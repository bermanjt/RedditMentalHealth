I grew up with a mother who abused her kids both physically and mentally. I've been locked in rooms with no light, tied to chairs, had kitchen knives pressed against my throat and wrists, threatened to be killed, hit until there has been bruises, name called, kicked out in the middle of the night and had to go sleep in parks or cry and beg until she lets me back in and she would pit her kids against each other in arguments if she was mad at one of them and so many more horrible events. My childhood was not always terrible though. I had clothes and there was food on the table and I had a ton of video games I was able to delve myself into.   

  

Obviously a lot of these situations became normalized to me. Plus we moved so much I never got a chance to become close with any friends. Hell, even if I did have friends, not like I was allowed to go anywhere. I never told anyone about what was going on. It was put in my head that if I did ever tell anyone and the police or child services showed up, she would end up killing me before they took me away to a home where I would not be loved and probably touched inappropriately. In my mind as a kid, things could always be much worse and I had it lucky.   

  

Things got better after I was 19. She went to jail for hitting my step-dad and she had a few court ordered therapy sessions. She didn't do anything physical after that. There was a lot of mental abuse still going on though. Obviously I had normalized this growing up. Without anyone to talk to about it, it didn't seem unusual. 

  

Fast forward to turning 25, I had a boyfriend who kept trying to convince me to move in with him. He ended up moving in with my family. I was always told, family was the only thing that was important. If I were to move out, all ties would be cut off and I wouldn't be able to survive without them unless I became a prostitute. Obviously this isn't true, but hearing it in various (more vulgar) ways since I was probably 11, it seemed pretty damn true. My boyfriend really changed my outlook on the entire situation though. I'm lucky to have someone who cares for me this much and was willing to stay through a lot of the shit that happened. What really cemented my motivation to move out though was my brother (29M) who is basically a mini version of my mother decided I pissed him off enough that he was going to choke me until I blacked out. My mother was on his side and told me I deserved it and I shouldn't of made him so mad. I don't even remember what we were arguing about. Hes had anger issues growing up from smashing windows in to pushing my parents around. It's really that, you see physical violence happening growing up, it's the only way you know how to deal with anything situation.   

 

So I'm 26 now and I moved out. I paid my mother an extra month of rent prior to moving so there would be less stress on her for finances. Mind you, I was paying more living with her for renting a single room than I am paying here for rent, bills and groceries. I gave her a week's notice. Three days prior to the last day I was officially gone, she was threatening to kill me and told me I had to leave that day. So I did just that. Twist was, she wasn't going to let neither of my brothers help me move and I wasn't allowed to have anyone else in the house. My boyfriend showed up with a few of his friends and they literally waited outside and I passed stuff from the front door to them, it was ridiculous and they were so mad about the situation. I'm thankful they stayed, otherwise there was no way it was going to happen. So instead of helping, my family sat at the kitchen table and whispered, as I'm taking stuff out of my room to the front door, about how much of a traitor and terrible person I am turning my back on my family.   

  

Its been about 7 months since I've been here. A week after I was gone, my mom phoned me to demand 2 weeks more of rent from me and $400 for my brother and his gf's birthday. Mind you his birthday was 5 months away and hers was 9 months away. If I didn't pay, I was told all ties were going to be cut off and I've have nobody to help out with anything if I needed it in the future. So I paid her. I love my family and I don't want that to happen. I stopped bothering trying to call them since every time I did she was either demanding more money from me or trying to start an argument. It also irritated me that in their eyes, everything was my fault and not a single one of them were to blame. I had to repair all the damaged relationships because I moved out.  

  

A couple weeks ago she called me telling me she has breast cancer. I cried and went over there. Now she's asking me if I will take a few days every week to go over there and do chores and help out. There is 5 people living under that roof. When there was 7, I was the only person to lift a mop and a broom to clean the house. I was the only one making dinners. I did this while working full time. My brother's girlfriend is being supported as an immigrant. She is not working. She only did a load of dishes everyday. Both my brothers worked part time with at best, 30 hours/week and they didn't bother to pitch in to keep everything cleaned. I know it's chores, it's petty to be upset about. But why should I take time while I'm working and now attending university full-time to clean her house because other people are going to be taking her back and forth to appointments? I didn't say any of this to her, I told her I will consider it since I don't know how much time I have now that I'm in school. Shes removed me from facebook and won't respond to my messages as of last night.   

  

Should I just stop bothering at this point? I feel bad she has cancer and I don't want her to die, but now she's using it as an excuse to have me go over there and do chores when I should be focusing on my own life at this point. Or am I just being selfish and I should just suck it up and lend a hand?",23Sep2020,1

2,"I live on a small island and it’s like ‘Small Town Syndrome’ but x100.

I grew up mostly alone, caring for my severely autistic brother, and we grew up in a sling house for drugs (heroin and amphetamines). Despite this, both me and my brother have managed to do well for ourselves (my brother just graduated with a bachelors and I’m
a year away from the same).

It’s been difficult. Our mother died from malnutrition and organ failure in 2010 due to addiction, and our father isn’t worth mentioning. **And yet** we’ve worked hard, and we’re doing  better than most of our peers, despite them coming from ‘better’ families.

However, if I go into a bar or a restaurant, people around me stare. It’s not a curious stare, but openly smirking or glaring and laughing at me. I will always be that taboo kid because of my parents.

I’ve worked so much harder and have done more than these people (still working at it, but I’m getting there!). But it doesn’t seem to matter. I live on a small island and I will always be openly laughed at by a minority. It shouldn’t bother me; the people laughing at me obviously are attempting to push me down to pull themselves up, but it still hurts. 

How do I rise above it all and own it? I went into a bar tonight to talk to a friend who works there, and a table of six spent the whole time laughing at me and snickering between themselves, thus making other tables side eye me with suspicion. It was humiliating.",23Sep2020,1

5,"The one thing all of us want to be is happy. Increasingly, I'm starting to think that America is a country that is directly antithetical to that goal.

To be happy, we need to live. To live, we need to feed ourselves. And in America, to feed ourselves, we need to work.

To work, you have to sink an absurd amount of time and money into specializing your labor such that it can be exploited by someone else.

You work to produce goods so you can make someone else richer.

Or you work to sell goods while producing nothing of your own.

Or you work to produce something creative or artistic and don't get paid for it at all.

Being an idealist and dreaming of a better world gets you branded as naive or entitled.

Deciding to build your work life around your ideal personal life becomes near impossible when there's no safety net to subsidize risk-taking, soul-searching, or family planning.

Recognizing the hollowness of your job and your life makes you a discontent and unruly employee and hurts your intrinsic motivation to find work at all.

And for me personally, I know that there are so many simpler ways to organize society and be happy that completely eliminate the need for careerism, materialism, and self-jockeying. There's a reason Okinawa is the happiest country on Earth and all the countries where capital reigns supreme (US, UK, Japan) are getting more miserable. And knowing that really makes me feel like I've been duped all my life, beaten down by an exploitative and extortionist economy, and totally fucked if I want to make my way in this country.

10,"cw: mention abuse, neglect, suicide, mental health issues

This is a long one so grab a snack.

I (26F) graduated university this year in the middle of the pandemic. I paid for it mostly on my own and by my parent’s generosity for letting me live at home rent free. I’m grateful and have expressed this to them, even when they picked me up from late night rehearsals (10pm) after I offered to take the bus home multiple times. I help out around the house doing chores and helping my dad and mom. I’m currently completing a career diploma in medical administration through distance education and getting great marks. I’m doing this because there isn’t any theatre work because of the pandemic, and film work is sparse where I live. This is so I can feed and house myself until acting work starts coming around again. 

Some backstory: my brother left on very bad terms and I haven’t spoken to him in 2 years. My parents didn’t approve of who he was dating so instead of tolerating the constant berating and fights over his choices, he left. I don’t blame him. My mom tried to contact him for about 6 months through Facebook and Instagram to which he never replied. 

Growing up in my family was hard. Both my parents are adult survivors of child abuse and neglect, neither of which has ever gone to therapy about. (The irony is that my mom has a psych degree and my dad refuses to talk about it with his own therapist. More on that later) We moved around a lot because of my dad’s job so all I got used to was going from one city to another. I started high school on the opposite coast which was incredibly hard. I made a few friends but felt isolated. I moved a second time during high school and had to start all over again. Because of moving around, I’ve noticed in my adult life that I don’t let people get too close because I’m always in “we’re moving soon so what’s the point”mode in order to save myself some hurt. My family is my only constant. 

My parents pressured my brother and I to do well in school (so much so that I was once grounded for a week because I got 80% on a math test which was my weakest subject in school because I “didn’t try hard enough.”) based on their own history I get why they wanted us to succeed but I feel that it was excessive and the pressure to be the best in everything has given me anxiety (general and social) and major depression. I wanted to kill myself at 13 (which I still struggle with today) because I wasn’t good enough for my parents so why should I even be alive? Anyway I’m on antidepressants and went to therapy maybe 6 times. Mom doesn’t really acknowledge that I’m depressed. Dad says I’m using it as an excuse to not do things on my bad days/weeks.  

2012: I didn’t go to university right after high school because I had no idea what I wanted to do. I worked and lived at home and paid rent to my parents. I was a good girl, never did drugs, never went out and partied. I went to work, I went home, that’s it. Arguing and fighting about stupid little things continued (it never really stopped) and I learned to shut up and take it because if I tried to defend myself/my actions I would get shut down and yelled/screamed at. When I was finally considering going to university for acting (which I’m certain my mom had reservations about) I was pushed to one university and not others. I didn’t have a backbone back then so I went to this university even though I was looking at other acting schools I was told I was going to this one and that was it. 

To give you a really good example of how I really couldn’t stand up for myself: my mom was passed over for a promotion at work even though her boss implied (never guaranteed or promised) she would get it. My mom’s boss is my voice teacher’s husband. When this happened, my mom (and dad) said I had to stop going to voice lessons because I was associating with a liar (my mom’s boss and my voice teacher’s husband) and that it was a betrayal to the family if I kept going. I was 21 and tearfully called my voice teacher explaining why I couldn’t go anymore. To say I was devastated doesn’t even cover it. 

2016: my dad retired and we moved to the other coast where I grew up for most of my childhood and where the university is. I commute for 4 years by bus (1 hour each way) because I (thought I) couldn’t get a student loan because my household made too much money. Later found out that wasn’t true because I was 4 years out of high school and considered independent  and I could have been living in dorm the whole time. 

2020: (before Covid hit Canada) January, there was a big fight between the 3 of us (mom, dad,me) about something my dad did/didn’t do. I really don’t remember what it was about. My dad is diagnosed with BPD/depression/anxiety/OCD/anger issues and chronic pain. I yelled/told my dad that living with him is difficult and has been for as long as I can remember because the expectations he has were/are too high.I later told my mom she was guilty by association. This was the absolute worst way I could have delivered this and I fully recognize that my emotions got the better of me because my dad was getting into ‘smart-ass’ mode and I lost it and was fed up. About a week later, my mom and I have a conversation about what happened and that I blind-sided her (I absolutely did and feel awful for doing that). She then tells me, she wishes I had been born to someone else and what right did she have to be a mother when she didn’t have one? (My mom lost her mom suddenly when she was still young).

Since then it’s been up and down fights. We’re fine for weeks, and then something happens and old crap from years ago is brought back up. I’ve had enough so I’m leaving. I told my parents this and gave them the option to be involved in my apartment hunt because I still want to have a relationship with them but I need to not be around them 24/7. Dad said yes, mom said no. It’s been a point of contention since especially since I’m bringing my dog (who was a Christmas present a year or so ago). My mom has called me ungrateful, selfish, and foolish. I think she’ll miss the dog more than me honestly (but they’ll have 3 other dogs still with them). I’m getting past that slowly because she clearly doesn’t want me as a daughter as I am a disappointment and reminder of her own foolishness/mistakes/IDK. I Suspect it might be bring up bad memories because of my brother and empty-nester feelings. I sympathize but there isn’t anything I can do that won’t be harmful to myself in the long run. 

I have an apartment ready to go in October and have a part time job in my field while I’m studying for some hands-on experience. It won’t pay all the bills, but I won’t starve and I’ll have some emergency money for my dog in case she gets sick. Student loans/savings will cover the rest for the time being.

The meat of this is: why do I feel so guilty about leaving? Am I making a good decision for myself or am I doing this rashly? It’s keeping me up at night and I need an outside opinion and advice on how to move forward. 

Tl;dr: moving out of my volatile parent’s house is making me feel guilty after all they’ve done for me, but staying is harmful to my mental health and relationship with them.",23Sep2020,1

21,"Basically some social anxiety symptoms began for me about 3 yrs ago. Only mild like not wanting to talk to people at school. But then it got worse in 11th/12th grade. I went out with friends about twice in each year and hung out with nobody at school. I didn’t bother asking for help because I always thought ‘I’ll see how I get on’. But I think that attitude just made it worse. I did pluck up the courage to go to the doctors in March but they were shut (covid). After that I thought ‘nah I won’t bother’ since I wasn’t at school anymore (that was my main issue).

26,"*Sorry for the long read* My mom is my entire world. She is my rock through everything: breakups, homelessness, stress, depression, you name it. But as of late I've noticed her health is starting to slowly diminish. Let me clarify.

My (24f) mom (55) since being born has had a total of 43 surgeries. Some minor, some major. A few years ago she had a bowel obstruction that almost killed her. Fast Forward few years, she battled an aggressive fight with breast cancer for the 2nd time, the 3rd time dealing with cancer in general. Unfortunately cancer runs on her side of the family with almost every generation so it is inevitable that she would get cancer.

2 years ago she was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes after she was officially cleared of her 2nd round of breast cancer. Although she is now cancer free she still struggles with high blood pressure, her depression, her bipolar, hearing loss, etc.

Here's where I am starting to grow concerned. The past 5 days I have been staying with her because of a family emergency. We've been camping out in her room until we were able to get things situated. My mom's memory has already been slipping here and there but nothing to really be alarming. When i was staying with her I noticed that some little things that she's never struggled with had somewhat become a bit harder for her to do or absolutely have no recollection of. For instance, she handed me her debit card to go check her Balance as she was in too much pain (another health issue with her tail bone and hip to knee pain) to do it on her own. Not even .01 seconds of her handing it to me she had grown frantic and asked if I had seen her card, meanwhile it is still physically in her hand as well as my hand grasping it. That was the first incident. 

The second incident was with her playing a game. My mom LOVES Legend of Zelda and has played it quite frequently. The past few weeks she's been binge playing BOTW and has been on point with everything on there. While staying with her she had gotten really confused on what she was doing. I don't mean she doesn't understand how to do something on the game but more of she doesn't understand WHAT she was doing like if it were the first time she ever turned on the game.

It may seem minor and i could see based how it sounds but knowing my mom, this was not a normal thing. I'm fully aware that getting older memory tends to slip a bit but this is the first that it made me stop what i was doing with pure shock. That wasn't my mom.

Alzheimer's is another thing that runs in her family. My granny (her mom) passed away from it back when I was 14 and I'm worried that my mom is starting to show signs of it.

Mom is only 55, she should not be having these kind of issues already. I want to sit down with my mom and voice my concerns over it and try to convince her of getting tested to see if my speculation is correct but she is already constantly depressed that she is getting older and has had break downs of the ""why me"" episodes due to her health. I don't want to upset her with talking about this. I had talked to my sister about this and she also feels the same as me. She insisted we play ""games and activities"" that help keep the cognitive parts of her brain stay sharp to help slow the progression of Alzheimer's without my mom realizing why we are doing it.

Now with Covid-19 going around I worry even more for her health and my anxiety is getting worse thinking about it. My dad (60) is the one that cares for her but even his health is slowly declining but not nearly a fast a rate as hers.

My mom is not going to be around forever, I'm fully aware but I'm petrified of losing her so soon. How should I address this to her where I don't upset her when she is already emotionally and mentally damaged or should I even say anything at all?",23Sep2020,1

Just a few minutes ago I was playing with my brother(11) and he knocked over the curtain dad (39)  came downstairs and started punching and kicking him I should have done something or said something but I was scared and froze. I know there's no reason for a 39 year old man to beat on a 12 year old like that, I know that I should report it all but my parents aren't really bad I know what they do and say is abusive but their mostly my mom is doing her best but this type of environment isn't safe for my siblings but I don't want to break up my family please help me what do I do?",23Sep2020,1
28,I was in an accident today when another driver changed lanes and hit my vehicle.  We followed the standard procedures and after making sure we both weren't hurt and exchanging information we waited for police to arrive.  After we got the report we left and I immediately filed a claim with my own insurance explaining I was not at fault.  I told my family about the accident today and they all told me I need to immediately cancel my claim with my own insurance and file a claim with the insurance of the other driver.  Should I do as they have said and cancel my claim or should I keep my claim with my own insurance?,23Sep2020,1
29,"So about 2 weeks ago I (m16) liked this girl (f15) in one of my classes. I told her and said I’d want to maybe try dating in like 3-4 months from now if we are comfortable She pretty much said it’s great of me to say that but she doesn’t think of me like that, doesn’t want a relationship. she just really wants to be friends. I told her give me some time to think of her as a friend. A day later I sent a question to her about one of my classes because I was confused on what work I needed to do. Then I realized and said never mind. The day after that she started the convo asks how im doing, we text a little then I ask her why she text if I didnt say I was ready yet. She said she thought I was because I sent her a text. That was my fault and I admitted it. Then a day goes by and I tell her I’m ready to be friends. She says  ok. Next day: I ask how she is, she gives me these 1-3 word answers followed by “wbu” and I tell her mine was good. She doesn’t ask anything about my day so I ask why hers was just “ok” and not good. She says something about friends having hard times or something. And I say ah ok. She says “yeah”. It’s been like this so much and it’s hard to get the conversation moving if I’m the only one willing to text a lot. 

I know she wants to be friends badly. I know this for 2 reasons. When i told her I liked her and she responded saying she thinks of me as a friend, I asked if this was her nice way of saying “I don’t want to talk to you anymore” and she said no, she just really wants to be friends. Then also she added me to the close friends list thing on Instagram. I’m incredibly confused why she says she wants to be friends, emphasizes it, and then doesn’t actually put in any of the work. Is there anything I should say or do?",23Sep2020,1
30,"I've noticed this throughout my whole life. I don't know why people are like this with me. I could suggest a fun thing to do or a fun thing to watch when I'm with a group of people, and people always give me the ""ehh, I'm not really (include random reasoning here)"" Or go ""nooo how about this instead!"" And everyone will agree with that and ignore what I suggested.

I almost feel like it has something to do with how people view my character and will naturally discredit my ideas because they don't think I'm cool enough or something. The popular person will always get more respected whenever they mention an idea, even if it's not a good idea. 

I always feel like I have original and interesting ideas to bring to the table and for whatever reason, it almost seems like they're afraid to go with it. Idk. What do you think?",23Sep2020,1
31,"Currently I am a 21 year old male in Australia studying a bachelor of primary education. I’m currently in 3rd year and have not been enjoying my degree for a while now. My Pex (professional placements) were enjoyable but they also shed a lot of light on what was expected and also what I’m capable of. I think for a long time I’ve also wanted a reason to withdraw from my course and do something and more recently I was given one. Results from one of my subjects have stated that I have already tech failed (failed before the final results are realised), the assessment was marked harshly and the feedback I received was savage and frankly destroyed any remaining confidence I had left in the degree. 

At this point I don’t know what to do, I haven’t enjoyed the degree and have wanted to switch but just don’t know what to study or get into. My parents just want me to not be stuck in retail my whole life and I don’t want to either. I want to do something that helps people, I feel like I just want to support people and I think that’s why I was drawn to teaching. I wanted to help people learn but after my in class experiences I feel like the profession is not for me. If I were to be a teacher I would want to be excited to teach everyday and would want my students to look back on me as one of the best teachers they had. I am confident I can not achieve this and I think it would be unfair to be in that position when there are more committed and talent people available (background: male teachers in Australia have a higher chance of getting a job than their female counterparts because the departments wants more “diversity”) 

I guess what I’m trying to say is. If I decide to withdraw what are some professions/jobs where I can help others? I feel really happy whenever I’m helping another person and so I want to do something within that category. I am currently on uni break for a bit which ends in 2 weeks and so I’m going to use that time to think before I withdraw or make any other decisions",23Sep2020,1
32,"In my grad school class we're required to post our thoughts on the current topic and the professor gives us the freedom to talk about anything and be creative while using the concepts we learned. I always try my best to write something valuable and not just do it because it's required. 

Earlier this week I write my post as I usually do and in class (virtual) he talks about my post and absolutely LOSES it. He's literally yelling and turning red because ""he hates the concept so much."" Which I understand, people can be fans or haters of concepts in academia. Still, these were concepts taught to us in other classes in the program so it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. He didn't name anybody's names but he ranted for 15 minutes about it and said multiple phrases from my post word for word. It was extremely uncomfortable for me and everyone else. The whole class was confused and shocked by his behavior. 

If it was just that, I would have been fine but right after, he says his class is open to all kinds of discussion topics. Now that definitely made me laugh because the guilt must have immediately kicked in. He already proved that statement is false and only topics he agrees on are allowed on the discussion boards.

Later, he started talking about unrelated topics like grammar on another assignment where he saw a common mistake and pointed out a mistake I clearly made. I appreciate it when people correct me out of good intentions but at this point I had a sick feeling in my gut like he was definitely targeting and bullying me. Almost like ""someone who doesn't know basic grammar (of course I know the grammar rule, people just make mistakes) must be dumb and dumb people surely cannot post discussion topics that are remotely intelligent."" 

I just let it go because I don't engage with childish people but him blowing up in class, being so rude, and almost mocking me left a bad feeling in my mouth. 

Today I check my grade and he gave me a horrible grade for the discussions, as expected. But he had used 2-3 of my posts as starting points for class discussions before and I was previously under the impression I was doing well.

I'm upset about my grade but I know life is unfair so I don't care if I get a lower grade than expected in that class. It's just that it's been two days and I still feel sick to my stomach about what he did and I'm not sure if I'm overreacting or not about confronting the school's department about his inappropriate attitude towards students and creating a hostile learning environment.

I realised that they had changed names and had gotten a whole new website and I emailed them again using their new email and still no answer, I have sent them 2 emails regarding a tracking number and still no answer.

I live in Iceland, and am used to having to wait a long time to get deliveries online, and the website specifies that European deliveries take 10-30 business days (I'm on day 18). I did my research to check if this site was a scam and all that came up was that this site was new and it was too early to tell. The website looks legit and has positive reviews on the site but no presence anywhere else online.

I’m wanting a change of scenery and change of pace but am having trouble nailing down an ideal place to relocate to. If anyone has any advice, I would genuinely appreciate it! I’ve googled extensively, but nothing beats true experience and recommendations. I’ve listed some wants and preferences below:

- Top of my list is somewhere that leans more liberal/progressive. 
- I would love to find a place with good outdoor life (I prefer the mountains), I have a large dog so parks, trails, hiking, patio restaurants, etc. would be awesome. 
- Also somewhere with decent night life/social scene. I’m a single 20-something, and regardless of where I move will know absolutely no one so will be looking to make friends quickly. Breweries/distilleries, parks, fitness groups (SoulCycle, OrangeTheory, etc.), night clubs, and museums are all perks. 
- Call me juvenile but recreational MJ / dispensaries are a huge huge huge plus. 
- I could be persuaded on weather. I’m from the south so looking to get away from the heat a bit, four seasons would be nice, snow for most of the year would be hard, but I think I could acclimate to most regions. 
- I’d prefer to stray away from anywhere that is traditional very religious or conservative. 
- I would prefer not to be in one of the huge major cities (New York, LA, Houston, etc.) but still big enough for activities and friends. The traffic and congestion gets to me. 
- Diversity, safety, and job opportunities are all other nice-to-haves!

Some places I’m thinking might fit the bill might be something similar to Eugene, OR; Boulder, CO; Austin, TX or Portland, ME. But again if anyone has any other recommendations or has experience in any of these cities I’m very open to suggestion!

Thank you in advance!",23Sep2020,1

50,"So I (f16) am torn between letting this subject go, or bringing it up to my parents. 

Three years ago, during the summer, my brother and I were staying with our aunt. 
It was for a month, and mostly to give our parents a break and escape the heatwave at home. 
( we live in northern California, but my aunt lives further north ) 

At the time, my parents couldn't keep paying for the hotel room we lived in, and had to move themselves and my sister into the car. 
Ny brother and I were still at our aunt's, and when I accidentally let it slip that my parents were sleeping in the car with my sis. 
( my sister, at the time, was turning three ) 

My aunt immediately accused my parents of being irresponsible, got my other aunt and grandparents involved, and convinced my brother and I that my parents were in the wrong. She also accused my parents of drug use, and mistreating my sister.
Police and CPS got involved, but nothing came of it. 
My brother and I went home, and my parents cut those relatives out of our lives. 
( relatives being my two aunts, and my grandparents, on my dad's side. this also meant any cousins that live up there to. ) 

While I am still incredibly angry at everyone who was involved, the town they live in is my happy place. 
It's somewhere I can feel like a regular teenager, without the pressure of my sister or our current living situation. 
Not only that, but the family I have there have always been there for me, and I especially miss my grandparents.

So I don't know if I should just let it go, and stay home.

51,"Last week I met this woman on an app where you simply meet to cuddle... she's in her late 40's and I'm in my early 30's...

We messaged for a few days, and then met up... it went well, yet we both crossed lines a few times and ended up making out for a few minutes. I took all the blame, and she understands that it's not one persons fault.

It was our first time meeting up with someone to cuddle, so we will be better next time.

Anyways, before we met up I tried to exchange numbers with her and she politely declined, and felt safer just talking on the app.

Yet after we met at her house, I asked again since it's just easier to communicate... and she said that she prefers to not exchange numbers because it she has had to block people in the past,

and also she can choose when to view the messages instead of having them go straight to her phone. She is an introverted single mom, so maybe it just can get emotionally exhausting having more messages on her phone? Maybe she didn't want to keep it a simple cuddle relationship, and not go further?

53,"I (16F) have a best friend (18F) that I’ve known for about 3 years now, and since then, we’ve done practically everything together. We’re both homeschooled, and don’t have many other friends in our area, so we naturally became very attached to each other. We made plans to go to college together and even live together, but as the friendship has grown, I feel like I’ve become a completely different person, and I hate it. I genuinely feel like I’m not a good person now. I want to grow as an individual, but I feel like I’m holding myself back by choosing to be friends with her, but I’m too afraid to let her go. It’s turned into this weird situation where I feel like I can’t cut her off or my reputation would be in danger.

I don’t know if she can be considered a “toxic friend” as she’s an okay friend besides the backhanded compliments and snarky remarks, but the problem comes in when she’s no longer friends with people. She completely airs out their business. All of it. If they’ve done anything that’s even the slightest bit “wrong” in society’s eyes, she will tell all of her friends and social media and make sure that everyone knows just how much of a “bad” person they are, and I’m afraid that she’ll do that to me. I feel like an idiot because I’ve told her so much stuff, said so many stupid things that are not representative of my character now, and now I’m afraid that if I choose not to be a part of her life anymore, the same will happen to me. She’ll say that she’s “never done anything to [me],” she “[doesn’t] know what happened”, and then shit talk me and expose every single thing I’ve done that she knows about.

On the other hand though, I think about the good things she’s done. I’ve stayed at her house multiple times, she’s been there for emotional support, and she has helped me out financially a little, but whenever I try to push the bad things away, it’s like they come up in my face again and remind of who she is.

54,"This girl that I use to quite like(I'll call her Anna), also happens to be one of my best mate's cousin(I'll call him Adam). So everything started back in February when we first met. I was with 3 friends (2 of which are unimportant but the other is, and I'll call him Ben) at a pizza place when Adam asked if I wanted to hang out. I said yes and told him to come to said pizza place. He said ok and told me he's coming with his cousin. He came we hanged out for a bit then the 2 unimportant friends left, Adam took a taxi home and me, Ben and Anna stayed at a bus stop waiting for a bus to come so Anna can go home. One came and we said our goodbyes and she left. I started to talk to her in DMs but she was uninterested so I took the hint and left her alone. (side note: Ben and Anna did not talk at all after she left).

Fast forward 6 months. I'm with Ben and a friend in my friend's car when Adam called me asking if I wanted to hang out(he was at his cousin's place). I said sure text me when you want us to pick you two up. He texts me, we go and we go around town with the car and stuff and I'm sitting in the back with Anna in the middle and Ben on her left. My friend is kind of a fast driver so she was scared and she kept leaning on me and holding my hand. Well I kind of took that as a hint so when we went like 100 KM away from town I held her hand all the time thinking that she might be interested this time. When we got back, we went to a 24/7 self service washing place for the car so my friend, Ben and Adam went outside and started washing the car and me and Anna stayed inside. I tought that maybe everything that happend were hints so I asked her out and she said yes. Fast Forward a week later we went on the date and we sat down on a bench at 2 am and started making out for the next 4 hours.(I am also the type that gets attached very fast). We went on 3 more dates and did the exact same thing. On the second one I asked her if she wanted to be my girlfriend she said she'll tell me later and we proceded to make out for the next 4 hours again. After the other dates she told me she can't be my girlfriend because she was moving to another city for collage(she's a year older then me). But it didnt really matter to me but I later found out it was a complete lie. Also she said we needed to stop the things we were doing. I was fine with that but I kind of hurt me a little but nothing too bad.

4 days later we went out again (as friends) and I took her in my lap because she was cold and tired and she kept looking into my eyes. I told her to stop because it was hard for me to hold back. She laughed and said ""so what, look at me"" so I did, and realised she was looking at me wanting something. So I kissed her. She smiled and didnt complain so we started making out again for the next 2 hours. After the 2 hours she started asking wierd questions like what would you do if you saw me with someone else and stuff. I told her i wouldnt really mind if she was my girlfriend, but if she wasnt I would be a bit pissed. Then she proceeds to tell me she doesnt like me but she likes Ben SINCE FEBRUARY(which she hasnt talked to before we went out in the car nor after) but wanted to remain friends with me. I was confused and I asked her why did you do all that with me and not him and why tell me now after we made out again for 2 hours. She said she didnt know so I tought that the human brain works in misterious ways so I believed her. I went home and slept then when I woke up I called my best friend over and cried like a bitch for 30 minutes about how I hate how I always do something to fuck things up.

Fast Forward two weeks later I told her to come outside(It was 1 am and I couldnt sleep) so we sat down on the bench and I told her that if she doesnt anwear all my questions truthfully I'll go gome and never talk to her again. Well I asked her what happend that night and why did she go out with me insted of asking Ben out. She told me that while she was making out with me she was IMAGINING THAT I WAS BEN. I have never felt this used in my life, and at this point any splinter of feelings I MIGHT have had for her vanished.

The Plan:

So I told Ben the story and it just so happens that Anna asked Ben to come over her place because she is alone. So i cooked up a plan with Ben that he goes over, has sex with her, leaves and never talks to her again. He gave me his phone to talk to Anna from his account and I manipulated her into agreeing to have sex with Ben. Now the plan takes place literally 20 hours from now and even tho she used me as a compensation prize, and I have no feelings for her whatsoever I still don't want to see her get hurt because I hate this type of stuff. But in the same time I want her to feel just as bad as I felt. I am so confused about what to do. I can call off the plan at any time but I am really confused about my feelings.

55,"My roommate (32M) in the middle of August lost his job and wasn't able to find another one until today and basically won't be able to make rent this month. Honestly there's a lot more behind why I (24M) wanted to get out of the situation I'm in but I would rather not disclose all of it as most of it is not relevant. I have resources and friends that could help me stay here but there are reasons I don't want to continue to deal with the roommate I have. Due to certain circumstances I have to keep a certain rapport with my landlord as I still have my job but I'm currently working from home and when I have to go back into work I need to move back into this apartment (which I've already talked to my landlord about this happening anyways). I made the decision to move out myself and it's always been agreed that if I move out the roommate does too. I've looked at other options but this is the best option for me and as for my roommate that's a different issue.

Basically he used his last paycheck to barely scrape by on last months rent and I had to start making preparations for if he didn't get a job in time. He has no money and I've been covering for food and other things this month because of it and I want out. He finally has a job but considering his history with previous jobs I feel like it's another time bomb before he loses another job and I have to go through this again (this isn't the first time and is one of the reasons he moved out here and in with me). I know it's not the greatest option but I'm moving back in with my parents (who are completely fine with it) on October 1st. I do not want to throw him to the wolves seeing as he's been a good friend of mine for a few years now and I want to help out as much as I can, but I don't have the money to move him into another place.

So here's the situation. We have to be out by the 1st and he has no money to secure apartment (security deposit and first months rent are too high for him), can't move in with a random roommate (same as previous), can't move into a hotel/motel/business suite (they require full length visit cost up front and the job he just got requires an ethernet connection with the set up they gave him) and lastly he really doesn't have anyone else to help out in this situation as he already moved across country to move in with me as he had nobody before moving here. What kind of options does he have to wait out the first few weeks he would need to save up paychecks and move into an apartment or anywhere he can afford?

***FULL DISCLOSURE:*** I do NOT need advice about how to get him out or to just tell him it's his problem and move on from it. I want to genuinely help him out and all the advice I've gotten from people I know have told me these two things. I need a different perspective on options I have before the end of the month to get him set up somewhere else with little to no money.",23Sep2020,1

Not sure if this is the right thread fairly new not sure where to correctly post.

Okay basically what the titles says my sister in law and brother were both arrested a month ago and my sister in law is pregnant however since she’s gotten in she’s lost over 40 pounds and just this Friday she started to bleed, cramp, and haven’t felt the baby kick since then. The police refuse to get her medical attention and keep saying she is faking or they don’t know what’s up. 

We’ve told them since the begging she was pregnant and when exactly her doctor appointment dates were and they said they would write it down. Her family and my family have called constantly to remind them cause of the weight she lost we were worried and then the date of the doctors appointments happens and they don’t take her said they knew nothing of it and that they can’t even take inmates to doctor during this time. I know this is a lie cause some of her tank mates are being taken to the doctor since she’s gotten in and even my dad who’s at the same place said he’s been to the doctor last week. 

And now that the babies not moving they’re  still refusing and are just giving her pain pills even though she hasn’t seen a doctor or been prescribed them. We called her doctor and let him know and he said that he can’t go in cause he needs permission so we called and told them and they said alright they’ll do it and maybe half a hour later called and said an appointment was made. Her doctor called again today and said why haven’t we called them and we asked, what do you mean the police said that they had made a appointment with him and he said they never got into contact with him. And now he’s calling the police and telling them and they’re telling him they don’t what’s he’s talking about no one like that is there and hang up or just plain leave him on hold. 

So I’m asking is there anything we can do? Her family can’t afford a lawyer and when we keep calling they threaten us that they’ll throw her into segregation if we don’t stop. 

TL;DR: my sister in law is sitting in jail possibly going through a miscarriage and the police refuse to get her help and ignore her doctor or threaten us if we keep calling.",23Sep2020,1

**Sept 20**

So I was looking for a car for a while now and I seen a car on the Facebook market place for $1,300 with 160k miles, (I took a screenshot of everything) so the description said that the car drives good and is  a good a to b car. So I bargained for $1000 and he said $1100 and I took the offer then ask the guy where I can meet him and he sent me a location in Queens which was an hour away from me (I live in the Bronx), so I asked my best friend if he can come with me and he agreed, so we took the 4 train to 161st to then take the D train to 42nd to catch the 7 train.

While at the train station, I texted the guy and said I'm 30 mins away, to then received a message back saying that he wasn't at the location but was in Brooklyn and wanted me to go over there. When I looked it up on my phone it was an hour away and I had explained to him that the location is an hour away from where I'm at and he was trying his hardest to get me to come by offering discounts and all that, that's when I asked is it possible for him to just go to the first location, he refused. So as I was about to call it quits, I get a text and a facetime call from another guy who said he'll order me a lyft to the location. Me wanting a car soo bad decided to go along with it.

So my friend and I got on the lyft and was headed to brooklyn. As we got there around 7:50pm and it was dark out, so I texted the guy telling him that I was there and he came out with 4 other guys. We greeted each other and he pulled out a title and gave it to me, I took a small look at the title but didn't take a real good look at it and it was also dark out. So he walked us to the car and said it drives good and showed me how to open the doors, trunks, etc. Then he grabbed something out of the car I handed him the money and he handed me the key and started to walk back.

I got into the car and shared my excitement with my friend and also called a few people up. I then said I was going to go home to surprise my parents of me buying a car all on my own.

So I started driving and everything was fine for the first few minutes, then after that I started hearing a beeping noise, and was wondering what was going on, I then looked at the dash and seen that the temperature was way passed the H so I parked the car to the side and decided to text the guy and waited for a response then I popped the hood to see anything and didn't see anything but there was a very awful smell coming out of the engine, I didn't pay mind and thought it's probably because the car sitting for a while and needed to ""get adjusted"" so my friend an I waited, took a bathroom break, and got back into the car, as I turned on the engine the temperature went straight back up to the H and the beeping continued. So I continued driving because it was getting late and I had work early in the morning and was going to figure it out after I left work. I then continued driving and drove in the highway from brooklyn to queens near LaGuardia  Airport as I was leaving the highway, I had to brake to a red light and when driving when let go of the brake slightly, the car is supposed to slowly move forward. But as I let go the car wasn't moving so I looked down to see if the car was off or not and my friend yelled telling me to look up and as I looked up I was greeted by a large cloud of white smoke coming from underneath the hood. My friend then say to get out of the car so we get out in the middle of a busy road just looking at the car I bought less than 30 mins ago, then this man parked his car in front of ours and was telling us that the car is just overheated and I explained to him that I bought it less than 30 min ago and that the guy told me that everything was fine and he basically told me I got sold a ""lemon"" so as the guy was looking at my car in the middle of a busy road, I was trying to get in contact with the first guy that I had texted no response I called and he didn't answer, I then texted the second guy and my messages didn't go through, I then called multiple times and it went straight to voicemail (he blocked me). The guy that was looking at our car then said to take the car to the nearest gas station which was 2 blocks down and to buy water and pour it into the coolant tank and see if it changes anything. So I closed the hood and drove the car as fast as I can to the gas station  and bought a bottle of water, I then was talking to my friend and we agreed to the fact that I got scammed and I decided to call the police to explain everything and they said they were going to send an officer, So we waited and waited and that's when the gas station owner came up to us and I explained the whole story to him and he said that the cops were never going to come and asked if I can park the car outside of the gas station, I then moved the car outside of the station and parked it and decided the car was cool enough to pour the water, so i poured the water and turned the car back on and the temperature went straight up to the H and continued its beeping. It was already 10-11pm at this point and no one was coming so my friend called an uber and I wrote my number on a piece of paper and placed it on the windshield and went into the uber. I explained the situation to the uber driver and asked for an advice and he suggested that I make a police report and take the guy to court

**Sept 21**

I had work early in the morning and got out at 2pm I then headed to the police station that was near my house and I tried to make a police report but the women told me I had to go sue him through small claims, and in the past I've always had an issue with small claims because of my ex never getting her issue solved when she had gotten scammed in the past. But she said I was supposed to get proof and stuff but then I remembered yesterday I didnt record any of the incident because of how shocked I was and really wasnt thinking about recording. So she suggested that I go back to the car and record what happens to the car when I try to drive it then go make a claim, so I went all the way to queens made a video of what happens then waited till the next day to go to the court because of the fact that it closes at 4

Later that night I check out the guys facebook page and he posted that he sold his car and as I was reading the comments someone asked him why and he stated that the engine was fucked up. I took a screenshot of that.

**Sept 22**

I went to the court today to try and make a claim and as I walked in they said I needed the persons address, I got the name and knows that he lives in brooklyn and got pictures of the guy but they said they do it in a ""mailing"" type of way so i had to have the person exact address. So I searched up the address where I went to go pick up the car and found a site where it tells you the first intial of the tenants name and their full last name and I saw one that matched with his and wrote it down and sued him for the amount that I paid $1100, I then gave it to the lady and she told me that I'm not going to hear from them until next year. 

Which really sucks because what if the guy moves, or goes into hiding or anything, I just wanted to know what can i do at this point to make it go quicker, I have a car that doesnt drive more than 5 min without screaming that its overheated and I got the guys picture, facebook page, number, address, proof that he sold me a bad car claiming it was good, a person who sent my friend and I out on the road with a bad car. Like what can I do with all this, isnt there a way I can get the police to go after him or something to make the process faster???",23Sep2020,1
65,"Me and my mother just got into a huge spat... My mother is really abusive in a verbal manner and always threatens to beat me... I plan on moving out when I’m 18 but there is a chance because now she knows exactly how I feel about her. She’s always making rude comments about my body, how I never do enough when I usually clean the whole house, how I’m disrespectful for asking questions pertaining to the argument, etc. I keep getting treated like shit and have been thinking religiously about moving back in with my dad. Only problem is me and my dad have an on again off again relationship that I know damn well even with that he’d pull up in a heartbeat. I don’t know if I can stand and speak to my mother without having another mental breakdown with her yelling in my face and at me. I always try to speak calmly and tell her she’s yelling when I’m speaking in a low tone. She’s really homophobic and is beyond a Bible thumper... I’m scared and afraid of telling her the truth and am debating if I should just grab my birth certificate and social and book it. I don’t know what to do. I’ve been told by people to stay and talk but what if that doesn’t work...? I’m so fuckin weak man. I’m scared. My mom always dangles fear above my head and... Every alarm in my body is going off. I wanna get emancipated but building it off emotional abuse is very hard. I might talk to my dad about it if we get to that point Bc I’m pretty sure all you have to do is have one parent sign the agreement... My mom might be there for me financially but she’s not there for me emotionally or usually physically. There’s always excuses about having work, false promises, etc. All I want is to be happy...

66,"I (16M) just recently visited my dad’s place in Missouri. This was the first time I had seen him (aside from when he very occasionally comes up to us) in years since my parents have gotten divorced. I had a really great time down there. Everyone was so nice and for the first time in my life, I actually felt comfortable in the environment I was in. 

So, naturally, I feel a want to move in with him after such a great experience, one I’ve never before had at my mom’s. I had talked about it with him and he’s totally up for it, he’d love to have me stay with him. 

But, get this, my moms a total control freak. She’s a Class A narcissist. She’s mentally ill to where she can’t even realize not only the mental damage she causes to her own kids (and btw I want to point out that she has worked in the mental health area for well over 20 years. She now focuses on infants mental health and how to raise children in general). So on top of not understanding that she scars me and my other siblings daily with her abuse, she is also in an abusive relationship herself which is both physical and mental. In fact, it even gets dangerous to us children. (Driving drunk, alone and with kids, involving kids in physical arguments, things of that nature). She has suffered her share of abuse as a kid herself, but given that she’s devoted nearly 30 years of her life to studying mental health, it’s inexcusable. 

I had tried getting my dad to talk about it with her before, which, needless to say, went quite unsuccessfully. At that time, I was extremely sensitive and immediately after hearing that I asked my dad that, she burst into my room yelling at me and invalidating all of my feelings which I had felt around the home at that time. 

My question is, how can my dad approach her about this whole ‘me moving to his place’? I would do so myself but honestly I’m afraid of the same thing happening and I really don’t want to fall back to where I was at that time, it was an extremely low point in my life. Any advice at all would be much appreciated, thank you in advance.

67,"A few nights ago my husband heard a crash from outside and went to see what happened. A truck had veered off the road into our yard and the driver (M35-40) over-corrected and ended up in a gully across the street. The driver crawled out of the passenger side window because the driver’s side was so messed up and my husband noticed he was bleeding so he called 911. Our neighbors also heard the crash and called the police and when the man was told that the police were called he took off running down the street into the darkness. My husband did tell me that he could smell alcohol on the man. The police came and we all told them everything we knew/saw and we went about our business.

Today, my husband was working out in the yard and the driver of the truck pulled up in a white van and got out to talk to him. He asked if my husband was the one that called the cops and was angry because he got a DUI. My husband admitted it was him and kept working and eventually the man left after mumbling something my husband didn’t hear. (I feel like i should note that my husband was visibly carrying his pistol at this time)

Since this encounter today, the same white van/ same man has driven by my house 3 times so far, very slowly with the windows down and has been watching the house.

70,"I’m a senior in college, as you guys now most things have gone online. I study mainly in a large empty room and several of my friends frequently study their too. A good friend of mine who also studies in the same room is taking chemistry 111, a class I tutor. I love to help people out and tutor so I’ve been working with him a lot off the books and even gave him my old textbook. Unfortunately, I acted very inappropriately. 

I was studying in the room when I was sent an email from the learning center to review recordings of tutor sessions on zoom, it included several sessions and a few were with my friend and another tutor. For whatever reason I thought it would be funny to play the one with him and the tutor on full blast, after all we were the only ones in the room. So I played it and started laughing at his surprise but he gave me a look then ran out of the room with his laptop. I found out he was in a zoom class. Suddenly I realized how utterly offensive and highly unethical what I did was. I quickly apologized to him then left, several minutes later I reiterated my apology through text in a more well thought out way. He is possibly the most passionate and dedicated person I know in regards to his education, The time this man puts in to studying is unworldly. for me to ridicule his efforts is absolutely asinine. I have no excuse for my actions. It doesn’t matter what our relationship was and how we may joke with eachother.  

I would like advice as to how I can make him feel better. I don’t care about justifying my actions to him, I just want to know if there is a way to apologize to him better. I know it hurt him, I do not want him to feel bad about his education in any way or matter.

71,"I can't leave the house. 

I'm spending every day sat on the sofa in PJ's playing a stupid farm game. It's having a negative impact on my mental health. 

Currently I can't work or volunteer due to lockdown, I have no social life so even without lockdown spending time with friends isn't an option either - I'd typically try to at least find free events to go to, but that's not an option over lockdown. Short of grocery shopping I've had no reason to leave the house over the past few months, even then I've switched to a more local store so it's not even that much of a walk. 

I need to leave the house, but there's nowhere to walk locally...I also don't get up until very late in the day so I can't even go a bit further afield (not much of an option in lockdown either as no public bathrooms). 

Even just walking around the block feels like a massive chore...

I just keep getting confronted by all the effort it takes to leave the house; get washed, dressed, do my makeup, do my hair - then there's making sure I've been in the bath the night before so my hair is clean. It's wearing fresh clothes but then I'm faced with the concern that I'm wearing out clothes I can't afford to replace right now or dirtying clothes that I might need in a few days but won't have time to wash. 

It may sound ridiculous but it all feels so pointless making this effort just to walk around the block. At least before lockdown I would get ready to work, while already out I'd take the opportunity to go to town after work to shop, go for coffee, a bar, etc. 

I just don't know how to motivate myself to get out the house. Too much work just for something that feels so pointless.",23Sep2020,1

Yesterday we found maggots under our puppy's fake grass pad (we never leave her stuff on the fake grass, either). We cleaned it, threw it out, and poured boiling water mixed with chlorine, and hydrogen peroxide on the concrete area where the problem was. 

Everything seemed fine today, but now tonight they showed up on the concrete, even after I cleaned and threw everything out. Can anyone give me advice? I'm confused about why they are still appearing.

Because they are such sensitive areas, I've been careful not to get any cleaner too close to her eyes and mouth and subsequently can't wash the smell out. Any advice would be beyond deeply appreciated, it doesn't really bother me very much but I'm imagining my poor dog having this awful smell constantly present in her nose.. thanks for taking the time to read 🖤",23Sep2020,1
81,"I recently had my wisdom teeth removed(4 teeth). There arose some issues post surgery regarding the care I received from the staff at the Oral Surgeon office. 

According to my girlfriend who was my driver the following things occurred:

They wheeled me out to the main lobby where she was waiting and according to her I could not form words nor did I have the ability to keep my eyes open, head up, or move my limbs. 

As they wheeled me out to the car she said that I proceeded to throw up blood all over the ground, her car and my leg/shoes. The nurses said that its normal but that it ""usually happens in the operation room"".  After examining the pools of vomit my girlfriend realized that I had zero gauze put in my mouth to stop any bleeding meaning that I was just swallowing my own blood. 

The nurses handed her paperwork and said, ""read the instructions"" and that was it in regard to how to care for me. No explanation. No questions answered. Just read the instructions. 

I have to believe my girlfriend in all of this because I do not remember a single thing until I woke up from sleeping multiple hours later. That is another issue for me. Shouldn't I be coherent enough to understand the instructions at least somewhat in regard to caring for my mouth? 

Does any of this sound like not proper procedure? Am I blowing things out of proportion?

I proceeded to write a letter to the Oral Surgeon and stated all of the above points and how unhappy I was with the care I received. He called me back and refuted that anything wrong had been done. He said that in order for me to be released I had to pass certain criteria, i.e. state my name, date, etc., and claims that I passed all criteria. He proceeded to say that its common to not remember anything for multiple hours(which i fully get) and that it wouldn't be crazy if I didn't remember anything until the next morning. So am I supposed to just take his word that I passed those criteria when I'm also expected to not remember a damn thing? They did not wheel me out to my girlfriend and have me do these things in front of her to show her that I was able to leave. If she says that I couldn't form words and could hardly lift my head then there is no way that I stated my name and other things to be released from their office. It is my belief that they overdosed my anesthesia. 

He says that he never uses gauze in his practice and this baffled us. I thought that the first few hours post surgery was the important time for clotting to form and gauze would help that process. Correct me if that's wrong please. On the instruction sheet they gave us it says to ""keep the gauze in the mouth for 2 hours"" implying that there should have been gauze in there. 

None of his practices were explained to me during my consultation visit and nothing was explained to me prior to surgery about caring for my mouth post surgery. The doctor abrasively refuted my claims and seemed to not care too much other than to get me off his back.

Your thoughts on how to proceed or go about this are appreciated.

Thank you if you read all of this!

TL;DR 

Oral Surgeon didn't put gauze in mouth, I threw up blood outside their office. I don't remember anything for multiple hours and they released me under very suspect conditions according to my girlfriend. I wrote a letter and the doctor called me refuting my claims and explaining why he did nothing wrong.",23Sep2020,1
82,"Okay. So my life hasn’t been the best. I never knew my father, my mom has been addicted to pills my entire life, and her boyfriend is a racist. For information purposes I happen to be the only person of color in my house. To sum it all up, I hate my current situation. But thankfully I have a great opportunity. Long story short, I will be getting a check for 10k within the next month. However I have no idea what to do with it. I currently live in the middle of nowhere in a small town in NC. I’ve always disliked the small town life. I’ve always wanted to get into the city, to where I can walk and take the bus/train everywhere I need to go.

His father/my stepdad was very verbally abusive with me and my sister, and when I pick him up from home I can tell my stepdad is frustrated with him. I just wish he could talk to me and my sister (also 24, twins). He just shrugs and nods his head when we try to talk to him about things we wish we could talk about to someone when we were his age. 

My mom moved 4 hours away from him when he was like, 8 at the oldest (classic mom), and my and my sister have known for a long time that he will need us at some point. My sister asked if he has anyone to talk to about his feelings, and he shook his head. She asked if he wanted to talk to someone, he shook his head. Im worried about him :/

86,"So, to start this off, i will say that i am 15, in my sophomore year of high school. all of it is online for me this year. Ever since i started high school, i have had trouble just doing my work. (most likely due to my ADHD) right now, i am failing three classes and have a D in two. now, with that said, today, I dont even know what the hell happened. 

My mom asked me to bring my computer downstairs for her to see what all work I have due tonight. So, i brought my computer down for her to look at. at first all was normal in her seeing that i have work to do for tomorrow until i told her that i failed a test today. she asked if i had studied and i said that i forgot. (i am VERY forgetful) At this, she flipped. she went on a rant about how i never do my work (was true but i am working to do better) and how it seems like to dont care about anything. I cant exactly remember the whole conversation now as it was over 4 hours ago, but i remember her saying that she will pull me out of everything that im in. Boyscouts and Hockey (i didnt even want to do hockey this year but thats another story) but then she said that she will take away all of the electronics that i have in my room until i can get all of my grades back up. (they have been bad for the bast week and a half so this was out of nowhere) then, she said something that i can remember clear as day still. she said, ""you will not have any social life anymore. The only social life that you will have is school."" Like, WTF.

Im pretty sure that is all that happened.

Now that the story is out of the way, i relly need advice:

1. Is she in the wrong?
2. Wtf am I even supposed to do in this situation?
3. Am I in the wrong in some way?",23Sep2020,1

92,"There’s a speed camera on the highway I (17F) drive on every week to get to my guitar lessons and my boyfriend pointed out the other day a new speed camera at a point on that highway that I always pass.

Sunday I was driving and I passed that point and completely forgot about the camera. At some point as I passed that area I looked down and I was going either just under or just above 70mph. I don’t know the exact speed. The speed camera gets triggered at 71mph. I didn’t see a flash but it was during the day so I might have just missed it. 

I’ve been a nervous wreck for days now. I can’t remember if I was speeding when I passed that point and I don’t know if I’ll get a ticket or not. I know I wasn’t going above 75mph but again the camera goes off at 71mph. I don’t have $65 to pay the fine and my parents will murder me. It could take 2 weeks for the ticket to come in the mail if I did get one. It’s been 3 days and I’m a mess of anxiety just waiting to see what happens. I hardly ever speed, it was just an instance of not checking my speed for a few minutes and accidentally going too fast. As soon as I noticed I slowed down.

I love helping patients and makes my day knowing I helped a patient and made their day.  I’m on my third week of training so far.

The problem is the MAs do not seem like to do any work and they are very rude to me and this other new guy in my department. One MA complained that I left a sticky on her desk which is untrue. What happened was that I was speaking to the patient and the patient demanded to speak to the MA. I asked the patient repeatedly if there was anything I could do to help the patient, patient said no and wouldn’t even let me know the reason for her call. So I got the patient MRN and a callback number that I wrote in my small notebook so I wouldn’t forget to get back to the task. I went up to the MA in her office and asked if she was busy first. She said no and asked what’s up. I informed her that a patient requested a callback from her, provided her the patient number and MRN.

I thought everything was fine then bam supervisor came to tell me to not leave stickys on their desk because there was a complaint. Keep in mind I’m still training so I’m not sure why she didn’t just tell me instead of going to the supervisor. Another MA complained that she didn’t understand my task, I basically stated that a patient gotten injections on her right knee and wanted to know if she could get a certain injection on her left knee. The MA stated my task didn’t make sense so she sent it to my supervisor.

98,"I never met my biological father, over the years I’ve tried to suppress the idea it bothers me, but it does. 

My mother and father had a longterm long distance relationship via different countries. She went on a holiday and met him, they soon after started a relationship. Then she got pregnant. 

My mother told me that the reason he isn’t in my life is because he wanted her to stay there once she found out she was pregnant and she wanted him to move out of his country and come back with her. So she essentially said because of inconvenience they broke up, and he didn’t care about being in his unborn child’s life. 

I don’t believe what she has told me. I have a feeling she told me this to shelter me from the truth of the matter, he cut it off when she got pregnant because he didn’t want me. 

In my 19 years of life we have only spoken about him once, I asked her once why he never reached out and she told me what I previously said, along with the fact he asked for a picture of me once. And she never heard from him again. 

The fact he asked for a picture of me once I was born gives me some slight hope he does care about me. 

I want some advice, I don’t know what I should say to my mother. I don’t want to come across as upset or as if this bothers me. 

Truth is for some unbeknownst reason I’m scared to ask, what if he’s dead, if she won’t answer me, if it upsets her to talk about it.

109,"I am on a cross country road trip with my dad right now, and while things are definitely going better than I thought they would, I still have trouble dealing with the way he acts. He has done very well for himself in his life and has provided everything my family could need. While we are all very appreciative of this, it is still hard to call him a good guy. 

He has a pretty distinct lack of empathy for other people. During this trip he is constantly tailgating other drivers who are simply following the rules and gets immediately, genuinely pissed off if he cant go the speed he wants in the left lane. He treats service workers like shit (he gave a server lip today for asking if he wanted to add a tip on a contactless payment, I have also seen him scream at the top of his lungs on the phone at a popeye’s worker who was trying to explain to him that grubhub drivers sometimes steal food when we didnt get the 4 biscuits we ordered). He is unable to control his anger when faced with even the most simple inconvenience, and it has become impossible to address with him.

He is also very unpleasant to have even a basic conversation with. While he is definitely a very smart person (lack of emotional intelligence aside), he is extremely condescending and doesn’t listen to the point you are trying to make. Sometimes it seems like he is just talking at you to hear his own voice and your opinion or contribution to the conversation is wrong or dumb. My uncle and I were trying to explain a simple broadcast delay to him, and he got extremely defensive once he realized he was wrong and started yelling about how we know nothing to save his position.

Anytime one of us brings up that he is being an asshole he always defaults to something along the lines of “I’ve done so much for this family I can do/say whatever I want and you just have to take it”. He thinks that his accomplishments somehow excuse him from having to be a good person and it is starting to worry me. He is starting to estrange himself from his siblings because he acts like this damn near every day of his life now. My Aunt has pretty much cut off contact with him after an incident when he full on screamed at my mother in a public restaurant for wanting to pay for everybody in our party. 

I am really worried because he was a bad alcoholic for 5 or 6 years and if we were to take drastic measures he would certainly go back to the bottle. It almost seems like we have no options at this point because it’s either sit there and take his wrath or leave and see him destroy himself. But things have kind of gotten to a breaking point as my sister is thinking about giving the ultimatum of seek help or she will no longer come visit. I just dont even know if that would work because he sees nothing wrong with his actions, so I worry our family might be destroyed for nothing. Anytime you try to speak your mind to him he just yells louder and says more dramatic things because he can never be wrong. I don’t want to see my family break up but I fear my mom might have no option but to divorce him soon. He treats her the worst, even though she has supported him through times that would have made most people pack up and leave. The shit he gets mad about is always trivial too, he started screaming about her having expired tabs, saying things along the lines of he has to do everything for her and that she is just trying to make his life harder. 

Probably running out of room here, but how do i tell him that he is fucking up all his personal relationships and is headed down a dark lonely path in a way that won’t set him off or make him angry at everybody else for even having these thoughts? I don’t want to see my family break up but I don’t know if he is going to leave an alternative for us.

116,"Hello Reddit, hope things are well. As I'm sure you've gathered by the subject title, I've been struggling on the social side of things lately. I've found that most of the issues I have with others can be easily solved by just talking to the person in consideration, but this is a situation I really don't know how to approach (without sounding like a pathetic asshole at least)  
I'm 16 years old, and graduating Highschool in a couple months. I'm homeschooled, so I have very few friends that actually live in my state. Recently though, I found a circle of friends on Discord, and have become very close to them. They're probably the best friends I've had ever. I know this feeling is one-sided, I'm just a random 16 year old and they are all college age students majoring in STEM. 

It doesn't bother me all that much, I have a good time with them either way. They're all incredibly charismatic and smart as a whip. If I ever need advice, \*someone\* will have an answer, which I appreciate more than anything.  
Lately though, I'm struggling to get over ""not feeling enough"" 

I also plan to go into STEM, specifically biology. One person in the group is a bio major, and I see myself asking them a lot of questions that come across as ignorant. Things I get excited over are very surface-level and basic, so I really don't want to come across as patronizing or boring.  
I've been told not to google, and that asking them for advice is the best way to go... but the questions I do have are very basic, and I feel like I irritate him with my sheer lack of brain cells. I've frustrated him on many occasions, and I feel so guilty about it.  
This may seem small, but it's been making me feel really depressed and unconfident. I don't know hoe to see if I'm just overthinking, or how to approach it without sounding pitiful/attention-seeking. At what point should I realize that maybe these people really don't like me all that much, and try to find a friend group closer to my level?

117,"Hi Reddit,

This week my girlfriend and I had received results for an ultrasound from the vet for our 7 year old German Shepherd. The vet informed us that our GSD has a tumor on her spleen as she is recommending a $10,000 surgery to go in and remove her spleen and biopsy the mass. This cost would only be the beginning a they may need to add other costs if the surgery doesn't go perfectly. 

Needless to say my girlfriend and I are devastated. We love our GSD with all of our hearts and can't think about losing her so soon. The cost of the surgery , however, would financially sink us as well (for years probably). 

I wanted to ask if anyone knows of any options or solutions that may help us. 

For example, are there any pet insurances that will take a dog diagnosed with cancer? Any surgery centers that may be willing to discount the surgery? Any programs available for pet owners that cannot fork out $10k + dollars?

* If we must finance this, are there any credit cards that would be best? 
* We've considered trying to fund-raise but that may be extremely difficult with COVID going on (as car washes and bake sales are out of the question right now). If anyone has any ideas on how to fund-raise from a distance we would be open to ideas as well.
* Anyone who may have have experienced this before, is there any advice you can give?

Thank you for your help and advice.",23Sep2020,1
118,"Generally I am pretty good at sticking things through. However, this fall I started university, it's online but I am living on campus. There was a small COVID-19 outbreak so pretty much everything around campus has been shutdown. The roommates I am living with are leaving to go home because of closures around campus. 

With all the shutdowns its really hard to meet people and without my roommates I am going to be spending a lot of time alone in my room doing online class. So, I asked my mom if I could come home for a few weeks to see if things get better (after getting tested ofc.) and just do my work my from home. 

Basically, she called me a quitter for not sticking it through. That I should be trying harder to make friends with people, I am giving up too early and I am just making excuses to leave. It is kind of like she thinks I am a kid at summer camp asking to come home. 

It is just that there is no one around to make friends with (people eat in their rooms too) . I'm struggling here. 

Should I be trying harder? How do I even try harder in this situation? 

Any advice would be appreciated :)",23Sep2020,1
119,"okay, so. i have always really struggled with my mental health, but by family doesn't really believe in that stuff (think people with depression are just lazy, people with anxiety just need to grow up, etc.) and i have never been able to ask them for help. i learned my lesson after a few painful experiences as a teen and i do not expect any support whatsoever from my family when it comes to mental health struggles.

january of this year was my first semester at my new college (i went to community college for 2 yrs first).  my first semester was incredibly hard on me. there were some things i loved (amazing professors, small campus, learning stuff i was interested in) but the demands of my program were incredibly stressful for me. i had a small mental health crisis early on in the semester but was able to handle it on my own. after the midterm, we didn't return to in person classes due to covid, so most of the things that worried me so much were no longer an issue. i finished the semester with amazing grades but i felt like i was only able to achieve them due to my school's response to covid.

fast forward to now. i started the semester really optimistic and excited but quickly started to feel anxious and discouraged again. one class in particular this semester is basically a full time job where i'm expected to work with a team and perform tasks that i have never done before (i should know how to do this stuff already, but since i'm a transfer student and my first semester was sorta cut short, i haven't had a chance to learn what i'm expected to know by now). even thinking about this class causes me great distress. i got to the point where, two weeks into the semester, i would have an episode at least once a day where i was crying, hyperventilating, even sometimes vomiting. i started wondering if i'm cut out for this program. what i want to do with my life is very collaborative and stressful, and if i can't even handle this program in school, i don't know how i'll be able to handle working in this field for the rest of my life. plus, i feel like my degree would be kind of useless. i've been keeping myself up at night wondering if i should drop out or change majors or stick with it. worrying about it is making me physically ill. i have skipped most of my classes for the past two weeks as a result.

i've also been dealing with what i suspected were signs of depression and other things. i have dealt with these basically my whole life so i kept telling myself i needed to just get over it but after a friend asked me to get help i checked out my university's website and took some online mental health screeners. the results were, well... very very not good.

i know i should get help, but all the counselors at my school are men, and i'm not really comfortable talking to a male counselor (i don't hate men or anything, i just wouldn't be able to relax enough to talk honestly about my mental health with a man). i also don't feel like it's okay for me to bring this up with any of my professors and ask for advice because they are not therapists. but i don't have an adult in my life that i can talk to and i don't know how to move forward. i feel like i'm stuck and i have no one to turn to. i want to get out of this situation but i don't know who to talk to.

TLDR: i know there's something wrong with me, and my grades are suffering for it. i was going to get help, but i'm not comfortable talking to my university's (male) counselors. i can't talk to my professors or my family. i don't know what to do.",23Sep2020,1

124,"By the title alone I might already know the answer. I know 7 years is quite a long time to be friends with someone. Before I had been through thick and thin with this person. Breakups, new relationships, hard times with family, everything. But unfortunately a huge disagreement regarding one of their friends who I don't know personally is what drove our friendship into the ground. I let them let their feelings out and they just unleashed every bit of wrath possible. Of course I'm used to this but I was afof what could happen with them or with me. Releasing all the aggression made me scared of them. Not scared for them which is obviously two very different things. Some days I feel like I could've worked with them and found some middle ground.

I don’t know why I feel the need to do this and I need to get this fixed. I can’t keep going like this I’m worried one day I won’t be able to stop. I love my pets and I can’t hurt them.

I was wondering now if I should report him or if I should just ignore it and move on? I don't even know if my university would be able to do anything in this case, considering it was off school grounds. I was specifically thinking of sending screenshots/proof of his behaviour to this other university he's applied to transfer to, but I've gotten conflicting responses. Someone said to ignore it because I might get him in trouble (isn't he getting himself in trouble though with his behaviour?), some said to only report him to the current university, and others said that considering how he defended his position when called out, I should report him to both universities.

It is a 1 bedroom apartment and before joining it was decided that I would be living in the hall and since he has the lease he would live in private room. The total rent he claimed was supposed to be $1550. I asked him for any kind of confirmation of rent and he provided me with a fake lease document ( found out it was fake later). So the rent was decided to split up as $850 by him and $700 by me. Before moving i again asked him for confirmation because my colleague told that the rent is $1350 but he said our apartment is different and every apt has different rent.

132,"Hey guys! So, My roommate and I have known each other through high school and became good friends towards the final two years, so we decided to room together for college. 

Okay, so I'm very busy being a stem major and having to work and I'm actually stressed out bc idk wtf is going on chem and I'm just trying to keep my head above the water and work as hard as I can. Since I dedicate so much of my daytime to activities that really don't focus on myself I tend to stay up late to do some things I like to do or I'll actually go crazy. 

Okay so a couple days ago I was very busy I woke up early to work on a group project for about 5 hours without eating breakfast after that I ate a Bagel for lunch and took a nap b/c i was exhausted. I had to work an 8pm-12am shift and woke up at 7pm, so no food for me okay cool. 

So I was working and someone in our hall group chat offered some pizza and considering nothing is open at 12am and I was actually starving I asked her if she could get the pizza for me so I can have a little something to much on and she told me ""Im still hanging out with my friend."" Usually, I wouldn't have a problem with this, but it  sounded like she had no concern. If anyone told me this I would usually at the very minimum hit them with a ""sorry, I wish I could do something"" and attempt to find an alternative, but nope that's all she told me.  

Mind you for this friend I've brought her a blanket, water, and pajamas when she got drunk elsewhere because I at least wanted her to be comfortable at night. She forgot her key at the dorm when I already stepped out and texted me to leave it on the door for her and I did it with no problems, but I confront her about not even showing an ounce of concern and she hits me with the ""This is why we should practice accountability"". It really bothers me bc I told my other friend who lives further from me and we don't room but yet still offered to help me figure something out, so Am I over-reacting? Am I the bad friend here?

I'm not sure which university I want to transfer to, I live in Nevada and my only in-state options are Las Vegas and Reno (I live in Vegas). I'm only considering in-state cause Nevada has a particular scholarship for Nevada universities only.

UNLV does not have chemical engineering, which is my major of choice and only available at UNR, so I'd have to major in Chemistry if I wanted to go to UNLV.

If I majored in Chemistry, I'd want to get an alternative teaching license and become a chemistry teacher if I find that I can't get any entry level chemistry jobs and save up to get a master's in chemical engineering.

My question is, would the vast amount of student loans it takes to move and dorm at an out-of-town university be worth getting a chemical engineering bachelors over a chemistry bachelors?

I will admit I’ve missed a good number of meetings due to my careless organization, but for the most part I’m caught up on assignments.

I understand I have to join them so I still do, and when I don’t I barely lose any points. Yet I’m not even passing a single class.

Especially with history class, I did all my teachers work at the start of the year, even this big ass project that took me a straight week.

As we’re in unit 16, my girlfriend parked in number 16, however on our first night we received a note saying this was unit 4’s space and to not park there again.

Obviously confused, we knocked on their door and spoke with the tenants in unit 4 who explained that about a year ago the strata/building management changed the car space allocations to be numerical (as they were in a different order before) however nobody conformed to the new order and kept parking in their original spots. 

They told us that unit 16’s original parking space is 14 and that we should park there instead. Thankfully they seemed a lot nicer than their angry looking note led us to believe.

Since then we started parking in number 14 but on Monday noticed another car there (no idea which apartment they’re from).

I emailed our Real Estate Agent for clarification and she’s responded to confirm our space is 16 and she will contact the strata to address with all the other tenants and advise them to park in their correct spots.

153," I met this girl in second grade, let's call her Lina; Lina and I have been best friends for 10 years, we are both now in grade 12. After grade 8 when I switched schools, we have noticeably been starting to drift apart and I have been doing everything I could to not let that happen because she is the only one who makes me feel somewhat happy or complete. Even though we didn't hang out as much afterward, we were still friends.

Although in 10th grade she started dating this guy that seemed way older than her; she lied and told me that he was 17 turning 18, he was actually 25. She pretty much only dated him for cash and also sent him nudes, which he then used to blackmail her to get more nudes and other 'favors'. When he finally got bored with her, he left. Three guys who were around 20-23 years old later (because she hasn't learned her lesson the first time), she decides to become a sugar baby to a rich 45 years old and gets paid $5k per visit, and she lied to him and told him she was 20 when she is actually now 17. She is currently recovering from anorexia and also has exima, so her skin has wrinkled prematurely, he hair is really damaged from the hair dye and also dying (since she's anorexic), so I really don't blame the guy thinking she was way older than what her age actually is. Her parents have sent her to therapy, but she really doesn't want to recover, as well as she is sneaking out to see these guys.

I found all of this out yesterday through my sister, who has been trying to keep this a secret from me because she knew what my reaction would be. She was okay with Lina being a slut/ sugar baby, which was probably why Lina told her and hasn't spoken to me as much as she does with my sister. On one hand, I love Lina because we've spent the last 10 years together and the time I spent with her was probably the best times of my life, but I am honestly so disgusted with her for doing this and I don't want to be friends with someone like this. On top of that, she is rich and doesn't need the money she's getting from these guys, and she has been slowly replacing me with my sister.

155,"i was on my cousin's twitter account (not stalking btw, she had liked one of my retweets earlier in the month and i assumed she was following me this whole time but i noticed she wasn't in my followers so i went to her account to check) i followed her by mistake when trying to click out. i wasn't going to follow her because i assumed she was just lurking my page for some reason. i quickly unfollowed her but realized she'd probably get the notification that i followed her regardless so i followed her again and messaged her on snapchat telling her i'd followed her. i thought doing this would make everything less embarrassing but i now realize that i just set myself up for more humiliation. she opened my message but didn't respond. instead she soft blocked me and turned her twitter account to private. this is so extremely awkward and i have anxiety so i'm going to be agonizing over this forever lol my cousin and i have sort of a weird rift between us as well so this didn't really help much. how do i forget about this? i just can't stop thinking about how weird she probably thinks i am. i want to just move on but we see each other irl sometimes (not often) and i don't want it to be awkward but i'm pretty sure it will be..",23Sep2020,1
156,"Many people are afraid of her, most people do not like her at all. She isn't qualified for the job and acts like sun shines out of her booty hole.

Thing 1:I work in an office, we have no dress code. I normally wear a sweater and jeans. I sit directly under a a vent and it blows cold air. I hate jeans, I feel uncomfortable in them but since I started and I seen everyone wearing them, I decided it is casual and I'll follow suit.

I normally wear a tank top underneath, and on this particular day I was asked to do some labour outside and it was 40 degrees Celsius outside. Needless to say I took my sweater off. 

I was brought into the office by my boss and was told that there was several complaints about my apparel. I it wasn't super tight fitting, I have no boobs really so nothing is fall out of revealing.

They got me a company shirt to wear. 

Thing 2: I asked someone in her department a question that was very brief, relating to work ( being new, this is where I thought I should turn as this person was named for reference), before they could answer, she told me not to talk to her people again and speak with my superior ( whom is rarely around so I need to resolve most my own issues). 

Thing 3: she yelled at me in front of several people for not have the proper PPE to grab a ladder from the shop ( IE; safety glasses and safety boots). I was told minutes before this that I could wear anything that is plastic, sunglasses, eye seeing glasses, it just had to be something and not glass. I was by no machines but I can respect the request to wear safety boots, but she's came from the shop yelling in her Keds. I was where plastic sunglasses. 

Her tones are rather aggressive and maybe that is my perspective but I'm fairly new there and her wrap sheet tells me that this is only going to get worse. 

How should I deal with this? I don't want to just bow down to someone that isn't my boss ( my boss has no back bone and loves this manager) and someone I don't agree with just because it's easier.

157,"My grandma on my dad’s side (90) takes care of my aunt (70), who is mentally handicapped. She’s taken care of her her whole life, but since my grandpa died a few years ago and my grandma had a stroke, I’m increasingly worried for them. My grandma frequently forgets meals and leaves the stove and oven on often. She’s very forgetful. My aunt is growing more and more thin and lethargic due to my grandma forgetting to feed her, according to my mom, and she can’t communicate beyond grunts and other noises. (She can’t feed herself or perform other basic functions.)

I live far away from the rest of my family, and my mom and I feel like this really isn’t acceptable, but my dad and the rest of his family—full of nurses—won’t do anything to better the situation and are avoiding them more and more.

Fast forward to now, I’m with C and I have completely fallen for him over the last few months we have been together. I guess I want to know if there are any best ways to express this to him. 

I am very sure that he feels the same way, but I think he is waiting on me to express my growing feelings first because I was the one more hesitant and wanting to take things slower in the beginning.

161,"Hi, I need advice on this because I’m kind of having a crisis about it. I’m a freshman in college, and am enrolled in a college in New York City. When I was a junior in high school, my best friend and I were searching for colleges to go to and we both came across this college and thought it would be amazing to go, especially together. We visited the college soon after we figured out we wanted to go there and loved the campus. A few months later when it was time, I applied to the school and got in! I was really excited to move in but then the coronavirus hit and I have to be online for my current/first semester. But, recently, I went on a trip into the city for one of my class assignments. I went with my friend who I mentioned before, and another one of my friends who wanted to come. The morning of my trip, I had a lot of anxiety and uncertainty, which is pretty unusual for me. Yeah, I can be nervous about things, but never something like this. On the train ride there I was nervous, and when we got in, I started to understand why. I realized, I think I actually HATE the city. I used to hate it when I was younger, but when I visited my college I loved it and dusted off my old feelings of dislike. But I think my true feelings are coming back. I get weird about locations other than my home town, whether it’s a place I’m vacationing at or just visiting. Most of the time, I’m really picky about the “vibe” I get. It sounds really pretentious, but most places either make me really happy or really depressed feeling. I don’t know why this trip phased and changed my feelings so much, but I don’t know what to do. I felt so sad and unhappy that I would be living there so soon. I’m most probably moving into the city next semester if COVID allows it. I genuinely don’t know what to do though because I haven’t told my family or my friend who’s going. The trip wasn’t even bad, and I was even in a really nice part of the city. I just really wanted to get back to my hometown, and when I did, I got really depressed the few days following the trip. And the worrying thing is that this crisis was just from VISITING it. I would so much rather go to a college that’s in upstate New York in the mountains, not be in a congested city with crazy people. What do I do?! I feel at a loss.",23Sep2020,1

163,"I dated a guy “R,” TEN years ago, for only three months. We were both 21yo at the time.

We met while studying abroad, and R and I fell for each other very quickly. We explored the new country together and had the best adventures. We were young but very in love. The connection was strong; it’s hard to explain, but I felt as though R and I were two halves of one being split into two bodies. He absolutely set my soul on fire like nothing before or since.

We broke up after returning from study abroad - our relationship had become long distance, and neither was able to handle the stress of that during our last semester of college. We were both jealous, said awful things, etc. 

Fast forward to ten years later - we haven’t seen each other in ten years. Since 2010, we have sent a few brief, friendly messages here and there, maybe a total of five times. But when I noticed a few months ago that some of his posts online were particularly dark, I sent a “lots of people care about you” kind of message. (I’ve lost three friends to suicide in recent years, and it’s important to reach out IMO.) He mentioned things have been hard since his divorce - I didn’t know he had been divorced. We caught up a little via messaging online, and I was sure to mention early on about my awesome fiancée, so as not to inadvertently seem flirtatious. He expressed well wishes for me with this person I love. A few weeks later we decided ten years was long enough to wait to catch up, so we agreed a phone call would be nice: he called me and we spoke for an unexpectedly long period of time (three hours). The conversation was about looming COVID, how’s the family, what ever happened to so-and-so from our semester abroad, etc., but no reminiscing about old times. That was six months ago, and I don’t expect to chat again. It was a one-time deal, catching up, and talking again after all this time would be weird and inappropriate.

I have had several much longer relationships since him, and my fiancée is truly my best friend and the kindest man I know - I love him and we have a bright future together. But R and the way he made me feel ten years ago - I think about it a lot. To be clear, R and I haven’t messaged or spoken since that phone call. I doubt he ever thinks of me, and I wish I didn’t think of him. I won’t be talking with him again and I’ll never tell him how much he meant to me, though I wish I could. It hurts. 

So reddit: how do I deal with these invasive thoughts about R and stop thinking about the past? Thank you for reading.",23Sep2020,1

165,"To start off I want to explain that there are four people in our friend group. Everyone met around seventh grade and I met them freshman year of high school. We are adults now. The oldest being 20 and the rest of us being 19. Our friend has made it very known that he is asexual and we know that it doesn't mean that he would never date anyone, but he hasn't shown romantic interest in anyone at all in the time we've known him. We weren't expecting him to date anyone really. And he isn't the type to go out an meet new people.

 Things started to change when he started using an app made for asexual people to meet and make friends. He started talking to someone and got close to him. Our friend didn't give us a lot of info on him other than he lived out of the country (we live in America and he lives in Europe) and his first name. It's been months now and we haven't gotten much more info. I've learned that he works in a casino and that he likes to skate board and he owns a car that was made in the 80's. 

Their relationship progressed pretty quickly after this. First they were friends and suddenly, he found it appropriate to ask my friend to go on a 4 month cruise ALONE with him. His reasoning for this was that he had no friends to go with him and for some reason his family didn't want to go, so he asked my friend. My friend agreed and committed himself to paying the money for his half of the expenses back. My friend had committed himself to over 21k in debt and didn't see a problem with it. He doesn't have that type of money. He's a college student... 

Shortly after that, they started making plans to meet up sometime. All of these plans involve my friend leaving the country. Of course we don't want him going alone so another friend and myself decided that we were going to follow him there to make sure he doesn't get sold to a sex trafficking ring or something.  His safety is a great concern but we are both scared for ourselves because we would be in a  country were we don't speak the language (German, mostly) and relying on the hope that he and whoever he is with aren't murderers. ( I didn't mention this, but they planned that the first time they met up would be the first time my friend gets introduced to his boyfriends family.)

It only seemed like weeks into their friendship that he asked my friend to be his boyfriend. We were happy that he found someone that he liked and it was obvious that he was happy but it just seemed super fast. I didn't want to push my standards for a nicely paced relationship on them but in my opinion everything was going backwards and fast and slow at the same time. (does that make sense) It was odd. He never met his family or met in person but they are dating.

Anyway, so they start dating and we have never spoken to this guy yet. We still know nothing about him and we are asking to meet up and play some online game or something to break the ice. It seemed like any time we planned something, anything would happen last minute to stop it. When we finally did get a hold of him, he barely spoke to us. He responded to my friend a little and completely ignored me even when i tried speaking to him and repeating myself. I eventually gave up.

No surprise, only a short while later, he told my friend that he was in love with him and we were again, happy for him but we thought it was super early. If someone told me they loved me within a month of dating me I would run. This is my friends first relationship and they are already saying they loved each other one month in. I know everyone is different but this was super fast and odd because we knew nothing about this guy. Not even a last name.

Eventually we noticed how much our friend was spending. He was paying $20 to $80 shipping on top of the money it cost to buy whatever it was that he was sending to his boyfriend overseas. Almost every time we spoke to him. he was telling us about something he had made or bought so send to him. All those times that he sent things to his boyfriend and i heard he only got one thing and it was for his birthday.

Eventually, his boyfriend had mentioned getting married. Mind you it's been maybe around 2 months at this point. This was something that our friend was shocked about but he didn't dislike the idea. He just didn't know what to say. I made jokes about it and I feel like I probably encouraged something and I regret it, but we all didn't like the idea of it. When our friend questioned his boyfriend about the proposal he said that he was only half serious. Even so, we still thought it was weird.

Recently however our friend has been changing. His been spending less time with us and when we do spend time with him, we have to be careful not to let our guards down because any second he would leave and make an excuse when he know it is to talk to his boyfriend. He leaves us whenever his boyfriend wants to talk. Any moment he could say that he was gonna hang up and call us back but he never does. He acts like he needs to speak to his boyfriend right then and there even though he had spoken to him for a few hours earlier that day. He ignores messages for us even though he is usually someone who likes to get back to people pretty quickly. Even messages that are in a serious tone can go ignored for day or two. 

Most recently another situation has happened that has my friends and I upset. We had finally gotten a date set up to play a game online together and we were supposed to use whatsapp to chat with each other. I asked why we couldn't use skype or something because we already all have one but he said that his boyfriend refuses to make one and that he won't budge. I found that a bit strange and unnecessary but I ignored it. When the day came where we were supposed to chat and play we were super exited that we could finally talk to the guy we've been hearing so much about. It was actually my fault we couldn't do it in the end. I use an app to substitute a calls and texts because I don't have a carrier. Because of this I don't have a real phone number and I don't get calls or texts from apps that want to verify phone numbers. So I couldn't make an account. I felt really bad and asked if we could just use skype and he could make an account on there. He responded by telling me that we would play another day and he would make a discord where we can talk. It all seemed so unnecessary and odd. Why not make a discord then? Why not make a skype account? It seemed like they were trying to avoid talking to us as much as possible and this was their lucky break. I texted and asked if they was any way if we could still play the game together as friends and we could include his boyfriend another day as planned. I got no reply. We all assumed that he was ignoring us and talking to his boyfriend again. 

We're all worried about our friend. He's told my personally that sometimes when we plan to talk to him he texts our friend in private and tells him that he does't want to do it anymore or he's tired and gets out of the meeting all together. That is what leads us to believe that he doesn't want to talk to us. But Why? Because he thinks that we will notice something that our friend doesn't? We don't think he's necessarily naive, but he has his moments. Our friend has been acting strange and has been apologizing on the behalf of his friend constantly but he never comes to us an apologizes himself. 

I'm worried for my friend. We can all sense some form of manipulation going on. With the personality changes and the odd behavior from him, it just seems foolish not to come to that conclusion. We've talked to our friend about it in private but he just keeps making excuses or apologizing on his boyfriends behalf. 

I worry that this whole relationship will turn into some weird 90 day fiance thing that will ruin his life. At worse it's some scam that resembles the plot of hostel.

181,"I quit my job at Walmart a little over a month ago and got a nice job upgrade to a phone store because of my dad. He'd worked with the company for a while (not anymore) and the district manager owed him a favor, so he used the favor to get me a job there. 

My experience at Walmart had been horrible, and every day conditions had been getting worse. I loved the job, loved my coworkers, but hated how we were being treated and hated how the company and upper management looked down upon us. 

Anyways, at this new job everything is completely different. I've been in training (which lasts 3 months since there's so much to learn) and it's been rough. 

I work with only two people (including my boss) and they're both men, which I usually wouldn't mind, but they keep making odd comments relating to me being a female. 

The manager has extreme anger issues and flips out in anger every time the customers leave the store. The manager also badmouths my coworker behind his back, and I can tell he's doing the same to me whenever I leave the salesfloor for a few minutes. 

The two guys I work with keep getting upset with me too for not knowing how to do things I was never trained to do. I tell them I was never shown how to do said things and they tell me that I should still know how. 

Today really ended on a note that bummed me out. I helped tons of customers by myself today and my coworker complimented me and said I did a good job, but then asked me how many phone upgrades I did. I'd only done one because the other customers who I'd helped came in with phones they'd purchased online and needed help transferring their data to. After telling him this, he said ""Wow, nevermind. I thought you'd done good today but I was wrong. You seriously only did one phone upgrade?"" 

I thought I'd finally done well for once, but I guess not. He continued to bad mouth me, to me. He said he was happy that I barely asked him any questions today and went about figuring things out on my own, but then chastised me for not asking him a question earlier in the day. He then said the question that I should've asked him, but didn't, was a stupid question and that I should've known the answer. 

Idk, I'm just really unhappy at this job. I was an expert at everything at Walmart, but then again- that's Walmart. I thought this whole new experience would be an awesome opportunity, but really I just feel like garbage nearly everytime I work and like I'm being a burden on the store. I want to look at getting a job somewhere else, but my dad went out of his way and got this job for me. I'd feel really bad leaving this job this early when my dad did this huge favor for me.

I know I can tell my parents anything but anything to do with my weight or something super personal I've just not be able to talk about to anybody, is there any advice you guys could give me?",23Sep2020,1
183,"Okay so this is a long story and I probably wont cover everything but it has to do with my best friend, let's call her Anna. I met her a couple years ago on Omegle. She lives a couple States away from me and we haven't met in person yet. She has a boyfriend of 3 almost 4 years now. We are both currently 18 but she is older than me by 7 months or so. I'm going to explain the weirdness from her over the past year.

So, starting in around October of 2019, she began to tell me that her and her boyfriend were having problems. And he was doing some things she didn't like, and maybe even cheating. Anna went so far as to kick him out of her car at one point. She eventually broke up with him and began talking to me all the time. She always Facetimed, flirted, responded almost instantly, told me her problems when she was upset, spammed me if she missed me, told me she wanted to be ""sleeping buddies"" and just wanted me there. She even called me her boyfriend once when some marine guy who had a fiancee was harassing her, but that's a different story.

It was all going well, until about January of this year when she started talking to her ex again, and telling me how he was being so genuine and nice. Mind you, during this time I had a major crush on her, shes one of the prettiest girls I know. Once I knew this, I told her something that would change everything. I told her that i used to like her but i didn't anymore, mainly because she was talking to her ex and was going to get back with him and I felt sick and depressed because I wanted to date her. She seemed really offended and sad like she wanted me to like her. I even consulted another girl and explained this and she assumed that she did like me back and I wasn't the only one to think that. She generally seemed hurt, and I asked her if she did like me, and she said ""not like that"".
That hurt but oh well.

Pretty much after that she stopped flirting, started talking less and got back with her ex, and they are still dating now. I began talking to this girl in one of my classes and Anna knew that. She recently told me she didn't want to ""overstep"" but I don't really know how to feel. She slowly began to distance herself to the point where we wouldn't talk for days which at one time was unusual. (Btw I stopped talking to the girl at this point bc of other reasons I won't get into but it was part of the story). As spring and summer rolled by, I wouldn't get any more messages saying she missed me or anything like she would do if we didnt talk for like half a day. I had the worst and longest depression maybe stemming from not talking to her but other things were happening too.

Again I apologize for anything that is unclear and or missing there is a lot and idk how to structure it all and I'm forgetting things. 

I recently brought this up to her and she told me she thought I stopped caring and didn't want to talk to her, yet she wasn't talking as much to me either. I'm not just gonna blame her I did stop talking a bit only because of a Spring and Summer job I got. But i never stopped caring about her and was sad we weren't talking as much.

Anna is the type of person who doesn't share they're feelings unless they are really close. As in I'm her best friend but she still wouldn't open up to me and told me to leave her alone when she was upset. I am the same way, to be fair.

Idk where to end this we are starting to talk more that's about it.

Also some weird thing she said to me recently as I just turned 18 (for his whole story I was 17 and she was 18) when she turned 18 she told me our relationship was gonna be illegal which it is not illegal to be friends with someone who is younger than 18. Before my birthday she told me ""our relationship is going to be legal again"". Remember, I've never met her in real life so there's nothing sexual or anything. And on my birthday she told me ""you're officially legal"". I told her it was weird and she responded with ""why? Turning 18 is a big deal and you're a legal adult now""

So I'm really stuck and confused about pretty much everything and I need some answers please and thank you. I'm sorry it's so long but I need to get this off my chest. Was I just a second option if her and her boyfriend failed? Am I really a best friend to her? Is she really toxic? Should I not be friends anymore?",23Sep2020,1
184,"I follow a latex mask page on fb. Some guy posted something about how he was bummed that the government is limiting halloween to mostly stay at home activities, so no trick or treating, halloween parties, costume parties. Someone commented saying 

""They may be guide lines, but you don't have to follow them. Party on!""

I'm so sick of people putting their own desires over the health of the public. This is what I saud to the guy. 

""do you not realize how incredibly selfish that is? Risk Putting everyone's health at risk, because you want to party. Its likely just one day you'd have to sacrifice. Get over yourselves. I know I seem like a karen to a lot of people, but so be it.

185,I have noticed that when I’m around people I am happy and enjoy myself but when I’m alone I’m usually sad or emotionless. I feel empty when I’m by myself and often listen to sad music which doesn’t help. I told a friend a few weeks ago and they said it sound like depression. I don’t really know much about depression because my mom has a different opinion on it and has voiced it to me my whole life so I feel like I have a mixed view on it. At this point I don’t know how to feel or what this mean so I’m kinda stuck.,23Sep2020,1
186,My spouse and I purchased a small house about five years ago that immediately more than doubled in value so it has some decent equity. It’s on the outskirts of a major midwestern city. It’s a historic home and we fixed it up and we love it and we planned to live here forever but lately I have a fantasy to sell the house and buy a small/very inexpensive house in the middle of the woods and just live very cheaply and grow vegetables and share an old car etc. and make money running a part time business. We are in our late thirties and do not plan to have kids. We are sick of working and don’t want to wait until we are in our late 60’s to fully pursue our interests and enjoy life. Should I pursue this idea further or just forget it and be content with I original plan to live an urban lifestyle with full-time white collar jobs.,23Sep2020,1
187,"I don’t know if college is for me. My mom is willing to let me drop out but only if I complete a year and keep my scholarship. But it’s only making everything worse. I don’t think I’ll be able to keep my scholarship because I have really bad ADHD- I’m two and a half weeks in and I’m already failing all of my classes pretty badly. But she wants me to so badly to keep it because I’m the only one in the family who got one- neither of my sisters, nor my mom went to college on a scholarship.


This jump from high school to college, from consistent 80 minute classes with easy homework to 3 hour long lectures with 2 readings and an essay due next class? It’s too much. I’m not smart enough to go through college, I was barely smart enough to pass high school. The only reason I got my scholarship is because I cheated. If I did everything legitimately I would’ve failed. 


I want to drop out. I’ll learn to drive, get a job, learn to cook, I don’t care. This is just too much for me. I want to become a voice actor, and maybe do some community theatre- things that don’t require a degree; and I wanna start doing it ASAP.


I never feel happy when I’m in my house anymore. I feel much more at home when I’m at my boyfriend’s house. Him and his parents understand how I feel and think I should do what I think is best for me- unlike my mom who INSISTS she’s right. When I talked to my mom, she decided I needed a tutor, not a therapist. A tutor. 

I’m doing college digitally from my hometown this semester and she told me that since I didn’t move out, she’s gonna treat me like I’m 15 again. Problem with that is, she also said she’s failed as a mother because I’m not independent enough. So apparently she can’t choose between treating me like I need help with everything or treating me like I know what I’m doing, and I get yelled at for it.


I told her she was suffocating me and she said we barely talk to each other- yeah, I just told you why. Why is it so hard for her to realise that I already know what I need? I don’t need a tutor, or a schedule. I need a therapist, a job and freedom to make my own decisions.

She also has full control of my bank account right now. We essentially share it but I haven’t been able to log into it digitally since we made it in June 2019, and although we’ve talked about it, we’ve never taken the steps to help me access it again. 


I’ve been feeling so apathetic for like a week. My hobbies haven’t brought me the same joy they usually do. The only things that make me feel good is talking to friends and hanging out with my boyfriend.


Should I talk to my sisters? We don’t always agree on things, and my eldest sister will sometimes share our conversations with my mom, but I feel like if anyone knows how to get through to her, it’s them. And maybe they’ll have good advice since they’re older.

Another thing I was thinking about doing was just taking initiative. Getting a job without her help, signing up for a voice acting agency without her help, doing everything I can do without her help. But I don’t know how to convince her that I’m not okay- I’ve told her how rapidly my mental health is deteriorating but she never takes me seriously. I don’t know what to do, this is chipping away at me so much.",23Sep2020,1
188,"So, long story short not in a very good spot - my ex dumping me through text without any explanation or verbal communication, my job being heavily affected by this whole pandemic thing. Pay has been delayed several times over this year and severely affecting my financial stability. I haven’t been paid this month and I don’t know when as my workplace is pretty much a mess right now. Been looking for other work but to no avail as things have been really difficult nowadays. My last resort would be to go home back to my parents however my parents and I don’t get along they have been the root cause of my heavy depression and several attempts to take my life and I swore off on going back. But with how things are going it looks like thats my last recourse. I’m very scared and uncertain but I don’t know till how long I can hold out and I just want a reprieve at this point. Would it be better for me to just go back to them or should I try to hold out by myself I’m scared I won’t be able to feed myself and more than me my pets. I’m really lost.",23Sep2020,1
189,"Shes giving me a half of a day of her time to figure out a dress from scratch (neither of us are seamstresses.) I hated my wedding because people convinced me I wanted different things than I really did, and I really don't want to do that but making a dress in a half of a day just isn't going to go well.

She originally had a blasè attitude but she's getting quite specific on what she wants and plans to 'pick things up on her way out of town' on Friday for a Saturday wedding.

I really don't want to stress her out and be a bad maid of honor, but there's no way all of her ideas will come to fruition. I also dont want to do what other people did to my wedding and convince her that different ideas might be better for the situation. One of the ideas- dont leave picking things up last minute.

190,"I have two children that live with us (previous relationship). He has a child from a previous marriage. We’ve been living together a little over a year and together a little longer than that. 

I’m currently in school. I don’t have a pot to piss in, so I’m working hard to get educated for my kids. If all goes well, I graduate either this coming May 2021, or December 2021. 

He is currently in school as well, but has an incredible job, with good benefits, good pay, etc. 

6mos ago, despite taking birth control “perfectly” I ended up pregnant, and had an ectopic. This ectopic (I’ve had one prior), ruptured my tube. Due to the opposite ovary being compromised from the previous ectopic, I was told that my chances of conceiving, were slim (jokes on me). When I found out I was pregnant I didn’t know how to tell him. Honestly, I texted him on my way to the ER. It was about 4 days from when I found out until I ruptured and told him via text. He was so supportive and helped with the kids while I finished my semester and recuperated. 

Now I am pregnant again, confirmed via home test this morning. I’m sure there will be many blatant “just tell him”, but this is so hard for me. I didn’t have this problem telling the father of my kids, I don’t get why it’s so hard now. 

I told myself (and told him once) that the chances of my getting an abortion if I got pregnant while I was in school were like 99.99%. This was before compromised fertility. Now I desire to have this baby, but I genuinely care about him so much that I don’t want to ‘trap’ him. So I’m conflicted there, and feeling selfish, honestly. 

HOW can I possibly tell him? Is there any easy way to face the music? I’m already so stressed with school, my kids schools filling with COVID, and now pregnancy hormones?! I feel like I will lack the ability to be constructive.",23Sep2020,1

I really want to be bold and want something more challenging. Now i feel like I am in high school again (just computing to school and nothing much apart from studying).

192,"I play trumpet and my mom isn’t supportive of me. She used to be. But now she is just negative. 
Same is my dad. He would show me videos and say I need to play like that and that’s how I should play. And it hurts low key cuz I’m trying. And my mom said that I just started so I should stick with percussion instead trumpet. But I wanted to pursue a different experience. It doesn’t matter if i suck. If I work my ass off practitioners everyday I’ll get better. And I did. I’m not bad like I was in the beginning, I’ve made incredible process and nobody is noticing it. 
When I brought up about switching to brass from percussion my band teacher supported me and encouraged me to switch. I just started playing 9 months ago. My band teacher let me stay after school and get all the music I needed for marching band and let me practice during my lunch period while I was in percussion at the time. I submitted a video of me playing and she said I’m sounding good. That made me feel mixed feelings, i was happy, but I felt weird about the compliment since I was never told that before. Coming from my own teacher.

So out of curiosity I messaged her and asked who did her tattoo. She was all stoked and gave me the name and said her and all her friends go to the guy cause he’s cheap and fast. But he really isn’t that great at all. 

So I basically said it looks like he’s pretty good, maybe hit or miss but her tattoo looked really decent and I asked if she was open to other recommendations for artists, because my good friends does tattoos who is way better (though I didn’t say “he’s way better” I just mentioned he does good tattoos) 

She responded all offended calling me out for insulting her tattoo and shit. But I didn’t insult her tattoo. I told her it looked really decent and thought I could help her out with another better artist.

196,"I co-host a semi popular podcast. Recently my co-host decided that they wanted to take a break due to some personal things. I was totally fine with it because everyone needs a break. Although with that being said I have been recently thinking about the show and also not doing it weekly for nearly a month. I have started feel like I am being taken advantage of for the most part and I might want to end the show. 

So when it comes to the show I edit the show, I pay for the hosting fee and paying for programs and our bill is $50-70 a month and handle all the business stuff minus the occasional email. 

My co-host really just shows up and we do the show and then they leave and chat once or twice during the week. This is fine because of life things but recently due to COVID 19 I asked them about helping to pay for some of the fees needed to run our show and they started to get mad at me and we got into a fight about it. 

I tend to be ready for our show at we picked out but when it comes to them. They tend to show up 15-70 minutes late almost every time and very rarely gives an explanation. The only issue with this is sometimes we have guests who have very limited time and the guest sometimes leaves or we are forced to reschedule.  

Another thing that has been happening is that I would say something about a person and if my co-host does not like the person or a piece of media. They would demand I should edit it out completely and I do to respect their wishes. Though if I cut out something from them sometimes I will receive messages about why I took it out. 

Recently as well when we record our shows. I would be talking about something and my co-host would cut me off and talk about random things or correct me before I have a chance to finish what I was saying. I did not notice this until a few listeners started bringing it up in emails. Same happens when we get an email that is negative or critical about something my co-host said in a previous episode. They will either tell me to delete it or they will berate the person who sent in the email. 

Lastly the one thing that has been bothering me is it has been nearly a mouth since we took our break. In that time I have not heard from them or have we discussed what is happening with the show. Normally that is fine and understandable given the break but they are constantly on social media and talking about our show and chatting with everyone in our friend group and it feels like they are actively avoiding me. 

I don’t think they are a bad person. Nor do I want things to end with a huge fight. I love our show that we do but at the same time the more I think about it. The more I feel like I am being used to further my co-host social media presence. During the break I have been learning new programs and recently started dabbling in a solo podcast and I have been having a lot of fun and just as rewarding.

 I am not sure how to handle this situation. Any advice would be helpful. Because I want to bring this all up to them but also I just want to end the show on good terms and just move on to other projects for the both of us.",23Sep2020,1

199,"I had an interaction with my roommate tonight that really left me feeling uneasy and hurt. Over the past year I went through a really bad period of social anxiety and cynical life realizations that caused me to close myself off from people, and am just now trying to rebuild the relationships I pushed away due to thinking that everyone was out to get me. I mentioned to my roommate yesterday that my old friend (i'll call her lindsey) messaged me and told her about my suspicions surrounding why she may have suddenly decided to after months of not talking. Since I told her about that, she now is beginning to assume that every time I open my mouth its about that girl. For example, I'll say ""i'm really confused about-"" and before I can finish she'll say ""let me guess, lindsey?"" when I had no intention of bringing her up. This pattern is starting to bother me because the underlying principle to her saying it is ""this kid has no friends except this girl that started messaging him again, that must be all he has to talk about"" which kinda leaves me feeling worthless and like I have no one. I've brought this girl up in convo ONCE and she has now initiated it on her own three separate times. Then nearly 5 minutes later she brings up how I accidentally snapchatted this guy earlier and started hypothesizing ""maybe you subconsciously felt the need to message him"" which alone would have been something I could shrug off but I was already pissed about her bringing up the girl AGAIN when i didn't even initiate the convo. I know I'm probably being really sensitive, but i'm not enjoying this attempt she's making to psychoanalyze me and to act like she knows everything there is to know about me. Am I overreacted or does any of this seem a little rude/suspicious? I don't like being intruded on when I don't offer up myself or something relating to me as a topic it feels like an invasion of privacy.

206,"I’ve been friends with Amy since we were 15. We’re both 28 now, and she’s had a pretty hard life in general. So I tend to kind of baby her when she needs help, because  I find it hard to say no when someone asks for help. (Sorry this is kind of long and I am on mobile so formatting might be weird) 

 So a few years ago I get a call from Amy’s mom while I’m at work and she tells me that Amy is in the hospital because her boyfriend Tom (who we have also known since we were 15) pushed her out of his car while they were driving. Witnesses made police reports and she was admitted into the ICU. I rushed over there after work to check on her, and since her mother was not in the same state she gave them permission to tell me what was going on with her so I could report back. 

The doctor informed me that they drug tested her when she arrived because she was completely out of it, and they told me she had heroin, meth and cocaine in her system. I was just floored. I went to the hospital every day after work for 5 days. Made the hospital admit her under an alias so Tom couldn’t find her. When she was released I picked her up and brought her to my house to help detox her a little more. I told her the stipulation of staying with me is that she cannot be in contact with Tom or tell him where she is because I also feared for my own safety around him. He is very violent and has a rap sheet about a mile long. 

She agreed and told me she didn’t want to be around him because he had been pushing her to do drugs and sell herself for money for them to get more.  But one of the days that I was at work she called him to pick her up, so he then knew where I lived. I was furious and cut her off for a while because she had potentially put me in danger by letting him know where I live. He sent me threatening messages after keeping her in hiding. 

Maybe a year later she reached out to me and told me she was done with him for good, so I happily became her friend again because she didn’t really have anyone else. She was doing really good (for about 2.5 years) until yesterday. She messaged me asking to come over, but with covid I said I didn’t feel comfortable being around people. She then told me that she’s pregnant and knows she doesn’t have covid because she’s been at the doctor getting checked frequently. I asked her who the father was, and wrote the name of a guy I knew she had been on/off with after her and Tom broke up. 

She then messaged me back today saying that Tom (who at this point I didn’t know she was even speaking to again) was the one that got her pregnant. He also had taken her phone and saw my messages to her asking if the other guy was the father. He apparently flipped out on her and hit her, kicked her out of his car with all of her things and left her on the side of the road. He also knows damn well that she’s pregnant. I will admit she did ask me if she could come over again because of this, but after last time and already fearing for my safety when she told Tom where I lived I didn’t want to take the chance of him showing up if I picked her up. 

I feel horrible about this, but if he has her on drugs again and he could endanger my life to get to her.. I don’t know what else to do. How can I help her? She doesn’t have a physical address right now, she told me they were living in a motel, and which one I don’t know. Her phone doesn’t work, she only messages me on Facebook when she gets free WiFi from somewhere. I want to do all I can without putting myself at risk again, but I don’t know where to start. Please, any advice is welcome. 

(TL;DR) My friend is in an abusive relationship with a violent guy that has forced hard drugs on her and has forced her to sell herself to sustain his habit. She’s now pregnant/homeless/possibly back on drugs and he literally kicked her out on the street today, what should I do?)",23Sep2020,1
207,"So, for some context, I'm Polyamorous. I have two partners. One is a cis male, we'll call E. The other is genderfluid, they'll be K. 
E and I have been together about three years. A year and a half ago, we had a talk and decided that I could have another partner. 
I dated one guy for about 3 months, but he wasn't into being poly at all and it just didn't work out. I took a break and didn't intend on dating again for a while. But, then I met K. K is amazing. We've been together a month and a half. It's going great.
Or it was until I told my dad about K. I love my dad, he's always been a big support for me. But, when I told him about K, he started getting really weird. About a week after telling him, he started telling me that E isn't okay with things.
 I instantly went into panic mode. I called K crying and we were worried we'd have to break up. But then when I talked to E, he said he's perfectly fine with it. He even brought up the idea of the three of us moving in together. It helped calm me down a lot.
Well, tonight we went and talked to my dad about moving (my dad is our landlord so we had to). He told me that K is going to ""get sick of sharing me like my ex did"" and that ""We'd be idiots to move in together"". I'm crushed.

208,"I’m having my 21st in December, and luckily for us we’ve had no covid cases in months so it looks like it will happen. 

There’s a group of friends I considered close so I initially invited them to my birthday, but now I’m having second thoughts because I’m realising how they treat me.

I haven’t seen any of them in about a month as I’ve been in poor health. The night before I was with one of these people and even checked the next day that they were feeling okay. The last time I saw all of them is when I organised a get together out my place. The same friend I checked in on told me it was pretty bad and he’d host the next time.

There was a period of time that someone in the group (who has since left) tried to get the others to dislike me. Once they actually got to know me they realised they misjudged me and how much the other person lied about all most everything he ever said. 

I’ve also been told that none of them were going to show up to my birthday dinner last year until one of them felt bad for the way they treated me so everyone else came. They also said they find me condescending and after analysing and trying to “fix” myself, I realised they just weren’t getting my sarcasm and sense of humour. They don’t seem to care about me or put in effort either.

The more I think about it, the more I realise I’m the only one putting effort into these friendships. This whole situation is too similar to what I went through with people in high school and how they tried to make me change. When I got to university, I could finally be myself and no one asked me to change til now. 

I know it’s rude, but I’m starting to think that I’m better inviting people I actually want to my birthday over people I invited because I felt I had to. Should I just uninvited them?",23Sep2020,1
209,"So I have been told multiple times in my life that when I'm around bad things seem to happen and people are unhappy, most recently a few days ago by my friend's girlfriend, what confuses me is I try my best to be a good person like I don't steal, I try not to lie, i only spread positivity, and I want the best for everybody but apparently when I'm around negative events seem to happen more often and people get depressed, I've been told by my friends landlord, a friend's grandma, and even my dad when I was young, but I only want the best for everyone and try to make the world a better place Everywhere I Go but apparently it's the exact opposite and I don't know what to do I do my best to be what is considered a good person but apparently that's not good enough, anytime I'm Givin anyting like food or cigarettes I always try to reimburse and I always make sure I give more then I take, I don't really talk much bc I'm penalized with anxiety, I don't bring ""bad"" people around since I basically don't have any friends anymore so I'm clueless on why my presence brings people misery, I'm a man of science so I don't think I'm a ""bad luck charm"" like I've been told, so that means I'm doing something that makes people feel this way but I don't understand what it is since I try so damn hard to be a ""good"" person, should I just stay completely to myself or can I fix this problem? Maybe it's bc I'm depressed and I hate myself and life and even tho I try to drown out those feeling with love and positivity and humor somehow I still give off those vibes.. I'm probably asking too much by expecting someone to have a answer, maybe I'm just a shitty person even tho I try so hard not to be... btw I'm 21M if that info is needed to help understand",23Sep2020,1

211,"Hey guys, first time poster, long time lurker.

So COVID has made rentals substantially cheaper in my area. Our house is a wreck and has been constantly falling apart around us. We can get something crazy good for like $100 more a week between 4 of us, so we're considering our options. We currently pay $175 each a week, for a 1 bathroom place. 

My housemate, and best friend, is somewhat difficult, but we make it work and for the most part things are fine and dandy.

My other housemate, my brother, can only pay up to $180. Thats fine, he will get the smallest room. my partner are willing to pay up to $300 together, and the other housemate $250. However, she is adamant she wants a room with an ensuite. Thats fine, but if you are getting the room with the most facilities you should pay more.

So I told her if she wants to pay $250 for an ensuite and walk in robe, then we will only be paying up to $200, which would substantially bring down the overall amount we could spend. She's pissy because with a $730 budget we can get something substantially better than with a $630 budget. She probably wouldn't be able to get anything with an ensuite, but this is her 'condition' moving to a new house. 

Do we try and convince her otherwise, or just bite the bullet and GTFO? My other housemate, my brother, is an absolute dream and I'd hate to leave him, but its super hard finding new housemates in the current climate anyway and we might also get a bit stuck looking for something.

Essentially she wants us to pay for her to have the best room and ensuite which we clearly won't do, but she",23Sep2020,1

1. You can just click on the icon bar and open up the app on the current virtual desktop, and can just start typing what you need to.
   1. Offline desktop would do this. Web apps doesn't allow you to do this
2. When you open a new instance, it opens to where you left off / are at, and syncs in near real-time with the other instances opened

I want to talk to Randy Gardner about longest time to go without sleeping. He has to know some tips, as he went around 11-ish days. Yes, it has been beat, but he was the og dude. He was extensively researched and is like a scientist or something. No wikipedia  page or news source shows anything about him except date of birth, the sleeplessness, the after effects, then poof, no more info.

Mainly, he'd probably figured out a way to beat the hallucinations, but that's another story.

Would it be wrong of me to delete her as a friend so she cannot see my posts since I am not allowed to see hers? Most of my postings are of her new baby sister that she doesn’t see often as we live in different states.

I know it’s just Instagram but it hurts my feelings that she won’t allow me to view this aspect of her life. Am I being childish?

216,"THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT 

Everything’s my personal opinion but i genuinely think it will help for those who actually wants this to work.

First of all lets talk about the stress. What is stress, and what it does to our body while studying, exam etc. Stress makes you lose your mind and makes you nervous, mad etc. 

Time for the final exam you may not remember everything you’ve learned, why? 
Whenever you’re stressed you start forgetting things, there’s a huge impact on your studying results and in general daily activity etc, you may remember most of the things incorrectly or you may forget everything, everything depends on how stressed you are, as you’ve already noticed in the morning you remember everything so much better than ever before, why is that? because you’re as relaxed as you can without taking unnecessary/necessary drugs.

How to get over it? You need to relax as much as you can, the more relaxed you are the better results will be, don’t stress, don’t get mad, everything has an impact so sleep schedule does which is very important to your nerve system that leads to stress-bad nerve system-mood or a good nerve system, good mood etc, that will have a impact on you. 

The most IMPORTANT thing is to want to study without anyone forcing you, you need to have a flame in your heart and you have to know that you’re ready to do everything it takes to reach your goal. If someone is forcing you to do something you’re not interested in, I promise you, you’ll never get good at it, you need to love what you’re doing so much for the maximum results in a good way. 

Good luck :)",23Sep2020,1

My mom is a little concerned  since she is almost spot on with the topics her and M talk about even though there is no way K could have heard about in person.

So it's always been a little sad for me. These last years, I've met great friends. I could celebrate it with them but covid took my chances. Last year I couldn't celebrate it cuz my city had an earthquake. And the previous year I was just getting to know my friends and also we couldn't celebrate it for a reason I don't remember but now I was literally counting days everyday. I was so excited. It would have been my 16th bday. Well, the problem was that my mother came to me and said ""your father and I r gonna be out of the city taking your grandmother where she wanted to go. You see she's so stressed because of the isolation and all and we thought we could take her since she shouldn't take a bus to get there. It would be risky.""......... They will be gone for 2 days...

221,"I moved into college mid August. I moved into the dorms. I met my neighbors the second day I was here, 2 what seemed to be nice boys. Over the course of the semester they started to be very loud at nights and having small groups of people in there dorm. It bothered me and I just tried to keep to myself because I understand there’s not much to do and it’s nice to have friends over. Also the walls are thin so I wasn’t able to tell if they were being really loud or I could just hear them because of that. I noticed an increase of people/noise as time went on and kept trying to ignore it. Then their noise started to cut into my sleep,I couldn’t fall asleep because they were being too loud. One night it was close to 1am and I had enough so I went downstairs to file a noise complaint and the DA basically told me to go away because that’s not his job. By the time I went back upstairs I they were quiet enough for me to fall asleep. A week or two went by my friend was over, we were watching a movie, i could hear they were talking loud and making thumping and rattling noises on the wall, right where my bed is. This went on for maybe 20 minutes so I banged on the wall. They just laughed and banged back, which didn’t really surprise me. My friend suggest I told someone because she had noticed how disruptive my neighbors are every time she comes over. I was very reluctant to because once I did that I knew I’d be getting involved. I finally emailed my CA that night and asked him to talk to my neighbors about quiet hours. He emailed me back explaining he wasn’t around until the weekend and I needed to talk to someone else but would talk to them when he got back. So I figured I’d just wait it out. I fell asleep that night but woke up to what I only can explain as drunken karaoke competition. I laid in bed for awhile before deciding to knock on their door just to ask them to be quiet, they didn’t answer. I went downstairs to another DA and she tried to tell me there wasn’t much she could do and I just had a total breakdown and cried basically begging her to do something. She tried but couldn’t get a hold of someone to handle the situation. On my way back up I knocked again, still no answer they were still loud. So I crawled back into bed and banged on my wall. They stopped and I got a faint “Sorry” through the wall. A CA spoke to them and they were even quiet for awhile. Then today happened. I was in the shower playing music (maybe a little loud it unsure) but they started to knock on the all while I was showering, maybe even saying stuff I couldn’t make out. Then I got out and turned off my music to call my bf. While on the call someone said something like “too loud “ then banged on my door really loud. I went to answer but no one was there. The right before bed someone did it again but said something like “b**** I’ll be loud” it was hard to hear. So any advice on what I should do? Should I tell someone this happened?

225,"I (17f) have been having some trouble adjusting to online schooling, and sleep has really been the only thing that makes me feel better. However, when my brother (15m) and I are at my mom's, his gaming habits keep me from sleeping. Sometimes it's a murmur I can tune out, but a lot of the time it's him yelling at his friends and I can't fall asleep. He's always been louder than he realizes in everyday life, but no matter how often or politely I ask him, he doesn't quiet down and it's hard for me to sleep. If I text him, he ignores it. If I talk to him in person, he gets super rude or passive-aggressive. I've tried earbuds and music, earplugs, melatonin, etc., but most methods don't help. Sometimes I just unplug the router (which is probably a dick move) just to get to sleep before 11. I've tried to get my mom to talk to him, but he ignores it and she doesn't care enough to press the issue. While I'm at my mom's I usually end up sleeping on a futon on the other side of the house, but...I don't know. I just think it's unreasonable for me to have to do this when it's negatively affecting me? Am I just being bratty or demanding? I've honestly tried proposing solutions like buying soundproofing foam (not sure if that would help much) to put up, or imposing a 9:30 ""curfew"" of sorts during the school week, where everyone would have to be quiet (I also made it clear that I would be happy to adhere to this because I sometimes stay up during the week and play games with my friends too!) but I am reaching a point where thinking of going back from my dad's and dealing with this is giving me some legitimate anxiety and I just don't know what to do? Obviously, I don't want my brother to just stop gaming with friends all together because especially now, it's basically his main way of socializing, but I am already struggling and being tired like I am really doesn't help my productivity.

235,I am a student with a pretty strenuous major and due to online classes I sit at the desk in my room from 9am-9pm almost every day with occasional walks to campus (2x a week) when I have lab. I find that my posture is terrible and I think it is because the muscles in my back are weak. Because I have bad posture and have to sit at a desk for hours my back feels so tired at the end of the day and causes me great pain. The pain is in my upper back between my shoulder blades. Does anyone know anything that can help ease the pain or strengthen my back muscles?,23Sep2020,1

237,"After my 12 year old sister broke her iPhone and forgot the password to it. I lended her my iPad Pro to use. After lending it to her she’s been using it all the time and having no sense of time management on it at all. It’d get to the point where most of her time is spent on the iPad. Majority of the time she doesn’t get away from it unless it’s to sleep and eat. I’m concerned for her, but it’s also getting annoying since I have heard her talking to her friends till the middle of the night when I’m sleeping. I can also hear her giggling from her room at night. I honestly don’t know what to do. I want her to actually spend time outside of using the iPad but also I know she’s too stubborn to be able to force her to do anything else. Please help ;-;",23Sep2020,1

My questions are how do you put the vbucks that you bought with the card on the fortnite account is their a code or something like that? If there's a code where do I go to put the code in? Is there a limit on how long the card will last before you can put the code in because I want to hide the card until he wants to buy some vbucks (which isn't often so it'll probably be a month or longer until he uses the card), but I want to make sure that the card or code on the card will last until he uses it.

That being said, the bf is a very logic driven person- not to say that he isn't good with emotions, but he tends to think in a very academic way about  how to deal with emotional issues. It's not all together a problem, but it does get a bit weird whenever I bring up my personal struggles with my depression and/or anxiety. These are struggles apprehensive about sharing with partners because  I've been in several situations where many of them would either dismiss my issues or try to find ways to 'fix' them. The only time  I ever reveal this information about myself is when I feel like I can trust that the other person might have the capacity to accept me where I am as I continue on my own journey to get better.

251,"Sorry I tried to condense about 6 years of things. My best friend from high school is way prettier than me. We became close friends over both of us (mostly her honestly) crushing over some cute guy in our class. She’s also more book-smart than I. We have a good friendship but I often find she is too whiny and I am not very tolerant. She complains about people not talking to her suddenly without giving her a reason and she feels bad about it. She always has guys talking to her but besides her friend from elementary school and me she doesn’t have any other close friends. We’ve been friends for about 6 years now. 

I, on the other hand, have a steady friend group for about the same time, 6 years. I have not really thought about mixing her in (it really just hasn’t come up much) but i have brought her to hang out with my friend group a couple times. Mostly it’s just me and her when we hang out. 

I am now starting to see why friends ghost her. There are many things that are starting to really irk at me. But I am now gaining more self-confidence and there are some things I can just not let go any longer. 

For example, I am one year older and I started working about a year before she did. She complained to me after I told her how much i get paid saying “i don’t get how you and my other friend make more money than me. And you didn’t even have to ask for a raise? That’s so unfair! I mean I’m happy for you but I just don’t understand.” Am i wrong to have taken that in a negative way? I feel like I would never say that to my friends. Or feel that way if they make more money than I. 

She also goes to a better college than me. But she’s constantly complaining about how I’m done with my degree and have a professional license and she still doesn’t know exactly what she wants to do. At the beginning she tried to encourage me to go to a “better” college so I would be able to find a good job. Well, in my shitty college I’m doing just fine. The way she makes it seem sometimes, it sounds like this upsets her. 

I also have a long-term boyfriend. This too has become a problem. She literally said “no offense but how come you can get a boyfriend for years already and I can’t even get a guy to date for a few months” umm.. “no offense”? I took that as because I’m not as pretty as she is, she should be the one to have a better love life. Am i wrong?

There’s a guy she’s basically in love with at work. He has a gf who also works there. My friends still flirts with him. I told her that’s not cool and she’s like “but i think he likes me too, we also text” they ended up sleeping together while he was still dating that girl. I told her how wrong this was and it especially hurt because I am in a relationship and i strongly discouraged her behavior.  Eventually he and his gf broke up so my friend thought he wanted her and was waiting for him to ask her out and guess what! Months went by and he still didn’t ask her out. I was sad that she was broken by this but told her he’s definitely not the right guy if he cheated on his gf with you. 

While in one of my internships, there was this guy a few years older than me who liked me (i was too naive and had too low self-esteem to get that) a few years later he friended me on fb and told me he liked me not just for my pretty face but also my intelligence and my personality. When I showed her the conversation she laughed at this message and said “not just for your pretty face??” And she emphasized the “pretty” part. I mean... jesus im not that ugly and some guys may find me attractive.  I should say that this conversation happened after we went to a party and the guy she’d apparently thought was cute asked me to dance and the guy i thought was cute asked her to dance. This was funny and we laughed until... the guy I danced with came at the end of the night to ask for my # and the guy she danced with never did. She complained the whole way home. Mind you, i don’t get nearly as much guy attention as she does. Like not even close. Like not even a little bit close. She really can’t let me just have one at least? (This happened before my current relationship) 

There are many more things like this. Subtle things she’d say that i’d brush off more because I didn’t have much confidence. But now, i’m getting really annoyed with her. I don’t think a true friend would say those things

The last straw also has to do with my relationship. My boyfriend is in the military and comes home 1-2 weeks at a time maybe 2-3x per year if we’re lucky. I don’t ever bring her along when he’s home. Or any of my other friends. When he’s home we spend some time with his family and the rest of the time just us two. He also makes time for his friends while i’m working. She really said “why are you hiding him from me?” UMMM... it’s not about you at all? He’s literally only home for a short period of time and you think we want to share that time with you? I’m not purposely hiding him from her. She’s upset that i don’t spend time with her for the time he’s home. I take long to return calls and respond to texts and this bothers her. I mean, I tell her he’s home. Why would I spend his limited time here on my phone?? 

I don’t know how to stop being her friend. I have had many conversations about her behavior and when she’s wrong but she’s always defensive, she’s apparently always right and thinks so because she is “smarter and prettier” than me. So many times when things go right for me, she complains that life is SO unfair because she doesn’t have the same things. I feel like I am outgrowing her. I feel like there’s no way to end this nicely.",23Sep2020,1

So recently I have moved into a new apartment. this apartment is a non smoking property and quite expensive, so i figured everything would be good. However, I have noticed the master bathroom absolutely REEKS of cigarette smoke. It smells like someone’s been smoking in there for ten years. I don’t mind cigs (i am a pack a week type of smoker) but it doesn’t mean i want to smell them everytime i’m home. I cleaned my bathroom so nice and i couldn’t even enjoy the nice fresh clean smell:( 
My apartment complex offered to do an ozone treatment but it would take three days and can be extremely harmful
to pets (i have a rabbit and an old sick cat). even if i take them away from the house for a few days, the risk that the treatment hangs around is pretty high and i don’t want to risk harming my boys. 
It would have been great if they would have done the treatment well before i moved in, but it was on me for moving my stuff in and signing the lease without taking a really good smell in the bathroom area, so i can’t get too mad at them. Does anyone know of any alternatives to this ozone treatment that is safe for pets (and humans too)? :) Or any other additional advice on what to ask for with my complex or whatever.

257,"

Ever since I turned 9, my father has been using various parental control and child lock applications to restrict our access. My brother, being a tech wiz, always managed to outsmart them. After my brother moved out, my father switched to a new app (the one he currently uses) called WebGuard. Which restricts my access on both home Wifi and my Cell Plan. He did not add my brother onto this. 

WebGuard, which I believe is either operated through the Google Account linked to my phone, or my T-Mobile cell line, has proven to be difficult to crack, yet very dumb. 

It currently restricts any and all websites it deems suspicious. Including various random restaurants like Domino's, Subway, and Wendy's. 

The program also shuts off all my internet access at 10pm, which becomes problematic when working on Schoolwork or legitimate work (both of which are fully online).

Due to paying for college, buying my own mobile line is a last resort, and I'd rather not circumvent this anyway. Don't want to leave bad blood between me and my father when I leave.

How can I best handle this situation?

259,"I've dealt with mental health issues most of my life and now I am 26 and still living with my mom without a job and with no friends. In the past 8 or so months I've had a lot of ""epiphanies"" and have grown in leaps and bounds. Whereas in the past when I've been in programs in college for various certificates/diplomas I could cope with it just well enough to get through the program and then went on to have nervous breakdowns. Now not only am I a lot mentally sturdier but I'm going into education for a diploma that I have previous work experience in and feel very confident about. 

The only thing is that my mom and I are very close, probably too close I guess. She doesn't have friends and neither do I and she's retired and I currently don't work. Now that school is about to start she's getting really moody and distant, just when I was hoping I could rely on her for that bit of extra support. Upon reflecting I've realized she's done this my entire life. Every time I would get a job somewhere making minimum wage she would always ask me tons of questions about it and point out all the things that are stressful with the job and sort of egg me on to quit. Every time I've been in school she gets really grumpy and essentially withdraws almost all support and doesn't talk to me as much. 

I think she worries I'll abandon her or something, which won't happen. But I  really need more independence. There's this extra layer of stress and worry over everything when I'm already predisposed to dealing with stress very poorly. Even though she complains all the time about me not working (rightly so tbh) she treats me SO MUCH BETTER when I'm totally dependent on her.

Her boyfriend will likely be moving to another country back to his family very soon. She has told me about the BPD favorite person concept so I'm vaguely familiar with it. She also has schizophrenia and occasionally hallucinates if she doesn't feel grounded. Since her boyfriend will be leaving and she relies on him a lot, she will be struggling a LOT. Not being able to pay bills, hallucinations, breakdowns, and more.

I don’t know what to do. Should I choose to be mentally stable or should I keep my current major and keep myself more depressed than I already am?

During class today (he's my age- 17) he told me to 'be nice' to him because he had just learned a close friend of his had committed suicide. He did seem a bit off during the lesson, but when I asked him how he was and if he needed support etc. he said he was okay and didn't need anything. He was not visibly upset but I could tell that this affected him. How could I support him through this time? How can I be helpful but not annoying? 


I don't want to sound annoying or provocative, but I don't want him to get into a bad headspace. How would I best do this? I was thinking of asking him 'how are you feeling after hearing the news?' And stuff but I don't want to get too involved in it, in case he gets annoyed with me.

I’d only been looking for like a month and a half. Before then my last job was in February and I’ve gone through a few jobs since we’ve been dating, so I’ve been employed for most of the time. I’m also taking 5 online classes. He doesn’t do anything all day except play video games/his guitar and smoke. When his friend/bandmate hits him up they’ll go up to his friends lake house to work on their music like once a month for a few days. They’ve been “taking their music seriously” since we started dating but I never saw any progress cuz they both half ass it most of the time. 

He also never really introduced me to any of his friends despite meeting all of his friends gf’s and hanging out together with them and their gf’s on multiple occasions. I felt so left out of his social circle.

Hi guys! So recently me and my girlfriend broke up, she was going through depression and having family issues and being in a relationship was not in her or my interest as we both had our problems that we had to fix alone. It was mutual but I still feel odd, I didn’t expect to feel this sad and this alone. For so long of my life I have been alone and relationship free, I liked it, I had so much time for me and my friends and I felt free. I got into this relationship like 2 years ago, my freshman year of high school, and at the beginning it was fun, and exciting; but overtime I lost interest I missed being single, I just thought of it as my natural state. I was messing up in my relationship and it was crumbling, i wanted out for a little while and I didn’t know how to do it. Then it finally snapped and we lost each other. I was expecting to be sad, I wanted to be relieved and feel free. But know I feel hollow, empty, like a large piece of me was ripped away from my soul.  I’ve cried more than I have ever before, I don’t understand why this is happening. I hate this feeling I have in my chest and my mind, it’s numbing and it’s stopping me from being happy. The only way I mask it is by playing with friends, but once there gone the feeling is back. I can’t vibe to music, I can’t shower without crying, I can’t workout with effort. I’ve lost it. Why is this happening? Is this some kind of stage? Will it pass? I really do miss her :( but I know it’s for the best. Any advice please, before this feeling consumes me.",23Sep2020,1

275,"My break lasted 6 months. *6 months.* I couldn't even finish a single book, or start more than one. 

Still, I have the audacity to tell people that I love reading. The audacity to go to bookstores, buy new books knowing I will never have the will to read them, and then they collect dust on my bookshelf. I do it with everything. I buy games that I play for 5 seconds before completely losing any ounce of dedication I had. I buy art materials that sit around because I never manage to muster up the will to get off my ass and fucking use them. I buy courses, telling myself, ""I'll learn anatomy!"", and then those courses go unseen and unwatched, because I realize that it takes effort to watch, and to read, and to learn - so I don't. Instead, I sit at my desk, staring endlessly into a void of nothingness.

My life is holding on by a *thread*. My self-esteem is plummeting by the day and by god is it lonely here. I'm taking University courses I'm not really passionate about, for the sake of, ""Figuring out what I want to do"". I can't get through the assigned readings though, I can barely pay attention. I'm living with a relative, I say until I graduate, but I keep wondering, ""How long before I'm a burden?"". Because everyday I wonder when it is that I'm going to fail my University courses, and get dropped by my sponsorship. Without a sponsorship, my tuition and living doesn't get paid. Without payment, I can't continue to pay rent or attend University. Without rent I'm kicked out, I go back home to my fun family toxic environment, probably become an alcoholic and rot away. 

For a while I used other people to feel safer about my future. Truth is, I don't know what I'm going to do. I don't know how I can live without a degree of somekind, and I don't know if I can ever get a degree without any passion for any of the subjects.

276,"So I'm a girl in my junior year of highschool. To put it bluntly, I hate living in my house. My parents are both very toxic and I also dislike them as people. I also have a 5 year old sister. My mother is on the overprotective side and grew up very sheltered. She did not move out for college and only moved out when she married my father. She wants me to follow this and stay home during college by going to a community college, and then to the same college she went to which is 40 minutes away.

Today we got into an argument, and at one point I asked her how much money was in my college fund. She weaseled around the answer but told me there's next to nothing. I've been alive for 17 years and they've always talked about my college fund, and now I find out there is no money in it.

I intended to audition for some of the more prestigious music schools for vocal performance, but I have no college fund, and will receive minimal help from FAFSA due to being middle class and white, and I'm too busy to work during school as I'm taking all AP classes.

My mom later implied there was once money but it was taken out for some reason.

I am now considering getting married when I turn 18 so that I can be counted as independent by FAFSA and receive good financial aid from colleges. 


My long term and long distance boyfriend's parents know about my situation and have offered to let me live with them while paying minimal rent after I graduate. I am considering taking up this offer, marrying my boyfriend for financial aid (and signing a prenup), taking a gap year while I save up money working, and then going to college. 

So I guess what I'm asking is, how do I move out?

TLDR: shitty parents blocking me from moving out, mom reveals the college fund I thought existed, doesnt. considering moving across country and marrying to receive financial aid. how do I move out when I turn 18 and graduate?",23Sep2020,1

She doesn’t know this, bc I don’t wanna scare her off or make her think I’m weird, but I’ve been battling attachment issues with her for as long as I can remember even noticing it. she’s just been acting like a mother to me than my own mom has ever been and has treated me with so much love and care I’ve never really had. I love her hugs bc it makes me feel so safe and I just love being by her all the time. whenever I get the chance I always give her a huge hug or cuddle up by her. lately I’ve spent less time and have said no when she offers for me to come over. which is huge of me bc I’d always say yes and would drop everything &amp; be there in an instant. but now I always find myself going back to my routine of constantly wanting to be around her &amp; constantly craving her hugs. it’s kinda annoying bc I’ve worked so hard to stop this attachment cycle but like I can’t. 

also, would it be weird to tell her about it one day? she has said in the past that she absolutely loves me and when I’m around and I’m always welcome in her home and that she depends on me &amp; we need each other. sounds weird but from a grieving standpoint it helps to know I always have someone to rely on.",23Sep2020,1

298,"(tw: death, cancer, hospital) this is a long post i’m sorry 
in may 2018 my grandpa was diagnosed again with esophageal cancer, except the doctors found it too late. the doctors said there was nothing they could do except make him comfortable at home. every weekend toward the end of my junior year of high school and throughout the entire summer, my family drove to coney island to spend time with him and help him out. with every increasing visit, i watched him get worse and worse. he lost so much weight. he was so skinny. it started off with him being winded with a cough, then he lost his voice, next on oxygen, then bedridden. i watched him slowly pass away and i remember the last time i saw him laying in his bed, he was so cold and was shaking and i gave him a hug. he passed 8/15/18 (i was 17). shortly after, my grandma got diagnosed with bladder cancer. i was told this cancer is treatable, however, hers was out of control. it spread everywhere and she was in really bad shape for a long time. she had bags for her waste because she had to get her bladder and bowels removed. but the hospital gave her the wrong bags and they burst and it made her get an awful infection. i was in and out of hospitals and ICUs visiting her. her infection was fungal and it was like a hallucinagen so it’s like she was trapped in a dream (what the doctors described it as) she was in so much pain constantly. unlike my grandpa, all i heard was her screaming, groaning, and moaning in pain. i watched her cry and get worse and worse. she also got so skinny and died on 12/26/19 (my 19th birthday). both of their deaths hit me so hard because my grandpa was my father figure and my grandma felt like a mom to me. i loved them so much. watching them slowly die and have these horrific moments in hospitals and at the house hurt. i think about it so much and just recently i can’t stop. it makes me super sad and anxious and makes me not want to get close to anyone. the more i type this the more i figure i should be in therapy not on reddit (lol). but am i traumatized? if not, what would you call how i’m feeling? how can i ease these feelings and let them pass?",23Sep2020,1

303,"To give context on who is in the story, My SO (18M), myself (17F), Marie (early twenties, not her actual name), Marie's Brother (early twenties), My online friends. 

So last Sunday, My parents agreed to give me some cash, to get a second hand phone online. Despite myself not comfortable with that idea, as second hand phones could have some underlying problems, I decided to go with it. I went to this online app, and found a phone that was listed as $450. Cool, the listing stated that the phone was in 10/10 condition, I messaged Marie for her best price. Marie replied and said she can do $430 if we deal on the same day. So we agreed to meet in the late afternoon (close to evening) at a public transport area (and do note that it was an hour and a half journey there), met her with my SO, saw the phone, checked everything except the LCD (which unfortunately slipped my mind). Do keep note that I took some time to do so. So I paid, and went my merry way home.

By the time I reached home, it was already pretty late, so I done some studying and went to sleep. The next day (Monday), I head to school, had school from morning to 6pm. After managing to reach home, wash up and all, do my work. After some time, I finally had the time to set up my phone which was late night, around 12am+. I downloaded some apps, put in my data etc. So then, I decided to put a white wallpaper, and afterwards I noticed something weird. It was then I saw a burn screen of some app, with words like ""drop off"" and some other stuff (which I found out to be Grab ride waiting screen/ Grab food delivering screen, this will come in important later). So, upon discovery, I immediately messaged Marie, about the burnscreen issue, due to myself not informed about it (which I calculated which was 1 day and 8 hours later). Do note that I didn't check as thoroughly as I should (as I trusted her on her quote 10/10 condition). 

She saw it in the morning, first said it could be the screen protector, and I needed to clean the screen. It was not, and I showed her multiple pictures to circle the burnscreen marks on the screen. After, proving to her that it wasn't the screen protector, she said it was my fault that I caused this, and that she said that it was in perfect condition before I had it. I then asked her multiple times, asking if she did actually do a lcd test, because certain screen burns can hide in bright coloured backgrounds, dark background etc. She constantly avoided it, and kept explaining she doesn't won't do a refund as she claimed it was in perfect condition. She also kept saying that I've checked the lcd, even though I told her multiple times that I did not(this is my bad), and my SO was watching me as a witness. She kept dismissing me, kept saying "" the phone was in good condition, don't do refundss"", and got angry with me first, which I got angry and frustrated in return. Afterwards, she ghosted me for a while. 

Feeling upset, I called one of my online friends later in the morning (I skipped school that day), and after talking for awhile, he asked me to see closer on what app screen was it. Do note, I only used this phone to play among us, put in my bank details, and some other apps (which does not include using delivery or ride services). Upon closer inspection, I realised it was a Grab ride / Grab Food delivery screen whereas the person was either waiting for the ride or food, or actually the one delivering the food / giving a ride. I was pissed. The last time I touched Grab was 7 days prior, and there was NO way I caused it. I took a screenshot of my activity on Grab (and just an FYI for people who don't use Grab, u can deliver things, give a ride, get a ride, get food etc, and also you can't delete the activity you've done in Grab) . I tried to contact her and asked Marie for a refund or at least a partial refund to fix the lcd, because there was no way I caused it (do note that it has to take a lot of time on that very screen and possibly be in the burning sun in order to get that screen burn). No reply. 

I contacted support for the App, but they couldn't really intervene because it was a private transaction, and they have limited ways to intervene. The support tried reaching out to her, but no reply too. So the only thing I could do was to report to the police about this case. I did a last ditch effort, and told her that, hey u sold to me this phone under the pretense that it was in perfect condition, and I only agreed because of that, and if not I'll report this to the police and try to settle this issue. Marie did reply with ""you have no solid evidence blah blah"", and said that it was unfair to her because I took more than a day to inform her. And she went ghost afterwards. I took the necessary screenshots and went to report it to the police. 

They recorded down the case, but told me that this is a hard case to pursue to get a refund unless I pursue legal action which then again, have no clear cut ending of whether I would get back the money, and hey legal action is expensive. I felt extremely upset afterwards that I was unlikely to get the money back (I also topped up money with my own cash). I tried reaching her again, explaining to her that it was really irresponsible of her selling the phone with or without knowing its condition, and that I would be totally fine with a partial refund. (and just for your information, afterwards, i went to several second hand shops, and they said that it is worth a $150, and the retail price for a perfect condition for this handphone model was $320, which means I paid about retail price.) 

Marie replied again, and said it was unfair for her even though I tried to explain my situation, now said to let the police settle this issue and stop replying since. I feel pretty defeated about it, and now I feel bad that I did the police report because it would be recorded and be on her record, and now I feel that if I didn't do the report, and became angry with her after she dismissed me many times that she won't do the refund or even partial, and got angry with her, there might still be a chance that I could get a refund. I feel that it was my fault for landing in this situation, as I got frustrated quite easily, and the situation would have turned out differently if I was much more civil. 

Any advice?",23Sep2020,1
304,"Hi all, didn't think I'd be posting to reddit on a throwaway account but I'm out of options, and I'm beyond concerned about her and I don't know where else to turn, so I figure strangers on the internet might know.

I'm going to keep the backstory brief. I'm 22/m dating a 21/f long-distance. We've met multiple times on visits, and we have plans to eventually advance our relationship into something permanently physical. But at this time, our relationship is long distance, and we live in totally different states on totally different sides of the USA. So in terms of physically helping her out doing anything, I am unable. 

Recently, and since we started dating, she's taken a very quiet approach towards her health. She doesn't share much about the things she deals with to me, which I have respected for the most part, as I find that so long as it is not fatal, it isn't any of my business to try and pry her to discuss something she is uncomfortable with or ashamed of. But I can share two specific things about her, that she often times will vent to me about, despite that she otherwise does not share much, and they are 

1) she gets excruciatingly bad headaches/migraines, and 

2) she gets excruciatingly bad stomach pain, which she refers to as her ""guts.""

The complicated part of this is that she is unable to see a doctor. She currently does not work or make income, and within her household, she is not provided health insurance from her parents. Her parents choose not to get health insurance for their child, and it's been this way for a lot of her life. She doesn't go on physicals, she doesn't have routine checkups, and she is unable to diagnose any of the issues she is frequently dealing with.

I've tried to discuss the ways she could potentially get health insurance so she could see a doctor and get the help she needs, but she has argued with me about how much she is against the concept of paying for insurance if ""she doesn't need it.""

She told me today that for the past two weeks, she has been dealing with constant stomach pain, non-stop. She has been eating less and less as time goes on as she feels that is the problem, when it absolutely is not. She eats probably one meal a day if not less, and almost every time she eats she gets massive cramping afterwards. 

But, every time we discuss this, she tells me, ""I'm fine."" She doesn't want to talk about it.

Her statement after telling me that she's been having constant pain for such a long period of time was, ""well, I guess I'm just going to die or something.""

I don't want to accept it. She refuses to get any help or do any research or figure out what might be wrong with her and I have no idea if what she's dealing with could potentially be fatal or damaging in the long term. She refuses to tell me more information about it besides that she is in pain. So I am at a loss. I'm unable to provide her any sort of health insurance because she lives in another state and we are not married. Is there anything I can do? Is there anybody I can turn to?",23Sep2020,1

So we’re all drinkin and chillin at clay’s house and having a pretty good time none of us really got like fucked up cuz we all had work tomorrow so we were just buzzin. And me and my boyfriend are cuddling on the bed and then jimmy slides behind my boyfriend so jimmy is the big spoon and my bf is the little spoon (ass and ween not touching ofc) and then he starts to caress my hair n shit and then a few moments pass and he slips down grabs my ass and then just keeps his hand there. I was like “yo thats my ass” and my boyfriend was shocked and didn’t know what to do i just pushed his hand off and was like no. Immediately after i acknowledged it and brought it to their attention Jimmy started acting blackout drunk out of nowhere and it had at least been 2-3 hours since we drank and he keeps saying he needs a girlfriend in the fake wasted voice (y’all know what im talking ab). Jimmy also knows about my ex sexually assaulting me because he was one of my closest friends and he grabbed MY ass in front of His best friend (aka my boyfriend). a few days have passed and Jimmy has pretended like nothing has happened and i dont know what to do about it because it made me really uncomfortable and like i see him differently now but like Jimmy is my boyfriend’s best friend and he’s not happy about what Jimmy did but he still wants to be friends with him.

314,"I'm in a weird position where I did a bachelor's in IT, but then had a chance to study abroad with some friends. However the particular school didn't really offer any technical or true business type majors. The closest to my interests was a master's in communication because it had a digital media.

Fast forward 5 years, I'm a sysadmin doing lots of powershell automation and devops work, looking to go into my next role within devops. I've been keeping the master's off my resume but a friend told me I should put it back on.

What do you think? Would it add value to my resume, or possibly take away (maybe HR will skim and not even realize that I also have a bachelor's in IT). Or it will just make me look weird. I know communication, documentation, being able to put together presentations, etc is a good skill in this field, and any master's should in theory give me some small points, maybe?

316,"For background, I am a second year undergraduate college student and I am currently looking for a volunteer research position in a lab or facility. So I'm not applying for an official job, I'm just reaching out to look for volunteer research experience. The thing is, I made up an extracurricular on my resume (volunteer tutor/mentor with an educational student org at my college) and I never took it off for a couple months.

I don't know why I did it. It's not something I even needed to do. I did it out of desperation, not out of deception. I recently sent this resume to a research facility inquiring about a volunteer research position, and I have an interview with them next week. It's now hitting me that what if they call the stuff listed on my resume to verify my extracurriculars and that one fake volunteer role comes to bite my back (There isn't any contact information for my listed experience on the resume though so I think they would need that information from me. There also isn't any formal application as I am inquiring about a volunteer research position). 

I know what I did was wrong, and I will never blindly write a lie like that on my resume ever again. I'm just really worried now because this was my top choice for starting research that I've been looking for a while now, and theres a chance I may have just thrown that away because of my stupid mistake. If that's the case I will have paid for my mistake.

318,"Hello, I’m not quite sure where else to post this, so I hope this is okay.
For context, I’m 15 and Jake is almost 19.
I’m sorry if there are lots of spelling errors, I haven’t slept at all since yesterday.
I’m sorry if it’s difficult to read this, I’m a bit of a mess at the moment so some things might not make any sense.

For the sake of staying anonymous I’ll just refer to him as Jake. This is mostly because of privacy reasons and the fact that they’re on reddit regularly and I don’t want to risk them finding this post and linking it back to me.

So, I have been friends with Jake for around 3 or so years, and things started to go down hill about a year and a half ago. Before all of this we were great friends and didn’t have any problems at all, which is why I’m hesitating on trying to remove him from my life, even if it’s in a peaceful way. 

I have a lot going on in my life, recent deaths, severe depression and suicidal thoughts for years, physical bullying, mental scars, other mental issues and much more. I have been extremely stressed out this entire year and it keeps getting worse. I’m always helping other friends with any problems they have (family issues, death, etc.), and I don’t mind that since I want to help them, but it’s as though I’m a magnet for these kinds of people. 

Almost every single friend I have has something going on in their life, and I know that’s not their fault but it seems like practically every single one of them vents to me about it. I already have a lot going on in my life (a lot more than what I listed) and this is just stressing me out more. The main issue is that Jake has been talking to me about his depression, family issues and more for the past year and a half, and I don’t mind that but he doesn’t listen to anything I say. I’m always trying to help him in any way I can by suggesting things like therapy, telling an adult about the bullying, etc but he doesn’t even try to help his situation. 
For example, no matter what kind of therapy I suggest he’ll always say no. It doesn’t matter if the therapy is affordable, online, anonymous, free, good or not, he’ll say no regardless. And the thing is that I’m obviously not qualified to be helping him with some of his issues as I just don’t know how to properly help, but even when I suggest things to him so that he can get the proper professional help he needs, he’ll deny it anyways.
He also constantly talks about how if I block him, stop talking to him, etc that he’ll cut himself, kill himself, harm his family members and much more. He always guilt trips me into playing video games with him online, which causes me to spend multiple hours online with him. I have no time to relax during the day, so I stay up way too late so that I can have some time to myself. I know this isn’t healthy but he takes up practically every second of the day for me and I’m tired of it. I want to have at least an hour or two of time to myself where I can just do something relaxing like watch a movie or play a video game I actually enjoy instead of the same one every time.

Like I said, I’m always trying to help him but he never listens. His grandma is a very rude, abusive and narcissistic woman who is rarely ever kind to him, and she always guilt trips him and his mother. Like with everything else going on in his life, and constantly rants and vents about her, and that’s fine, but he still won’t listen to me. I often tell him that he should try to secretly record her acting out so that he’ll have proof in case she ever does something bad to him or his mother, but he always says no. When I tell him to confront her about her negative attitudes, he always says that he can’t because “she’s a part of my family, I can’t do that to her.” She has done a LOT of terrible things that technically could land her a spot in jail, but even then, he always does nothing about it and then rants to me the next day. Everyday, he’ll spend hours ranting about something, I’ll respond and help him in every way possible that’s within my abilities, he’ll disagree with everything and then spam me with “let’s play ___ today!” or just more ranting. Hours later and I’m now trying to sleep, I’ll usually fall asleep very late, usually between 3 and 6 am. The next day I’ll wake up, check my messages and find that he has once again complained and ranted about the exact same thing. No matter what I do to try and help him, he just never listens to my advice. 

I have around 8 or so friends online that I speak to on a regular basis. And 6 of them are depressed and or have something serious going on in their lives. I’m trying to help all of them at once which is causing me to neglect my own mental and physical health. But even so, I still talk to every single one of them daily so that I can try to make them feel better. Because even if I’m upset, the least I could try to do was make someone else happy. I don’t want to talk about too many of the details but there’s a lot of disturbing things going on in some of their households, so I have been trying my best to help them in any way I can.
I want to help Jake, I really do, but he just won’t let me. He guilt trips me into spending time with him, threatens me, tries to suicide and self harm bait me and much worse. 

I was only slightly depressed beforehand but now I’m extremely depressed again. 
I have been depressed and sad for years now, and about two years ago I had finally convinced my mom to homeschool me so that I could avoid all of the bullies, rude and unnecessarily cruel teachers, etc. This ended up working a lot better than I had expected as I immediately felt relieved and happier. I did the work I was given without complaining as I enjoyed learning about all sorts of topics, I worked on improving my mental health and I tried my best to prove to my mom that homeschooling me would get rid of my depression, and it did. I felt much better within days of being homeschooled. I was extremely happy and stress free, I could happily work on my education without worrying about someone throwing something at me on my way home or just straight up physically assaulting me. 

But Jake has ruined all of this happiness for me, I don’t want to sound dramatic but I don’t have the motivation to do anything anymore. I often feel like cutting again, I can’t even cry about it because I don’t want to burden anyone with my problems and Jake doesn’t care. Everything is always about him no matter the situation. I try to do the things I usually would to make myself feel better, but it doesn’t help at all. I feel miserable and I feel like crying. I tried so hard to finally be happy again, and within months of finally achieving that my depression came back. I feel like all of my positive progress has just gone backwards. 

There’s a lot more going on that I can’t talk about or else he would definitely know who I am, but I am extremely depressed and I don’t know what to do anymore. I often talk to my mom about this and she always says that I should just block him, slowly disappear from his life, etc. But I feel like I can’t do that, I feel like he’ll kill himself if I stop talking to him, and he knows my full name and the country I live in. I haven’t told him my exact location or county, but it still worries me that he would try to find out where I live. Not to mention the fact that this wouldn’t be too difficult for him as he lives in the country that’s literally RIGHT next to mine, it wouldn’t be difficult for him to fly over here at all. And there’s no way to get through to him, he never listens to others opinions on anything. And the thing is, when he isn’t ranting or fighting, he’s a genuinely nice person. I occasionally give me baking recipes and he makes them with his mom and then shows me the results. It’s just that his negativity is beginning to get unbearable and it’s dragging me down as well. It took ages for me to get to a stage where I was content with my life, and it was ruined in less than a month.

I understand that it’s not his fault that all these things are happening to him, but it bothers me because he never takes any of the advice I give him into consideration. No matter what I do, he always acts like I’m not even trying to help him at all. He’s extremely rude and aggressive when he’s angry too, which is often. He expects me to always be available, even when I’m busy. I don’t know what to do anymore, I know him, and I know for a fact that if I block him, ignore him or tell him I don’t want to be friends anymore, he’ll probably try to get revenge somehow. He always does these things, for example, he attempted to ruin his ex girlfriend's life (it didn’t end up working) just because she broke up with him. I know for a fact that he’ll probably try to blackmail me, spread nasty rumors about me (he has a lot of followers on almost every single account he owns so these rumors would spread like a wildfire), talk badly about me, etc. He also knows about every single account I own, so he’ll probably bring his negativity there too so that he can properly get “revenge” as he puts it. 

I’m not sure what to do anymore, should I block him on every account, change my username? I don’t know what to do to solve all of this without having some sort of karma. I know that this isn’t his fault, but I only started getting depressed again because of him. Am I overreacting or should I continue to speak to him?

321,"Hello. 

Recently I had to record a video of myself giving a speech, a story specifically, for one of my classes. I had to go back and listen to it and I realize I sounded like a robot. English is not my first language, my speech was in English, the whole thing just sounded boring and I literally had a monotone.

So, I asked my bf if I sound like a robot when I talk to him normally, he said I usually sound sleepy. I talk softly most of the time. I actually try to use higher and lower tone when I speak in English but I guess it isn’t working. 

I had a surgery in my throat when I was 3 and I suspect that they fucked my vocal cord up somehow since my throat start to hurt and taste like blood if I talk for too long or too loud.

325,"Hello all,

I am in some extreme confusion and pain.

1. I'm dating a **person1** (of 3 years, started dating in high school) who cheated on me three times, and is trying to make it work. (Let me note that it is kind of a mess. The first time (which I guess I consider cheating) is when **person1** said they wanted to hook up with this person (**person2**) if they meet us in college, even though I was still dating them. **Person1** admitted to cheating on me two more times with **person2** while we were together (Its kind of mess. If you want me to spill the tea on that, let me know). However, they still want to be friends with **person2**, which makes me *extremely* insecure, and I let them know that. **Person1**'s excuse for still wanting to be friends with **person2** is that **person2** is ""really in love with some other person"", that **person1** and **person2** have known each other longer than I have known/dated **person1**, and that **person1** cares (""and has sacrificed"") so much for **person2**. **Person2** is even a *known* cheater: they cheated on their past two ex's. I don't have it in me to break up with **person1** because: I am/kind of in love with them still after that, I'm scared of what will happen to them if I do, and I'm very hopeful that things might work out. But they have recently done nothing for me. I don't feel loved by them. Plus, its long distance now because they switched colleges. I'm also very, *very* scared of being alone. My problem is trying to find it in myself to do so because its going to take a lot for me to do it. Do I even try to break up with them?
2. There is a friend who I've been talking to for years now, of whom I met my freshman year in college. I think I've recently started to fall in love with them - or maybe I did a long time ago and have started to admit it to myself. I know they are way way out of my league. At the very least I believe we are good friends. We talk a lot, we hang out a bunch, and we have a great time together. But its just *different* with them. I even weirdly remember everything I do with them, and enjoy all of it. Especially the first time I saw them :this is a guess because our face was covered, but it was like time slowed down, it was snowing, we had our scarfs covering our face, and I just saw their eyes, but something about them just radiated at me, and my heart skipped a beat. That is just so weird, that never happens. I've just been putting all this aside because I'm currently in a relationship. With them I can't even imagine being able to date, let a lone be in a relationship, with them. But its just like... what if? What if it can work out? What if they would go on a date with me? I know damn well I would actually be so damn happy. With this, though, would come the sacrifice with my current relationship.

If both fail... I would just be stuck in this pit of loneliness that I don't have the strength to get out of. I sacrificed my support system (some of my friends and family relationships) for the person I am dating right now (**person1**). I sacrificed so much for them. I don't want to lose them. For asking out my friend who I like: what if I just completely ruin my relationship with them by doing so.

Just know I'm no cheater. I refused to think about doing anything of the sort, but I have only recently started feeling things for my friend when I learned that **person1** had cheated on me. Am I cheating? I hate myself for even thinking about it.

**TL;DR;** 1. I am figuring out if/how I should break up with a cheater (**person1**) who wants things to work out, even though they want to stay friends with the person (**person2**) they cheated on me with. 2. I am falling in love with somebody who I think I have no chance with. Is it worth throwing away my current relationship (which I am trying to figure out myself) for them?",23Sep2020,1

I ask because I often eat till I feel sick because I over ate. Up till last month whenever I felt I ate too much I would throw some of it up (and I know I don’t have bulimia because I didn’t throw up all the time).

336,"Hey reddit, sorry if it's not the most interesting story and for any possible mistakes but english is not my first language. This is the first time I've posted anything on reddit but I don't really know what to do and I wanted some advice from people with some distance to the situation for another perspective. 

For a bit of context, I (F22) had a previous relationship that was emotionally and mentally abusive, I was only with that guy for around 9 months but in the end it felt like years. I had absolutely no sense of self and would've done anything just to make him happy, he made me feel like whatever I did was not enough but would tell me that he wouldn't break up with me because he believed I could be better and get on his level. I moved away for college and didn't really tell my family anything was wrong but when I came home for vacation they started to notice how I had lost a lot of weight, I was extremely stressed and anxious and so they took me to a doctor who helped me break up with him and I ended up having to go to therapy.

Fast forward two years, I'm a lot better from that situation but a few of the traumas still arise from time to time, I started dating this guy (who lived in the city where I went for college) who treated me like the complete opposite of the previous one, he made me feel like a princess; he knew about my past and respected my space and helped me in any way he could. He was a sweetheart, all was well up until last week when I had to go there for a week to take care of a few things for college and stayed with him,  when I was out he asked if he could use my computer to watch netflix (he lives alone and doesn't have a tv). I said of course because I trusted him and was even considering leaving my computer when I left the city until I went back for classes so that he would have something to watch. 

When I got home he had already left for work and I went into the computer history to get the link from the site I was watching movies in and found that he had been going through my facebook messages. He opened about 54 different conversations. I felt like I got hit by a truck, I couldn't believe that he had done that. I trusted him with my computer and he violated not only my privacy as well as 54 other people's. I waited until he got home to talk and when I confronted him at first he said he didn't do it, that it wasn't him and why did I not trust him? I told him I wanted to but there was no other explanation other then he had done it. After a while he stared to confess saying that he had been cheated on in the past and that he was overcome with something that make him do it. 

We talked for a long time, dicided I would think about it and then dicide what to do and he respected that, and now I'm back home and will only go back in a few weeks. I'm very confused and I don't know what to do. I don't want to make the same mistakes as I did before and let this go but I also don't want to over react, I have never treated him differently because of my previous experience so he shouldn't either, besides I never gave him reason to doubt me, which  hurts even more because I can't understand why he would do this. I think I'll most likely break up with him because I can't trust him now and to other people what he did might not be as bad but for me, with what I've been through, I just can't let this go, everytime I think about it I cry and I don't want that to be my situation. Not again.

Help me reddit, am I overreacting? Am I not? I don't know how to proceed.. ( and btw sorry for the long post) thank you!",23Sep2020,1
337,"Hey reddit, 

As I write this, it’s 2:45 AM and I’m on my couch in the living room. I’m angry because I have to start getting ready for work at 6 AM and I was woken up to the sound of my fiancé closing the bedroom door. I told him that he does that a lot and that it wakes me up when he does it to which he replied “well what do you want me to do? I had really bad heartburn.” I feel bad that he was feeling bad but I also find what he did to be inconsiderate. 

We live in an older house so the door doesn’t latch very well(you have to push the door UP so that it’ll close)  and it’s loud when you close it. My fiancé has Wednesdays and Saturdays off and he tends to do this a lot on these days. This is something I’ve had an issue with since we got together and it’s getting to the point where I’d like to suggest separate beds unless it’s fixed. If I’m woken up and I’ve had a couple of hours, it’s usually very difficult for me to go back to sleep. My body thinks I’m “up.” I also have a heart condition called POTS and it gets worse if I haven’t had a full nights rest. It becomes difficult for me to talk to him about it because I’m sleep deprived the day after, angry, and I’m focused on my heart sucking so I just don’t say anything. Sometimes I have had to call in because I don’t feel comfortable driving in this state. When I think about it, I get really angry and I have a difficult time thinking of a way to express myself that wouldn’t end up with us fighting.

Other than asking for separate sleep spaces I don’t know what to do. Please help.",23Sep2020,1
339,"I'm in high school. I have social anxiety and basically everyone in the group can relate. We're all very introverted people, except one person. He's the word glue that keeps the conversation going. I don't really understand him though. He's always calling out tiny mistakes. When I say something 'clumsy' for example, something most people would just let go, he calls it out. Everyone else in the group gets that sometimes stuff is phrased wrongly but he makes a deal out of it. He is hypocritical and he says one thing one day and another the next but nobody ever calls him out on that. I think it all in my head but there's no way I could ever say it out loud. I don't think it's personal because he does it to most of us but 90% of the time I'm the target because the rest is very quiet and doesn't really open their mouth in the first place. Also, he switches so fast. If I've come home crying because of something he said (haven't cried in front of him yet lol) I'll come to school the next day and be greeted with a wave and a smile by him.

I have no clue how to deal with him as an anxious and extremely sensitive person. I'm very intimidated by him because of his directness. Many occasions I have come home from school crying because of him. On the other hand I know I don't have to care this much. I really don't know what to do and at this point I'm just walking on eggshells around him in an attempt not to be the target of his unpredictable outbursts. I don't know how to stop taking this personally and if I ever will.

There's another part of the story. He's been diagnosed with autism. He's literally (if he actually meant it literally is something else) said that he doesn't really care how people feel. He doesn't think it's his problem when he's made someone cry. He has a point there I guess, he doesn't say things to make people cry and like he would never ever bully somebody. But sometimes I don't know if he realises that it might hurt people or isn't really necessary. I feel like he's pretty clueless but masks it with fake confidence or something. For this reason I don't think I could ever really get close to him. I need to have an idea of how somebody's gonna respond to something I say and I just don't

I don't really know if approaching this proactively as in directly talking to him about this is going to be possible. I feel this is something I can work on. It makes it hard that there is no other friend group at school, the what eight of us are literally the entire class. And I love everybody else, I just don't know how to deal with him.",23Sep2020,1

First off water is just not going to cut it okay a lot of people say just use water and you will be fine you have to do a lot more than that lol! 

First: Get some soap on ur rag and only wipe the LIPS of ur kitty NEVER get soap INSIDE ur vagina that a NO NO ! 

Second: Make sure your getting water in ur vagina so its all wet now take a different rag or just wipe all the soap off the rag completely and put the rag in one finger so Ur getting in there! Then begin to wipe gently in ur vagina and make sure ur getting the inside of the lips also! so everywhere 

Tips; ( When wiping the inside of ur lips make sure ur going up then wiping down ) to get all that cum or anything that hiding in the lips !!! that could be making ur vagina smell. 

Also dont think ur kitty needs to smell like berrys or all this other kinds of stuff because it doesnt all vaginas have a NATURE smell so ur vagina should smell nature not funky or strong or of fish . 

 You NEED to be eating healthy foods and drinking LOTS of water a cup a day and even more thats really going to make you have a great smelling kitty and healthy !

If ur sleeping with someone you need to make sure there washing there privates!! Because one your going to get affections and a whole bunch of other stuff thats going to make ur vagina smell .",23Sep2020,1

They've bitten me with a seeming intent to kill, definitely not play fighting, but most annoying is the non-stop earpericing barking. On top of that the psychological effects of having Satans stalk you while you're gardening/cooking never knowing when the next bark/bite is going to happen is horrible.

They were abused by their previous owners and are hazardous to take on walks, so they never got the chance to socialise. Because of the abuse my girlfriend's family doesn't want to discipline them either.

i'm a really introverted person in general and i don't really like to talk to a lot of people, but at the same time i don't like being alone. it's hard to say that i'm depressed, because i've never been properly diagnosed or anything, but it's sometimes hard to get up. i would rather sleep in for 18+ hours instead of spending the entire day being sad.

however, i have this one friend (online\*) that i'm really close to. i find myself getting up at proper times and having a fixed schedule just so i can be with her. i gained my hobbies back, i started being productive again and i look forward to tomorrows because i know i'll be spending it with her someway or another. there's a lot more, but in conclusion, i am happy. happier than i've been in a long time.

she took a break from the internet recently and i realized that, i'm just a very small part of her life. there's nothing i can do to keep our friendship forever. she's saved me so much, it scares me. during this break, i finally realized that i would be back to the complete mess i was without her. even now, i can't help but feel anxious and scared that it was something that i did wrong that caused her to leave for a while.

i think i already kind of knew this. i know, i'm emotionally dependant on her. but i just don't know what to do. it just feels like i love her so much more than i love myself. how can i start to rely on myself to be happy?

354,"Backstory: my boyfriend, his dad, and I all like in a two bed apartment on the first floor of a medium sized apartment complex.the complex goes in a square around a water retention area surrounded by a fence, with a gravel pathway around it. Each apartment has a little patio that juts out a little bit, so there's barkchips between the wall and the gravel path. My boyfriend's and I's room faces this retention pond area, and there's a tree in front of our window.

So about twenty minutes ago my boyfriend and I were getting intimate in bed. The window was open because it helps with airflow, but the blinds were pulled all the way down and closed. The lights were off. We were being quiet because, well, it's an apartment complex and I don't need everyone to hear our business.

As we were getting to the end we both saw a bright, long flash of light that filled out entire room. Even with the blinds down and closed, there is a sliver of space in the window that you can see into our room. We believe that someone either succeeded or attempted to take our photo.

I'm not exactly sure what to do, if we should tell the manager or what, but I seriously feel uncomfortable sleeping or anything now that that's happened.

If anyone has any advice I would really appreciate it, or even if this isn't really the right subreddit, please direct me somewhere.",23Sep2020,1
355,"Particularly with men. Guys, I’m struggling so bad right now. I (21F) just got out of a relationship with my boyfriend of three years and it hit hard. I miss him of course but he wasn’t very good to me. He took my virginity and ever since then I have severe anxiety involving sex. For the past two years, I can’t do sexual things without having panic attacks or crying. People don’t seem to understand how badly this affects me.


After me and my boyfriend broke up his uncle confessed that he has a crush on me, he’s my mom’s age. I told him that it was okay that he told me that, but that we would never work and that I would rather be upfront about that. I said I won’t make it awkward that he said anything, but we are going to move on from it because I don’t date guys that are 5 years older than me, much less twice my age. I only text with him because I’ve heard him mention to his family that they never reach out and make sure he’s okay. He moved to Denver (the rest of us live in North Carolina) about a year ago and only comes back on holidays cause he’s always working, and apparently people only ever reach out to him if they need money or something. Not me. Even when I was still dating my boyfriend, every now and then I’d text the uncle and ask him if he was okay and if work was going well. I felt that this was appropriate because that’s all we’d talk about. I know how it feels to wonder if people ever care about you specifically, and I didn’t want him to feel like he wasn’t important. So I figured by saying what’s up, how’re you, etc. maybe he’d know he wasn’t alone.
 Since I’m the only person who really ever did that, I guess that’s how the crush developed. It’s sort of like how patients can easily develop crushes on their therapists, caretaker, or doctors. We love when people care about us, it’s natural. Plus, I’m young and beautiful. I explained to him that this was likely where the crush was coming from, because he had asked if I was mad and I didn’t want him to think there would be a problem with him having a crush. I told him I’m glad he told me, but we have identified why he likely feels this way, and this knowledge could help him to move past it. I told him I wasn’t interested but that I appreciated his transparency and there would be no need to feel guilty about how he feels, I won’t mention it to anyone and it could stay between us. I thought that would be the end of it. Nope! Then he got persistent.
 He kept asking why, so I explained the age difference. “Oh but age is just a number,” he would say. So I told him I don’t have sex. Ever. And I never will. And that I know he can’t handle that in a relationship (he always used to date 19-year-olds and I’m pretty sure sex was the only reason), so it would never work. He asked why I’d never have sex in a relationship and I responded “It gives me panic attacks and makes me hyperventilate/cry.” He knows why that happens. And I know he knows why, because when we were still dating, my boyfriend told him about how I respond to sex when he was asking his uncle for advice.
 Then the uncle explains that he could fix the way sex makes me feel and make it all better. Then he asks me what I *like.* I tell him he can ask his nephew if he wants to know so bad and he replies, “I already have asked him.” Then he proceeds to tell me what I like and he gets it *right* which means he *knows.* I felt extremely violated by this point and told him I didn’t like *any of it* and I’m never doing it again even when I marry someone. He insisted that would change and then ended up saying I’d see him on the holidays. I told him I’d probably never see him again now that me and his nephew are broken up. Then he goes, “You will see me.” And ends up saying, “I’m gonna kiss you.” And I said, “Yeah, my ass.” To which he responded, “Tempting.”
 Then he started asking repeatedly if I was mad yet and I ended up asking him if he wanted me to be mad. Was there something about me getting angry that would make this rejection easier for him to deal with? I asked him that and he was like, “No. Maybe so.” 
 
 He ended up changing the subject and the next morning texted me and told me to pretend that entire conversation never happened last night. I said, “We talked last night?” And he said “Nope” with lots of laughing and sticking out tongue emojis. 

 At first I was passive about how I felt. Yeah, he talked about things that made me uncomfortable but I dismissed everything I didn’t like about it by validating how he was feeling, even in my own mind. I didn’t give myself permission to have any feelings regarding it. PLUS, I didn’t see where I had any right to complain because at any point in time I could’ve just shut the conversation down and stopped talking about it. I never did that. And I still feel like I can’t cut him off because then I know I would feel overwhelmingly guilty. I know that would be more detrimental to me than just dealing with him. I don’t want to make him, or anyone, mad or upset with me, and I definitely don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings.
 
 I told my now-ex boyfriend what the uncle said, and he just responded “I’m not surprised.” And then just briefly mentioned that this further proves he can’t trust anyone in his family (his family is crazy and not good to him, long story). He never mentioned how I felt about it or acknowledged that it was wrong, only that he wasn’t surprised and can’t trust. I was hurt that he didn’t even ask how it made me feel or anything, but then again I broke up with him because he never cared about me ever. I asked if the uncle had always been like this, and he said yes. I asked him why he told his uncle the intimate details of our sex life if he knew that the uncle was weird and he just said “I didn’t know-know, but looking back I see the signs. He’s always been this way towards other people so.” Then we dropped it.
 
 THE VERY NEXT DAY, one of my ex’s friends is texting me. I’m still nice to his friends because they became my friends too, and that didn’t end just cause we broke up. One in particular talks to me more than the others, and sometimes we flirt with each other a little bit, just lightheartedly joking around, nothing at all serious. I don’t mind this and last week we both came to the agreement that we weren’t looking for a relationship and that we are just friends playing around. I was thankful for this because it takes a lot of pressure off wondering if the flirting would ever be taken wrong, and this way we could have our playful and occasionally minimally sexual banter. I loved this because I always feel like men are only my friend because they want one thing. And I told him that, and thanked him a ton for wanting to be my friend because many people don’t like me enough for that usually. He assure me I was great and he loved being my friend. Perfect right? Wrong.
 
 So, it’s the day after the uncle tells me to forget about our conversation the night before and I’m texting my ex’s friend like I often do. This friend is Ohio but keeps up with my ex via phone and video games. I’m his friend on PSN and we text on phones. On this particular day, my sister did my make up really nice because she wanted to work on this photography project she saw on Pinterest and recreate some of their photos with me as the subject. I didn’t mind and they turned out really nice. None of them were provocative at all. I was wearing a tank top in them, but it was a modest one. In maybe two of all the pictures, you could see a little bit of cleavage. Not much at all and I have small boobs anyway so it wasn’t much of treat for anyone. Still, my ex’s friend loved them. Our joking back and forth turned very sexually charged very quickly and I joined in at first to have a little fun, but it didn’t take long for me to wish I hadn’t. He ended up saying he wanted me to send pics of myself undressed with my sword (we both collect knives and swords), and that he wanted to send me some pictures too. The more we talked the less we joked and things were getting more serious and I was very uncomfortable. He’s 28 so it’s not as weird as the uncle thing, but I didn’t like it still. If I’d ignore him about wanting to exchange pics, he’d keep bringing it up. Finally I gave him a “maybe” and I hated that because I wanted to say no. I never just say no and I don’t know what’s wrong with me and why I wanna please everyone so much. So he liked that. He kept joking and flirting but also he kept mentioning the pictures. I ended up freezing the whole conversation to tell them that I was getting a little bit on the edge of being uncomfortable and that I LOVE our conversation and the jokes, even the sexual ones, don’t bother me, but that I start to feel pressure (not his fault) whenever the conversation gets too close to more specific, serious things about sex (I meant even the act of exchanging pictures but I didn’t say that so I guess he didn’t understand). He knows why, he knew the whole story of what happened with me and my ex too, just like the uncle did. He knows I cry and panic. I told him my anxiety was starting to come back and that as much as I LOVE the joking and how fun our conversation was, maybe we should calm down a bit. He ended up sympathizing for a little while but then right back to the sexual themes again. This angered me, so my responses got less frequent. He never noticed. He still kept talking about how if I ever got uncomfortable I’d need to “let him know quick” because apparently he sends “spontaneous dick pics.” The way I saw it, I had already let him know and he was ignoring it. I told him to hold off on that, which wasn’t an explicit “I will never want that!” and I know I could’ve done better but being straightforward literally makes me cry. So I did try my best.

Then I told him I had to leave to go to work, and he told me that he already downloaded all the pictures from my photoshoot and then he told me what he was going to *use* them for. If you know what I mean. This made me feel super nasty. I wanted to delete all my pictures and my profile. I can’t stand looking at the pictures anymore and knowing what I know. I didn’t take them for that kind of attention and it just makes me feel dirty. I can’t tell if me feeling gross is because of how sex makes me feel panicked or if it’s because that’s how anyone would feel to find out someone is getting off to a picture of them. Still, I feel like I can’t complain because I was flirting and encouraging the sexual themes at first. This is the same shit I got myself into with my ex. I’d make sex jokes, all the time. I love sex jokes cause they make me laugh. But the guys start taking it so serious idk what to.

 I mentioned this to my ex as well and he wrote it off as just one more betrayal, but he did apologize on their behalves for making me feel gross and being vulgar. That was appreciated.
 
 Why don’t I just block these men? Or something?? I’m letting them treat me like this and because of that I forfeit my right to get angry. Please tell me how to be more assertive, without caring. I always care too much. Please help. Sorry this was so long, I’ve been dozing just writing it so please ignore grammatical errors. Much love!",23Sep2020,1

358,"I’m a 2nd year engineering student! I live in a brown family and I’m tired of the expectations. I have a twin sister who is very smart! Unlike others, she puts in the effort and studies all day to get top level marks. Her being my twin, my parents expect similar things from me. They’ve come to understand that she’s simply smarter than me but they still expect me to be studying all day. I’m not slouching, I still have very good grades and my end goal is the same as hers.

Being in a brown family is already challenging because I live in Canada. Unlike other kids who have the freedom to hang out with friends whenever they want, I’m always stuck at home. I want to stay connected to my friends, meet new friends, and live life. Instead, I’m always accused of not studying hard enough. 

I call my friend almost every day at home and we work our way through assignments together. My mom happened to hear me laugh during a call and figured I wasn’t working and rather, wasting my time. She told me today to stop calling my friend and focus on school. 

Another time, my mom told me I shouldn’t go to campus to study because I “probably just waste time.” The only reason I’ve been going to campus 2/3 times a week is because I’m tired of being at home all day and my campus is 15 min away. 

School is very important to me, I don’t want people to assume that it’s not. I just don’t think it’s fair for them to want me to be studying 24/7. I know they expect me to pursue a PhD in the future but the only reason I chose engineering was because of the workplace. I have an open mind to get to a PhD but I don’t want them to think their son will definitely be a university professor doing research when that is not something I’m passionate about.

365,"My friend currently lives with her mother while studying at a state college. Since childhood, she has been a victim of physical and emotional abuse from both her parents (now separated), and there was one instance of sexual assault by a family acquaintance.

She has a history of panic attacks with a specific trigger. Her family is knowledgeable of this trigger and will intentionally induce panic attacks whenever they are upset.

She has severe self-worth issues, and refuses to seek the help of any services, as she believes she diverts resources from 'those who need it most'. She also views her own existence as harmful to others around her. However, she has no history of attempting suicide.

So far she has made it through life any life-threatening incidents or near-death experiences, and has been working part-time in addition to studying. Except for housing and insurance, she is financially independent from her family, but has no plans to move out until after graduation and potentially beyond. Her mother still occasionally induces panic attacks, which has still made living in the house dangerous.

I've considered contacting services that handle domestic violence, but hesitate since if she is removed from her mother's home, she will have nowhere to go. Neither I nor any friends have the means to take her in, especially during times of pandemic, and I fear that shelters will not offer her long-term stay (not to mention her tendency to refuse help). Also, if removed from her mother's home, she would likely be forced to quit college altogether, which would be a devastating blow to her already precarious mental state.

All throughout my childhood my father was in and out of my life, after a while he finally just stopped showing up.

Growing up, my mom would frequently ask if I ever missed my dad. And I never did, I never thought or asked about him. I’ve always had my mom and my stepdad (who was very caring, never raised his voice or hand at me at all). Sadly I was never really close with him either, he would try but I was just way too distant and he wanted to respect that.

In relationships/friendships I tend to get very clingy or very distant, sometimes both. I’ve always feared rejection and the thought of abandonment would make me very anxious and sleepless. At times I would feel incapable of ever knowing what true love feels like. Sometimes the fear of abandonment, loneliness, and the feeling of being unlovable becomes so overwhelming that I would normally get very depressed.

Any advice on how to cope with these feelings? Any piece of advice would help honestly.

SIDE NOTE: 
— I’ve talked to my mom and (step)dad separately about this. My dad was very helpful and I think we’ve gotten closer.

372,"OK.. so i never really bother posting on reddit i just surf about and what not. But i stumbled across this advice section and thought 'yeah i can maybe get some advice in here!'. So anyways this issue is about my brother... and it started in around 2016ish after he had a bad break up with his Ex, she dumped him and left the only child with him for an older man. As you can imagine this hurt and broke my brothers heart, badly. As the months went on after fights would break out between them both and other friends and family members, the Ex even tried to get the kid back from my brother but it all ended up in court and my brother won, thankgod!.. At least... thats how it looked like, at first. After a large fall out between me and my brother which lasted about a year or so 2016-2017.. we re-kindled our friendship and started talking again and things seemed.. ok. He was even seeing a new woman who had 3 children of her own, i was happy for him.. things where back to normal i thought or so it would seem. Anyways.. within a month or so i find out that my brothers new GF is infact the OLD wife of his Ex-girlfriends new partner(hope you're all still following by this point!). So basically his my brothers new gf used to be married to his Ex-Girlfriends current partner. So.. i never really thought anything of this at first until that is when the comments started.. some where light comments about his ex, bad stuff mainly.. so i just listened and took it all in my brothers GF would also do the same.. started off with just little comments about there exs. I'd say that over the last past 2 year or so things with them both talking/commenting/slandering/cyber stalking about theres exs has gotten far worse, to the point where the kids are now affected, im just not sure what to do or say anymore.. if anything. Whenever I am in the car with my brother or at home all hes seems to talk about is his ex its even worse when he gets together with his gf and talks with her as well. Also.. another weird thing i have NEVER seen my brother hold hands or kiss, hugg or even sleep in the same bed as his new gf.. thats when i began to click on. Hes clearly not inlove with this new woman, hes just using her for money(as she has a well paid job) and to vent off. It gets alot worse as well.. over the last past year or so my brothers little child, hes 9 at the moment has been hitting me ALOT.. like punching me often. I'm really not sure what to say on this i have tried to point this out.. but theres always a defence given about the child's behaviour again.. really not sure what to say or do anymore in this case. Last week as usual he was going on about his ex again and checking her facebook as he was talking to me.. my brother then tells me that while the child is visiting the mother he sticks around. watching where the mother takes the child and whatnot.. after hearing this from my brother i tell him NOT to do this as its talking. A line has been crossed here altogether, i see now that my brother needs help all together. Its even gotten to the point where hes put cameras in front of his house and claiming that shes driving down near his house.. i myself have NEVER seen any evidence of this. Hes also claimed shes messaged him online and her friends have also... again NEVER seen any evidence of this and believe me i have asked for it.",23Sep2020,1
373,"I've been married since Juneteenth of 2018 to **""Ted""**. I married Ted, a recovering drug addict from heroin who also shot it up. Anyone who knows a drug user that uses needles knows what that does to a person. We have only been married shortly but have been together since 2015. In the beginning of the relationship he was sober and charming and didn't act like a **drug addict**. The drugs came in to the relationship in early late 2016 - early 2017. In the fall of 2016 I cheated on him because he was either withdrawing or getting on **Suboxone** and working out of town  lot and not having sex with me. When the drugs came back he encouraged but did not force me to partake with him. The joint drug use went on for a while but then I stopped around late 2017 and he never did until February of this year. This year in January we separated and I filed for divorce. During the separation I went and had a hoe phase -- as did he but then he got a girlfriend and decided to ""settle"" and post her all over his social media a brag about her. I, on the other hand, had developed a healthy relationship with **""Mike""** that i didn't blast on social media because I was in the middle of a divorce and that's very messy. Mike is only somewhat of an intellectual but his *PEN15* is very big and he's a great cook who has helped me get over some of my anxiety.

Here's where I need advice...

When I decided that I was going to get back with my husband Ted -- he decided to be honest with me and show and tell me the REAL reason why he stinks all the time. He revealed that he is battling skin necrosis. He says that he stopped shooting up in February and toward the end of the drug use he was shooting the drugs in his muscles in his legs. Eventually the drugs bubbled back up and decided to come out and literally eat his skin away. The smell and the look of them are horrendous. I wanna know if I'm right for thinking that deciding to stay married and going through this healing process with him is my karma for the bullsh\*t that has happened in out past. I wasn't a saint and I was verbally abusive because I was constantly being lied to everyday and worried about him overdosing in a Walmart parking lot in BFE or giving me a disease.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I making the right decision staying married and trying to work through the issue with him because we have history and I love him but also I want to keep Mike safe because Ted constantly threatens to kill Mike?

Is this my karma?

Am I ever going to want to have sex with my husband again?

&amp;#x200B;

p.s. I'll also add that my husband has a substantial inheritance coming his way one day and it would be lovely to make sure those funds were uplifting future BLACK generations seeing as his family (on his dad's side) are racist.

My pay began at $20 for a couple months and currently sits at $35. I am often given bonuses as well if my code works particularly well. 

One big issue is that I am a fulltime student attending college. Due to my family’s income level, I go to college for very little cost and basically get my education for free with grants. However, I also live in a state with cheap schooling so this ties into another point of mine. 

Also, I’m currently on disability as I have a history of mental illness, so I receive my payments from work under the table. This has been something hard for me to deal with as I know I’m capable of doing some things well in life like people without disabilities, but it takes one setback for me to spiral downwardly. I also didn’t know how well this job would work out for me. This was my mentality at first as I didn’t know how things with this job would go, but I’m happier and happier working, so it seems like more of a sure deal. I was advised by people close to me to not mention my working to Social Security. 

Simply put, a large part of me wants to tell social security I’m working, work my job for as long as it lasts and pursue college at a later date (maybe a semester or two from now). The drawbacks of this are I risk losing grants, disability, and perhaps even penalization. I also want to transfer to a better school down the road and worry this may affect my chances (taking a break, as I’ve already taken a break from freshman classes a year ago due to illness). 

People close to me have suggested I focus on school and try to get my degree. I can understand this as the industry I work in is very volatile, and nothing is guaranteed as far as a future. However, I figure that with the pay I currently get, in one year I can pay for my schooling and then some. I also think I’m in a very unique position with everything and I stand to gain much more from this industry. I don’t want to close the door on it.

But the stress of managing money and juggling both school and working at the same time gets to me, so I really would like to try working for a while, and take a break from school. 

As I progress further with this job, I understand what I’m doing becomes more and more unethical which I know is wrong. So if anyone has suggestions I would love to hear them.",23Sep2020,1
381,"Hi, 

I'm a contemporary dancer that just graduated college. The pandemic hit, so I went to stay with my parents. I'm currently dating someone, but he lives an 11 hour drive away. I've been offered a job to train and then later teach at a local ballroom dance studio. I really want to take the job to save money, but I would have to commit for at least a year. However, I think I'm falling in love with my boyfriend and I just feel so scared about the future - in dance and in this relationship. I feel alone and overwhelmed, although I know I'm very lucky to have a roof my head and to be offered a full time job. It's just so different from what I've trained for/dreamt of doing my entire life. I can't seem to get passed feeling depressed, uncertain,  and pessimistic (especially about corona). I try and tell myself my life could be worse, or this will pass, but that only works for so long.

I (25f) lost my brother (25m, you guessed it - he was my twin) in a car accident,  my dad was driving and survived but in ""life threatening but stable"" condition. He was in surgery for 10 hours. My brother died on impact, they believe my dad was trapped and conscious next to him whilst he waited for emergency services. It makes me sick to my stomach knowing he was sat there helpless. 
The other vehicle's passenger is fine but as selfish as this sounds I couldn't care less about that person, I'm angry but that's not a priority for me right now. The police are handling that aspect, hence my lack of specifics. 


I don't know how to grieve or how to support my dad.
I dont know how to help my mum or my brother's partner through this.
I dont know how were going to tell my brothers 3 year old son that he's never going to see his dad again.
I dont know what happens now.
I dont know what happens financially, my brother had a credit card (£3k), a mortgage and a car on finance.

391,"So basically I'm fairly confident about myself around the people I already get along with. I could also quite easily strike up a conversation with someone from my school, as long as we got some courses or something in common. But I find having trouble approaching a complete stranger I have nothing in common with. People always say ""Just go out and talk to someone"" and I fail to understand *how* I'm supposed to approach a complete stranger.

I can't just up and attempt to talk to every single stranger I come across. And the people in my country are generally already quite reserved socially. I have the impression in other countries like in the US the people are much more eager to have a random chat with someone but around here in my country people are very defensive. Bus stops are completely quiet, people always try and maintain having a certain distance to eachother and especially the younger folks tend to listen to music most of the time, so it's quite difficult to approach someone in my experience.

So how am I supposed to do that? Should I go to certain public places? I've been to several pubs and clubs already and it's either that I just don't like talking to drunk people (frankly I hate drinking in general) or even there people tend to just stick together in their own premade friend groups or even competely dismiss strangers when approached by them. So, again, how are you supposed to approach strangers?",23Sep2020,1

394,"So December last year I finally got a job, it's a big girl fashion casual retail job. At the time of getting the job I was bloody ecstatic as I hadn't had a stable job in years. The first 4 months were great them covid happened so had to shut shop for a bit, after we reopened in July things were good until the middle/end of August when i suddenly started resenting going to work, especially when I was asked to open the store, close the store or simply run the day. 

I used to react to those situations by being really happy and 'woooo more hours!!!! Awesome!!!!!' but now whenever work calls me to work on a day I'm not scheduled I get all depressed, I feel sick and I act like I was just asked to put my pet down. Usually I'm doing absolutely nothing in the days I get asked to work, the most I might do is play on my ds or read a book, so it shouldn't be a hassle.

Why do I feel like this, is it work burn out? Do I genuinely hate my job and am just in denial because I spent so long jobless that I don't want to hate it? I don't want to leave and be jobless again because I don't know how long it'll take me to find another job.

Anyway.

I woke up kind of depressed because I didn't want to leave the dream but knew I couldn't get back to sleep. This segues nicely into a bigger point.

I can't say that my life right now sucks. My wife and I live in a decent place. Somehow, I'm making fairly decent money freelance writing on the internet. But it *is* almost totally devoid of excitement and variety.

I live in a pretty boring city that I'm not keen on. I stayed as my wife has a job here. We've been talking about leaving for a year or so. I find freelance writing completely unfulfilling, but there are no better career options where I live (I'm not based in an English speaking country). Most of my close friends have left over the past few years. And I spend a lot of time and energy dealing with complications from a surgery I had a year ago. Abusing caffeine pills keeps me going through long hours and the odd Xanxax, when needed, deals with momentary freak-outs.\]

My mother: Hates my two sisters (because they're female). Loves me very much because I am a son and I'm going to take care of her in her old age. Narcissist, negative personality. She wanted to do a job but couldn't (I guess because of my father), and now when she is approx. 50, she feels awful about not doing a job. She is a housekeeper. She always want more. She wants a better house, more money, travel etc, etc.

My father: Thinks a job is the only thing required from his side in the family. He earns well, and that's all he does. He has no time for family and is very proud that he provides financial support for the family. This makes my mother more insecure. He is a simple man, as long as he has enough clothes, a normal house and food, he doesn't want more.

My sister (one is married, so not writing about her): Not very bright (academically). She's finding any job to get out of this house.

Me: I've been, for the most part, absent in the family. I do what I am asked to do, and then I continue anything on my laptop. It's an escape for me. I'm aspiring to do a Psychology-related course. I've anxiety; I am a perfectionist, a self-critique, and never happy with my achievements. Also, my mom doesn't believe that I'd become anything because I aspire to take a Psychology-related course and not any science field.

I would have to hide my favorite hobbies and pretend that I like other things so she wouldn’t try to steal anything from me or pretended to be me. She would copy the way I talk, walk, dress, and even things like grades and stuff like that. When I was around eight years old I was sexually abused and it caused severe depression.

So this situation was really weird to me and I don’t know whether I’m overthinking here

So I’ve currently been feeling a little low, you know, what like most young adults/teenagers feel. Nothing more, nothing less.

I woke up at around 10 AM, felt alright. I went on over to my bathroom then started to wash my hands 

I noticed there was a cut going down my forearm which looks like had been done with something sharp

And that’s the bit that worries me, it was done at an effective place to self harm.

402,"Hi, I am posting this more on behalf of my mother because it’s her final decision (although everyone in our family has their own personal opinion on the matter) 

My family circumstances are kinda fucked up tbh but for some context: my mom is 50F, my aunt was 32F. They were half siblings. My aunt suffered from depression her entire life bc she was abused by her father and carried a lot of the trauma into her adult life. 

Earlier this year, my aunt got pregnant from a one night stand. she was already in a bad mental state because her fiancée passed away last year, but then she absolutely fell apart when learning she was pregnant. my aunt was in absolutely no way prepared to have a child and she knew it. 

as far as we know, the father of the baby would not come around. my aunt was not financially stable and was still waiting on a promotion at work that may never come. not to mention, she never actually wanted children in the first place. 

she thought about abortion a few times but our family would pressure her into not getting one. she was researching abortion clinics and drove halfway to it, but decided she couldn’t go through with it in the end. i wouldn’t say she was very excited to have a child though

she had— what we assume to be— prenatal depression. there were a lot of mood swings and changing back and forth on her decision to have the child. one day, she told me she wished she would get a miscarriage, and then went out shopping for baby clothes the next morning. another time, she was contemplating potential baby names, but then suddenly switched the topic to the abortion clinic again. i’m no baby expert, and I know that mothers have their fair share of doubts when pregnant. But our family was really concerned with her so we moved her in with her mom (my grandma) so the 2 of them can care for each other

a few days after my aunt passed the 22 week mark (last week to get an abortion), she took her own life. our family will never know the real reason why she did it, but i am suspecting it had to do with the baby. i think she couldn’t deal with being a single mother, or maybe she really wanted an abortion and was horrified when she realized she could no longer get one. maybe she thought her life was over. maybe it was something completely different. I don’t really know. 

we probably won’t have a funeral service bc of covid , however my mom is in charge of ordering the headstone. sometimes when a pregnant woman dies, they put both her name and the name of her unborn child on the grave, and that’s exactly what some of my family members want to do. but the other half thinks that it would be a mockery to her, because they believe the baby is what lead to her death. my family has been fiercely divided over this and we’re not sure what to do",23Sep2020,1
403,"Bit of a rant here, please forgive the length.

Back in my home country, there used to be a college entrance exam, the JEE that would decide the college that you ended up going to. I wasn't doing so well on my prep (I barely even tried), and I ended up leaving the country because I knew there was no way I was going to do well on that test. I almost literally left on a life raft made of my parent's money.

When I got to college, I didn't have it in me to do well, and lost my partial scholarship within the first few months of being there. From then on, I was a solid C student, and barely scraped by the first couple of years there, until I finally got my arse in gear and managed to improve to a solid B/B+. The damage was done though, and I ended up with C+/B- overall (Second class, second tier).

Relied on my parent's money (again) for my masters, and actually did half well this time (though that's probably just how masters' courses are designed). Got a job that's nice, and am gainfully employed.

I've run away from the challenges that life threw my way, going through my highschool and college years in a really half-arsed way. I feel like I'm completely unable to do anything for myself without leaning heavily on those around me, and am completely impotent on my own when it comes to doing anything that has any actual value to me.

I'm basically a leech, sucking the resources and happiness of others. I used to consider ending it at times, now I know that that'd just be a waste at this point, nothing would come of that that would address any of these issues for anyone except me.

405," Hi, im 16y and currently staying with my host family since Im not in my own country.




 We went for a trip, me and my host family. I accidently broke my host mom’s phone while she was driving the car. I threw it to the children since she wanted them to take photos, but they couldn’t catch it, and it fell on the ground. It got cracked. I know I was responsible for this, but I was so embarrassed and sorry for her, so I could do nothing but apologise for her with small tiny winy voice. She said it was okay because it was an accident.





 However, I definitely knew that I needed to do something. After coming back from trip, I wasted time thinking of whether ‘should I talk about it or not’, and ‘how can i talk to her?’ etc. I just didn’t have enough courage to face her and talk about that happening again. I wasted about a month, or even more.






 Finally, I encouraged myself and talked to my teacher first. She’s the closest person for me and very friendly, nice woman. She said I was being extremely rude and should have told her much earlier than this. I agree.





 She said either a) give her a small gift and leave a message of apology, or b) tell my parents and let them pay for it. I thought I can pay for her with my money(allowance from my parents that I saved) but she said it would not make my host family comfortable to get paid from the student. 





 I know its going to be quick and much better for my host family and me if I tell my parents about it and let them help me. However, I CAN’T because my parents are really strict. I know this is called like general Asian parents, but their words broke me a lot. A LOT. I dont think its gonna be able to explain everything...... but just because i got lower grades at school, ive been treated as a trash at home, and my family love to make fun of me when Im crying.





 I just don’t want them to know about it. Its NOT just a thing like ‘they will tell me off’ or ‘they will get mad at me’.





 I know you guys can not understand my fear. And I would probably look like an idiot, but I can’t do it. I can’t take every words she would use to ‘educate’ me and I can’t do it. I can’t do it. I can’t do it. What do you think shes gonna call me? What do you think shes gonna do? How long do you think shes gonna use it to make me offended and broken? How many times do you think she would talk about it and yell at me?




 I need their help, and I cant even talk to them. What do you think I should do? Would there be another way to pay? What can I do?





 Thank you guys for reading. Stay safe, have a great day. Please feel free to tell me if you think I have wrong attitude.





 Brief summary : I broke my host family’s phone, wasted time about a month or more and trying to be responsible for it just now. I have two options given... a) small gift and a message or b) tell my parents and let them solve the problem. However Im not close with my parents, I can not even talk to them. What should I do? What would be the best thing to do? What can I do?",23Sep2020,1

However there's extra complication, as we found a very sick kitten back in March and took him in. I nursed him back to health, and now he is extremely attached to me and I love him to pieces. 

I have always taken care of him; changing his litter, feeding and changing his water, giving his medication, etc. My boyfriend doesn't pay attention to or care about the cat's needs a whole lot. I've done everything and paid for most of what he has. The only things that my boyfriend has paid for is litter and some vet bills, and that's where it gets complicated.

He's listed as the owner on the vet papers for whatever reason, and I fully intend on taking the cat with me when I move. I don't trust my boyfriend to take care of him especially considering his past mean behavior towards him when he was just being a kitten. 

A friend told me I could get in legal trouble if I just take him without transferring ownership, but I don't know for sure. We've had a brief discussion in the past about this situation and he said he wanted the cat to stay here. How can I convince him otherwise?",23Sep2020,1

So, I just wrapped up my first year of university by failing most of my classes. Basically, I've had an awful year and I'm a lazy asshole which is a horrible combination that brought me where I am today. I feel really bad about it but I'm aware that there's no space to feel sorry for myself and the only thing I can do is to try harder and work so I can get myself out of this problem. 

Unfortunately, I decided to dig my hole a little more. For a little background, I am the youngest of three siblings who are, let's say 'problematic' and they bring a lot of stress to my parents. I decided that the best thing that I can do is just not to complain and do my responsibilities with school. I did the first half - I didn't complain but I can't say that for the second half and now I've lost my scolarship. Today I told my parents that I finished my last exam and that I managed to save it and the saddest thing is that they were really happy even though I told them that I passed with the lowest possible results.

While I continued to fail exam after exam, I created plan B where I saved up for the first half of my tuition which is due next week and I think I have a chance of saving up the second half if I try hard enough but I deservedly so, still feel really guilty. The thing is, because of my siblings, my parents have really low expectations and they never check on anything that I do. I don't mean this in a bad way, but I don't think they care what I'll do or how (unless it's something crazy or illegal) just as long as I don't burden them. They don't even know what classes I have, they just ask if I still have the scolarship or not.

The other thing - My sister has a difficult time with her studies as well (among other things) but she's been very honest from the beginning, unlike me. Also, unlike me, she's been very vocal about every single problem that she faces so much that my parents have asked her multiple times that she keeps some things to herself. I do notice that I keep putting myself in this gray area of what's right and what's wrong because the obvious answer would be not to lie but with problems with my family and problems with my own brain I haven't seen outside of gray for a while now.

I guess what I'm asking is, what is the best thing to do so I don't stress out my parents? I already intend to pay the tuition myself and to wake the f up and pass my exams next year but is it better to tell my situation with telling them that I am responsible for the consenquences that come with my failings or to just not say anything. I'm not asking for my own conscience because I'm aware that I deserve judgement but the question is more if you put yourselves in my parents' shoes. I don't want to drop out and I know if I keep doing this next year I will have to be truthful. As harsh as it sounds, even if they know that they don't have to pay for anything, I know that them knowing that their third child is also going in the wrong footsteps like their other children would be the biggest burden. I want to keep this to myself because there is still a chance of me getting out of this situation if I complete my next year succesfully.

Is this even a valid question or am I just running in circles trying to find excuses for myself?",23Sep2020,1

417,"Hi everyone,

So I've been part of a youth group in my local area for about 6 years. I absolutely love the work that I do there, and if I can be there, I always am. 

Now, I was with my ex all through the second half of last year, up to December. We split up because of her parents, and the fact she wanted to date my friend. The breakup wasn't amicable, and parts of that were my fault. 

We started talking again in March of this year, and when the country went into Lockdown I shared my streaming services logins with her to help her mental health. 

We then had a massive argument in August, where she hit me with a lot of baseless accusations about our relationship, and agreed never to talk to each other again. She has since messaged me twice trying to start more arguments. 

Now she is a member of this youth group that I love, and I'm honestly scared to go back. I have a feeling she is going to start arguments there too, or spread lies about me like she already has to some people. 

Do I go back, or do I call it a day after 6 wonderful years to avoid the potential harm to my mental health that she may cause?

Tl, Dr; My ex has joined a group that I've been in for 6 years. She's previously spread lies about me and I'm worried she'll do it again. Do I go back or do I leave so I don't need to see her again?",23Sep2020,1
418,"Hi friends, I’m at a bit of low point right now and decided to turn to Reddit, as you do right? 

So I’m (19f) in a student house with 8 other girls. I’m a massive introvert and value my time spent on my own, I also struggle with mental health issues and I think that contributes to my tendency to isolate myself. However, all my housemates are extroverts and enjoy each other’s company whereas I’d rather be chilling on my own doing my own thing. 

This has caused my anxiety to blow up and I’m convinced they all hate me and talk about how much of a recluse I am. I get along with everyone and think they’re all brilliant but I just rather being by myself for the majority of the time. Too much social interaction overwhelms me and I feel drained, but when I’m on my own I feel guilty and as though I’m being rude. Even something as menial as going down to the kitchen worries me as I have to mentally prepare myself for an interaction. Fuck I sound so crazy here. 

I also feel like such an odd one out, as all the girls share similar interests and hobbies but I don’t really share these things with them. Like I said we get along and I value them so very much, they’re kind and welcoming, so I think I am most definitely the problem here. I sometimes wish I could just be like them because they seem to have it all sussed out while I’m just lamenting in my self inflicted isolation.

419,"Quick backstory

This past Feburary it became known to me that my girlfriend of one year was cheating on me. I was told by a close friend and decided to catch her in the act. I packed my belongings while she was at work and left a note telling her I knew and left. 
She begged me to come back and to give her a second chance and I came to the decision that people make mistakes and even though heartbroken I would give her a second chance.
Things weren't exactly normal and I was very suspicious of everything she was doing. I found myself looking through her phone and seeing her chatting inappropriately to other guys online. I lost my temper and tried leaving the relationship but she always had a alibis saying ""it's just a friend, that's how we talk"" or ""it was a mistake I was drunk"".
Her, upset that I went through her phone I told her that I would no longer do it because we had to start rebuilding trust in the relationship.

With the pandemic following shortly after she lost her job and I decided to move in to help her with rent. Also a reason for the initial cheating was that the relationship was moving to slow for her and she didn't see a future because we hadn't moved in together. 

So acouple months pass and things are okay and everything she does checks out with her whereabouts and so forth. Until acouple weeks ago she asks if I'm cheating on her. I wasn't, but now I'm suspicious because usually the one doing it is the one accusing. 

Despite saying I wouldn't I looked through her phone, she had texted her ex to come over after I had fallen asleep when acouple friends came over and is currently messaging a guy online, sending inappropriate messages and refering to me as her roommate.

Anyway I know I have to leave her but the problem is that my tennant where I live is leaving in November, so I have no where to go and I also got a puppy who needs to be watched until he's got all his vaccinations before I can enroll him in a day care while I'm at work. 

Should I wait until November and pretend all is okay, should I have a discussion with her that I know or should I just pack my things and disappear with a note telling her I've left her?",23Sep2020,1

424,"I’ve (21m) been attracted to boys since I was 16. I’ve never had a physical or extended emotional relationship with another guy. I got my first girlfriend when I was 14 and we dated on and off for years. While we were apart I was also involved with other girls. We broke up a year ago for good I think

Im androgynous to an extent. I like to grow my hair long, I’m pretty thin, and I conform to some masculine stereotypes but not most. I was asked by my ex and honestly more than one other girl that I’ve been with: am I gay? and I’ve always said emphatically no. Because I’m not. I am at minimum (I think?) bisexual, but the way that i feel when they ask me about it is a little bit defensive and guilty for reasons that I’ll try to explain but by no means am proud of. 

I grew up in a conservative community. My parents and siblings are socially liberal and open but my extended family (cousins, uncles and aunts) are homophobic. I have been told countless times and believe wholeheartedly that members of the lgbtq+ community are people and deserve to be treated like anybody else. But... where I grew up it was common to rib your friends by calling them a f****t/f*g/gay/homo, and openly different people like trans women were not shunned completely, but people talked behind their backs a lot. Im worried that Ive internalized some of those feelings of “different=bad” subconsciously.

Im sorry it took that long. Here’s my question: wtf do I do? First of all, how can I undo these feelings? I will never treat somebody differently (consciously) based on their orientation because I think that’s shitty, but how can I stop myself from doing it unconsciously? I’m 99% sure I am but am I bisexual or do I sound like someone who’s confused? Is it wrong to just say “no I’m not gay” and not “no, but I’m bisexual” to partners I have? I don’t want to hide what I am but is it relevant always? (Need help differentiating is it important to a one night stand vs a fling vs a serious relationship, it’s happened at all three stages lmao) 

lastly, how do I go about this? What’s the way to meet potential gay partners if I want to meet them? I’m at a very liberal college which has a fairly large gay/bisexual population and am living in town. Keeping covid in mind, do you have dating app recommendations, first date ideas, or any random pieces of advice? I’m clueless about boys :( thanks for answering any part of this",23Sep2020,1
425,"Back when lockdown started I lost my job for two weeks (admin assistant) and eventually got to work remotely. So in May I was applying to other jobs to supplement my income since I was the only one in the home working. I was trying to either find higher paying jobs or another remote job that I could do simultaneously. One night in may I get an email from the owner/boss asking if I’m quitting and what my next steps are because a person called the shop for a reference.I knew immediately that if this was true that one coworker in particular (let’s call her Amy) got this Information and told the boss.I explained that I was panicking about money and trying to earn more but I have no plans of leaving. I thought the case was closed and I was a little annoyed at Amy for opening her mouth. (Side note: Amy and boss are TIGHT. Amy has run her mouth and gotten other people fired. She’s a snake for sure. She once told me that her and the boss call each other to complain about everyone who works here).
So I finally started in the office this week and day ONE another coworker let it slip that I applied to a company that one of Amy’s boyfriends family members work at and they asked Amy if she knew me and she took that information to the boss! I find this completely inappropriate and crossing the line!
I spoke with my other boss about it yesterday (bosses are married owners) and told him the situation and now inappropriate I found it. He asked me what exactly I thought was inappropriate and I explained that taking Information someone finds out about me outside of work and telling the boss is inappropriate. He didn’t understand at all. He told me he can guarantee this wasn’t done maliciously and Amy was just concerned for me and wanted to let them know.
I then countered with the information that Amy told me that Amy and your wife speak on the phone and complain about everyone here. He said that absolutely doesn’t happen.
I felt so stonewalled and idiotic and now I’ve opened a can of worms I can’t close. I’ve stuck my head out for nothing!
Am I wrong for finding this completely inappropriate?! I’m starting to feel like I’m in a toxic work environment. Any advice/insight would be greatly appreciated!",23Sep2020,1
426,"TLDR: new neighbours are noisy, could anyone recommend good sound proofing solutions, please?

So me and my family just moved to a new house. This is the first time we've gotten a mortgage so moving isn't an option for a good. It's terrace housing so both sides of the house are attached to other houses. One side has this really nice old lady but the other has quite the noisy family. 
From my bedroom I can often hear loud conversations, young children (which I'm not especially mad about because kids are kids) and I often hear their loud television. But the worse part is that sometime around midday almost every day they start playing loud music. And I mean really loud! This is sometimes followed by the television getting louder as well cause I guess no one in that house ready cares just how loud they are. 
My mum is adamant that I can't ask them to keep the noise down because she's convinced it'll start trouble and she doesn't want that. This apparently extends to complaining to the local council as well. 

They're okay in the evening so this wouldn't be a problem if I wasn't also working from home because of the pandemic. I'm an apprentice so I attend university remotely as well. It's so difficult to concentrate on coding with all the noise. And I don't want the noise interrupting meetings or interfering with the lectures I attend.

428,"Sorry if this is too convoluted, I’m terrible at summarising 🙏

About a month ago my ex (17F) (who I’m still friends with) apologised for using me (17M) as a rebound to help her get over her ex. Obviously hearing that hurt. So I told her that, and she got mad at me for ‘trying to make her feel bad’. I’m not angry about being used as a rebound, it’s happened, whatever. What I’m mad about is the fact that she tried to make herself the victim in this situation. I’m now left with feelings for her and there’s nothing I can do about it. 

But here’s my main problem:
Now when I message her, I become insanely nervous. Even if it’s something simple like a photo showing that I’m watching a movie she suggested. Her responses are always either nice and friendly, or generic responses, but they’re never mean-spirited. I have Paranoid Personality Disorder, so when I message her, in my mind it always seems like a big deal. When I write a message, I doubt that I should send it (even though it’s not a bad message by any means) and when I eventually send it, I keep checking my Snapchat waiting for a response. I know it shouldn’t be a big deal to message her, but I do nothing but worry about getting a response. I think things like “She’s going to leave me on seen” or “She’s going to be angry at me” or “She doesn’t want to talk to me”

I just need advice on how I can stop dwelling on this one girl. Any advice besides ‘just move on’ would be great. That’s easier said than done, I’m going to move on in my own time. But my problem is that I can’t stop making a massive deal out of texting her. Also, please refrain from telling me that I’m stupid for trying to be friends with her after I was a rebound. I know I shouldn’t be friends with her after that, but I am. Get over it please lmao

I posted this in another subreddit, but it became filled with insults directed at my mental health, so if y’all could refrain from telling me I ‘need therapy’ and I’m ‘insane’ that would greatly appreciated.

434,"I just got my brother's motorcycle, a Yamaha city bike, in working condition through a transport service. I don't know about bikes much, and was fairly new to the terminology and problems that can occur to an unused bike for a month.

Problems with the bike were faulty carburator, rusty tank with poor quality petrol and the ignition wire was directed to manual switch as a workaround to start the bike. 

For the above mentioned problems I gave my bike to a mechanic who works full-time in KTM bike servicing department recommended by the friend who works in the same branch but as a sales manager. A week passed by and he had yet to examine the bike and tell me the problems mentioned above, except for the manual switch issue. 

Another week came in and I got to know the bike had rusty tank filled with bad quality petrol and that was the reason it wasn't starting up. I brought and gave some petrol from nearby pump to test it out. Turns out the issue was with the carburator. The week ended and I was told that if it works with a second hand carburator from an old bike, than there's no need to invest in new carburator.  So I searched in market and brought back a used one. Turns out the thing did work, but with some glitches. So I decided to order a new one, and within 14 days, I gave it the mechanic. He took three to four more days to fit the carburator and check. Good thing that it worked, and all I had now was the manual switch to be worked on.

More than a month has passed in figuring out and doing the above mentioned work; including the 14 days I took to get the new carburator delivered to me. He took another week to work on the switch, and rewire.

Rewiring needed some soldering work and he tried but failed, so I got it soldered from other shop.

All this was done within a time span of more than 45 days. After this, he told me that the bike is in working condition, so I took it for a spin and checked. Yes, all the above mentioned problems were solved, but the bike still needed new throttle wire for smooth throttling, whole new set of wires for odometer, speedometer and fuel meter to work. But since it was  it the primary requirement, I was happy to get the bike up and running.

I told my the mechanic and my friend individually to tell me how much the servicing costed, they both said they'll tell me. I my friend a week from that and he told me nothing. I brought that up again after a month, and he said he had yet to run the numbers. Two weeks back, I met him and asked for the amount number, still nothing. Last night, as per usual exchange of the forwards on Whatsapp and Instagram, I got a message written just ""9k"" after I sent funny video. I asked him what was it, and he just assumed I'm kidding and showing attitude to not pay his mechanic, and replied that he 'understands'.

How do I approach and handle this matter? For me the amount is way too much than I expected (previously Rs.500, now 1k after getting the 9k text).

H was also my ride home so I awaited their return. to myself and the others at G's we were surprised when what should have been a 20 minute trip turned into multiple hours so we called and their response was that something had happened but they were coming back to pick me up. When they arrived back they all seemed pretty shaken up but would and still won't say what happened and I feel its pretty serious. I don't really know what to do as they say it's no business of mine even though I feel that as a friend who was with them before and straight after this event that it is definitely my business.

445,"*TLDR: my neighbours want me to cut down a tree in my backyard. I don't want to. How can I keep the relationship healthy?*  


I bought my house last march, and one of the features that really sold it to me is the large, mature backyard. It has quite a few trees, the largest of which stands all the way at the back of the property. It is easily taller than the house, so I am guessing about 16meters tall. It pairs in nicely with the trees on the other side of the fence, on the city grounds, that are equally tall. If provides me south-facing garden with some much needed shade in the warm summer months, and I love the sound of the wind blowing through the leaves.

The house next to me is occupied by a couple in their late forties, early fifties. They both have children that often visit them. Before I even moved in, my neighbour (F) came over to see how the progress in the remodel of the house was coming along, and she quite bluntly asked me to cut down the tree. Back then, I made an [AITA](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ggl0gv/wibta_if_i_didnt_prune_cut_down_my_tree_even/) post about it, asking if IWBTA if I didn’t cut down the tree. People told me I was in the right here.

Ever since I really moved in, my neighbours have been asking me to come and have a drink, as to get to know each other better. I am quite hesitant to do so, since I am afraid that they will start talking about the tree again. This suspicion was confirmed when I was talking to my neighbour (M) came over to have a little chat when I was working in the front yard a few weeks ago and not to subtly implied that I should cut down the tree. He told me that I could easily plant a tree that doesn’t grow so tall and so wide. He told me that their vegetable garden doesn’t get enough sunlight with the tree being there. He told me that pruning it is a waste of money. He told me he knows nothing about trees or pruning, but he is more than willing to put his saw to the tree.

The thing is: I love that tree. It makes the garden. It provides me with much needed shade in summer. I don’t believe in cutting down healthy trees. I want to keep it. I am willing to have it somewhat pruned, but only by a professional and only if the neighbours pay for it. 

**How on earth am I going to convey that message, without ruining my relationship with the neighbours?**

&amp;#x200B;

Few facts:

\- The tree stands really close to the back of my property (like: 10cms) but is allowed to be there because behind me there is just more city owned greenery.

\- It stands about 3 meters from where my garden borders the neighbours’. The legal limit is 2 meters.

\- I don’t mind them cutting off the branches that grow over the border, at the border. Though they are 6 meters up in the air and cannot be reached without some serious equipment like a cherry picker.

\- The tree has been there for at least 15 years, but more likely closer to 30.

\- The neighbours told me they are planning on moving within the next 5 years.

\- The tree only puts shade in their garden in the morning, in the afternoon the sun has moved past the tree.

\- Cutting down my tree will only result in their garden getting shade from the city-trees at exactly the same times they now have shade from mine.",23Sep2020,1

CORONAVIRUS

I've been landed with grades much lower than I expected and there's no way any uni will have me on a veterinary science degree with them.

I found another course that I like, a biochemistry degree at another uni, and I find the job prospects interesting. I have an offer for biochemistry and I have the chance to study biochemistry this year.

Due to my living circumstances I'm not in a position to stay where I am for another year but I don't want to be going to university just to get away, I think getting a degree should be for a purpose.

449,"(This is my first post so bear with me please) I'm (18F don't know if that matters) currently a college freshman living in the dorms. I recently found out that the girl (also 18F still don't know if it matters) that lives next to me is in quite a few of my classes. I found out when some of our classmates met up for a study group (socially distanced of course and not for that long) and when we were leaving and finding out where everyone was going we both mentioned that we live in the same hall. Since she didn't have a ride back I offered her one and when we got back I noticed we went in the same direction all the way up until we got to our rooms. I off-handedly mentioned that we were neighbors, laughed, then went into my room and called it a day. Later that evening she messaged me (one of my classes has an entire group chat dedicated to that class that's how she has my info) and asked if at a later date could we have a sleepover. I was actually really excited because I was homeschooled my last 2 years of high school so I didn't have any friends and my social skills are literal shit so I hadn't made any friends the 2 weeks I had been here, so I jumped at the opportunity and said yes. In the days to follow, we would occasionally go to lunch at the cafe together and talked throughout the day. About 2 days later it was roughly 9:30 p.m. and I was in bed because I like to go to bed early so I can wake up early and do schoolwork and she messaged me and asked if I could drive her to the store, this wouldn't be a problem except I had already promised my mom that I wouldn't start giving people rides and she's paying for the car so I don't want to disrespect her. I agreed anyway because she made it seem like it was really urgent so I stumbled out of bed threw on some clothes and met her at the door to go to my car I took her to the store and that was that(later on she sent me a negative pregnancy test so I guess that's what she bought). I was wrong to think that was the end of it and like my mom always says ""Don't start something you can't finish!"". A night later she messages me at about the same time and asks what I was doing and how my day went I thought it was just a general conversation since she hadn't spoken to me all day (which I really didn't mind because we're in college people get busy) but eventually, she turns back around and says ""I wanted to ask you if you could take me to the store earlier but I didn't want to bother you (insert that one doe-eyed pouting emoji)"". I told her I couldn't take her this time as I had made the promise to my mom and I already (regrettably) broke it. She then becomes kind of disinterested in the rest of the conversation even though I told her if it was something really really important that I'd take her the next day (to which she then admits that her mom was taking her to the store the next day anyway). After that night we didn't really talk anymore and now she only messages me for answers to the classwork, to ask if I'm going somewhere so she can go too, or asking me for rides so I recently (as in just last night) just started ignoring the messages altogether because I don't know what to do and I don't want to be super rude because we still have multiple classes together and literally share a wall.

452,"I'm 18F and currently in my last year of high school. I probably haven't had any friends for the last 4 years. I always had people I can stand with during the breaks and could sometimes talk with for a bit but we didn't have anything in common. They often went to do stuff after school and didn't once invite me to come. I'm pretty sure they didn't really like me. 

I always try to be nice and helpful to people. I'm very shy and socially kinda awkward. I'm starting to feel a bit lonely and really want to find some friends. 

The people I currently stand with during breaks seem to be more like me. They have similar interests like video games. However, I have no idea how to talk to them. Some of them have tried to talk to me but I just get nervous and can usually only somehow manage to say yes or awkwardly laugh. Even when I manage to say full sentences I can only ever answer the question and have no idea how to keep the conversation flowing. It just stops after I answer and it gets quiet and awkward. My mind just goes blank and I just have no idea what to say or do. 

How the hell do you make friends? How do you keep a conversation going? How can I mentally not freak out when being asked a question? 

One guy tried to be my friend, I think, because he asked me to come play video games with him which I did. We did that a few times but suddenly he just stopped talking to me and hasn't said a word since. I'm pretty sure he just got bored of me.

I often hear them talk about all the games they're going to play together after school and they never invite me to join eventhough they know I'm into video games and play some they plan on playing.

471,"So.. this might be kind of long but I feel I need to explain the whole situation

When I was a freshman in highschool, I moved to a new city. I knew nobody there and the few friends I did make, I attached myself to. I met this one boy, letsss call him Jason. Me and him were very close- best friends pretty much. Once I met him we got close really fast- until I ended up moving 3 hours away about 2 months before the school year ended. The last time I saw him, it was 2 am and I had broken his band mates nose- he had also jumped on him to try and get him to stop hitting me. It was bad, lots of cops involved and a lot of emotion that night. We never spoke again.

Fast forward a few years, he’s 21, I’m 19. I’m a a manger at dominos, and about a month ago a new driver came in. He was wearing a mask the whole time so I didn’t even recognize him until I saw his name on our screen and saw the last name (he goes by his middle name so hearing everyone say his first name didn’t ring any bells either) so at that point I asked him if he could run to the store for me and get me a pack of smokes. He does, we both step out for a smoke break and I just asked him where he went to highschool, and I saw the lightbulb click on immediately 

He said he forgave me for everything and since that night we have seen eachother every. Single. Day. I should add that I was MAKORLY in love with him in highschool, but those feelings vanished and when I saw him again it was nothing like that. One night probably a week after I met him again, he told me he wouldn’t mind hooking up. So we did. And we have been since then- only I have feelings now that I don’t think he has (or he does?)

We pretty much spend all of our free time together, we go out to eat, we sleep over with eachother, I just go ride around with him on his deliveries when I’m not scheduled to work, he takes me to meet his band and his friends, we just took an out of state trip as well. He constantly tells me that I’m a good person and that he wants to see me grow and do good things and that he’s so proud of everything I’ve done and gotten through! He’s also met most of my family already. He always gives me the best hugs and kisses and holds my hand (I feel like a child writing this but it’s true lol) and wants to come over literally just to cuddle sometimes. We also tell eachother shit that we don’t tell literally anyone else- my point is it feels so much like a relationship. But it’s not. It’s just casual sex 

He’s moving about 2 hours away on the first. He’s leaving. Yesterday I was talking to him about where I should live, and he asked why I felt like I had to stay in the area. I thought about it and there is no reason- and it’s so expensive here! So I asked where I should move to because I had no idea and he told me I should move to the same city he is. I asked why and he said it’s cheap, a fresh start and I’ll already have good people to be around. He said it would be better for me and I could really use the fresh start to grow and do better for myself. He’s just been taking really good care of me too- he makes sure I don’t go without anything I need and has offered me to stay at his new house for weeks. Idk.

I love this man 

A couple weeks ago I asked him what he wanted out of this. I think I specifically said ‘whats happening here because I don’t want to expect anything that’s not’ and he basically said he just wants to fuck and that I don’t need to worry about a relationship because he’s not in love with me or anything 

So..
1: Do he really just want casual sex? Or is he into me at all? I’m so lost 
2: how do I figure out if he’s into me without being obvious? 
3: I’m sorry if this is too much for anyone to understand I might be baked as fuck and freaking out for no reason I just rly fucking like him :((",23Sep2020,1

I (24f)recently went on a date with a guy (26m). After the date I realized we were not on the same page. He was  “not necessarily looking for a GF” while I was looking for something more serious. Apart from that he was nice, kind and a gentleman. We had fun, laughed and enjoyed each other’s company, right after he asked for a second date at his place. Which sent a clear message to me. When I told him I wasn’t comfortable with that, he said he was fine with us meeting at a cafe. Tomorrow is our second date and he seems keen to meet up but after his initial second date idea am not so sure anymore. I still like him as a person. He seems to be quite keen on me, despite me not being interested in something casual and is fine with neutral date locations I suggest. It makes me wonder if he is just going along with it till he gets what he wants, or if he is genuinely interested. I don’t know which it is. Should I still go?",23Sep2020,1

474,"My ex broke up with me 2 months ago. During the relationship I was the one to support, encourage and listen to him through all of his problems. Every time I did that, he directed his frustrations towards me but I have never stopped being there for him. In the end, he broke up with me after a fight in which I told him that he has taken me for granted and would rather spend his time with his friends or by himself than with me. What he understood from this is that I reproached him that he doesn't have enough money and hinted that I was a gold digger... after all I have done for him and after being there for him though thick and thin and never given a single tought about money, because that is not who I am. He made me feel so guilty. Yesterday I saw that he got a managing position at his job, which has been a dream of his. I am sure that he deserves it and I am happy for it, but how do I stop feeling so frustrated about this situation? I was the one who made him believe that he can do better and I was the one who tried to motivate him to achieve this exact goal and I was there to listen to his every problem, only to be thrown away for such insulting reasons.

But there’s always those little moments here and there, or interactions, or whatever, that I dwell on. An email from my boss due to a ‘complaint’ that I didn’t get to know any details of. Our new neighbours upset at something I did that wasn’t aligned with their expectations. Missed calls from my dad. 

Just examples of everyday occurrences and little speed bumps along the way that I feel the average person wouldn’t necessarily think or worry about for more than the time it takes to have the conversation or respond to the email and clear it all up. Even after the fact, non-stop worrying about how this interaction will forever change or damage the relationship I’m trying desperately to build and maintain. 

It weighs on me for hours, days, then pops back in every now and then just to remind me that someone out there had a negative experience and it was because of me. And I can never take any of it back. 

I would never go out of my way to do anything to specifically hurt or upset or inconvenience anyone, regardless of how I know them. But my intentions and my actions and my words don’t always seem to marry up, and I make mistakes. 

How can I learn to give myself a break? How can I make myself understand that even though someone may have had an uncomfortable experience because of me, it doesn’t necessarily mean they hate me or don’t want anything to do with me any more? I’ve spent the past 5 hours or so incredibly upset, crying, forcing comfort and affection from my partner that does his best but thinks I shouldn’t be this upset as it’s not really that big a deal.

484,"My friend and college roommate has talked to me a few times about his very poor mental health and I just don't know how to approach it without seeming pushy or condescending or any of those negative things. He's a really amazing guy and one of the nicest you'll ever meet, but every day I seem him put everyone else above himself. He lost his father to suicide when he was a child and this seems to have forced him into the ""tough man"" stereotype. He is uncomfortable sharing his emotions, and the couple (literally 2) times we have talked about his emotions he has trouble making eye contact and has started to cry.

He has a girlfriend and has for a little over 2 years now, he's a college freshman and they have already sorta made the decision that they're going to get married and live happily ever after. However it seems like she isn't realizing the scope of his mental health out of her own selfishness.  If she notices he's feeling bad she just asks if he's ok, and of course he says yes, and then they move on. He has been on SSRI's since april or may and they weren't producing the desired effect so they recently doubled his dosage, to seemingly no avail.

He's said things like, ""I don't really feel like I think anymore"", ""Just going through the motions"", and ""I don't know where my motivation comes from"" a few times to me and that, I imagine is where the largest part of his depression comes from. Him and his girlfriend do the same short list of things, of which he has told me (but not her) that he is tired of doing. Things like watching youtube, playing video games, and taking naps. He constantly puts every one of her needs well above his own, and makes a point not to disagree, asking if she's ok with doing a certain task, she then asks if he's ok doing that task, this then repeats until they just pick something. 

I've offered to talk with him if he needs to, he's said he's ok. I guess my question is what are some ways to move forward so that he doesn't feel so stuck, what are some ways I could help him understand that being a subordinate in a relationship isn't just ok? Every time I think of something to ask him, I always hear it coming out as me sticking my nose where it doesn't belong, however if he's miserable and nobody is making any effort to do anything other than the same shit, isn't it my prerogative to help my friend?

So I don’t really comment or post stuff as I don’t use social media but I found this page while searching for good advising on Google and I really really need some advice so I’m making this exception. So I really like this girl who I know from my workplace. Me and her are really really good friends. I really like her, she’s different, shes perfect. She seems to be so much like me. She has freckles and she likes to listen to good music. She has a beautiful smile and she has naturally curly, brown hair yet she has dyed it black for now. Shes just very very entrancing. She likes to read and she draws. I’ve liked her for almost 7 months now yet I’ve never made any moves because and here’s the problem: she already has a boyfriend. I like to think that Im respectful towards women and I am a feminist as well so I haven’t ever said anything about my feelings as I don’t want to ruin my friendship and her relationship. So She’s been dating this guy for a year now and its eating me up from the inside. I don’t show it or anything and I’m happy for her but the guy she’s dating is a total douche. He acts like a completely different person in public when he’s with her. She likes Kpop singers though she’s white and she thinks that Kpop idols are good looking/pretty no matter the gender and this guy acts so insecure and tells her that he wants to blow his brains out just because she likes these idol. He’s jealous of Kpop idol she doesn’t even know she just thinks they’re appealing to look at. He tells her shes ugly sometimes. He’s very toxic but she doesn’t seem to get it. I’ve never said anything about their relationship I stay out of it but her female friends tell her that he’s toxic and he’s falling out because he definitely acts like it but she just denies it because she seems to ""love"" him. He hated her having male friends too and tells her that he doesn’t like any of her male friends including me. All I want help with is (because I feel like I have no chance with her) how to just let go. I’ve been trying to just let go of my feelings but its hard. Im a recovering drug addict and for the last 2 months I’ve been clean but just because of my feelings I’ve been craving drugs so much just so I forget and lose my feelings.

I am perfectly fine with driving this vehicle, but now that my parents are aware that I am saving money to buy my own house they say I should buy a new car before hand.

So recently family members have been making comments etc “You sit down all day and do nothing” and “Its not like you have to do any manual labour or anything”

496,"I'm not freshly 25, and will be 26 before too long but I'm starting to FEEL it. I've always felt younger / more immature than my age on paper and right now I feel about 21.

It's always been fine though because I'm young and haven't had as much responsibilities or worries, but i also never really did that early 20s thing of going out, drinking, getting into all sorts of relationships or casual dating.

Right now, I couldn't be happier, I'm in a job and career I love. Im in my first ever relationship and we're going to be moving in together soon, all a first for me. I'm going to be applying to my dream job this month. I have a lot more responsbilities and a lot more to think about now, and while it's extremely exciting, does it mean I have to turn my back to my early 20s? 

I wasn't employed straight away out of university and it took some time to find my feet, in that time, and up to when the pandemic hit, I did get a job, moved city, I started to explore going out and drinking more - I got really into music, really in to gigs (going to up to 3 a week), but I was about 24 and now im approaching 26 is it too late to be in a space thats occupied by students, people in their early 20s and people who are more free of the responsbilities that I am taking on? I can't imagine talking to a 21 year old about investing in funds, lol. I'm starting to realise the huge gap between 21 and 25.

I didn't have the ""typical"" student experience... and my question is, can I still be an ""adult"" while also juggling the more fun / less harmful aspects of the early 20s experience without seeming like a tryhard wannabe? Im in a stable and wonderful relationship with my boyfriend so I don't care that i didn't do the reckless dating thing (thank god), but i wanna stand around in vintage clothing that's too big for me and talk shit about things i know nothing about over a really crap beer, listening to a band that look like theyve only just hit puberty, and not feel too old for it.

497,"Ok, so here's my situation. Im an aspiring animator with some occasional freelance work, but there is little opportunity near me for work outside of the odd bits and bobs.

1. I have an apartment and minimal outgoings, money saved up I can live on for 1 year whole.
2. I live alone, and the family dog is my responsibility now due to the pandemic (father is stuck abroad, siblings nearby but don't do much to help, mother died last year)
3. I am a transwoman in closet, and scared to come out over fear of rejection.
4. Fear of rejection is based around historical abuse in my family.
5. Father has control of inhererance mother wanted me to have (it is done as a direct debit monthly to get around tax) and could realistically cut me off from it, leaving me in a bit of a direr financial situation.
6. The currently pandemic has impacted on my employment, and the stress going on has impacted my mental health due even more so.

I have two ideas:

1. Come out, risk backlash and my family disowning me, live on my savings for the year and work on the skills I need to get work as the industries I actually WANT to be in pics up again.
2. Find a job now, come out, risk backlash/being disowned etc, not have the job I want, but have some income at the very least. This will, however, put me in a situation where I will struggle on the skill development due to the time needed to manage the dog, apartment, appointments etc. This risks my skills going a bit rusty and struggling to climb out of this later.

498,"Overall I'm actually very happy. I'm nearing 30 and this year, and I realize this is a very fortunate and outlier thing for me to say, but 2020 has been the best year of my life. Not because of covid and everything going on obviously, but because I've worked hard on myself to be happy and am seeing the fruits of that.  
  
I can remember what life was like in the 90s, 00s, and 10s. If I were to rank each decade, I would rank each one worse than the last. Optimists will point out technological advances and decreased poverty worldwide which is great, but they often don't mention the negatives. Dating is a gong show - it's weird to approach or be approached nowadays, dating apps are horrible, and if you move or don't have a social circle you're kind of screwed. Now with covid, it's even more difficult, and it seems unlikely anything will change soon. I could image being extremely bitter if I hadn't had a lot of great memories with women over my life.  
  
It seems like we're all more isolated. Friendships are becoming more shallow. Everything is becoming more shallow, it feels like life is posing for Instagram and nobody is alive and in the moment. We all must be reading self help books, running side hustles, living our 'fullest lives' etc instead of... enjoying this gift of life we have.  
  
I often just get a sense of society, culture, and life looking shallow, bleak, and pointless. I also don't see paths for things to get better. Political systems have changed from our tribal origins to the agricultural revolution to the industrial revolution. But our society is still based around the industrial revolution while we're far into the technological revolution and are soon going to enter the AI revolution. I remember ""pop culture"" and ""rap culture"" from the 00's changing things, but social media has changed our social lives beyond recognition to be about algorithms instead of human relationships.   
  
I feel like a simple life that previous generations aspired to - say a wife and kids, a modest rural house, reliable income, etc - is becoming exceedingly out of reach and unrealistic for most people around my age and younger. And I'm an extremely fortunate person - of my friend group I'm the highest educated,  highest income, have some status/following online based on my work and other kind of superficial markers - and I feel this way. It hurts to imagine what someone making half or a third of what I make, and not having the securities I have is feeling like.  
  
Is there something I'm missing here? Any reason to believe that society will improve during my lifetime? Any reason I shouldn't just become a hermit and live a lonely but peaceful life making the best of what I can? I just don't see the point in participating beyond my close friends and family anymore.

The building is old and walls are thin, and I don't think he has a lot of furniture to absorb sound so when he plays video games through the night, we hear every word he's shouting to his friends online. I don't want to be a mean neighbor, but it's frustrating to be woken up anywhere from 1-3 am by his shouting on a weeknight when my husband and I have work early the next day.

506,"I can't get enough hot water for a bath, I heat the water in the morning for 2 hours (it should stay hot in the tank) but I also turn it on for about an hour before I want to bathe in the evening.

I turn the tap on and the water is scalding, absolutely boiling, until the bath fills to about the level you'd bath a small baby. (Less water than I usually put in my toddler's bath) 

Then it goes lukewarm, then eventually stone cold, so even if I was to run myself a shallow bath just to cover my body, it's not really an enjoyable temperature. I have to grit my teeth, get in, wash, get out.

I would love an actually hot bath, filled to the top (well you know, not the top, but a high enough point for the average adult woman to relax in)

Anyway as the title says I'm currently 18 and I want to move out of my parents house to be closer to both school and work.

Here's the problem, I'm currently only doing a entry level course in a small college and will (hopefully) be going to university in 2 years. No matter what university I go to I'll be moving out anyway.

I've talked to several friends and my parents about this and they all say I should just wait the two years before moving and save up as much as I can now but idk if I can stick this house for 2 more years. My family isn't bad to me or anything but they have some issues with respecting personal boundaries and stuff. On top of this I suffer from depression and being constantly surrounded by my family during covid has made things tougher.

One thing that is worrying me is the fact that in my country landlords can charge you rates on top of your rent and utilities and I'm worried in case I'd get stuck with a crappy landlord who trys to take advantage of that.

I can see how it might be financially smarter to just stick it out and save up for a bit but I feel like moving out will give me the independence and freedom that I want. I've done lots of research on budgeting and how to live on your own and stuff so I feel like I could do it but would it be dumb for me to do this now when I'm still basically living for free?",23Sep2020,1

I have general anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, panic attack disorder, illness anxiety disorder, and attention deficit disorder. Having OCD and illness anxiety disorder during a pandemic has been, to be honest, crippling. Every day has been awful, I cannot get the thought out of my head that I and everyone I love will die a horrible death. On top of that, a loved one was just diagnosed with aggressive cancer earlier this month. The next week, a friend who was fighting pancreatic cancer died, just two days before his daughter’s wedding. Then my fiancé’s good friend died in a hiking accident in the Rocky Mountains. It’s been a cluster fuck for me emotionally. I’ve been having anxiety attacks and panic attacks at an unprecedented rate, I’ve started having dissociative episodes, and I’ve had migraines that sometimes last 24-48hrs. I understand that everyone goes through things, but I don’t want my professors to think I’m a lazy asshole. I’m just overwhelmed and I’m doing my best to keep up but I haven’t turned in an assignment in two and a half weeks.

517,"I'm in a tricky situation rn, a lot of you are probably going to roll your eyes thinking this is a stupid thing but just bear with me and if anybody has some advice I would really appreciate it.

I'm a 20 year old young woman, third year of college with straight A's so far (knock on wood lol), and I've been dating a boy (23M) for longer than a year now. I trust him more than anyone I've ever been with before, and since I've been with him my health and happiness has increased so much. For the first time in years I have my self confidence back, I have the motivation to excercise regularly, study hard, and eat healthy. I've even been more confident in making friends and hanging out with people (something I've never been very good at before). 

All that is well and good, we're very happy together, and we want to move in together. 

So here's where it gets tricky, I come from a wealthy family, and my parents are adamant about my studies and constantly worry about distractions. To the point where they've even discouraged me from getting a job unless it's in my field of study, up until recently I was perfectly fine with living this way because it's nice to not worry about bills and food costs. My parents are paying for my school and housing, bless them. But I've been trying to find a job to start on becoming financially independent, but with the pandemic it's been impossible to even get an entry level position anywhere.

The thing is, with the pandemic, my classes are mostly online, but my school, and the city where my boyfriend lives is a 5 hour flight from my parents town. My parents seemed to be perfectly fine with forcing me to live with them all summer and I was having to bargain with them to even let me go back to the city. (I say ""Forcing"" because I had no choice, my parents arent abusive but they did lie to me to get me to comply with their wishes, especially in times like these)

This summer was a really hard time for me and my mental state, long story short, my mom and I didnt get along (lots of comments about my body, and rude comments about my boyfriend), and I really relapsed back into my old depression and then some when I had to live in my old house.

That's whatever, I'm back now and I'm happy. The thing is I've told my parents that I want to move in with my boyfriend and they wont let me and I really dont agree with their reasons, which are:

It's expensive
My grades will drop
My boyfriend isnt as financially affluent
My boyfriend and his roommate might clash and if that goes badly I'll be caught in the middle of it
The apartment is small and I wont have space to work

But these arguments dont hold water:

It's cheaper than my current living situation
I've been unofficially living with him for a few months now and my grades are fine
Despite the fact that we're in a pandemic and money is tight my boyfriend is fine
My boyfriend's roommate is planning on moving out when I move in and
There will be an extra room when that happens that we can use as a study.

There's also the fear of us breaking up but this isnt my first serious relationship and I have a really good feeling about him.

The compromise we came to for now is that my parents are literally paying thousands of dollars a month for an apartment that I dont sleep in :///. (No I never lied to them, I was clear from the get-go I was going to be spending the nights at his place and they specifically said they wanted to spend the money on a different apartment ""even if you never stay there"")

This frustrates me because its a waste of money, and it's in a bad side of town too, I dont feel safe going about my business there like I do at my boyfriend's place. (For context in bf's neighborhood you see mothers taking young children out, the neighbors always smile and wave at you, and it's safe to walk at night and go for runs as a woman. In the side of town where my parents apartment is I get whistled and yelled at regularly, nobody is very friendly, and it's not safe to be out after dark)

Obviously moving in with my boyfriend feels like my best and safest option. But my parents wont let me and to be honest it feels like their reasons are rooted in the fact that at this exact age my brother had moved in with his girlfriend of 6 months and wound up taking a leave of absence from school because she cheated and dumped him. :///

I want to be confident in my decision to do this, but I can't with everyone telling me I cant trust my instincts. So I'm asking you if you guys think this is a good idea or if I'm acting like a lovestruck teenager.

If you think I should, I could use some advice on how to even talk about it with my parents too, every time I try I feel like I solidify their opinion that I'm obsessive and crazy, and I always end up feeling like an ungrateful bratty child.",23Sep2020,1

520,"Sorry for my so-so english.

I'm currently enrolled in one of the toughest degrees as a foreign student, the duration of which is supposed to be 6 years, but I'm about to finish the 7th year now, with a number of exams that I just can't stop postponing. My parents go from being encouraging to just being low-key nervous about me not finishing already, and I feel like a fucking leech.

I should elaborate and say that the first 4 years, although being TOUGH AS HELL I still managed to do fine. Through the 5th year I had a nightmarish time because of A LOT of shit happening to me that I really had no control over, shit just kept getting worse and worse until I just couldn't get out of bed, I couldn't study anymore, being a foreign student and suffering from social anxiety (meaning I have no to talk to, I avoid my flatmates like fire even though they are completely decent people) really didn't help at all. I just stopped functioning. Yes, I had suicidal thoughts, I had weekly bouts of just planning for hours how and when I was gonna do it.

And then Covid hit.

I came back to my home country and soon after I couldn't go to the degree-country because of the lockdowns, I thought that I would automatically cheer up like I did in the past because here I was, with my family and friends, but no. I still couldn't get out of bed, I still wanted to die all the time. So I talked with my parents about it, went to a psychiatrist and got on Venlafaxine. About 4 weeks into treatment my depression vanished i.e suddenly after not stepping out of my house for 4 weeks straight I suddenly felt joyous and wanted to do shit, still no studying though. But I wanted to live again.

The social anxiety was still there though, so we upped the dosage 2 more times and on the second time... it vanished. I couldn't believe it, I didn't feel like people were watching me all the time anymore, I didn't give a shit about how I sounded, and I went from not having a date in more than 3 years (and 4 years before that, yep) to having 4 dates in one week. Wasn't even nervous at those dates, kept being funny and talking with them for hours etc. Something that I would've considered ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME before that.

Why am I telling you this though? To tell you guys that I'm not depressed anymore, I probably successfully cured my social anxiety which has been detrimental for me since at least puberty, but I STILL CAN'T FUCKING GET MYSELF TO STUDY. How how how do I go back to studying all day long like I used to? I just keep finding reasons all throughout the day to keep myself from studying, on the one hand now that I feel like I'm not mentally ill anymore I could go on and have the amazing life I always wanted but thought I could never have but on the other hand I can't bring myself to study enough to pass my fucking exams, I just don't know how to reignite that fire.",23Sep2020,1

I have no clue what to do with my life. I am 21f turning 22 in less than a month. I almost got my bachelor degree to teach teens math. I have a boyfriend for almost 5 years. And one friend who has a busy life. And my realtion with my parents is stable. The rest of the family is not exsiting in my life.

So now I feel a bit lost. I am looking for a job as a math teacher. But there aren't many jobs here for me. They always told me that you get a job in an instance but that isn't true. So it is a bit depressing. School was always my escape from everything else. And I liked to suround myself with a lot of people. But now school is ending and I have almost no one to be with. 

I feel the need to learn more. But I feel like doing a master or something is a waste of time. I know that I don't need a master to do what I like. But at the same time I can't do what I like. So what should I do?

I do need people around me. From the beginning of covid (march 2020) I have been alone a lot. And a lot of people have. But I cant find a new way to surround myself with people. To go and have fun with, to laugh with and make memories. It feels like I want to be the student I wasn't. Or the teen that I never was. But with covid and everything going on I feel stuck. And I have no clue what to do.

I tried out dancing but no on turned up. And it was just me and the teacher. I am trying to find a job. But nothing really seems to work out. And styding for the last part of my bachelor isn't working eather.

I've been friends online with this one person for around 3 months now, she has several mental conditions such as PTSD, depression, anxiety, etc. 

I'm well aware of the events and problems she has in her life, such as being stuck in a household with an emotionally abusive mother, problems with her being  way too easily stressed, and numerous friendship problems with others that's all degrading her mental health.

As our friendship progresses, she's been unknowingly hurting me in the process, she's been insensitive, mentally degrading, and sometimes just downright rude. 

I have done a lot for her in the past months, I tried helping her when she gets bursts of negative thoughts, remove contact from other friends of mine, help her stay clean of selfh*rm, and even prevented her to do an attempt.

But ever since that attempt, I've been filled with great worry and anxiety that all I ever bother to do now is make sure she never stays upset, it's slowly becoming even more unhealthy for me and our friendship and her attitude towards me are only causing me immense harm to my mental health.

I have thought of ending things with her but I simply can't, I am all that she has left who she trusts completely, if I leave, I'm afraid there'll be noone there to help her when she's getting s*icidal thoughts and she may end up attempting again.

However if I stay, I myself will disregard my own health for the sake of hers, she's made me feel the lowest I've ever been and it genuinely doesn't make me as happy to be with her anymore if that's all she'll do.

in a system affected by any source of gravity, (g−) = Eη² - (g+)
in a system which convert or harvest potential energy into electric energy while producing free fall, (g−) = E1η² - (g+) - E2η

i completed the equation without breaking any theories and laws of physic.

first of all i am an introvert that have been living alone since march due to some circumstances. i live in one of my uncle's house and i got 60-90$ worth of money a month from my aunt for food. the work itself is not my specialty, it just a hobby of mine trying to solve things while reducing my negative thoughts.

here some problems. i do not have any credibility. i tried to explain to everyone i know by showing my formulated spreadsheet (borrowed my cousin's laptop). instead of listening, they start to see me as a crazy person. its like explaining a new discovered religion to them. worst thing was yesterday. i ask permission from my aunt to take some scrap metal (that have been lying down from God's know when) at my grandma's house backyard to make a model to explain my discovery. answer was no with alot of excuses.
i continued by asking google alot of things just to get myself some depressing solutions like scientific peer review and how hard reality is.

the question is, what should i do?
i do not wish for fame or wealth. i dont intend to patent cause the benefit would be literally astronomical. a small token of appreciation will be more than enough for me after someone completed a prototype using my theory.


regarding my discovery. 
free fall is a 4dimentional force. it has no real body similar to gravity.
η²  is the system eficiency (which humanity can create in any size depending on the load). 
using same efficiency while giving twice energy input will get you four times amount of free fall. the eficiency still can be increased by development.
this system can be used to create the force while harvesting or converting the mechanism into energy itself while still producing free fall but with amount reduced.
this is not using any air friction to levitate. its also will be wasteful if trying to use combustion engine since we cant convert or reproduce fuel.
wont this be able to create infinite energy? no. the energy created will only be as much as current maximum energy conversion technology.
will it be able to power a space ship? i simulated space-x's falcon9. the system needs 237.44 mWh worth of electrical energy (which equals around 31k usd per hour) to accelerate at 1g speed. it dont have speed. it can only accelerate.

536,"(19m)I’m currently a student in a university completely for free on track to earning an MBA in management. I’ve always been entrepreneurial and a musician my whole life which got me into this school for free. The thing is, I’m always seeing shit online and in people I talk to saying you don’t need school to be successful and that it’s a waste of time. Originally I wanted to hop straight into a trade after high school but this opportunity came up so I took it. I’m in my second year right now planning to transfer to a more creative/driven school for free so I can be around people that help me make my entrepreneurial ideas work out. 

But a part of me always has this doubt saying dude. Just drop out, work a trade, and chase your dreams but I don’t know what that’s like. 

I guess what I need is a sense of reassurance? Or Is it validation? What do you think of my situation? Am I overthinking? I just want to do what’s right for me but sometimes feel like school is a waste of my time. I’m not around people similar to me in college, mostly around lazy people or corny business people. I don’t see the value in my degree if I want to do a trade anyways. Maybe I need some heavy hitting truth. Everyone I’ve ever talked to just says to stay in school because it’s free.",23Sep2020,1
538,"In the past few months or so my boyfriend and I broke up and I am having a really hard time coping with that. We still live together unfortunately, he doesn’t have any friends or family up here that he can stay with and the same goes for me. On top of this breakup, I am currently trying to find a job and this has been fruitless for the past few months. I have no support system to fall back on and he has said he’s not going to move out until he knows I am financially secure otherwise I’d end up homeless. It’s the least he can do but being trapped in a house with him constantly whilst dealing with the worst depression of my life, I fear that it is actually going to kill me. He told me he’s been much more happier without me and that he didn’t actually want to be in a relationship whilst he was with me which hurt A LOT. I am so far gone that nothing distracts me from my pain. I can’t even eat lately because my anxiety is debilitating. I’m sleeping 10-12 hours a night and I barely ever have any energy to move. It feels like my existence is pain, I’m suffering constantly and I can’t stop crying every 5 minutes. I’ve started self harming again too after 4 years of being clean.

I’ve had nobody to talk to about my suicidal thoughts and one night we were opening up to each other and I told him how I was feeling and he freaked out and couldn’t stop crying. It felt like the only way he cares about me is if I was dead because we agreed on still seeing each other with the physical side of a relationship. I know this will hurt me in the long run and make things worse but at the same time I don’t want him to pretend to want to be with me just to keep me alive. He knows how much pain I’m in but most of the time doesn’t ask how I’m doing or even acknowledge that I’m in the same house as him. Being around him gives me anxiety to the point where I’ve had to go and throw up a few times. I know he’s not good for me but he’s all I want at the moment. 

I don’t know what to do. I have nowhere to get away from this situation and it looks like I’ll be stuck with him even longer as we might be going in to a second lockdown soon too. At this point it feels like death is the only option for me. Everyday feels like a nightmare that I can’t get out of.

I also have a Bachelor's degree in theatre concentrated on stage and production management, and i plan on getting a second bachelors or a masters after covid.


I've been looking for full time work since April, and haven't had any luck. Even tried part time jobs in retail but haven't heard anything back. I'm used to working all the time so the free time is really getting to me. I'm not really sure what to do now.

542,"Over quarantine, I(21M) caught feelings for a girl(21F) and it was great and we went on dates. I finally got the courage to tell her how I felt about her, and sadly it did not go to plan. She declined stating that she was not ready due to trauma from her past relationship (It's pretty bad stuff). She also said that she felt a genuine connection to me, and still wanted to hangout. I told her that since this did not go the way I had planned, I needed some space to figure out how to go forward. But it has been over a week, and I'm still struggling with this. It was not a hard no, she still wants to be around me, and her past trauma is a very valid reason why someone would be not ready for dating. I want to at least be able to try to be her friend and hang out again, but emotionally the wound is still fresh and I fear that I will fall for her again. And for the people who say I should move on, morally I cannot due to her traumas, that's not what good people do.

544,"I recently graduated high school and I have absolutely no idea what course to pick, let alone what I want to do with my life job wise. Many of older people I’ve asked tell me to “follow my dreams” and “pursue my passions” but realistically I know that not everyone gets to do this and have a steady income. 

Should I let my passions (I have avg performance in these pursuits) stay a hobby and have a practical job, or make one of my passions my job? 

I have vague knowledge from the news and social media that living in this economy is not an easy thing to do. I do not want to be rich, I just want to live a relatively comfortable life in a small apartment in some nice neighborhood. The income I need will ideally support these things, and if possible, I will have a little extra to apply for therapy. 

I understand that we are progressing towards a more technology-based market. Should I apply for a course that is related to that so I know there are jobs available to me once I graduate uni?

552,"So like the title but it’s lengthy and I’ll try to keep it concise. Back in 2010 I met J which started out as friends but I had already developed feelings for him and then we spoke every day all day over Christmas break. I still think fondly of him and I feel guilty about it because H doesn’t deserve for me to think about J 8 years later. J was older and a bit geeky, had his hobbies and his own baggage (molested as a young boy) but he was always smiling and I adored his laugh and smile. We dated for a short time but during that time it always seemed kind of disconnected – we got along better as friends even though I desperately wanted to be with him – he would do small gestures or say things that would convey that he cared about me and had feelings for me as well. (One of my favorite memories is we were laying in bed after watching something and we were just talking, he was spooning me, hugged me close and kissed my neck – I felt so loved in that moment by him.)

&amp;#x200B;

I met H in between my time with J, in early 2011 I started dating H and I was still really good friends with J. I was constantly struggling with my feelings for J because for the longest time I had feelings for him, we hung out a lot after class, spoke online and/or texted. Around this time I started to back off on my friendship with J because I was feeling guilty that while H knew about my friendship, he didn’t know the extent (at the time.) So I cut communication with J and then over the summer H and I broke up. Afterwards I reached out to J again and still had unresolved feelings, which he knew about. It was like no time had gone by, he understood why I cut ties and we picked up where we left off. We slept together a few times and he still was being romantic but also stand offish at the same time all the while acting as if this was normal. I started to feel sad, less than, not good enough, and maybe even depressed but I so wanted to keep him around that I ignored what I was feeling. Eventually after months and months I asked him straight out what was going on with us and he explained that he really enjoyed being friends but didn’t see me “in that way.” That stung and he apologized for making me feel like there was still something between us, I could tell he felt horrible and meant his apologies because of how well I knew him as a person deep down. I often wonder if his up-bringing, and being molested as a child caused this weird friendship…. Even after this “talk” he still sometimes would kiss me and act wonderfully to me which then put back in a spiral of “why am I not good enough?”

&amp;#x200B;

I cut J out again, not entirely, but if we were together it was for school work only and we wouldn’t hang out alone just with other friends (still struggling to keep my feelings at bay because his smile got me every time.) At first I was sad that I didn’t have J as a friend anymore because he was a big friendship in my college years, but over time the happy I found outside of him outweighed the sadness. In late 2012 I cut him out completely because I got back together with H and have been together ever since – we got married June 1, 2019 and we’re going strong.

&amp;#x200B;

But…. Over the last year I’ve been having dreams about J. Old memories from college, new scenarios, and in future. Most recent was this past weekend. It felt so real and when I woke up I felt nostalgic and sad and horrible for having this dream because H was sleeping next to me. The dream was we ran into each other (which would never happen as we live in different states) on a busy sidewalk, we walked past each other then I turned around and he was also turning around looking for me. He let out my name in an excited way and flashed his smile at me. We agreed to talk so found a bench and sat down. From there it gets hazy but we talked about college and the feelings we shared – at one point we both started tearing up, last thing I remember was we were embracing each other and he said something along the lines of  “I wish we could go on and be together like how badly you want me.” Then I woke up.

&amp;#x200B;

Once before I had this same feeling like I can’t shake him – I wrote a letter to him and didn’t hold anything back – I never sent it and since deleted it and it was fine for a while until this past weekend. Since then J has been on my mind, I miss him and the easy going friendship we had. Why is this happening? I’m married and we’re trying for baby #1 and working to better our life together….

553,"Hi, I'm in a really confusing and difficult situation with work and I'm not sure what to do. 

A few weeks ago, I accepted a position to do an apprenticeship in IT through a recruitment agency (company A) to work at another company (company B). The job posting, my conversations with company A, and some course documents I was sent, all said two crucial things

1: The salary starts at one amount, rising by about 30% after 6 months. It's not great pay (fine, it's an apprenticeship) but it's liveable for 15 months with very strict budgeting.

2: The apprenticeship lasts 12-15 months depending on completion of assessments and whatnot.

I was excited and all ready to go. I'm meant to start next Tuesday. Two days ago, I received the contract to sign from company B, and it had absolutely no mention of a pay rise, and said the apprenticeship lasts 24 months. These are deal breakers as I have budgeted very specifically to allow for the pay rise and a maximum of 15 months in this position. Any less pay, or any longer, will put me in a very difficult financial position.

I emailed company B to clarify this, and I got a non-answer regarding the pay rise, and was told their standard apprenticeship is 24 months. I emailed company A with my concerns, and received a reply yesterday saying they would look into it and let me know today. It's now 15:52 and I've heard nothing, rang three times and gone to voicemail. If I hear back that either the pay rise isn't happening or that the contract is 24 months, I will have to decline the position. If it turns out that what I was told originally will be the case, I need to ask for the contract to be amended to reflect this, which is gonna be a whole other hassle since I start in less than a week.

I've handed in my notice at my current job already, and they're now asking people to take voluntary redundancy due to COVID slowing the business down, so asking for my old job back isn't an option. I'm very fortunate that I can work with my dad if it comes to it (kitchen fitting), and I'm becoming more and more tempted to just quit on the whole thing and ask to work with my dad permanently and learn the trade.

Basically I'm really struggling with how to handle this situation. I'm 24, and I think it's reasonable to not want to do a two year apprenticeship at well below minimum wage, but I've quit on things before and felt like a loser so that is affecting my judgement here. It's also worth mentioning that I suffer from anxiety and depression. My fiance is the only reason I'm keeping it together right now. Sorry for the long post, but any advice will be seriously appreciated.",23Sep2020,1
554,"It has been hard to find a job after this global pandemic happened, so I have been seeking for a new job after quitting my previous one. The one I found right now is a new franchise that just opened in my country, so obviously they were hiring and I took the job. 

It all went well, I got along good with my colleagues and managers. It is definitely a good working environment until the boss of the franchise came into the picture.

One day during work, he texted me and asked me how is the sales in our shop. I thought it was normal of him to ask me since he was the boss so I just replied that it was doing okay. After that, he asked me when was I knocking off, so I told him the time. Then, he said “That’s late, I thought of dating you.” followed by a “🤫” emoji. I started to panic, and since my manager was present in the shop, I told her about it. I think she texted him about it, and she told me he said he was joking and that if anything happens, she will protect me. It might have been a joke but it just seems so inappropriate. 

Another incident that just happened today was that our manager had sent a picture of the shop to the groupchat which included our boss. In the picture, there was just me at the cashier. And he replied, saying, “The picture is nice, there is something I like.” I did not say anything or reply to the groupchat, and no one said anything either. 

He comes to the shop time to time and I try to avoid him. I feel uncomfortable around him.

559,"Okay. Throwaway account bc obv. But I need some advice here. It's rather long, but I appreciate the read and opinion. Here it goes.

Last night my gf of a year (23) and I (23) hung out. She asked to come over to my place after I got off work, and I agreed. She shows up all dolled up with a bottle of wine. Now, we've been going through a rough patch so this was very welcome. We sat and talked and drank (the entire bottle of) wine and a few beers. It was really nice. We were both inebriated (we both don't drink too much) and she asked if I wanted to smoke (marijuana). She doesn't smoke but I do send me regularly and she knows that I prefer marijuana to alcohol. I said sure, and went and got my bowl. After I took a bit she said she'd smoke with me. I thought that was cool so I passed it to her. She took one hit and was good. We continued to sit and talk and tell stories as I smoked another two bowls myself. At this point I'm pretty high and decently drunk. As is she. After a bit, I lean in and kiss her and we start making out.

This is where the problem arises.

After we make out for a bit I lean back and she charges after me and starts rubbing on me and trying to do foreplay. I, of course, am down for this, but she and I both are prone to laps in judgement due to bipolar disorder. We've agreed previous to this night that we would stop whatever we're doing and look at each other and say, ""Is this what you want? Is this really you? Are you sure?"". That has worked several times in the past for us. So, I did that. She assured me that it was all her and that she just really missed me and wanted me. So we continued and ended up having sex a few times. EACH time, might I add, she initiated it not with just kissing or something like that, but full on unprompted oral sex or nude grinding. 

To be fair, there were a few times throughout the night where she looked like she was spacing out. During those times we stopped and I backed off the sex because that's not what I want to do (I have a giant fear of taking advantage of someone because of some things in my past that have happened to me). After comforting her and talking to her and lightly making some jokes and making her feel better, she would Tell me she loved me and wanted to be with me and wanted to marry me and then be all over me again. I'm going to say this again: each time that we engaged in intercourse, she initiated it and perpetuated it. And each time, I would stop and ask her if this is really what she wanted and if she's okay and what not. (Keep in mind, we're both pretty drunk /stoned). 

Anyway later on in the night she gets upset all of a sudden and throws her clothes on and goes downstairs. I sit with her for two hours as we're both sobering up and she is getting increasingly upset. I don't know what's happening because she won't really talk to me, and it's really frustrating me. After a while we argue for a bit (about unrelated drama) and she goes home.

Now this morning, she's telling me that I took advantage of her, and that I raped her. She says she couldn't give consent because she was messed up. But I was too?? And I didn't initiate any of it..

562,"I met a few people on discord back in January and ever since then I guess you could say we've been pretty close friends. We made our own little server together and everything was fine. But lately I've felt like they'd just be better if I left? Idk, it just seems like they have more fun talking when I'm not around. And sometimes it's really obvious they dont wanna talk to me. When I say hi in the chat, I noticed one of the people specifically ignores me or they respond saying hi but they dont seem too excited to talk to me? But then when our other friend says hi they respond almost right away every time and they're always happy to talk to them.

Maybe I'm just a dry texter but when we have conversations and I'm there, sometimes I feel ignored or unimportant. For example, when I'm having a conversation with one person in the server, they almost always bring up the other person. Like I'll say something then they wont really acknowledge what I said and instead they just talk about how the other person did that too. Like yeah, if it happens once or twice idc but it happens *all the time*. I seriously cannot have a conversation alone with this person without them bringing her up. It's always about her. And when they have conversations they never talk about me. Yeah that sounds super selfish, but honestly, can you not have at least a bit of decency to not bring her up in almost every conversation you have????? 

Theres honestly so much more they do that makes me mad and stuff but I dont feel like going over all of it. I'm just so tired of constantly feeling like some of my only friends would be better off without me. And I care about them a lot. I love talking to them. But I know that it's not good to always be around them if doing so constantly makes me feel like shit. It's just that every time I try to leave i always come back. Always. Is it even a good idea to leave? Should i stay? And if i should leave, how? How do I stop myself from going back? I dont want to leave them by blocking them and leaving the servers because that just seems rude. I'm just wondering if anyone has any advice for this situation because this has been going on for way too long. Am I just overreacting?",23Sep2020,1

She calls herself stupid to make other people want to help her. Not for us to say she’s not stupid. She gave her brother a drill and said she didn’t know which way to turn the chuck to tighten it. There is literally *literally* no way she didn’t know. Constantly she makes herself appear as clueless because it makes her brother feel better if he can do little so called manly tasks. It’s almost exclusively him she does this for. It boosts his ego, which is what she claims to be aiming for because she believes if she doesn’t he’ll kill himself. He, to me, has an insanely inflated ego already. There’s a million little incidents like this that happen daily where she asks him to do something for her. No one else really does this because he genuinely doesn’t have any tool or building intuition. Which is fine, plenty of people don’t. He just bulls and thrashes his way thru any project so we don’t normally ask him for help. (Usually, he inserts himself in because he thinks he’s the man of the house, no where close). I get if this sounds like I’m an ass but I’m not trying to degrade him. Mom does have an intuition for cars, tools, and building but he admits he doesn’t.

567,"I recently had a lump start to develop on the outside of my gum, around the area I had seen a dentist 6mo ago due to tooth pain.

Turns out, when he repaired a cavity on that tooth at the time, he drilled too deep to the root and caused inflamation. As a result I started having tooth pain again about 2 months afterwards.

I called to schedule an appointment to follow up about the pain and explained it was the tooth he had addressed before and that it was a different pain. Their office lost power and fell behind on appointments and had to cancel mine. They never rescheduled with me, not sure if that's entirely my fault or partial there. Whatever the case, the pain slowly diminshed or at least it wasn't anything that reminded me to make another appointment again.

Well the lump formed about 2 weeks ago, so I got an appointment last week and it turns out the swelling cut off circulation of blood and there is an abscess that has eaten away a fair amount of bone in my jaw.

The dentist presented two options:

1) a root canal he'd perform in order to attempt to save the tooth, even though he openly said he couldn't guarentee with that amount of bone loss that the tooth would hold indefinitely.

2) a dental surgeon remove the tooth and put in bone graft so I can maybe have a dental implant someday in the future when I can afford it.

I bring up the 'afford it' because my dental benefits are exhausted for the year already. Everything here on is OOP. I know I can't put this off at all, especially if bone loss is ongoing. 

The root canal - only benefit might be from keeping the tooth, but it would be a dead tooth so does that even matter? It's more expensive up-front and probably will fall out eventually at which point I'd be back where I am now...

Here's where I'm looking for advice. This sucks, both physically that I'm at this point and pain tolerance allowed me to almost ignore a significant problem, and also financially. Since they ate up my dental benefits doing the filling on the tooth, and if they had seen me at the original follow up appointment it probably wouldn't have gotten this far - can you ask a medical provider for your money back on a procedure? Can I ask them to apply that cost to the cost of the upcoming procedure? Do I have any level of recourse or financial ground to stand on? Has anyone gone through something similar?

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR - Had dental filling this year &amp; used up insurance. Now same tooth has died as a result of filling and delayed treatment. Not sure if I should even consider a root canal or just have it pulled, and unsure if I can even ask a medical provider to accept partial blame and help with cost of resulting issues/treatment.",23Sep2020,1

When I got into middle school, it cut down to maybe twice a week, but she also wanted to do it at night to keep it straight. I always thought it was like a bonding thing, but turns out she didn’t like the curls when I was an infant so she started straightening my hair when I was starting to walk. She did so because she said with the curls she couldn’t tell if my father was really my father. Between that and the overall product buildup, my hair was completely straight. 

I shaved my hair two years ago and it came back in with these huge curls. According to the charts online with the 2A -4C curls, mine are (I think) 2C.

Recently I have been feeling depressed and stressed for a reason that might or might not be my fault.

Background: I(a teenager: i wont reveal age nor gender in case the people i am talking about finds this post) have been in a friend group for about 2-3 years now. I also have social anxiety that none of my friends know about so, i have trouble making friends. I also find it difficult to stand up for myself as i feel that my group of friends might ostracise me.

So, I have this friend (A) which is pretty blunt. A usually calls me “two-faced”, “extra” and is close friends with B. A and B are both considered as close friends to me. A is friends with everyone. A knows tea about everyone and usually shares it with everyone else in our friend group, except for me. A thinks that i am not trustworthy and unreliable. A also thinks that I have a big mouth and that if A tells me anything the entire school will know about it. Whenever I try to join in A’s conversation with our friends, A usually calls me extra and asks me to shut up. However, the thing is that A and our friends are part of a chat group. A was the one who wanted to share the tea with everyone. Whenever i try to reply to a comment about the tea that A is sharing, I get called irrelevant and is asked to shut up. Their words really hurt me but I dont know how to tell that to them without them getting offended. I tried telling A to private message B and other friends if she doesn’t want me knowing all those tea. But A never listens. I feel that A is purposely trying to leave me out of certain conversations. 

My view on this is that A calls me two faced and not trust worthy, but I think that A is a hypocrite. Isnt A the one who is spreading all these secrets about other people to everyone? Isnt A the one who is untrustworthy about keeping secrets? 

Now, I dont think A thinks of me as a friend anymore although we have been friends for about 5 years.
I really want to save this relationship that i have with A and the rest of our friends but i am lost.

I am asking for advice for what i should do next

I (20F) don't know how to write this properly but I think I'd feel better if I write it down. I've posted this in another thread cause I feel I need an external opinion. I've always been an independent and academically oriented kid. Both my parents work and I started staying home alone and taking care of my sister ever since I was 8. My parents never liked to do that but they had to work to give us a good future. It's funny cause at that time everyone used to tell how mature I was and I took that a as a big compliment. 
I'm very focused on my education. I've taken a big loan and I have to get a good job to pay it off. My grades have never dropped but I'm afraid I have to learn alot more to get one. (I'm from a CS background so theory will not help). My parents constantly remind me to never worry about the loan and I honestly don't think I do. But I'm never able to relax. I have to keep working. I also teach part time so that's a good distraction. But the second I stop being productive I'm overwhelmed by so many intrusive thoughts. I hate it so much. I also noticed lately, I've started to sweat alot at the slightest inconvenience. I'll admit, I do get tensed when things don't happen the way I plan but now, even though I'm able to come to a solution without getting too anxious about it, by the time I'm  finished with it I'll be drenched in my own sweat.
I don't know if it's related but at night, somehow I can never manage to convince myself that the all the switches are switched off. I don't know why it's just with this one particular thing but I force myself to get up and check although I KNOW I switched it off. This is so dumb but if i ever stop myself from checking I get this horrible feeling something bad will happen to the people I love. I feel so stupid writing this. 
I have a happy life and a supportive family I have no reason to feel this way. The only bad incident that has probably happened is the relationship I got out of 7 months ago which lead to harassment but I don't think it has affected me. Am I overthinking this?

Normally this wouldn't be a problem, but the way he said it sounded like he meant it, and I just looked at him with an ""Are you serious"" type of look, and he was like ""My bad go ahead."".

My fantasises and dreams are so much more interesting than living this mundane life. I’ve considering a various amount of things to try such as acting and dancing. But then I’m like “whats the point? Can’t be bothered.”

There’s just so much self hatred and anger burning inside me every single day. I’m miserable and take it out on other people which I’m guilty for. Unfortunately it’s like my brain is wired this way and there’s nothing that will help. There’s the brain fog and lack of motivation every day. 

I’ve tried changing my diet and exercise but land up giving up on the 3rd day, wondering “what’s the point?” Food makes me happy, but unfortunately weight gain comes with overeating every single day. Some guys have told me I’m attractive and they wanna date me etc, though in my head it’s all bullshit. I haven’t even had sex with a guy lol. Then again.. I’m only 18. Feel like I don’t even deserve it. I’m fucking ugly and fat. I’ve slit my legs before, as a release, but it only just gives me scars in the end. 

My life isn’t even that bad, it’s this stupid mindset and battle in my head I have to deal with every day of my life. I’m too pussy to hang myself or overdose. I think it’s because at the back of my mind I’m wondering what information or stuff on my phone people would find. My family is small as fuck so there’s that holding me back. My brother would be an only child and it’s just a shitty thought. 

I don’t wanna work a crappy job anymore. Of course, nothing gets handed to you in life, I understand that. Just don’t really have the energy to push myself to be honest. It’s even harder finding other/ better jobs in the whole Covid 19 situation. Maybe I’m just an ungrateful bitch. 

Just feel so alone, even though I speak to people online. It’s not really the same. If I could pack up my bags and leave I would. Dunno where, maybe a different country. I see why people can’t cope without having a girlfriend or boyfriend now. Love is such a strong and beautiful emotion. Unconditional love, romantically speaking. I just... I dunno how to help myself to be honest. Feel stuck in life.

This is a problem that I'm sure most people have encountered at some point or another. I bought an E-Bike off of an amazon vendor and it was dead on arrival. Seems to be mostly battery related. The seller has been completely unresponsive to return requests and only partially responsive regarding sending a replacement battery -- they make placating promises to send a new battery over asap but then do nothing. Then when I try to send follow up emails and phone calls I'm just ignored. The most recent call I had with an employee was yesterday when I tried reminding him that they promised to have the battery shipped out on Monday, to which he apologized repeatedly saying he forgot and that it would be sent to UPS end of day. Looking at the tracking info today, of course it shows it still hasn’t even been delivered to the shipping company.

How do I deal with these scumbags? I get the feeling the only way I'll get them to play ball is if I can be a big enough nuisance they just give me what I want. I have an address for the business and it's only about an hour and a half away, would it be appropriate to show up at the facility and ask for the battery in person?

589,"I just learned tinder only shows profiles that have been ACTIVE in the past 7 days and I’m worried my bf may have been using it

So I’ve been with my boyfriend for about 5 months and it’s been great. He’s supportive and caring and reassured me plenty. I’m happy with him but we haven’t gotten to the “love” part yet.

Maybe like 2 months ago, my friend texted me she saw him on tinder and sent me the screenshots of his page. I saw he had the app on his phone but I trusted him enough to not ask. I literally thought he forgot to delete it off his phone (I was a little skeptical but I ignored it). I asked him about it after my friend texted me and he said he swore he wasn’t using it and then went and deleted it. Haven’t seen it on his phone since, but then again I’m not really looking. We met on a dating app so I figured maybe after that he forgot to remove it. I really wasn’t worried. 

Fast forward to now, I saw a video saying if someone isn’t using tinder for 7 days, their page will not show up for anyone to swipe on... and now my mind has me messed up thinking maybe he was using it.... I trust him but that doesn’t mean anything.. if it hides profiles and he “wasn’t using it” then how come my friend saw his page pop up.... then some people are saying that’s not true... but I believe the 7 day thing more. 

Can someone just let me know what it does? Cause he doesn’t post ANYTHING about me. I have yet to be posted in his social medias, even if it’s him posting a snap chat. He takes me to dinner but will only post the food. Took me to the beach but only posts the water.

It was our best option and has a second bedroom so we really couldn’t find anything better. We’re young parents and got pregnant unexpectedly so we’ve just been “making it as we go”.  

I guess my excitement started to wear off because for almost a year now, my husband and I have had to deal with the worst neighbors we’ve ever had and it’s possibly been the biggest reason we have been so exhausted and irritable with each other. 

The two neighbors on the side of us are good neighbors— one is a family who stays pretty quiet/to themselves and the lady on the other side of us is the same. There are minor annoyances with her (bright security light shining in our window at night but we changed the curtains, problem solved, and she does yard work pretty early in the mornings but hey, at least she keeps a nice yard). The neighbors I’m talking about are directly across the street from us. Here’s the problem(s):

There is obvious illegal activity going on from drug dealing, child neglect, violating leash laws with their dogs, and possibly even prostitution. 

1) I know drug dealing is happening because you know it when you see it (yes, right in their front yard in the middle of the day) and because the one woman that lives there has been arrested multiple times and I’ve heard her interactions with the police and heard her and the other house mates discussing it (yes I eavesdropped). I don’t know how she’s been bailed out so many times.

2) The 2-4 children that live there aged from 8-10 I would say (I don’t really know how many there are but I sometimes never recognize some of the children coming out) are sometimes sent outside for hours even in the rain when a “visitor” comes; he is usually greeted by the one woman that lives there who is usually dressed up as is he; (she is usually dressed pretty casual), otherwise she leaves with him. Twice I even saw the little girl picked up by some guy, and she was also dressed up? Only the two of them left together... This is probably an assumption with the little girl but I don’t think I’m reaching when it comes to the woman. The thing that makes it suspicious is the attractive, well dressed man arriving in a fancy, made in the last 5 years car, to a house that’s falling apart in the middle of the hood. 

3) The kids are the only ones I see mowing the lawn, taking out the trash, bathing or feeding their dogs. On the topic of their dogs, the female dog looks like she is constantly bred, they are constantly shitting in my yard, running at and growling at me when I check my mail. One time I turned my back while playing with my daughter in the yard and I turned around to find one of them nearly trampling her but I quickly ran back inside with her, and another time I even witnessed the two dogs ripping each other apart with one of the little girls trying to separate them. My mom was visiting at this time and stayed inside with my daughter while I ran out there and had to pull the young girl away from the dogs and teach all kids standing there that you do not get in the middle of a dog fight no matter how bad it is. No adult ever came outside when this happened. 

4) They are constantly coming and going, all hours of the day, even at 2 in the morning, each and every time with music blasting so loudly it wakes my daughter up multiple times a night (besides this she has always been a great sleeper; since moving here we have had to use a white noise machine and a box fan on the highest setting). 

5) They frequently have someone that comes over to work on their broken down car, who also has a car that stalls out while he’s trying to jump off their car. So all day long at least 3 times a week I’m constantly just listening to two shitty cars. 

6) Their trash is constantly thrown in the street which eventually finds it way into my yard. 

I don’t know that there’s anything I can do as my husband has told me it would be obvious if we called the cops or animal control on them, and he doesn’t want to make enemies in this neighborhood. There is even a cop that lives a few houses down but I have a feeling he’s a dirty cop that turns a blind eye. Every day these people do the same shit over and over, and it makes my blood boil to even look out the window at their house. Many times I’ve thought about walking over there and telling them to stop playing their music so loudly, stop littering in my yard, stop letting your dog shit in my yard, poking holes in their tires every time I hear their dumb music, or taking a bat to their dogs that constantly try to terrorize me and my daughter every time we walk outside (at this point I only play in the back yard with her but when we walk outside to get in the car, I have to hurry and shut us both in the car while I put her in her car seat). They even stand there and watch this happen and I have to say “can you come get your dog?!” and they go on some tangent about me being a “stupid ass white girl”. 

What can I do? And if there is nothing I can do, how can I stop being so angry? I feel like these people are destroying my livelihood and inner peace.",23Sep2020,1
594,"I have a habit of allowing one person to become incredibly significant to me. Our friendship will begin normal but then once I have decided to latch on, I overthink and start believing they must hate me because they’re not asking to spend time with me or not texting back, even if there’s no change in the frequency of our communication. I will talk and spend time with other people but it’s their texts that I want to receive and when my phone buzzes I’ll be disappointed if its not them. I’m not doing a good job of indicating the level of obsession, but the person will be constantly on my mind and I’ll be constantly worrying about their level of interest in me. I never act on how I feel, I’ll act completely normally and try my hardest to not let my feelings influence our relationship but it’s tough feeling this way. I want to be able to have normal healthy relationships with a healthy level of interest in people. 

I’ve also seen how my feelings change once I move on from my interest in someone and how that does influence my behaviour. Very suddenly they aren’t as important to me, I’ll initiate conversations less, reply slower, think about them almost never in day-to-day and generally just view them slightly differently.  Then this makes me feel guilty, I still care about them and value their friendship but suddenly part of my brain is no longer as invested. It’s literally a switch, I have no control over when it switches on with someone and (usually at the same time) off with another person and it comes with very noticeable sudden changes. 

Does anyone have any idea why this happens? What I can do to stop it?  (Please don't answer therapy as I can't afford it, once I can I will be looking into it)

TLDR: I get unhealthily attached to people very suddenly and then intensely overthink our interactions, only ever one individual at a time. I want to be able to have normal relationships. Why does this happen and how can I fix it?",23Sep2020,1
595,"Alright so I’ll start by saying I’m a 17 year old high school student and unlike many other schools, we are not doing online school or hybrid; we’re going 8 hours a day five days a week. 

Anyways, I started my first job at a kroger about 30 minutes away from my house. I’ve only been working for three weeks and they’ve messed up schedule multiple times, I’ve even drove all the way there only for them to tell me I wasn’t scheduled to work when I KNOW they told me I was working that day 5pm-9. Like I said, this isn’t the only time they’ve messed up my schedule. 

Now the scheduling mistakes they’ve made was annoying but wasn’t a huge deal, but my availability was. Back when I was first hired I said I was available every week day after school and every weekend, admittedly this was a stupid decision on my part but I guess getting a job 30 minutes away was pretty stupid too. Anyways, now being two weeks into school I’ve realized how exhausting it is to go to school for 8 hours then go directly to work for 5 more and also work 7 to 8 hour shifts on the weekend. I requested that my availability be changed to only weekdays so I could have the weekends off.  My managers got kind of pissy with me over it and declined my request. 

Now I realize I bit off more than I could chew when I took this particular job, but I’m really hating my life right now. This is not how I want to spend my senior year of highschool. I just found out that a store five minutes away from me is hiring, isn’t open on weekends, and pays significantly more than kroger. I’m on the brink of typing out a two weeks notice, the only thing that’s holding me back is that I feel bad about leaving after only being at kroger for three weeks. 

Anyways I’m just not sure if I should put in that two weeks notice or if I should just stick it out. Any advice as to what I should do would be appreciated.

Any questions feel free to ask.

On the second to last night, the 3 of us (family friend, me, and the guy) went to to the beach. Both her and the guy proceeded to go into the ocean (didn't come out) and I had to sit their awkwardly and listen to them having sex (didn't actually see the act because it was too dark).

there were only 2 girls who talked to me and they were really nice. 

However, the teachers once let me visit the class next to us where theres also 2 other guys and 1 girl that we got along well, so i started REALLY nagging and praying my teacher would let me change to their class..

- and the 2 girls from my old class said they miss me.. but these 2 girls are giving me more attention now that i changed class.. and it makes me feel GUILTY for changing class.. **now i have an even bigger crush on them**

604,Hello this a question I've been stewing over the past few days and im really unsure about this. About a year ago I catfished a girl to ask her to sext with me and she said yes and we ended up masturbating together. I now understand that this was wrong and she wasn't able to properly consent to the masturbation because she thought I was someone else but now I'm scared that this was a form of rape and not just something horrible I did. Part of me says that I didn't force sex with her and masturbation cant be rape but the other part of me says that she penetrated herself and that makes it rape.

606,"People keep saying that I need to ""focus more"" and ""complain less"". In terms of the former, I have ADD and rely on medication. In terms of the latter, it's how I cope with constant physical pain and emotional insecurity. It's not really a ""complaint"" so much as it is me making fun of myself or muttering to myself...not that anyone believes that.

The past 2 years out of college have been harsh because I can't seem to control myself or my moods or my ADD. I'm on all kinds of medication but I seem to keep making the same mistakes. I've had 2 jobs and, while I haven't been fired, in both I've been told I need to learn to focus better. This second job, I haven't come forward and said anything about my ADD because society seems to think they understand what that's like and view it as an excuse. 

My ADD is honestly horrible. It's so bad, I have to use a special medication for it. I've been taking meds for my ADD since the 1st grade and it's never caused me anything but trouble. I'm not an art major nor do I want to be, I'm a zoologist. 

Mentally: I have ADD, anxiety, depression, insomnia, and PMDD (pre-menstruational distress disorder). I've been on my period for 4 weeks straight with no breaks this month. The doctors can't do anything about it. FYI: the pain isn't as much a problem as the mood swings, which are exhausting. 

Physically: I'm an asthmatic, have a poor immune system, bad circulation, and a bad shoulder.

People pretend to be supportive of those with disabilities but I've never truly felt supported and we don't live in a world where being honest about it *doesn't* effect one's ability to get hired. I have to spin little lies about my condition into something more relatable to my peers so they understand when I need some time to myself to regroup. 

I take criticisms seriously because I'm always trying to be better, to improve as a person, and be more like-able and reliable. I wrote a post in this community about my supervisor targeting me and someone said don't take it personally but I just don't know *how.* My last job was similar, but much worse. It feels more likely to be an issue with *me* than one of bad luck but I don't know anymore...

I'd be easier not to take these criticisms seriously/personally if they weren't so often about the same issues. But I'm always exhausted and always in pain and I need, like, a phrase or a mantra or something to rely on when I end up getting scolded for these issues. 

What should I say to myself when this stuff happens to keep myself from taking it ""personally?""

How do I identify situations where I *should* take something personally? 

I live in a body that I haven't got any control over, despite all the medications that I've tried and take. I need help, or support, or something, and this is getting too hard.",23Sep2020,1
607,So I work for a board and train dog trainer. About 3 months ago we got a viscous dog in. He ended up being really sweet but even now he is still very dangerous to anyone he doesn’t know. The trainer decided it would be best for this dog to be put down. Now over the time that we’ve had this dog some of my coworkers quit or where fired but they really loved this dog. Today when I was told by my boss that we are putting this dog down today he told me very specifically not to tell anyone. These former coworkers of mine all told me before they left that they wanted to know if anything happened but have also contacted the owner directly in the past about the subject and made Facebook posts. So I don’t know what to do. I was hoping that my boss would have waited until next week when I no longer worked their either. I really loved this dog and am just crying in my car right now.

609,"Hello all. My best friend who lives walking distance from my house is in a horrible situation. They are stuck in the closet, and have to deal with emotionally manipulative/abusive parents. Their plan is to move in with me and my family, whether their parents let them or not. (I won't get into their parent's behavior as to not endanger their privacy) It's likely that their parents won't like this idea, and in that case my friend is going to cut them off and move out despite whatever they say/think. 

They're 18 and graduated high school already (i'm in my senior year of high school). My family is going to have an open room in our house within the coming month, and we're all willing to let them rent it out. 

The main question we're both wondering is where do they start? Their bank account, insurance, prescriptions, everything adult focused is through their parents. Their phone bill, literally everything you have under your parents growing up. Should we look into getting them a new insurance plan first? Contact all of their doctors and have the contacts changed? They want to move in within the month, but we want to figure out how to do all of this before their parents know anything just in case.

With them being 18 and me being 17, we really don't know how big life things work because school doesn't teach anything like that. So if any big bad adult with life experience could shoot any plans my/our way, we'd forever be grateful :) thank you for reading",23Sep2020,1

613,"**Background:**

\- Verizon Wireless customer for more than 10+ years

\- I have 2x iPhone 7 with unlimited voice and text, data is capped (\~ $150/mo)

\- Looking to upgrade to 2x iPhone 12 (once announced in October)

\- Also interested in 2x new Apple Watches and iPad

&amp;#x200B;

I have been a complacent Verizon subscriber for over a decade primarily using iPhones.  Prior to that I was on T-Mobile using a Google Nexus One.  I saw no need to upgrade our iPhone 7's over the past few years but will be ready to make the jump with the announcement of iPhone 12 and 5G support.  My wife also has an Apple Watch s3 but that's not connected to any data plan.

I am also very tired of the high monthly costs with Verizon.  Also interested in unlimited data in addition to 5G connectivity.  

I need advice!  Im completely ignorant with what other networks currently offer, costs, incentives, etc.  I have heard that T-Mobile is good with incentivizing switching networks, but that's all I really know.  I am still not sure I am willing to trade my iPhone 7's in too - thinking about giving these to my kids.  This is just a real daunting task to sort through network capabilities and offerings.

614,"Hey so this is gonna be a bit of a long one, sorry. I’ve been told different things by many different people and I just wanted some outside opinions on this. Just to preface this I’m currently 17 years old and turn 18 in November


So while working on English homework, my dad came into my room asking why I had a zero in my AP Bio class, which I had attempted to tell him about the night before, he quickly asked me why and I responded with how the teacher didn’t have it printed the day she assigned it and only gave it to us after it was due online, after he left I went back to work. He then returned a little bit later asking why I had 2 other late assignments in the same class while yelling. Trying to respond I began to become a little hysterical from the yelling, trying to tell him with the little time I had between his yelling, the first one being late due to not even knowing the due date and the second being her telling us when it was due but then actually making it due a week earlier online. After telling him she didn’t tell us the due date and how on focus (our online portal to see grades) it even was due the same day as assigned having no time to do it even though she said she’d give us multiple days in class he slammed the computer shut while in my lap with his fists, breaking the laptop. After leaving and coming back I began to raise my voice in response to him saying all we have to do is keep up with grades and we’re under no stress at all, I brought up the divorce and all the things we have to go through. The whole while he had a smug look and repeated, “are you done yet? You still talking?” Non stop. After cursing at him he jumped up and pinned me to the bed by putting his hand around my throat. After I pushed him off of me he ripped everything off of my bed including my books and the laptop he told me to stand up and get out of his house while spitting and putting his hands in my face. At this point my hands were trembling and I was having trouble breathing from anxiety to the point I had to calm down and take a few breaths each time I wanted to speak. He left the room and came back, by now I had gotten the laptop to work and pulled up my focus, he was still yelling at this point but when I was finally able to talk and explain what had happened he calmed down and listened to me but still in disbelief that a teacher could be wrong in this situation and how it’s written in black in white on focus that it was late. Only after I emailed my teacher and my guidance councilor for a class change did he begin to believe me and begin to act all buddy-buddy like nothing happened demanding I get out of the class. He left and came back crying saying how it’s upsetting to him that he isn’t married to my mom and makes us go through this stuff.

This is not the first time something like this has happened though, the last time I had a late assignment, 2 years ago in my sophomore year, he threatened to put my head through a wall. As well as many other instances that happened with my two sisters such as slamming food in my older ones face and pushing her into her room, slamming into the wall in front of my mom when they were still married. 

He only does these things when he thinks he’s alone or when my step mom isn’t home. He used to be an alcoholic and even got fired from being a detective by causing a hit and run while drunk in his police car and tried to call the car in as stolen a few years ago.

I’m not asking for money or anything, I just want to know the opinions of you guys and what you think, I told my mom who in turn told my principal to try to get me out of the class only to go to DCF and get an investigation started and I don’t know if I should feel bad or not about the whole situation because now all my step siblings and dad seem to be extremely mad at me and are telling me I did the wrong thing by being a rat.

615,"So I've noticed that my friend has gained a lot of weight. He used to be kind of twinky sized with me and we would go to bars together and have like a duo stick; you know where two cute people go to a bar and flirt with strangers. But now, it's kind of ruined now that he's gained a lot of weight and people are more attracted to me. The whole balance is thrown off and I feel like he takes it out on me when he doesn't get the attention he wants. Part of it was that but now that bars are closed that doesn't even matter anymore. Now it's just me wondering if he even knows or cares that he's going towards obesity. All of his friends talk about his weight (in jest) behind his back but it seems like they're looking at ME to have told him. His clothes don't fit him anymore and he looks pregnant. He's starting to look fat in the face as well. It's not like I have a problem with him being a bit on the bigger side, but it's not natural looking to his body. I feel bad because I may be the closest friend he has but I don't think we're at the point where I can just blurt out things like this. Actually, I wouldn't really be able to say this to my closest friends. 

Approach 1:

I say nothing like I've done for a long time. I was just thinking, has his mother or father said anything to him? Why should I say something?

Approach 2: 

I go with the concern approach. I definitely feel like this will come off as condescending to him and will backfire tremendously. 

Approach 3: 

I make quips here and there about how he's gaining weight and hope he picks up the hint.

Sorry if I offended anyone about their weight. Your weight should be your own journey but I think we have to be honest that weight causes a lot of problems in our current society; mainly socially. It's unfortunate that that's the truth and people are all of a sudden more 'attractive' when they lose weight (looking at the Adele fiasco). But a lot of people are searching to be attractive and to get attention so what happens when they need to know that that's what's keeping them back?",23Sep2020,1

Another example, when I'm dealing with adult people outside of school I treat with respect and know how to act towards them, but in school, I feel like I'm being weird. I overthink it or something. I think it has to do with I try to fit in, to do and to be what people in my school expect me to. Even though it makes me uncomfortable. I'm very awkward and embarrassed at school. And I'm 100% sure the reason behind this is when I was a kid, I was getting emotionally bullied and laughed on from like the 6th grade and before.

My brother agreed with her but told her that she ""wasn't supposed to say that,"" so I figure they'd spoken about it before. Now I can't even look at it. I hate my body so much. I never had self esteem issues like this before, and now I can't look in the mirror. It's been months and months since then, and my feelings kind of eased up for a little while but lately I'm so disgusted with myself. I'm very pale, and it's black, and anything I could cover it up with would look huge and shitty. Removing tattoos I've heard sometimes won't remove it all the way. I wear tons of bracelets all the time now and I've just worn down my favorite bracelet so its unwearable. I know what a concentration camp tattoo looks like, and mine is in a different place and in the perpendicular direction, but still the comparison was made. I talked to someone about it that I met at school and they even fucking agreed with my mom. I want to cut my skin off sometimes. My thought is, what kind of sick person would get that tattooed on themselves for aesthetics? Could someone please help me? I don't have any thick bracelets left that cover it completely now. I want to like myself again.",23Sep2020,1
618,"I am currently finding counselling services for my younger sister (22). Context first, we live in a third world country and our currency is weak, so if there's a site that offers free or low cost counselling, we might be able to afford it. The virus might also stay in our country up til same time next year because our country prioritizes adding artificial white sand on our beaches instead on giving more funds to healthcare, so we really want it online if possible. My sister also currently lives alone with our dad and he's the main source of the problem, so the counselling needs to be in chat (she doesn't really wanna leave him alone either despite the toxic environment).


Are there any suggestions? I tried googling (mobile) and those I find are kinda sketchy so I don't know if I should trust them. Thank you.",23Sep2020,1
619,"Hey guys! So I’m coming here because I’m in a bit of a pickle in life. Im 20 years old, I’ve failed out of college once, and I’m back in after two years and trying again, and once again I’m failing. I feel as if I cannot motivate myself to do almost any school work, I’m constantly doing the bare minimum, and honestly a lot of the time I’m doing less than that. This doesn’t just apply to school, this is everywhere in my life. I can’t get myself to save money, all I do is spend it the moment I earn it. I can motivate myself easily when it comes to most video games sadly, although I wish it weren’t true. I’m just looking for a way to start motivating myself to do work. This may be a struggle I need to handle personally, it may be something more than some people on reddit can give me advice for, but I’m not sure where else to look. For more background, I have ADD, always have. And I smoke weed semi-regularly.  
Any suggestions or ways you motivate yourself are welcome!
Thanks!",23Sep2020,1

621,"I'm highly misogynistic against former or current fat women and their fat mentality. It's a type of personality I only find in fat women. Sure there is Adele, who is a really nice and down to earth person, and Lizzo, who seems a kind person with no victim complex, and she includes other body types in her videos, I love truth hurts and juice, but for the most part the fatties I meet are more in the honey boo boo category. Loud, obnoxious, talk a lot and do nothing, fester alot, can't hold jobs and have eating disorders and take so much space and emotional space to be seen. They will be throwing tantrums where there is peace. Just being overbearing and the word sassy to mask envy and mental illness and autoimmune disorders and being a negative person who can't handle their emotions just has to go. You are not sassy or assertive, you are in emotional pain of being a retard and you are lucky you are fat, cause it helps mask alot of issues that are much worse than the blubber on you like needing a therapist like yesterday. Shirking all responsibilities. Mega rage and victim complex. Being clingy becomes uncool after a while, so they become rabid clingy and use the craziness to mask the fatness. This is another thing. For all the fat songs that abound about being all about that bass, and don't need a man, and it's not my fault people can't accept me at my worst, and drugs and alcohol and magical thinking all fat women are into, they are really clingy and obsessed with YOUR life. They don't spend time on their own lives. If you take away their need to one up conversations you kill their self esteem or something cause then they can't not see their blubber anymore. Like their entire life is a facade to escape and blame all their problems on fat and not just the personality behind that which makes most fat people fat. Infact the fat people I've met have left such a bad impression on me, that even though I love Adele and Lizzo I can't help feel they are internally the same screaming, rabid whales I've met who have no social awareness and just like to ruin good stuff in the world. Every single problem in my life has been caused by obese women having meltdowns and slandering me. Cause that's a fat woman thing. Attractive, thin and intelligent females don't do this stuff with me. They have the worst victim complex ever and think being obese entitles them special treatment for not having pretty privelege. 

I even found a word for it, so apparently it's not only my prejudice. 
https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fattitude

Apparently alot of people in the world have faced the same issues with fat women. 

As a disclaimer, if you are fat cause you had kids, or have illnesses its acceptable and you are not in the above category. However, why don't we have body acceptance movements for racial diversity, acne, c section scars, skin diseases and the infinite little things all women face everywhere. Fat is the one thing which is by health in your control and we don't need acceptance for it. Fat men don't seem to have this problem and society really takes it out on them.

 But fat female whales have the worst, entitled complex ever. Imagine the stereotypical wallmart whale with a whaletail. They are the type who as adults would fall on the floor and rage cry cause the guy who is the cashier misplaced their order. They talk about things like hand crushing handshakes to assert dominance. They talk about stuff like showing people you take no shit from anyone. Being emotionally strong, which doesn't mean can control their temper or tears. It means going around making people who make them envious miserable just for being better than them, and trust me it's exactly that cause these fat women stalk skinny women who make them feel bad emotions and then they need to hamster that emotions so they make stupid agendas to get release for that envy and jealousy. Domination mainly so they don't feel so pathetic. Control of others cause they can't control themselves. Being sexually in charge cause really no one approaches them. Mainly cause these women pathetically try to control their world, cause they have given up trying to control themselves and can no longer build their self esteem from it. 

The fat women I've met, have given me really bad opinions on other fat women. I have never seen a situation where the fat women  is hiding a beautiful mind or personality. Quite the contrary, I usually find them helpless retards, cause the effort it takes to be thin is the same effort it takes to have skills and accomplishments in anything in the world. 

Fat men are strangely the exception cause society doesn't treat them kindly for being just chubby. Fat women are rancid in personality.",23Sep2020,1

629,"Before those reading judge me, please hear me out first. More importantly if you have any advice as to how I can control my emotions towards this situation or if I have any legal ground to stand on, please let me know. This will be a long post, btw.

So my husband and I moved into our current house about a year and some months ago. It’s located in a predominantly black area and not the safest part of town, but my husband’s father owns the house and was kind enough to rent to us for pretty cheap after our lease ended at our apartment. We have a daughter (now 2 and a half) so we were relieved to get out of our noisy, one bedroom apartment and have a place to call our own. It was our best option and has a second bedroom so we really couldn’t find anything better. We’re young parents and got pregnant unexpectedly so we’ve just been “making it as we go”.  

I guess my excitement started to wear off because for almost a year now, my husband and I have had to deal with the worst neighbors we’ve ever had and it’s possibly been the biggest reason we have been so exhausted and irritable with each other. Now the two neighbors on the side of us are good neighbors— one is a family who stays pretty quiet/to themselves and the lady on the other side of us is the same. There are minor annoyances with her (bright security light shining in our window at night but we changed the curtains, problem solved, and she does yard work pretty early in the mornings but hey, at least she keeps a nice yard). The neighbors I’m talking about are directly across the street from us. Here’s the problem(s):

There is obvious illegal activity going on from drug dealing, child neglect, violating leash laws with their dogs, and possibly even prostitution. 

1) I know drug dealing is happening because you know it when you see it (yes, right in their front yard in the middle of the day) and because the one woman that lives there has been arrested multiple times and I’ve heard her interactions with the police and heard her and the other house mates discussing it (yes I eavesdropped). I don’t know how she’s been bailed out so many times.

2) The 2-4 children that live there aged from 8-10 I would say (I don’t really know how many there are but I sometimes never recognize some of the children coming out) are sometimes sent outside for hours even in the rain when a “visitor” comes; he is usually greeted by the one woman that lives there who is usually dressed up as is he; (she is usually dressed pretty casual), otherwise she leaves with him. Twice I even saw the little girl picked up by the same guy, and she was also dressed up? Only the two of them left together... This is probably an assumption with the little girl but I don’t think I’m reaching when it comes to the woman. The thing that makes it suspicious is the attractive, well dressed man arriving in a fancy, made in the last 5 years car, to a house that’s falling apart in the middle of the hood. 

3) The kids are the only ones I see mowing the lawn, taking out the trash, bathing or feeding their dogs. On the topic of their dogs, the female dog looks like she is constantly bred, they are constantly shitting in my yard, running at and growling at me when I check my mail. One time I turned my back while playing with my daughter in the yard and I turned around to find one of them nearly trampling her but I quickly ran back inside with her, and another time I even witnessed the two dogs ripping each other apart with one of the little girls trying to separate them. My mom was visiting at this time and stayed inside with my daughter while I ran out there and had to pull the young girl away from the dogs and teach all the kids standing there that you do not get in the middle of a dog fight no matter how bad it is. No adult ever came outside when this happened. This is the one time I did call animal control; they came to the house but nothing was done.

4) They are constantly coming and going, all hours of the day, even at 2 in the morning, each and every time with music blasting so loudly it wakes my daughter up multiple times a night (besides this she has always been a great sleeper; since moving here we have had to use a white noise machine and a box fan on the highest setting). My husband has to wake up at 6 am for work and he loses so much sleep over their noise as our bedroom is the one closest to their house; hence why our daughter has the bigger bedroom in the back as it is at least a little quieter but not enough. 

5) They frequently have someone that comes over to work on their broken down car, who also has a car that stalls out while he’s trying to jump off their car. So all day long at least 3 times a week I’m constantly just listening to two shitty cars. 

6) Their trash is constantly thrown in the street which eventually finds it way into my yard. 

I don’t know that there’s anything I can do as my husband has told me it would be obvious if we called the cops or animal control (again) on them, and he doesn’t want to make enemies in this neighborhood. There is even a cop that lives a few houses down but I have a feeling he’s a dirty cop that turns a blind eye. Every day these people do the same shit over and over, and it makes my blood boil to even look out the window at their house. Many times I’ve thought about walking over there and telling them to stop playing their music so loudly, stop littering in my yard, stop letting your dog shit in my yard, poking holes in their tires every time I hear their dumb music, or taking a bat to their dogs that constantly try to terrorize me and my daughter every time we walk outside (at this point I only play in the back yard with her but when we walk outside to get in the car, I have to hurry and shut us both in the car while I put her in her car seat). They even stand there and watch this happen and I have to say “can you come get your dog?!” and they go on some tangent about me being a “stupid ass white girl”. 

I have never hated anyone but these people make me see red every day. I also feel bad for the kids that live there as they never look like they are taken care of. All of this is causing me so much stress and I just wonder if there is anything I can do. If not, how can I stop letting these people bother me so much?",23Sep2020,1
630,"I need advice and a man’s perspective! This is not that serious but here is some relationship background: 

My boyfriend and I are comfortable speaking up about things, let me just start with that. We’ve had difficult conversations, we’ve gotten emotional and cried, and I’ve always made sure to not let the conversation end prematurely when he cries or gets upset (i.e. comfort him while he finishes crying so we can continue conversation.) Communication is so so important to both of us! 

He is typically the more emotional one. Ever since our first date he’s said he doesn’t know how he got me, and we’ve talked plenty about that, his amazing qualities, and he’s a lot more comfortable in the relationship now that time has passed (yay because I really love him!) I’m his first relationship. 

However he gets extremely upset at himself when he makes me upset. It doesn’t happen very often, but I feel it’s important to say “hey, I felt hurt when you said that, can we talk about it?” and generally just bring up when something makes me uncomfortable. He always ends up crying and getting emotional because he hates the idea of upsetting me, and I don’t mind that because I understand he’s emotional. I’m never angry, just really want to communicate my feelings. We eventually finish the conversation and cuddle it out and feel a lot better. And usually talk about other things happening that may have contributed to the high emotions (stress, insecurity, etc.) 

Now I have to bring up the most awkward thing...

I’ve noticed that when he comes over, there’s always a lot of pee on the toilet (where you lift it up.) It’s been happening for awhile and I’ve just cleaned it every week as I was trying to find the best way to bring it up. Looks like I ran out of time to address it though. This week my dad went and cleaned my bathroom as a surprise (I’ve been super busy) and he said he found pee on the floor, under the trash can, as well as the toilet, and that it had “looked like someone had tried wiping it up” but missed under the trash can. So it wasn’t just a little drop, it was a significant amount. 

We said it might be the dog, and left it. Sure he gets pee on the seat but leaving it on the floor? 

Well I just got home from work and my mom pulled me aside and said that they found the same issue in the downstairs bathroom, the day after my BF was over and using that one specifically. It’s COVID so obviously no one has come over and we don’t have any other male besides my dad in the home. She says I need to find a way to bring it up. Which I 100% agree with.

How the heck do I bring this up? I’m not angry, I’m just worried about bringing up a huge insecurity and making him eternally embarrassed to come over. He shares a bathroom with his younger brother and I’m assuming his mom cleans his bathroom as everyone else works full time (and Hispanic household, and yes he does know how to iron his own clothes and do his own laundry to those that will make this comment.) We’re serious and discussing marriage, so this needs to get resolved for that reason as well.

You would think with how comfortable we are I would be able to bring this up, but I feel like this could really affect his confidence and I really just need some guy’s perspectives on how to approach the subject. 

Thank you and please don’t roast me or him I’m just looking for advise or maybe people who have gone through the same thing.",23Sep2020,1

634,"I was talking with my therapist yesterday about a bunch of memories that came back (I have no memories from birth \[obviously\] to about 8 years old).

I also had a bed wetting phase at about 5-6 y.o., though I'd never had that problem, even when potty training (according to my family) I also had constant bladder/urinary tract infections. I was in and out of urology offices until I was 8.

When I was I guess 4 or 5 my parents split up and my mom dated a bunch of creeps on and off until they got back together. She'd take me to their houses where they'd do idk what. Its a huge possibility that one of them abused me. My mom swears up and down she never left me alone with them and as far as she knows I was never touched inappropriately.

636,"For some context my parents went through a bit of a messy divorce/separation when I was around 10. They tried to keep me and my older sister away from all the details but as I got older my dad has told me some shit about my mom. She was the cheater despite my dad loving her and apparently she got jealous that he “gave the kids more attention” than her or something like that. Long story short my dad told me my mom lied in court and said he owed her a bunch of child support money (this during the time we were living back and forth between my dads and my moms) and he essentially is paying her for life. 

I’ve tried my best to look past this, especially because I haven’t heard both sides of the story. But my dad also has severe Crohn’s disease. He’s had 2 major surgeries in his intestines and has been putting off getting a colostomy for years. He technically can only get disability and can’t work but those of you know that disability isn’t much to live on, on top of a hefty portion of it going to my mom. This causes my dad to have to work under the table to survive and he works as a handy man for his complex and also does other small odd jobs here and there. 

I didn’t realize how bad his condition was until I started living with him the past couple months. Multiple times a week in the bathroom screaming in pain and just pretty much constantly in pain. I can tell these jobs are wearing out his body and with his condition I’m worried he’s speeding up his death We’ve already had a hard conversation that he doesn’t know if he’ll make it another 10 years or not.

I feel like my moms selfishness is speeding up my dads death but I don’t know what I can do about it. He told me not to tell her he’s working because he can get into big trouble if she reports to the court that he’s working under the table again (apparently that’s what she said the first time.) It’s hard for me to turn the other cheek to her when I know how bad my dad is doing and should just be resting instead of working. It’s gotten bad I’ve stopped visiting her and replying to her texts as often and I feel the awkwardness in our calls. I’ve talked to my therapist about it and she just essentially told me “yeah that’s a rough situation there.” My mom even sent me a message this morning saying “Hola, how are you? Just going to say... love don’t live here anymore.... feels like I haven’t seen you in forever! “ which spawned me to post this as I have no idea how to respond at this point.

643,"Hi, I'm new to Reddit so please be mindful. I don't have many friends to talk to about this matter so this is my next best thing for advice.

I, 20f, have started dating this guy named Tim (27m, not his real name) for the past 4 months. Everything is going OK and is progressing well. We spent a lot of time together and I'm learning to be OK with the relationship after a tough 3 year relationship with my former and only partner before him. I'm learning to adjust and be in a healthy relationship but I recently got a call from my Mother that sort of upset me.

My brother, Jim (14m, not his real name either) has this little buddy (let's call him Kim) who he's been friends with since they were small children and has turned into an adoptive little brother of some sort. Kim recently came by my Mother's to visit Jim and has told my family about what his older cousin was saying back at his own home.

A little back story: we all live in a small town of 400 people, everyone knows each other and word flies around fast. Small town things, you know. My boyfriend, Tim, works with Kim's older cousin that we'll name Kyle.

Anyways, Kim has said to my Mother and mind you, he has never lied before about anything before. Kim said that my boyfriend, Tim, has been complaining at work to his peers about me and that Kyle has taken home to mention this to his family (hence why Kim is telling my Mother) of what he heard being said. Not typical girlfriend things as you would expect but rather more personal stuff that only me and my SO would know.

Tim, has stated that ""(me) likes to have sex everyday. Sometimes even twice..., she's always over every night. I'm really tired when I get off work and I don't have time to myself anymore, or my own space."" I don't have a problem with it but the part that bothers me is that he asks me himself to stay over. I don't push anything on him or ask of anything, and the sex? He knows specifically how I feel about sex because we've talked numerous times about it. There are times where I do not want to be touched and other times I do, but I don't force myself onto him or initiate sex if he doesn't want too because I value his choices. So where this is coming from, I do not know and I always thought we were pretty honest with each other.

I feel disappointed and hurt that he would mention to his peers about me in that nature, especially at work where people personally know me. He's not the first man either who's done anything like that to me before so I'm familiar with this situation. He knows that too because we've had talks about how I don't like being used as a toy for his own good etc. If I'm being honest, I feel ashamed in my own body and now have anxiety of all the potential things he has said about me that I don't know.

I'm a person who doesn't like to sweep things like this under the rug. My Mother even suggested I don't say anything because of where the information came from but I'm honestly not going to be thrown around like that. It bothers me and it upsets me, especially when it comes from someone I genuinely trust and let into my life.

What do you think I should do? What approach should I take in bringing it up in conversation?",23Sep2020,1

A generally unimportant issue, i know. Lately something in me clicked and i’ve been wanting to shave my head for a while. i recently got a haircut that’s quite short, but a little longer on the top (just above my eyebrows to be precise) but it still feels too long, and i think the only alternative would be to go ahead and shave it.

My girlfriend has told me that it wouldn’t suit me and she doesn’t like the idea. i wouldn’t want to do it and be stuck looking ugly hahaha.. but i’ve read, and heard from a couple friends who had shaved their heads a couple months back, about how good it feels, how comfortable and easy it is etc.

648,"im a guy. Throughout the years, I've seen people act weird around for their own amusement. Some would ask me obscene or inappropriate questions for their own amusement among their friends.

I feel like anything I do gets a reaction I don't want. If Im chill and reserved, I come across as being aloof, anti-social or even shy. if I comes across as being calm and controlling my reactions, I come across as being not all there or unaware and as a result, it comes across if I have no social skills or have aspergers. If I try to charismatic, I come across as being clownish. As a result, if i try make a rant about something like a tv show or if I mockingly imitate someone, instead of them just chuckling and understanding the point im making, they instead just focus on the voice and laugh only on that.

Sometimes I might pronounce a word incorrectly because Im not used to saying it but they laugh and always bring up at other times. Its okay to laugh at the time but I don't like it being brought up later. Growing up, I lacked experience on things such as when I first smoked weed with friends at college. my novice moments always linger with people. it makes them think im weird, goofy, or inexperienced.

basically, other people can have embarrassing moments, mispronounced things, or act silly sometimes and it is just a funny moment and thats it. but for me, it gets attached to me by others and i hate it. i don't understand. i don't get the benefit of the doubt. when im chill and normal, people think im anti-social, upset, or forgettable. i just want to be seen as normal but instead people think im different for situations many others go through but dont deal with.",23Sep2020,1

650,"So this is going to be long but I’ll try to make it short. I had this best friend since I was 15 I am now 22 and last year around this time we stopped being friends. I moved in with him and his husband January of 2019 and in June my girlfriend moved in and it was my best friends idea. We all sat down and talked about things many times before she moved in and everything seemed fine. About 3 days after my girlfriend moved in, my best friend started talking behind our backs to my other friend saying that my girlfriend and I were together all the time and I didn’t make time for him anymore. My girlfriend and I had just started dating and it was a long road to get there so her and I were just happy but I sat down with my best friend and told him that I would gladly spend more time with him but that he had just been making me anxious as soon as I walked in the door because it felt like he didn’t want me nor my girlfriend there. That part worsened and then one month I was going to be a couple days late on rent, we sat down with my best friend and his husband and they said they were going to try to pull out of the lease, well they did pull out of the lease with out discussing with me and my girlfriend whom were both also on the lease. So things were awkward they moved out and we moved into a new place. My best friend and I stopped talking for a couple months until he texted me that he wanted to be friends, my girlfriend tried to text him as well saying she wanted to put everything behind and he said no basically that it was all her fault that everything happened between him and I and they were friends before, he introduced us.

I started working a terrible job at a large greenhouse a month ago. It’s full time (don’t have an issue with) and often makes me work overtime (slight issue bc it cuts into my school time a lot). The only good thing I can bring up about my job is the money, which is a couple bucks over minimum wage.

Since it’s in a greenhouse it’s hot as fuck. The work is hard, i spend all day doing manually intensive and repetitive tasks. I don’t have an issue with working in harsh conditions, but they treat me like garbage. They favor other departments over mine and often dump work onto us and don’t help us when needed. This is why I often work overtime, bc I get stuck doing someone else’s work.

For example: if my brother has overslept for a little bit in the morning i blow out in a full out panic thinking he’s dead. Or if my dad is upstairs in his room or in the garage for too long i start worrying that he’s killed himself. Thankfully none of my family members suffer from depression so i have no reason to be worrying about stuff like that. Today, my dad went to go to Lowes and I was worried because he had been gone for quite some time. I tried to settle my anxiety down by focusing on my schoolwork but in the middle of that this horrible scene popped up in my head about him getting in a horrible car accident. So fast forward to a few hours later he comes back home and when I come downstairs I find out that he, indeed, had gotten in a car accident. Thankfully he is perfectly safe &amp; okay, but the back of his car suffered quite some damage.

I contemplated whether or not I should keep the job while going to university because I plan on applying for an internship at the end of my spring semester. Having this job on my resume is very important to me because (IMO) it'll definitely help boost my chances of getting it. I'm currently going to school for engineering and the internship involves sales and is customer service oriented. I also thought going to school while working would be a good way to show employers how much of a dedicated and hard worker I am. But this really backfired on me.

661,"Hey guys, 

This can be long but I am sure it will be interesting. I am writing all of this from the core of my heart and I am sure somewhere out there, someone knowledgeable enough will read it and guide me accordingly. So a quick brief about myself, my name's Tanush, a 17 year old ""Indian"" (This is important) who just turned 18 a few days ago.  


So I am a graphic designer, I have worked with 100s of brands since last 3 years and I am sure they all were unaware of my age and hired me out of my portfolio. I don't want to judge my own designs, but I get great response from the community when they see my designs.  


Now India's a country where while being a high school student, generally they don't dream to start a business or work for businesses, and even if a student tries so, the community isn't much supportive, parents want their sons and daughters to study from a broken education system and live the rest of their lives working under a MNC after securing a degree. I won't blame the parents here, they just want their little ones to have a great and secured future rather than having a risky business but what this does is kills our creativity. Hence India generates one of the smartest minds and gets imported by abroad and foreign companies which is considered to be one of the greatest achievements here in India. ( India produces more engineers than US and China combined ) but they fail to generate creativity.  


Now, my parents unlike the majority are very very special, they understand me and my perspective, they agree to my stupid thoughts and needs, they never force me to do anything which I don't want, in short they are very very supportive. Now obviously, in return I always want to fulfill any wish they have, I feel like, ""Wow! They are so amazing, I have to fulfill any wish they have"", now obviously nothing's perfect, their only wish in exchange for their supportive nature was for me to be good academically. And unfortunately, I wasn't ( though I am above average ), I just didn't wanted to study things which won't be valuable to me in the future ( Our curriculum is very very outdated ).   
Still I have always felt very bad that they have always fulfilled all of  my wishes and are extraordinary parents but I couldn't fulfill just one wish of theirs. So I thought, if I earn good enough, if I will earn extraordinarily enough in my age, they will be happy that their son is talented enough to earn at a age when students spend the time of their day playing games. 

So as I loved computers, designing and solving problems with businesses, I used to read books which could increase my entrepreneurial and marketing knowledge (One of my favorite being the ""Influence | The Psychology of Persuasion"", I have completed over 25-30 courses in Udemy and I currently know to operate more than 6 Adobe Software. So everyday and night, I was wondering about problems which the world had, and ways to solve them (to me this is what business is). Opened several of them, and closed without seeing much profit and then one day I sat to re-evaluate myself and my mistakes and that is when I realized that I was not giving enough time for each of those businesses to flourish. I wasn't giving enough of my dedication to any of them. But often, I used to doubt myself, that really will a 17 year old be able to earn enough or start businesses, if this would be so easy, why people so experienced and aged would struggle to do so. But somewhere down my heart, I wanted to prove the age factor wrong.

Though at that time I also used to carry out part time and freelance jobs. So fortunately, I was little successful at earning, Getting $200 per month through freelance jobs which is a big deal here at the age of 16 was something which I was able to do, so they were satisfied that I am skillful enough to earn without being good academically. But I wanted to make them 'very proud' so I had bigger dreams, I wanted to buy my mom the dream house she ever wanted as soon as possible ( because I have this strange and weird fear of the death of my parents, and I want to achieve things as soon as possible at least so that they can see that they were successful at making their son a great and successful person and go very very happily and peacefully ), I wanted to be one of the most youngest entrepreneur the country has seen and don't worry, I am very very against of 'get rich quick schemes'. I believe in the hard work that goes into earning.

So, now you know the little background of mine, and back to current situation. So now, after evaluating all of my mistakes and understanding what I am excellent at, I opened a company which served Social Media Management services by making beautiful content 5-7 days a week with mesmerizing caption copy ( I did hire a talented copywriter for this and 2-3 more people for better management) and I posted our portfolio in one of the Facebook groups, and instantly few people approached from all around the world and I successfully closed two of them from Portland and Australia respectively, It's been 4 months, and we produced beautiful and engaging posts for them and even successfully carried some marketing campaigns as well. Through my experience of last 2 years, I had little knowledge about the Instagram algorithm as well, so I was able to successfully bump up their engagement rates as well. So now this so called company of mine is generating more than 600$ monthly, (though not much profit is left, but I don't want to secure profit right now). But something inside me was telling me, if I secured just 2 clients without any much effort and helped them with their problem of social presence then over the world, there must be so so so many companies who are in need of the same services, I searched through Fiverr and all, and people are charging hundreds of dollars for designs which are no where close to ours so I am pretty sure, I can scale this to immense figures. 

Now the facebook group where I posted the portfolio have closed the option of promotions, and I can't seem to approach clients or get any leads. I am exploring LinkedIn, Fiverr and other sites. but still I feel like there is something which I am missing or doing wrong. Now I know there are a lot of people with immense knowledge here, if you did read all of the above. Thankyou so so much, I feel proud that I was able to make even a single person read this. but if there is anything, any advice which you feel should be given to me, please do so. Where should I look at, where should I get the clients, should I start with Paid ads? What should I do right now, even if you have anything to say apart from this, please do so. Any critique or comment will be valuable to me more than you know. Again Thankyou so so much for reading this through. Hope you have a wonderful day ahead.

666,"So, I [24NB] am happily married to my wife, and polyamorous (please no negative comments about me being polyam) and I have a bit of an issue. It started when I matched with this guy on Tinder a few months ago (February). We talked for a while, had a one night stand, and then we didn’t really talk much for quite a while. 

Then, this past week he comes to me venting about how his father is dying of cancer and he’s leaning on me for emotional support. He wants to hang out, he wants to be around me because he “doesn’t have anyone else”. And I understand that he’s had a hard life, being abused, and now his father is dying, and yes it’s a very difficult situation. But I just feel like we barely know each other? Like I’m not the person he should be coming to? I really want to help him and everything but I can barely take care of myself. I have my own issues with my mental health (BPD and PTSD) and physical health (Hashimoto’s Disease) and I can’t handle being someone else’s entire support system. Especially when I barely know him.

It just screams of something I would’ve done before I ever went to therapy, back when I was way more toxic and codependent.
He gives me red flags but I don’t want to ghost him because I don’t want to be a bad person if that makes sense?

667,"Ok, so me (male 28) and the mother of my child (female 27) were together for 5 years and we broke up in October 2018. No cheating, but my depression made me stop caring about her and my child mentally and even in some cases emotionally. No dates and I secluded myself from my family and her family. I was hard to talk to at times and I just stop hearing her cries for help. I looked into other sources attempting to bury or hide it not trying to stress her out about my suicidal thoughts and ignored her and my child for months while in the same household. She'll probably never forgive me, and that's ok.

 After she kicked me out (july 2019) because she really started to dislike me I couldnt and did not want to keep my child where I was staying, so I would go over there and see her. She started blaming me for not helping and because of my credit (paying Bills with my credit cards when she was low on money and signing on a car she got repossessed) I couldnt even get a apartment until I worked on it.calling herself a single mother......hurt hearing that when I was there. Got depressed again because life was just kicking my ass (got sick and couldnt work for months) so i disappeared. Almost ended my life but remembered my child. I was Staying with my dad and one minute he would say it's cool to take a room and keep my kid, and the next I was getting to comfortable and had to leave soon. Imagine hearing all the time how much of a bad dad you are and you ain't shit and constantly being reminded of it because you cant keep your child. I'm fine now and fully mentally and emotionally well. 

She's moved on....well I think. She says she has forgiven me and herself for the failure of our relationship but still doesnt like me lol which is fine. Just wanted to be cordial and nothing more. Which is great. I agree. Told me she was in love with someone, then said days later she wasnt talking to someone ""romantically"" lol. Trying to make me jealous? Who knows, but This isnt a post about trying to get her back.....no. That story is done. I just wanted to know will things get better over time to the point we're just cool if I'm just friendly and help out when and if I can. 

Should I ask from time to time is she ok or just mind my business? Sometimes I just cash app her money simply because she just might need it. the fact that she is the mother of my child, I want to make sure she's ok, but we arent together idk if I should or shouldn't (hence why I'm asking for advice), or just back off completely and Just do for my child (female 3)? My mother ( female 55) and father (male 56) didnt get along and I hated it as a kid, so im trying to avoid that. It's no secret I still care for her, but I also havent forgiven myself.

669,"I was low on money yesterday, and couldn’t afford to spend the night at the hotel I’m currently at. Ironically 5 blocks away is the complex my mom, sister and brother have lived and currently my cousin lives there. I chose to go there to get out of the rain, out of view and wait for the morning when my check was deposited. I didn’t go to my cousin, because I don’t want my family knowing my circumstances right now. But I do visit her from time to time. 

Security pulled up in a pick up, high beams right in my face. The whole thing really felt like security presenting themselves as cops. Either one I’m good with, I understand that I might be trespassing I mean it’s common sense I knew that before I went there and was ready to move if I was approached by anyone. I told them I was visiting my cousin and I started gathering my things after the first few questions they made it clear I was trespassing, cool I got it, I’m out of y’all’s hair. However the main guard or whatever commanded me to stay seated because they have more questions.. I answered to the best of my ability at this time internally and somewhat externally freaking out because I don’t know what’s next. I offered to call my cousin and have her vouch, but the guard insisted I give him her number and I offered to call her on my phone because after thinking about it I didn’t want to give him the number. Night time she’s got 3 kids and a sub par babies father she’s dealing with. When I said I wouldn’t give to him, he commanded I stand up “this coulda been easy blah blah” pay down hand cuffs, went through my bags, took my ID, took my picture and told me not to come back unless I got written permission from the offense. All I was doing was charging my phone and trying to pass the time, it felt bizarre. I did give him my cousins name, even after he found her name on the property’s list they insisted I was lying, he asked how do you know her did you go through her mailbox/mail. ??? *Nick Young face* even later he asked if this was a gf or an ex of mine that I might be stalking.

I do not! Understand why this had to that way. I don’t understand why I was in this position with two security officers, I don’t understand why after acknowledging that I shouldn’t be there and was willing to leave immediately, I was made to stay. It made the experience more terrifying because I was detained by two security guards for no other reason than trespassing, it wasn’t even criminal, I’ve never been warned never been told to leave before. 

I’m angry, and I would very much like to go and speak with the complex manager to get information of their agency but honestly I feel like expressing my frustration with her as well. I have been approached by cops before none of those experiences made me feel like this, in fact for some reason the main guard repeatedly mention the police department for the area and at one point said “they’re too nice” ?? 

I’m sure I will be over it in a few days but I am so fucking tired of over complying, shoving things down. It wasn’t physical but during the pat I heard repeatedly stop moving, being warned to keep my hands up. Now I feel like I know what some others feel when they’re being detained don’t really understand why and you’re trying to find out why not really thinking about what your hands are doing, you’re scared you have your back to them which is necessary but also adds to the “what’s about to happen-terror. But when he said that all I could think about were their guns I shut up and focused only on my arms and hands, until they cuffed me. 

Again I’m angry. I want to talk to the office and I want to know what company they work for. Is it a bad idea?",23Sep2020,1

671,"Recently I've decided to stop drinking soda. I've taken a more serious approach this time, so hopefully me quitting now will be more permanent. Before, when I would try to stop, sodas were always in the house, and I was insanely addicted to them and the sugar, and I'd give up after like two weeks. 

I want to quit drinking them because of the sugar, the addiction to the sugar, the amount of caffeine I was drinking was insane, I was losing sleep, I was gaining weight, taking in too many calories, and I was barely drinking any water. 

Right now I can drink one or two cups of coffee a day and be fine, it's way less caffeine and sugar. I'm also trying to get used to drinking more water each day because sometimes I just forget to, but normally it's around 30-60 ounces a day, sometimes more, but normally never less than that. 

What I'm having an issue with is replacing the calories lost from drinking so much soda with food. I'd probably consume about 200-300 calories a day in just soda alone. I was also overeating and going over the amount of calories I should have been eating as well. In general, I was consuming too many calories, but I don't have a specific number I could really guess. 

I eat about 1200-1400 calories a day, but some days I feel like I'm just constantly hungry even though it's like I'm eating non-stop. Is there a reason that I'm so hungry all of the sudden? When I would just overeat I was eating because I was bored or binging and coping with that binge. Now I'm actually just flat out hungry, but I feel like I'm eating too much.",23Sep2020,1

They text her childish things about wanting to beat her up, and in the workplace go through lengths to make her day harder. We warned the managers that these women have it out for her. And I told my girlfriend that if they do anything in the workplace we’ll take it to the managers, anywhere else we’ll take it to the police. But this is making my girlfriends anxiety and bipolar disorder spike, and when she has a downspike she asks me to make it stop, and throws moving back home at me.

674,"You know that trope behind the weighty exterior of a fat woman you find a personality and good qualities? Never seen it.

I'm highly misogynistic against former or current fat women and their fat mentality. It's a type of personality I only find in fat women. Sure there is Adele, who is a really nice and down to earth person, and Lizzo, who seems a kind person with no victim complex, and she includes other body types in her videos, I love truth hurts and juice, but for the most part the fatties I meet are more in the honey boo boo category. Loud, obnoxious, talk a lot and do nothing, fester alot, can't hold jobs and have eating disorders and take so much space and emotional space to be seen. They will be throwing tantrums where there is peace. Just being overbearing and use the word sassy to mask envy and mental illness and autoimmune disorders and being a negative person who can't handle their emotions just has to go. You are not sassy (that word basically implies uncontrollably emotionally abusive) or assertive (make scenes in peaceful environments) , you are in emotional pain of being a retard and you are lucky you are fat, cause it helps mask alot of issues that are much worse than the blubber on you like needing a therapist like yesterday. Shirking all responsibilities. Mega rage and victim complex.

 Being clingy becomes uncool after a while, so they become rabid clingy (rage and clingy means it's not codependency thought process) and use the craziness to mask the fatness. This is another thing. For all the fat songs that abound about being all about that bass, and don't need a man, and it's not my fault people can't accept me at my worst (Monroe was like size 6), and drugs and alcohol and magical thinking all fat women are into, they are really clingy and obsessed with YOUR life. They don't spend time on their own lives so you know nothing is happening there. If you take away their need to one up conversations you kill their self esteem or something cause then they can't not see their blubber anymore. Like their entire life is a facade to escape and blame all their problems on fat and not just the personality behind that which makes most fat people fat. Infact the fat people I've met have left such a bad impression on me, that even though I love Adele and Lizzo I can't help feel they are internally the same screaming, rabid whales I've met who have no social awareness and just like to ruin good stuff in the world. Every single problem in my life has been caused by obese women having meltdowns and slandering me. Cause that's a fat woman thing. Attractive, thin and intelligent females don't do this stuff with me. They have the worst victim complex ever and think being obese and envious entitles them special treatment for not having pretty privelege. 

I even found a word for it, so apparently it's not only my prejudice. 
https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fattitude

Apparently alot of people in the world have faced the same issues with fat women. 

As a disclaimer, if you are fat cause you had kids, or have illnesses its acceptable and you are not in the above category. However, why don't we have body acceptance movements for racial diversity, acne, c section scars, skin diseases and the infinite little things all women face everywhere. Fat is the one thing which is by health in your control and we don't need acceptance for it. Fat men don't seem to have this problem and society really takes it out on them.

 But fat female whales have the worst, entitled complex ever. Imagine the stereotypical wallmart whale with a whaletail. They are the type who as adults would fall on the floor and rage cry cause the guy who is the cashier misplaced their order. They talk about things like hand crushing handshakes to assert dominance. They talk about stuff like showing people you take no shit from anyone (means it's like talking to a wall with no logic and rationality) . Being emotionally strong ( which doesn't mean can control their temper or tears) . It means going around making people who make them envious miserable just for being better than them, and trust me it's exactly that, cause these fat women stalk skinny women who make them feel bad emotions, and then they need to hamster that emotions, so they make stupid agendas to get release for that envy and jealousy  which can't be simply they are envious cause that would confirm they are a fat whale. Domination mainly so they don't feel so pathetic. Control of others cause they can't control themselves. Being sexually in charge cause really no one approaches them. Mainly cause these women pathetically try to control their world, cause they have given up trying to control themselves and can no longer build their self esteem from it. 

The fat women I've met, have given me really bad opinions on other fat women. I have never seen a situation where the fat women  is hiding a beautiful mind or personality. Quite the contrary, I usually find them helpless retards, cause the effort it takes to be thin is the same effort it takes to have skills and accomplishments in anything in the world. 

Fat men are strangely the exception cause society doesn't treat them kindly for being just chubby. Fat women are rancid in personality. I don't like to keep many around in my life if I can help it.

How do I get over my fatphobia? The few times I gain weight and lose it, my motivation is not to look more hotter  when I get skinny again, it's mainly that I don't want to join that group, they are obnoxious.",23Sep2020,1
675,"Years ago when i was an undergrad, i started off pre-med— from heavy pressure from my parents since childhood. After going through a serious depression, i found that my real passion was international relations, languages, diplomacy and decided to leave pre-med. i could do science, i only did gen chem 1-2, they werent hard but i wasnt rlly interested in them as much as other courses.

I decided to transfer to a much better university pursue my love of international relations/languages. I did really well and wanted to apply to law school to do intl law. 

During my 2nd uni and since graduating i did a number of research internships and fellowships relating to intl relations and languages tht i loved.
I took the lsat/ exam to enter law school and despite my months and hundreds of hours of studying my score is not where it needs to be for the top schools. Recently, ive come to regret not doing medicine. I keep telling myself that i wouldve done well in the pre-med courses, done well on the mcat and gotten into med school.

I have no way of guaranteeing these things obviously. Ive come regret NOT taking the pre med courses AND the other courses i was interested in tht uni didnt offer them. Its been 2 yrs since ive graduated and ive put SO MUCH time and effort preparing for law school and now it seems like i want to talk away to medicine. I dont what to do. It would seem so foolish to walk away from all the work i have done just to bet on the possibility of medicine. It would take a few years to do post bacc, mcat apply and even then theres no guarantee  and in tht time i could be graduating law school

I used to just go over to friend’s houses, but now because of COVID-19 my mom won’t let me. I have anxiety, depression and insomnia but my mother won’t let me take the therapy that I used to have because “we need to save our money, it’s foolish to waste money on a luxury right now.” My father has become increasingly worse, more time at home means more time to drink. The only times he doesn’t get extremely aggressive or belligerent with me are when he drinks so much that he passes out. Last night was the final straw. I had been drawing something for over 2 weeks and put well over 70 hours of work into it. It was a comic that accounted the story of my favorite game: Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. At about 11:00 I wanted to show him because I was genuinely proud, and he usually doesn’t start drinking until my mom goes to bed, but she went to bed early last night without me knowing. I walk out of my room and show my dad and I see that he’s drunk so I start to back up and he snatches the comic out of my hand and throws it  I’m the garbage and asked me why I would put so much time into something so “worthless.”

681,"Btw, currently working on my studies, I want to get an engineer certificate then move out to another country to get a more specific one like med engineer, aerospace engineer, etc.. (I'm still not sure which)

The reasons I want to move out from this country is, one of the reasons is language. I'm foreign but I hate my main language. I love English more and I want to use it but people here in my country are very uneducated and dont know it speak it. Probably think I'm trying to be superior to them when I speak it.

Another reason is, I'm not myself here. It's because this country cares so much about culture, that's what's making people so close minded. For example if I want to express my feelings and thoughts theres a limit to it. Another example is sexuality, you must be straight, or else this community I live in between will all talk bad things about you. They will be saying things like Oh No hIs pAreNts DiNdt RaIse HiM WeLl. LOok at hOw He LooKs aNd AcTs nOw. 

Note: my parents are open minded (my mom more than my dad) and I'm almost 100% positive they will support my choice or opinion no matter what it is. I'm blessed to have them as parents)

Another reason is this country is so old school. People here are back to farming. While in countries like Dubai for example, there are robots being made and highly intelligent AI, here we still get blackouts. Smh

Another reason is I feel like im different than this community society im in. I like hip hop music, jazz etc.. but people here only listen to music that are the language the main one, and I hate it. So itd be weird at partys. 

Another reason is this country doesn't support sports, even though I LOVE sports. Like seriously, if I wasnt in this shitty country I would become a basketball player. But nope, when I bring that topic up here, everyone will rush to me and say, you wont have a future in that while you are in this country. (And I agree)

I could go on but I dont wanna make this post more long than it already is, I hope you understand me,

691,"Content warning: Suicidal thoughts, self-harm, eating disorder. Long post.

Earlier this year I (22F) graduated and completed my bachelor's degree in pharmacy. At the moment I'm supposed to be studying for the board exam so I can get a license to work, but I hate the career path that I'm stuck with. I *did* choose this degree myself, thinking it would be my passion, but after having done internships in different settings (I've interned at a hospital, a retail pharmacy, and a pharmaceutical manufacturer) I realized I would just be miserable should I proceed to become a licensed pharmacist. There's nothing about this career that is appealing to me.

Due to the pandemic, the board exam is cancelled this year, but even so I don't think I have time to find a job that I like or at least tolerate. I've been focused on academics all this time that I haven't developed any other skills or hobbies. I've already broke down crying in front of my mother while raising this concern, saying ""I don't want to be a pharmacist but I don't know what else I can or want to do."" To which she said that I need a job to live in this world and I should make use of the degree I already have, it would be a waste if I study a completely unrelated degree.

With that kind of response I don't see the point in living if I'm just going to hate my life, working a job I don't like. I've even had fleeting thoughts about ending my life. Again I cried in front of my parents while saying that but they just ignored me during my breakdown. They talked to me like normal the next morning. Another day I couldn't the tears from flowing and my mom asked what's wrong, I thought she would listen this time but when I said ""I don't want to live,"" she just looked annoyed. I've been diagnosed with major depressive disorder but my parents probably don't take my suicidal thoughts seriously since the most ""extreme"" thing I've done in the past is slitting my arms and thighs and no actual attempts on my life. Also I haven't been eating much (some days, not at all) for months so maybe the lack of nutrients is negatively impacting the way I think even more. My family is somewhat encouraging this behavior too by complimenting my weight loss.

These days I'm just wasting time by going on social media and sleeping excessively. There's no immediate pressure to seriously study for the board exam but my mother tells me to at least study for a few hours each day. I can't even do that because I no longer understand the simplest of lessons (which I suspect is an effect of my malnutrition). I really can't get past reading one page before giving up, because either I don't understand what I've read or I feel existential dread.

I feel so lost. I don't know what I want to do. On the other hand I don't know how to make peace with the fact that I'll be stuck with a career I hate (but before that, I don't know how to study for the board exam because it's been months since I've been in a classroom).

692,"Hi,

I am torn about work at the moment.

I cannot decide what job to take. I work in before and after school care with children. This isn't my career goal, I am still in university. It is the same position at two different places. Here is my dilemma:

Place A - Pays $2-3 more per hour, don't enjoy being there as much as I don't feel close with my colleagues (have only started working here during the summer, it's really only been 1.5 months)

Place B - Pays less, love my coworkers, sense of comfort, more physical space (aka more space to spread out because COVID), I feel inspired to be better there

Granted, it is the same position at both places. I'm just torn on what to do. When I do the math, the higher paying job rewards me with \~$130 more per week, which equates to about $600 more per month. I'm a college student so yes money is important and I should start saving, but I've been at Place B for so long that I think a part of me is scared to leave?

Not an option to ask for a raise at Place B. The $600/month between the two jobs is quite a difference though.

I mention a sense of comfort at Place B - like I genuinely love all of my coworkers there and can trust them, whereas I do not trust the team at Place A at all. I feel like I'll be a bit more stressed at Place A, but I guess the extra stress can be compensated with the higher pay? I'm not sure. Maybe I just need to give Place A more time? Only been working there the past two months, in comparison to Place B where I've worked for 3 years.

Now with COVID and me panicking about the future in general in post-grad life, who knows? Should I go for the money? My parents are immigrants and I'm worried for them too, financially.

Basically, my head says to go work at Place A, whereas my heart says Place B. Any tips on what to do? Do I do it for the money or overall good time? Hard to decide.",23Sep2020,1

695,"          I am a 19 year old (male) student from New York currently enrolled in college with no working experience. I am taking up Video and Television at the current  moment. Last year I was within the fine arts, but found out for me it was just a great hobby not a good job/career for me.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          I have applied for jobs and internships day in, and day out within the last year to no success. I will say I have done it all from applying online, to then showing up in person to inform I have applied online, handing in a physical copy of my resume, expressing how I am actually excited to work within whatever field I have applied to, and am willing to work (basically not be the type of person to call out or purposely show up late). At first I thought well maybe my resume is not good because I have made it my senior year of highschool, so I made an appointment with an advisor in my college and together have redone my resume. Im not sure what I can do now, and am feeling like I'm just doing the same cycle which will eventually leave me back to square one. Any advice for what I can do?",23Sep2020,1

698,"I've had 4 professional career-esque job interviews in my life. 

One was at a 30+ year old traditionally run company, after the interviews HR called and offered me a salary and I had the opportunity to negotiate. 

One was at a 4 year old traditionally run company and the CFO asked me point blank, **""So how much do you want, I've hired people and** ***underpaid*** **them before.""** later a subordinate called to offer the job and told me a salary.  Again I could've negotiated if I'd wanted the job. 

Finally- twice I've interviewed at startups. In both interviews the mid-level managers seemed to want me to ask **""*****So what's the salary?""***  Both times I haven't asked because I haven't been offered the job yet and don't even know if I'm doing well in the interview. Moreover I expect HR to handle salary negotiations. 

However companies *have* said **""We pay $XX,XXX.XX for this position.""** Which is good and well in my mind. I've also been asked - **""S*****o*** **what kind of salary do you expect for this job?**"" which is also fine if they're trying to gauge my interest and salary expectation. If their offer is too low or too high they'd be able to tell something based on my response, or my reaction to the previous question. 

I don't like *telling* my desired salary or asking what a job pays until I know the other party is interested in hiring me.  *(I.E: we're in the final stages of hiring)* 

That being said- is there any norm regarding when to ask the salary in a professional setting?   
I don't like letting others down or having slightly awkward interviews. My perception is that salary should be told early-on if it's low or asked about later on if there's room for negotiation.",23Sep2020,1
699,"I just moved into a new studio apartment 3 weeks ago. Pretty small place and built in 1963, but it works, I actually really like it.

I’m 21 and usually work in the live music industry, meaning my body clock has me staying up late and sleeping in most of the time, so a baby crying at all hours of the day has been awful quite honestly.

700,"Years ago when i was an undergrad, i started off pre-med— from heavy pressure from my parents since childhood. After going through a serious depression, i found that my real passion was international relations, languages, diplomacy and decided to leave pre-med. i could do science, i only did gen chem 1-2, they werent hard but i wasnt rlly interested in them as much as other courses.

I decided to transfer to a much better university pursue my love of international relations/languages. I did really well and wanted to apply to law school to do intl law. 

During my 2nd uni and since graduating i did a number of research internships and fellowships relating to intl relations and languages tht i loved.
I took the lsat/ exam to enter law school and despite my months and hundreds of hours of studying my score is not where it needs to be for the top schools. Recently, ive come to regret not doing medicine. I keep telling myself that i wouldve done well in the pre-med courses, done well on the mcat and gotten into med school.

I have no way of guaranteeing these things obviously. Ive come regret NOT taking the pre med courses AND the other courses i was interested in tht uni didnt offer them. Its been 2 yrs since ive graduated and ive put SO MUCH time and effort preparing for law school and now it seems like i want to talk away to medicine. I dont what to do. It would seem so foolish to walk away from all the work i have done just to bet on the possibility of medicine. It would take a few years to do post bacc, mcat apply and even then theres no guarantee  and in tht time i could be graduating law school

Im just afraid im on the wrong track. Tht im ruining my life, then again i could be saying the same thing if i did medicine. Part of fears tht since doctors always have job security, can work anywhere and doesnt rlly matter where they  go to med school it seems much better than law esp for me since it seems like i wont get into a top law school,Idk.  Also given wht i potentially want to study in med it will take 10-14 yrs to finish  as opposed to 3 for law school. There is a good chance i can get some good scholarships for some law schools as well.  Part of me feels tht this may all stem from my anxiety and fear about the future.

I tried convincing her to not date him because I don't trust him at all and I don't want my friend to be stuck in a toxic relationship, but there was only so much I could have done. I couldn't force her to do anything. All I could do was keep an eye out and express my disapproval, but reassure her that I'd always be there for her. This boy also got her into smoking cigarettes. I realize that it's normal at our age to experiment, but it's starting to look like an addiction. It's basically all she talks about. I'm against smoking because of certain experiences I've had in my life, and I wouldn't really have anything to say if my friends smoked every once in a while because it's totally their business, but this friend in particular is constantly smoking. A few weeks ago her boyfriend broke up with her, but she still hangs out with him hoping he'll reconsider.

My issue is with his grading system when it comes to discussion boards. Instead of taking points away after the due date, he’s taking points off based on how many days your work was submitted before the due date. Which makes absolutely no sense to me. Here’s a copy and paste from his syllabus

**“a) 100 points you must post your entries on at least 3 different days.

b) 75 points you must post your entries on 2 different days.

c) 50 points you must enter your entries on 1 single day but BEFORE the last day (due date).

719,"At the beginning of the year I reconnected with an old friend after years of losing touch. I knew she was married and had a daughter, but we started talking every day as old friends. She began to get more flirtatious with me so I decided to ask about her relationship. She told me that they had been separated for a year and planned to be divorced by the end of summer. Eventually we started talking about a relationship with us, but decided it's best we wait for her to be out of her marriage for a few months before making things official and instead just invest our time in getting to know one another and not pursuing anyone else so that when the time comes we will know it's what we wanted. We both developed feelings for one another and had sex several times. I knew it wasn't right, but I fully believed that she had the intention to leave her marriage. Fast forward several months and neither of them had filed for a divorce. I began questioning her about when it would happen and she would get angry with me and tell me that we should just end things because I wasn't being patient. We never ended it, because I told her I was willing to wait (and I was) but I needed to stay updated. One day she told me that we should just stay friends for now and stop saying things like ""I love you"". I understood she may have been feeling guilty so I agreed. A few weeks later my brother had passed away and the next I drove across the state to see her. When I got to town she told me that her mother backed out of watching her daughter and she couldn't come see me. We had an argument and she tried ending things with me again so I stayed in the hotel alone and we didn't talk that night. The next day she texts me and asks to come see me; so we talked and we worked things out and she told me she still loved me and asked me to have sex with her. I left the next day and and I only heard from her 3 times over the next 2 weeks. One morning she called me on the way to work and officially ended things and said she had lost all feelings but wanted to be my friend. I agreed, but I was still in love. We talked every day still for another month and eventually she apologized and said that she needed to end the marriage before anything else. A couple of weeks go by and we talk on the phone when she tells me that they had decided to go to counseling, but she still wanted out. I was hurt, but I decided to still try and be her friend in hopes that she may still end up with me in the end. A week goes by and I was scrolling through Instagram when I saw her and another guy flirting in his comments of a video he posted of himself in the gym.

I now know basically every about what she has been through now so before I go into it this is dark and isn't going to be anything fun to read at all.

So apparently when her older sister was around 15 her mum and sister started being sexual with each other and would masturbate together alot and occasionally have full sex which was all brought in by her mum. After a while of her knowing this was happening she asked her sister about it who basically convinced her to join in. This happened when she was 11 and they have all been regularly having sex together ever since.

Her mum is a ""swinger"" I guess and is part of fetish clubs where she would find men who where into younger girls and bring them home with her where they would have orgies together which apperantly started when she was 16 so was technically legal.

Her mum and her sister are complete predators and I'm even more emotional and super tempted to contact the police about this now whereas yesterday I wasn't. I will probably make my decision based on what people here suggest and what sounds right. 

Obviously she is no longer a child and she has been indoctrinated into believing that it is normal and is very into it sadly otherwise I would try to convince her to come forward herself. I don't know what reporting it to the police would do at this point but my only other option is to just let her stay living how she is living and never having the people who have abused her brought to justice. 

If your going to ask me why I care so much she is somebody I have known for since I was about 9 and we have been in an and off relationship for the better part of that time so that's why she has told me everything and just imagining while I was an innocent child she was being raped by her own family makes me super compelled to do something. 

I'll awnser any questions anyone has but what I want is advice and the legal consequences for her if I where to go to the police.",23Sep2020,1
721,"Throwaway for reasons and This is my first ever reddit post.

Hello, My name is J and I am 16 years old. My mom and stepdad started dating 11 years ago and I have a great relationship with him as my father figure. They had four other kids within the 11 years they have been together

 A couple years after they started dating, he started get violent when he was angry and he hit her. It didn't happen super often and I was a little kid so I didn't understand what was going on. For a while I thought that it was normal for parents to fight like that. I am aware now that I was wrong.

Fast forward to Late 2019, he was the primary income for the family while my mom did school at home. He stopped bringing home money for 8 months and my mom struggled to keep bills paid. It wasn't until mid 2020 that he admitted to his fentanyl/opioid problem. He got super high at one point and caused a scene that ended with him getting arrested. We tried therapy and he was clean for a long time but for the past few weeks he's been using again.

My mom doesn't finish school until December and even then I don't know if she will find a job right away in this current climate. She has always managed to keep us afloat but I don't know if she can do it much longer. 

We have kicked him out a million times but because we rely on him he always comes back.

My mom is too embarresed to ask her family for help, but most of them can't do anything to help us or are hateful assholes.

My mom doesn't wanna go to the police because she's afraid they will take her children for her.(She doesn't believe me that they won't)

This has of course been very stressful on me. I've had to wrestle him off of her in the past and I am practically her protector. I also have online school and other personal problems that just add more weight to my shoulders.

I cannot show her this thread because she wouldn't approve of me using internet strangers for advice. We live in a shitty small town. Our neighbors have heard him beating her and don't call the cops. I am not allowed to speak about it outside the house but you can only keep this quiet for so long. We have nowhere to go, nowhere to hide, nowhere to stay. It's getting to the point that I am afraid that he will kill her and I'm afraid to leave her alone to go on trips or hang out with friends.

I am just asking for some advice on my options right now. I am very hesitant to give any specific info on my location or personal info in case this gets traced back to me and I will get in huge trouble with my family for this.

Any and all advice will be welcomed. I am sorry for the poor formatting, I am not used to reddit posts.",23Sep2020,1
722,"I'm a preschool teacher. Three months ago I was hired along with a new director and several new teachers. The old staff ran the buisness almost to the ground by destroying the building and never having established rules. There was no lesson planning because you never know who was going to be in your classroom. The old director was still accepting new students even though the school was over filled and under staffed. 

Our new director hired me along with many other teachers. While we arnt understaffed anymore we are still always out of ratio.The legal max is 5 kids per 1 teacher but at times I'll be left alone with 13 kids. The new director promised to ""fix"" the issues around the building.

723,"I really dont know where to post this but I'll try. 

Back story: my dad is an alcoholic hes 60 (I think) and hes been a drinker since he was about 20 apparently he was bad when my older brother and sister were under his care (his ex and him divorced and he got main custody because she wornt that interested. I also dont get along with his kids and am not talking to them at the moment dont know if that's relevant) apparently he was so bad (as in 100 times worse of an alcoholic) when they were kids and I have it easy (I've been raised as an only child because my mum and dads other kids are all 15+ years older than me) according to my mums family my dad got 100 times worse of an alcoholic after I was born (10 years into my mum and dads relationship).

So idk i think I just want to rant more than anything. I'm just gonna bullet point what he has done.


• destroyed my mums house (flooded the bathroom about 50 times, broke the ceiling of the living room and bedroom, nearly set the house on fire while drunk, destroyed the back bedroom, got the house infested with rats) 



• so the dog ate some rat poisen that was in his room, so I rushed her the vets, he hasn't cheaked if they have been eaten but is convinced he placed it so she couldn't have gotten to it (it was in her bloods and vomit). But basically he went the pub and got that drunk that I couldn't get in touch with him so I had to get my cousin to take me to the vets (not having a go at my cousin hes boss but when i live with my dad i shouldnt need to call my cousin for things like that ) and later had to get my brother to take me to vet appointment for cheakups and bloods (dont live with my brother I live with my dad but my cousin lives a street over all this family is on my mums side I'm not close to his side) 


• so he works on the building and is self employed luckily he was working through all this rubbish but 2 months ago resources ran out and he was off work but didnt tell me till 2 or 3 weeks in (funny story the dog got poisoned on the first week of him being off) and got absolutely bladderd every day for 4 weeks then drunk for another 2 weeks. I honestly dont know how much he was spending my sister (mums side) is trying to convince me and herself that he was just topping himself up but I know he dosnt drink like that, he buys 2 drinks to your 1, my nan (mums side) and I are guessing £30 a day ish for the first 4 weeks and between £10 and 15 for the last 2 weeks. Basically he drained our money on beer but this is all just an approximate could be more could be less. 



• about 2 weeks ago he had a seizure. I heard him fall but I didnt think anything of it because if he gets frustrated he throws things, this makes me a bad person but I only went to cheak on him after about 5 minutes because I was doing my hair and wanted to cheak on the damage then seen him concluding on the floor stuck inbetween the dryer and the chair I struggled to pull him up but managed it where he gained full consciousness. Since then I've been paranoid when he drops something or throws something or anything like that because I didnt cheak on him for so long.

725,"My background: I am a social worker and my duty is to protect children. 

Back in the beginning of the year, I received a very detailed message from a trustworthy source. Apparently one of my clients was very worried about the family of his girlfriend. They had a baby together. 

We talked. One point was that his gf alledgedly abuses alcohol during her pregnancies and this might explain why her older children are doing bad at school. As I wrote earlier, I already got plenty of details from my source and some things were absurd. When I asked him about the claims, he tried to hold many details back. My colleague and I played along and assured him that everything is okay. 

So far, we never confronted the gf. Based on the different versions that we got from the source and then from him, we could tell that he must have shallow interests. However, I thought it is still serious and my obligation to report this to the child protective service. We were now asked to confront the gf about the alcohol part. 

That is something that I find necessary to do but I don't know HOW... 

If we talk about the claims, I'm sure she asks who talks sh\*t behind her back. Second, she might be so emotional that once again she can't take care of her children. If we get him into the room while talking about it, they might fight or stick together. I believe that he would try to make us look untrustworthy in front of the whole family. And it took already so much time to get her trust. You need honest answers about the children and the parents. 

So I wonder, how I could talk about this? Especially when I know that this guy actually did a lot of good for the children while she is still struggeling to support them and herself. Moreover, my colleague is and boss are super nervous about it and it might cause an image and financial problem for my company.",23Sep2020,1

i'm not really sure where to start with this. to keep it short and simple, i need advice on how to work through the fear of my partner dying. they're mostly healthy (aside from breast cancer running in their family, but we're working on keeping that monitored) and we're both young (both 23), so it's not as if there's an immediate threat. however, every single time i look at them, a part of my brain says, ""one day they're going to die and you'll never see them again."" it's genuinely distressing, and logically i understand death is something we can neither predict nor prepare for, but i can't stop thinking about it. this fear manifests in 2 common ways: 1) fear of them dying before me via disease/cancer/sickness/etc. as we get older, and 2) fear that they will get into an accident (such as a car accident) and pass away. 

i haven't been able to see my therapist due to covid (he has a 91 year old mother that stays in the office with him while he works) and i know therapy is, ultimately, the key to working through this (it's a psychological fear stemming from my anxiety issues most likely). i was just hoping to get some practical advice on how to perhaps stop thinking about it as much, or advice from anyone who suffer from thoughts such as these as well.

732,"Sorry in advance for formatting, I’m on mobile. I came out to most of my family as trans (nonbinary transmasc for those that may be curious) when I was 17, and I recently came out to my mom last month. Everyone on my side is so easy going and accepting of the fact that I’m me. My mom was looking at our insurance to see if they covered testosterone injections and other transitionary procedures, y’know just showing me she supports me and wants to help whoever she can. 

Now, my fiancé and I tried to tell his family a few months ago. It didn’t end well because they are incredibly homophobic and transphobic. We ended up having to play it off like it was a big fucked up joke because they were threatening to completely cut him off and stop helping him pay for his college. 

Our wedding is next year and he’s now telling me that he’s scared to invite his family because he knows mine will respect my they/he pronouns, and his family will lose their shit when they hear that. They’re already pissed that I’ll be wearing a suit instead of a dress. He’s scared of being known as “the gay twin” and being disowned, which I understand. But it also hurts that I will never be able to be myself around them.

734,"Hi! This is my first post on here. I've debated getting advice on this issue for a while, but I think I really need it. I'm 17f and have been having issues with a 26m coworker, we'll call him Arthur. Sorry if this post is a little long.

Some background:

So Arthur is the Dairy lead at the grocery store I work at. He has a child and a partner. I'm a clicklist worker and have to go through his department often to pick products for customers. When I first came there I heard horror stories about him being rude and making people cry. He often breaks the cooler door in anger or throws things. I eventually met him and he asked very intrusive questions, ""What's your age"" ""Do you have a boyfriend"" ""What school do you go to"", things like that. I go to an online school and can work earlier than most kids my age, so he was curious about that. Arthur was very mean, he would insult me by calling me an idiot or degrade me if I needed his help finding a product. Eventually, I started working with him in the dairy and we became close. He helped me a lot more than other people and taught me a lot. He was very kind and connected with me on things like both of our dad's having passed away. He would often ask me why I wasn't dating anyone or try to get me to date people like his younger brother. I see Arthur as a father figure and admire him a lot. He knows how much I respect him and I often come to him for advice. I trusted him deeply. I knew he would never approach me in a bad way and he was one of the few people I could look in the eye.

Now, there was another man that used to work with us in the grocery department, but left not too long ago. We'll call him Matt (25m). Most people didn't like him. He's autistic and has some communication issues. People would complain about him and at one point Arthur straight up said, ""I hate you."" to his face. Matt and I became very very close, like family. We're both bisexual and he helped me get my diagnosis for aspergers. He used to work in child court and saw many sexual assault and pedophile cases (remember this for later), so I knew he could never see me in that light. I told him about how Arthur would make sure that people wouldn't make sexual comments towards me. Like how our coworker told me that I look much older for my age, and Arthur came to me and told me that's usually not a good sign when an older man says that to you. Matt said that seemed like Arthur had a crush on me.  I told him no, Arthur isn't like that.

Now onto the situation: 

Now, Matt is moving to Florida so I have been spending a lot of time with him. I take lots of pictures of him for Instagram where Arthur follows me. Recently, I've been having lots of people ask me if I'm dating Matt at work. I tell them no, he's 8 years older than me and has a girlfriend. However, I had another coworker tell me that Arthur has been telling people that I've been dating Matt. I was angry, what if Matt's employers found out about the rumor and decided to fire him over it? The next day, I stopped Arthur and asked him to take a break with me later, he agreed. He seemed to be in a cheerful mood. Later, he stopped me in the middle of the store and told me that we were going to talk now. I was stunned, I didn't want to talk about it in front of customers. But I respect Arthur so much that I decided to do what he wanted. I told him the situation. He wouldn't let me get through my sentence before interrupting me, ""No. I didn't say that. I don't even know Matt."" He got very angry and defensive all of a sudden. I know he knows Matt, they used to talk at work and I would often bring up Matt during our conversations. I asked him why our coworker would lie about him saying that and he started yelling at me, ""No. This is the end of the conversation. Do me a favor and don't ever talk to me about anything other than work again."" I cried about the entire day. 

 So, I went to Matt and had breakfast with him, his girlfriend (30f), and our friend ""Jennifer""(24f). I explained the situation. Matt stops me and tells me that Arthur telling people I was dating him is a common tactic that pedophiles use. I guess he saw it a lot in court. He and his girlfriend think that he's grooming me and has a crush on me. I don't believe that, and a couple other people feel the same way. Some people say they could see him having a thing for me. They asked me to block him on Instagram, I did. I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. Arthur won't even stand next to me during work, won't speak to me or look at me. I didn't get the closure I wanted. I really want to speak to him again, I miss our conversations. I at least want to know what I did wrong and tell him I'm sorry for making him uncomfortable. I'm not sure if he would be angry if I tried talking to him again. Some people said he would, others say they think he wants to talk to me again. Does anyone have any advice on what I should do?",23Sep2020,1

742,"Hi all.

So when buying our house we did not get a survey done (please learn from our mistake and always get the survey done). We moved in and some months later we got a survey because we were installing a fence.

Our neighbors on one side said we could connect to their fence, no biggie. Cool. Well, when the surveyors showed up, it turns out that their retaining wall in the front of the house is built four feet onto our property. It comes right up and abuts to our driveway. The side of the fence that we are connected to, entirely on our property. The stairs in their backyard leading to alley, part of those are on our property. This retaining wall was built before we moved in, but there are Google maps pictures showing that their old wall stopped on their property line.

They were super spooked when the surveyors were here. They kissed our asses for a long time afterwards until they realized we weren't going to say anything (at least not yet).

Its to the point now where we may need to bring in an ill family member and our driveway now cannot accommodate a wheelchair. When our cars are in the driveway we cannot open the back left door either because of that retaining wall.

How do we have a conversation with them that keeps things amicable as possible? We will have to live next to them for the next 30 years possibly. I know I can't control their feelings or behavior, but I want to approach in the best way possible. If they're assholes about it, I guess it is what it is, but I tried, you know?

744,"So, obviously this is a throw away account, and it's super long, but I'd love some advice.

I am 29, and have worked quite a few jobs. I usually stay anywhere from 2-4 years at each job, depending on the work environment and how much I enjoy the people I work with (sometimes location plays a role too). I've never been fired. The one thing I've noticed, is that I usually end up being deeply hurt by people's actions, or I feel like I'm being talked about behind my back. I'm aware that this could signal that I'm quite sensitive, but I also feel like that can't always be the case. People who are peers, usually end up acting like they are my boss and ordering me around, sometimes I don't get invited to group meetings, other times passive aggressive comments are made that usually alert me to someone's real feelings about my work. Anyways, here is what happened today that made me cry (for the first time in over 2 years):

I was assigned a project (Let's call it Project X). Project X was given to me in a semi patronizing way of "" you're super organized, and honestly... well people don't have time to do this, but because you're so organized, it would be a great resume builder and it would help us out a ton!!! I""ll help you lead the project, but I'll let you do most of the planning."" Fine, cool. I'm stepping in for Project X since my main job revolves around something deeply affected by COVID... so this means I'm doing content creation, digital graphics, etc. which are out of my normal scope. I proceeded to make up a strategic plan, coordinated with the appropriate executives, and then boom. First hurdle, the person who was supposed to develop the html for the project, said they couldn't. So, I went to my boss to tell her we ran into a snag, and she'd need to approve a new developer. She finds a new person, he tells her in a private email that he's not a developer, but he could help design. One month later, I request the html from the ""developer"" and he forwards the email saying that he told my boss he wasn't a developer. I hop on a call with another employee (Let's call her B. I tend to notice that B does a lot of schmoozing and is very much a yes-(wo)man.) and the executive, and tell him Project X will be delayed. He is obviously very frustrated and annoyed, and then B says "" I was wondering the same as you, don't mean to throw anyone under the bus, but seems to me that the team should have found another person to do the html and they miscommunicated with each other."" While all of this is happening, I have yet to tell my team members that our boss dropped the ball, B is talking shit, and this whole project is now on me to create from A-Z even though I don't have the skill set. Anyways, I hop off of the call where B talks shit, and then she adds in my boss... where they then proceed to draw up another plan for Project X without involving me. This is now the 5th conversation B has roped everyone into without alerting me. So, there are promises being made, deadlines being set, etc without me even being aware of it.

Fast forward to today, my coworker who was supposed to do the html says to me that he's just going to take over Project X. He thanks me for my assistance, but he's going to be coordinating with the team from now on. I am shocked.... I have all of these things I never shared... and now it looks like I've dropped the ball. I don't normally say anything controversial in return, but I did today because I felt gutted.

Me: May I ask why you're taking the lead? Him: Because it's easier, I'll just be coordinating from now on, thanks Me: Great, I'd love to understand as this project was assigned to me Him: I'll be just coordinating it, appreciate all of the work you've done Me: Okay, you can speak candidly with me as I won't take it personally Him: I appreciate the effort, but honestly I've done the majority of the work on this project, and it's just easier to get it done on my own as this project keeps getting dragged out and it's stressing me

This was beyond frustrating as he has not done most of the work. When asked if he could produce the html, he told me he didn't have time.... I can't go to B or my boss because they both support him and are likely to believe him over me always....Finally, the exec gets mad, so now he does the html in under an hour (after 1 month delay of finding a new developer), and then he's now stepping in as super man. All of this is beyond annoying because this has been my project from the beginning, and I've been doing the best I could without being included in multiple meetings (and finding out way later or after the fact). I feel gutted... I've cried today, I'm sad. I was bullied SEVERELY when I was in 7-9 grade, and I don't feel respected. I don't feel my work is respected. Anytime I do anything, I'm always told "" yeah it's good, but it could be better... here let me fix it."" I feel if I were a shitty worker, I probably would have been fired by now right? I saw that two of my coworkers B and html guy hopped on a call right after we had this little exchange. I feel like I'm being talked about.

If I say anything, I'll be labelled as too sensitive. If he says anything, he's just being strong and assertive, and he's more respected. I think I tend to say sorry a lot, and self deprecate, which can make people respect you less, but geeez... I'm so frustrated and angry. I didn't air out everyone's shit, the person on my team who was supposed to do the html design didn't want to, now has to and is saying he's done everything....My boss is scared to upset him, so when he said he couldn't do the html, she told me I should go online and learn how to do it to get Project X out the door in the next day or two.

TL;DR: I feel I'm not respected at work, a project was taken away from me by a peer, and I don't know how to gain respect or if I'm being too sensitive.",23Sep2020,1

I meet someone. We talk. I realize that I like him. I enjoy his company and he genuinely makes me happy. He piques my interest. I'm curious about him and want to talk to him more. It's like I can't get enough of him. 

He suddenly becomes the center of my attention. I feel this pressure to prioritize him over everything else just so he doesn't lose interest in me. I will make time for him and ignore other essentials in life (like sleep and personal goals). He basically becomes in control of my emotions. If we talked today, I'm happy and it was a good day. If we don't talk, I'm sad and cry myself to sleep.

758,"For background, I am a second year undergraduate college student and I am currently looking for a volunteer research position in a lab or facility. So I'm not applying for an official job, I'm just reaching out to look for volunteer research experience. The thing is, I added  an extracurricular on my resume that I didn't actually do (volunteer tutor/mentor with an educational student org at my college) and I never took it off for a couple months.

I don't know why I did it. It's not something I even needed to do. I did it out of desperation, not out of deception. I recently sent this resume to a research facility inquiring about a volunteer research position, and I have an interview with them next week. It's now hitting me that what if they call the stuff listed on my resume to verify my extracurriculars and that one fake volunteer role comes to bite my back (There isn't any contact information for my listed experience on the resume though so I think they would need that information from me. There also isn't any formal application as I am inquiring about a volunteer research position). 

I know what I did was wrong, and I will never blindly write a lie like that on my resume ever again. I'm just really worried now because this was my top choice for starting research that I've been looking for a while now, and theres a chance I may have just thrown that away because of my stupid mistake.

He then, reached out to me on iMessage because emails, and quickly devolved into forcing me to “look at his dick and tell him if it’s okay because that’s what us girls do - discuss or rubbish insecurities”. It was pretty vile. I put him in place but he seemed to fester on the negative exchange. I realised and I blocked and moved on. He repeatedly comes up every few years and I eventually settled with not responding. Now, tonight, he just sent me three nudes of himself face and body etc in them and sent it from some fake account acting like his nudes got leaked and this random person is sending those to me.

762,"I live with my partner and their family for clarity. 

Basically what happened is one of their dogs passed away earlier this summer, leaving their other dog without his friend. So my partners mom was looking at the dogs at the humane society and saw EL. She’s a small senior dog with a cleft pallet and she’s definitely super cute. But insane, food aggressive, toy aggressive, and not trained at all for a senior dog. The humane society gave her surgery to help fix her pallet and nose, so she’s in a cone and still healing. Without that cone I might have been bit a few times during the at home meet and greets. 

We did three meet and greets. One at the humane society, and two at home. She’s cute other than the growling and aggression, feeding her is an absolute night mare. Yesterday was our last meet and greet and my partner was at work for the day. My partners brother, who really wanted nothing to do with her in the first place wouldn’t come out of his room. I cuddle with her and she was very cute but my answer was still I don’t know. But when we brought her back to the humane society my partners mom was insistent that we’re getting her anyways so we might as well take her some tonight. I felt pressure to keep the peace and said that it would be sad after so many meet and greets to just leave her.. but that wasn’t a yes. Before I knew it she inside was signing the papers without consulting anyone else in the family. 

We bring her home and she sits on my lap on the car ride, and I’m the only one brave enough to pick her up so now apparently she’s my dog??? If she wants up on the couch I have to go out of my way to pick her up and put her on the couch. We are keeping her on a leash for now in the house but it’s me and my partners responsibility to constantly hold her and watch her. She sleeps and eats in our room and my partner and I have to go through the nightmare that is feeding her.. and all my partners mom has done so far is yell at her for licking her cone and take her for a walk. 

I understand having a new dog comes with patience and training but nobody in the house hold agreed to getting her. We didn’t sit down as a family and have a group discussion about adopting her. It was my partners mom who made that final decision while my partner was at work and their brother wasn’t even there with us. I can’t deal with it.. I’m not even a dog person. I was welcomed in a home of dog people but I don’t know how to train a dog, I only know to feed it and walk it but that’s it.. 


My partner brought it up this morning and she got mad saying that I wanted the dog and that it’s to late now.. I don’t know what to do. Nobody  wanted her and now we’re stuck with the responsibility of her everything. Were so stressed after one night.",23Sep2020,1

I'm fine with taking his name, but I'd rather we use mine over a new one that we have little connection to. I'm also in a career where I hope to be publishing in the next few years, and it could be easier to not have a name change (but I'm fine with having a professional name different from personal name). 

We have great communication, but I'm having trouble telling him that I don't really want a new name outside of his or mine. I've kind of alluded to it, but I'm not sure how to tell him more explicitly without disappointing him or hurting his feelings.

My mom loves all of us whole heartedly, is very caring when sick, cooks majority of meals, and does the laundry. My mom and Dad have always been on the brink of divorce for as long as I can remember. It seems as if my Dad has given up in the relationship as he sleeps on the couch every night and avoids confrontation by my Mom. My Mom does not speak to any of us nicely. In my opinion she is a negative person, for example, after my grade 8 grad valedictorian speech the first thing she said to me was that I was reading off the paper, in Venice it was raining when we were visiting so we could not ride on the Gandola, it seemed to ruin her trip. My Mom has made scrapbooks of our vacations, and behind every picture it seems like there was an argument behind it. Majority of the arguments at home take place because of a minuscule mess, one of us smelling bad (in her opinion), or something that does not seem to matter in anyone elses head but hers. I have reached out multiple times telling her exactly how I feel and that maybe giving us more responsibility like making us do our own laundry and not just gather our dirty clothes for her may take stress off her mind. She has said on multiple occasions for years she is going to pack her bags and leave, ive also seen in writing that she wishes she never had kids and that she knew she was going to be a bad mother.

784,"Some background....

My lady and I have lived in Colorado for our entire lives. I'm 27 and she is 25. We have lived together for three years in a little apartment and for the most part, we've been decently happy. But recently we have both been feeling smothered by our families and constantly feeling like we are working on pleasing or helping them, than just doing what we want, when we want.

My parents are divorced and my dad remarried. I have a very strong relationship with all 3 of them. Especially my mom. Her dad lives in Poland and her mom is currently sleeping on our couch (I'll get to that part in a sec). She's close with her mom and has a little sister in her teenage years. My sister is grown and living with her man. We all live independent lives except for our mothers.

My mom is a recovering alcoholic and someone who has never really established independence. I feel like I'm taking care of her and helping her function as an adult almost on a daily basis. Her mom, as mentioned, is currently living with us along with her sister in our tiny apartment. She got evicted during the tiny lapse on the eviction moratorium in Colorado and wound up with us. The thing is, over the last two years we have had my mom living with us twice, and her mom living with us 3 different times. They both find themselves in these situations and we both feel obligated to let them stay with us than sleep in their cars. Our fault on that front but still. We are tired of even being put in this situation to begin with. This has been a heavily repeating cycle that we are both completely over.

This is where relocating comes into play. My lady has very bad eczema and her skin dries out astonishingly fast. Colorado is a very dry state virtually year round which makes her life a living hell 95% of the time. So a move somewhere with more moisture seems like a no brainer. So we've been researching and debating and talking and we are at a point we have our hearts set on Oregon and we will be moving in exactly a year from yesterday. The only one we have told is my best friend who may or may not be coming with us.

The part I need advice on is how do I tell my parents this? My mom is a very emotional being who is going to lose her shit and probably try to say she's coming with us (not happening). My dad is a little more logical but it recent months has made it known that he's suffering without his kids around (he moved an hour away into the mountains 3 years ago). My step mom however will be the easy one. She has always been an advocate of moving away and experiencing life when we are young. My hope is she gets through to my dad and we will eventually have both of their support. Her mom has caught wind that we are at least thinking about it and has said she'd come with us (any advice on how to squash that bug immediately is also welcomed).

I have no clue when I should tell them or how. I have really bad anxiety and it can make facing situations like this so daunting I just want to avoid it altogether which is exactly what I do NOT want to do. My family deserves better than that. We are not moving because we hate our families but we do need distance. And that's going to piss everyone off. 

TL;DR we are moving out of state, families are going to lose their shit, how do we tell them and minimize the negative emotions and ensuing arguments?",23Sep2020,1

I wrote about what I've witnessed in the thread linked above. I won't reiterate everything, but the state of the place I'm living in has me very disgusted and at times worried for my own health. Trouble is, I am living with friends of mine, and though I love them dearly, I don't know how to handle their messiness and the dirt in and around our home, infestations with various kinds of noxious animals included. 

I am trying to make a plan as to whether to stay and if for how long, if I need to get out ASAP or can take my time, and especially, how to communicate all this to my friends. Do you think that this situation warrants moving out? Do you think that I can take another half year here to find a proper new place or that it's already quite urgent? I've got the flu (with a fever, so I'm not mentally clear) at the moment, so thinking about things is a bit difficult for me, but I can try to talk things through with someone if one of you is willing to help. I am a bit desperate because I am so grossed out. Thanks so much!",23Sep2020,1
786,"I moved into an apartment room this summer, and I think one of my roommates has schizophrenia and it's starting to affect everyone else that lives here.

&amp;#x200B;

I live with 5 other people. About 2 months ago, a young woman joined us (I will refer to her as E). She has been very shy around us all (we invite her to picnics with the rest of the house, she always declines. My roommates have said she just ignores them. I've only had one pleasant conversation with her about her home country, but otherwise we ignore each other.). However, ever since she's moved in she's had these episodes where she usually ends up either straight up breaking something or flipping something over or putting weird things in places they clearly don't belong. I've recorded them all so I will recount to you what's happened in chronological order:

1.) First occurrence, we were all either not home or in our rooms. One of our housemates who lives across from E's room heard her open her door, walk downstairs, then me and my housemates all heard a loud bang in the communal kitchen. That housemate asked E if anything was wrong on her way up (thinking she fell or something) but E said no and went into her room. me and that roommate went to investigate and we just found our near full trash can thrown across the kitchen with trash everywhere. Me and the housemate had to clean up the entire thing. I texted her that evening asking if she was ok, if she was having any trouble or wanted to talk about anything and she just didnt respond. The housemate who helped me clean is a really talented painter but she became very scared after this incident and had to hide all her paintings away for fear of them getting trashed. We told our landlord about this with pictures and he said if this were to happen again, she would be gone.

2.) I had just returned home from work and went upstairs to get dressed for a run. I am the only boy on the top floor so one of our older roommates asked if the bathroom next to my room could be just for women, which i don't mind. However, i overheard E in the bathroom talking to someone while i was getting dressed (the door was open so she wasnt using it, i later found out she was only talking to her reflection). As I left my room to go for the run, I heard her say ""you look like a little bitch"". I initially thought she was talking to me, so i turned around and that's when i saw she was talking to her reflection. She noticed me going downstairs and slammed the door so hard it shook the house. Later, when i got home from my run, I went into our kitchen and saw a shattered mug and our drying rack (which was full of dishes) flipped over into our sink, in no way was it an accident because it had to have been moved intentionally to end up how it did. I texted all of our housemates and got confirmation that nobody else was home (except E who just didnt respond, and I know she was home because i could hear her). After this incident, she then left a near full bag of trash in front of my door. I then heard her walk back and forth, just ignoring it and leaving it there for me to pick up after her. I told my landlord about this, he said last time if this happened again she would be gone, but he only told my other housemate and not me so i had no idea. However, i told that housemate about what happened and she told me he would get her out, but nothing came of that. He told us he would set up a house meeting with us all but he never showed up.

3.) She shattered her glass coffee pot on our kitchen table and just left it there for us to see. I took a photo and sent it to our landlord. He actually does a lot of handiwork on our apartment so he was here that day and cleaned it up himself. He asked me if i knew who's coffee pot it was, I told him it was E's and that she must have shattered it when i went to do some errands because she was the only other person home again this time as well. I actually overheard a conversation later that night of my landlord asking her if that was her coffee pot. He even asked her if she shattered it and she said yes like no problem, no remorse or anything, and my landlord just said ""oh thats too bad"" then asked if everything else was ok, then he just leaves. Later that night i heard her stomping around at 1am and talking to herself as she kept going up and down our stairs to wash dishes and talk to herself

4.) This is happening today, but she just slammed her door twice so powerfully it shook our house, and then she went downstairs, dug some trash out, and left it in front of my door. My landlord is here now and i told him about it with a picture (actually the trash is still there, im tired of cleaning up after her). This is the second time i've been targeted by her specifically during her tantrums, she hasn't done this for anyone else. Since she seems to be targeting me, im starting to fear for my safety.

&amp;#x200B;

I live in CT and i hear our eviction laws are pretty tough and since it's also still a quarantine, I don't know if my landlord is just being timid about this or if his hands are really tied, but I don't know what to do because im feeling incredibly terrified and stressed out about this situation, im afraid her tantrums will start to become a real hazard for us. They've become more frequent recently and i've noticed she's been talking to her hallucinations a lot lately (she used to be totally silent but now when i pass her in the kitchen she is having a full conversation to herself, no headphones or phone in sight)",23Sep2020,1
787,"Okay, this is super uncomfortable for me to talk about, so once again I’m happy there’s the internet for advice! I know this sounds weird, but I don’t know what else to do than ask for advice on reddit, so here it goes:
I’m working as an Au Pair and one of the children I take care of is a 7 year old boy, let’s call him Max. So Max is mostly a smart, good behaving kid, we get along well most of the time, just when he has had a long day he might get grumpy.
The thing is that... he’s a bit weird sometimes. And I don’t know whether I just shouldn’t care because he’s a child and doesn’t mean anything by it or not. He just... is very touchy, often in a very in gentle way. He touches my bottom randomly, same with my breasts - he just stretches out his arms towards me and idk, gets fidgety. Hides his face on my chest (something very child-like imo), but the other day we were play-fighting and he kinda punched me between my legs (not very child-like?). And today he was very grumpy again and angry at me and... kinda pinched my breasts? Through the sweater of course, but still... 
I don’t really know what to do about it. His little sister isn’t like that - she sometimes claps my bottom, but she’s smaller, she does it with everyone in the family, no big deal. But with Max... it does make me feel uncomfortable but I could never talk to the parents about it and don’t really know what to do. Anyone out there who could give me some advice on it? Should I just leave it and not think about it too much? Max probably means all of this in a totally harmless way and there’s no reason for me to have second thoughts, right?",23Sep2020,1

But we have clear windows on the door to look through. We offer to send voice memos of the lessons, and talk to parents afterwards.

This student, along with most, would do much better one on one.

792,"So Right now we’re doing virtual learning. We have a schedule of when we meet each day. I usually meet this teacher and the specific class on odd days. 

I don’t really like talking on the mic, I like typing it in the chat. I would rather speak face to face in real time.

Each morning he says good morning to us individually.

On the first day (or second, I don’t remember to be honest) when the teacher said good morning to me I was lagging a lot. I couldn’t turn on my mic so he couldn’t hear me say good morning. I’m pretty sure he saw my lips moving on the screen or I might’ve froze. He then said that it’s rude to not say good morning back. I felt pretty embarrassed. 

The next few days I just decided that I should just wave at the camera since it takes too long to turn on the camera. 

Today was an odd day. And I didn’t feel like talking or waving since I was tired. 

The teacher said good morning and I forced a weird smile.. he then repeated good morning again and I didn’t smile at all. He then said “that didn’t feel genuine, turn on your mic and say good morning.”

... 

I then proceed to turn on my mic. I said good morning anyway. I feel like I shouldn’t have done that because I didn’t really want to. Now that I’m thinking of it, I wonder if he heard me say good morning (today I wasn’t lagging but I did see that my mic didn’t turn on even though I pressed curl D to turn on the mic).

After, my friend texted me that I shouldn’t say good morning if I don’t want to. She said the next time he does that she’s going to tell him that it isn’t mandatory. I feel like I should be the one to do that next time, but I’m scared to do so.


When another student came into the virtual meeting he just said good morning and the student didn’t answer. Then another student said good morning to him.

I know it’s a nice thing to say goodmorning but I don’t like talking during the meetings. Only when Im comfortable with the class. 

I really don’t want this to start at the beginning of the year. Me hating the teacher hence, not liking the class work and being lazy.

I’m also wondering if this teacher is going to pick on me during the year. If that does happen I’m not sure what to do. I feel like I should brush it off and don’t let him bother me. If I do that, this is going to result in me not doing my work.",23Sep2020,1
795,"I am currently in a film class where we do a lot of group work. Last week, I was placed in a group with three of my closest peers and our assignment was to create a short talk show to post online (Just a side note, this project will be recurring each week for the next month). My group members and I planned to have two members host the show each week, while the other two of us edit. However, last week while filming the talk show, the two people that were hosting began arguing and called my other group member (who was not supposed to be hosting) for reinforcement. They then refilmed the project, but instead of having two hosts (as we originally planned) my other group member stayed and hosted with them so as to minimize arguments. I was not notified that any of this was going on, and the next day I received the footage of all three of them hosting the talk show. I asked them multiple times if they wanted me to edit the footage or if they needed me to do anything, but they told me that they had already finished the video. Essentially, they completed the project all by themselves. I am not someone who usually does nothing when it comes to group projects, and I feel super guilty that I did absolutely nothing on this project. I told them that I would edit the next talk show video to make up for my lack of work but I still feel guilty. I’m also a bit worried that my professor will find out. Should I still feel guilty, and should I fess up that I didn’t do any work?",23Sep2020,1

I just realized it was left there and I disposed of it and cleaned the area (it was rolled up so nothing inside was shown).

Now they're moving away, and now I'm feeling I want to move as well. They've said numerous times that they would like if I did, because we're very close, but they don't pressure me to do it or anything. But there's a part of me that feels like I'm dumb for wanting to move because my friends are moving. 

I'm 25, single, and I have mental health issues. I struggle with depression and my friends have really helped me and been loving to me. Now that they're moving I'm feeling even more depressed. Because of this I'm leaning towards wanting to move. When I feel dumb for wanting that, I feel like it's my parents voice manifesting itself in my head, and my mother just confirmed that. I talked to her and hinted at moving, and she said ""you can't move every time your friends move"". Now I feel really sad because she basically confirmed that it's wrong to feel this way.

But at the same time I'm having trouble understanding why she would think that and why I feel that's wrong. I guess it kind of relates to a ""be your own man"" mindset, which I also have instilled in me because of my parents. But I am my own man. I just want to be with my friends that are like to family to me. It's that wrong? Like now I feel like I'm not ""my own man"" because I want to be close to my friends because I value them and they bring value to my life. Should I feel dumb for that? If I don't care where I live, and I can provide for myself, why would I *not* move closer to the people who want me closer? Am I wrong for feeling this way?",23Sep2020,1

799,"I’m a 20 year old woman in college and at the moment I live at home with my parents who are both in their late 40’s and never married. They were so in love throughout my whole childhood and it never occurred to me that one day they’d split up, but last month my mother confided in me that they had been drifting apart and she had decided to leave my father due to some bad choices he had made in the past, and partly due to his spending. I am trying my best not to pick sides because ultimately I just want them both to be happy, but my dad is completely heartbroken. My mom is still living at home, they still sleep in the same bed, and they still laugh and chat the same way they always did. But my dad is getting suspicious of one of my moms male friends (she talks to him late at night and it’s suspicious to me as well seeing as this friend is a married man) and he is upset that she seems to not be able to communicate a reason for breaking up. As much as I try to talk to my dad about it, tell him her friend isn’t something he should worry about, offer him advice to the best of my ability, and tell him that my mom is going through a midlife crisis (she really is, this isn’t the only thing she’s done to make me think that) it’s not making it any easier for him. I really do believe that my mom isn’t done with my dad and that they both still love each other very much, but I worry about my dad and want to help him get through this. They are both in therapy separately, and my mom doesn’t seem to have any intention of going together. I guess my question is this: how do I help my dad through this? What are some things I can tell him that will ease his mind or give him hope? Also: am I crazy in thinking that my mom might change her mind? How can I work to show them that they still love each other?

803,"The last 5-6 months have been nothing shy of a travesty. Most of what I thought I identified with, related to, or had in my life... either passed, changed or vanished. It's hard to even tell who I am anymore. And most of the time... nothing feels real anymore.

But given all that, I've been trying to really change my life for the better. And I just can't seem to get ahead. Just a constant reminder that the sum of all my failures and mistakes have led me here to a realm where I constantly hear the word ""no"" and feel compelled to settle for less than what I hoped to achieve because if I don't, I'll have nothing instead. Every step along the way I thought I was doing the right thing, or did the right thing and lately I feel like I've led myself astray. I went to college and got a degree because everyone told me it'll ""get your foot in the door"" and if anything, the real world has told me that was a flat-out-fucking-lie. My marketing degree is straight up worthless. So much of my foundation has been shook, destroyed or chiseled away at that I don't know what to do anymore.

I'm caught in a rut. On one hand, I have a decent paying restaurant job that is leading nowhere due to covid. I love it some days, other days it drives me absolutely fucking mad. On the other, I have this opportunity to go work at a local dispensary. I really wanted this dispensary job. Like really wanted it. I probably sent them an email a week asking about updates. Then I got it... and all of a sudden, I'm not so sure. When I got it I thought it was a chance to grow into something more but the more I research, yeah it gets my foot in the door but... it doesn't lead to much else after that. And it's close to a 50-60% pay cut. My last shift at the restaurant I work at is tomorrow. And I'm getting some wicked hesitations. I don't think I want the dispensary job anymore. But I do because its something new. But I don't because it's going to make me feel like I'm running in circles for much less. My heart and soul is telling me not to take it but I'm sending myself into sheer panic due to waiting till the last minute to be confronted with this decision.

I'm 100% positive that i don't have any mental illnesses, i just think a lot about everything. I need to get my life back on track and stop thinking about thing all the time.

805,"I (20F) was abused by my mom my whole life and my dad was a complete deadbeat AH who was also abusive. When I was 18, I became homeless because it was better than living at home. I couch surfed, lived on the streets, even did sex work at one point (I know the stigma, I just really needed the money to eat/live). 

Well, I finally was able to sublet an apartment with small rent and began working full-time. I worked for like 50 hours a week making minimum wage, and with that I started a business. 

I basically build my own things like custom rugs, furniture, etc. and ship them out all across the world. I make roughly $300K a year and I’m so proud of myself for it, knowing where I’ve come from. 

The thing is, now I finally bought a new car. I finally got my own place. All the odds were against me, *but I did it*. My problem is that everyone who sees me without question makes a comment like “must be nice mommy and daddy bought you that car, house, bag, etc.” 

Most people don’t even believe that I made it on my own and assume I’m lying. I didn’t go to college or anything because of my circumstances, when all my friends did. I didn’t have a car in high school. I made bad grades because I was convinced I would just KMS even though I was smart. 

So now I’m living my dream life all on my own, and I feel like I can’t even be happy about it because everyone calls me a liar or brings up my mom and dad which is pretty triggering to me. 

I just want to be able to be proud of my accomplishments without everyone saying, “must be nice to be a trust fund baby,” when I was being financially abused my whole life. When I did work jobs, my mom stole *all* the money I had and took loans out in my name. She was eventually arrested, but it was a lot to handle while in school and working. 

I almost wish I could write on my head “I worked hard for this, my parents did *nothing*” because it just hurts so much knowing I’ve worked 50-90 hours every week for the last year and a half to be in my position, and basically everyone credits my parents for it.",23Sep2020,1
806,"This is hard to type out. It's a realization that I had inklings towards but haven't hit the nail on the head until recently. My personality is one that feels deeply rooted in avoidance. I can make friends but my pattern always seems to be that I emotionally detach extremely easily and once I detach it's really hard for me to re-attach. I'm not sure why this is and I am going to bring it up to my therapist when I speak to her but it bothers me. So many friendships I've had died because of this and, while I wonder how they're doing, I don't check in. I really don't keep friendships for very long. I know it always looks like I just use people when they're necessary and then drop them but I swear that isn't the case. Half the time I wonder if it's just because I vent to people and then think I've upset them or they know too much or they're annoyed or bored with me and then I just disappear but idk if that's actually the root of it or not. And it's a problem that's so easy for me to not talk about. Is this what avoidant personality is? 

The few friends I have are friends of my fiance aside from one, and he's the friend I met my fiance through. The rest of my ""friends"" are honestly people I was at one time super close with and now barely check in on and I don't know why it's so easy for me to do this or be this way. 

I know the childhood I had is one conducive to these sort of fractured bonds. But still why did it take me 24 years to even realize just how bad of an issue this is? What steps can I take to correct this? 

I miss my best friend. Every day that we were in college we'd spend our lunches with him teaching me yugioh or D&amp;D. He got me into a few anime. We were genuinely close. He's the person I feel the worst about. It took him a while to realize my current partner and I are together and once it hit him, he kinda just stopped seeing how things were going and I think maybe I took that as enough rejection to just.....not? I don't mean not care, but just stop contacting but I don't know if that was guilt or disinterest.

I found a baby field mouse outside of my apartment a little while ago.

No sign of the mother or any other baby mice (which makes sense cause there are a lot of birds that eat field mice around) so I brought the little guy inside and they’re currently keeping warm in my shirt pocket.

Problem is I can’t keep a pet mouse where I live so I don’t know what to do with them, but I couldn’t just let them die. My mother suggested seeing if a pet store would take them; I’m open to any other suggestions cause I don’t think that would fly. Please help!",23Sep2020,1
814,"I've been in therapy for years now and it has helped a lot but now I feel like I'm completely losing it. I am diagnosed OCD and ADHD but my symptoms have never been worse.

I had some really traumatic family things start a few years ago and they concluded in March when I sent a letter to my father in prison essentially disowning him. My mother has since started using meth and I am live 3 1/2 hours away and can do nothing about it.

The pandemic hit and I have basically lost most contact with people at this point. I realized I was in nobody's real circle. I have a bunch of friends...none of which have ever called me to hangout. I have one close friend but honestly she is a narcissist and really only uses me to help her sort out whatever meltdown she is having today and when I'm not useful to her she is having fun with other people and I am never invited. My roommate has also spiraled into meth and so I'm just trapped in this ghetto apartment with a tweaker and nowhere to go.

I almost moved in July but the pandemic prevented that because I couldnt get internet installed which I need to work from home. Because of all the nonsense over the last few years my credit is rough and I have about $5k in collections so I basically have to beg and plead to a private landlord and you can imagine how easy that is. Because of my family situation I can't call mom and dad to bail me out. I never really could but now I obviously can't. I have absolutely no support system. If I were to lose my job and not be able to find a comparably paying one (VERY unlikely) I would be homeless very quickly. I was raised without being taught any life skills and now in my late 20s I am trying to fix them with absolutely no help from anyone. It just makes the loneliness hurt even worse.

I started getting into meditation with this program I found but I had to stop because it truly was making me lose my grip on whatever reality is. I felt like I was constantly walking around in a dream. Like nothing was real.

My job has been incredibly frustrating lately too. I'm working from home which is nice but literally every task I have to do I feel like I am arguing with my company constantly to do the job they want me to do. The left hand doesn't know what the right hands doing because for some reason everyone decided it was more important what the pancreas was doing.

I'm not suicidal and have no plans in place but I also have this overwhelming sense that I'm going to die soon. I feel like I'm watching the collapse of society through this rectangle in my phone and I feel like I'm collapsing with it. I feel so hopeless and feel so much despair.

I'm not sure why I wrote this...I dont know what good it will do. But there it is. Any advice would be appreciated.",23Sep2020,1

816,"Sorry first post on mobile. 
I’m in a tough situation. My boyfriend’s sister and brother in law are very intolerant, conservative, hypocritical and racist. As whites people in the mid-west, they believe racism is not real. They have 3 children which they “homeschool.” They don’t actually teach them anything though. They only teach them things out of the Bible. My S/O wants their children over often and whenever they’re at our home
they make racist, homophobic, and xenophobic remarks and I tell them not to say those things here and that it’s wrong. But nothing changes. It causes me a bit of anxiety having to deal with them. I have them on my Facebook page which I’m relatively active on and they share the most dis-information I’ve ever seen. Just blatantly false things. To be frank, it pisses me off to see what they post and to be around them. I can’t deal with the constant negativity I see from them and never ever even want to visit them. I love my boyfriend dearly but I can’t stand to be around his family. Would I be an asshole for telling him this and deleting them off my social medias? I will compromise with him but my own family has told me to not bother with his family if they’re going to be willingly hateful and spiteful. Any advice welcome please. Thank you",23Sep2020,1

819," Tl;dr my mom acts like a teenager when we fight 

I’m currently a senior at college, about to graduate once I finish up my final class and get my internship waiver out of the way. I currently live with my mom and dad, until I finish college. My relationship with my mom is good when we get along but when we don’t she acts like a teenager by doing childish things like cold shouldering me, continuing arguments that my dad says to drop, blaming me for all our fights etc. This is the sort of stuff teenagers do not a women in her mid 60’s. 
   Today’s fight was over something so stupid. I was planning on making dinner today so I asked my mom if she brought spinach. She says no because I didn’t put it on a list. I told her I did put it on the list and my dad even says that he saw it. My mom then tells me that I should have told her because she didn’t know where the list was let alone that it was behind another list my dad made. My dad suggested that I let my mom know when I make a list and then give it to her. This should have been the end of it, but instead my mom starts the argument back up again and complains about the situation some more. My dad tells her to stop but she keeps going. My mom then goes on about how she didn’t have breakfast or lunch, she’s not in the mood to eat meat today  (my mom gives me a hard time when I skip breakfast sometimes so this is ironic to me) I’ve offered to my parents that I’ll make the dish without spinach, but my mom being a child says no I don’t want to eat that and insists that what she’s eating at 3:00 is her dinner. Now my mom is going off on me about how I should give the list to her etc and frustrated I tell my mom it’s always my
fault right, you can’t take accountability for yourself. She goes it’s 95% your fault, I’m not your friends you have to be clear and let me know these things I can’t read your brain, I can’t remember the conversation we had last night about what ingredients you want. It’s so frustrated if I start the fight, my mom will always find a way to point the finger at me and not hold herself accountable, she will blame her tantrums on being frustrated, she will blame something on me, she’ll act stubborn. I’m aware that I should have given my mom the list but there’s no reason she needs to act like a teenager and carry on the argument to get the last word in or complain that she won’t eat the food I make.

830,"Hi, this has been an ongoing issue since January 2020. I have been apart of a DND group for over a year, and have attended almost every single meeting. During this time I have gone on and off medications and have had some of my worse health spells in my life. I have gotten approved for a service dog from my medical team and have been waiting for one from an organization for months (i was supposed to get one 6+ months later, but they had one ready for me earlier). I got my new dog that was not fully task trained (ways to mitigate my disability) but was perfectly behaved in public and has been working since basically birth (appropriately of course). He could hold a down-stay for hours with no problem. At first, I was denied from having my dog attend due to my roommate starting rumors about how untrained he was (when he was a puppy and playing, NOT working). They said no due to that, but eventually, he got his first set of tasks that were trained for me, and I needed him to go. There was a huge disagreement with some members of the group because they didn't want him to go. Mainly the DM because it was his apartment, but I offered to groom/wear a shed guard/ use a portable crate/ sit in one spot and clean up after/ etc... I suppose they felt I was justified because they did come to a realization that one member had a life-threatening deadly allergy to dogs. I offered many solutions so as to talk to the individual with the allergies about how he managed it. I wanted to make sure everyone would be safe as you never value one disability over the other. I offered to meet in public to discuss and stand across a store with my dog and see how he reacted. I sent one message. He told the group I was harassing him. They all turned on me to tell me to stop. I was broken because all I did was to ask if we could talk. 

A few weeks (closer to 1.5 months) the guy with allergies came to my apartment unannounced. We didn't clean the dog hair. Oscar as out. I freaked thinking he was going to die and offered to call an ambulance the group of them just laughed it off and looked embarrassed saying they will handle it. I went to my room with my dog. Not months after this incident I have bee having arguments with my one roommate which were stupid and just drama honestly. We had a sit-down discussion with part of the group to talk to the roommate about the arguments because it was not healthy. It was there the news about the fake deadly allergy to dogs was fake. Made up. They knew it was not real. They decided to lie to me for months. 

Things got better because of COVID as we moved to online DND and having my accommodations were no big deal. We were all at home. However, they decided in mid-summer to start playing DND in person again. I asked for accommodations and if I could go... well the ""group leader"" said no. Why? because his landlord didn't like pets. Which is a completely solvable thing! Service Dogs just visiting a property have full rights and just need the approval of the people living there. I didn't need to ask the landlord for accommodations!

I have been talking to handler friends, therapists, abled friends- they all agreed they discriminated against me. They told me to no longer hang out with them but I missed many of the players so much I stayed around. They have been saying this since the first incident, but it is still present months later.

I accepted this. I let them choose to do this without much pushback as I was tired of fighting for my rights. I was told more events would happen. I was told I could attend those, just not DND. I have not been very active in the group chat because I am not invited and do not understand their inside jokes and cannot participate in the polls.

It is now late September and the Dm/group leader removed me from the chat with no explanation or even talking to me beforehand. I go and ask him what is going on. He said ""he felt awkward"" I was in the group chat. That was his reasoning. I bring up how they are discriminating against me and how I felt, and he turned it into harassment. Apparently I have been in the totally wrong because I fought for my rights and tried to get them to just have a conversation to talk about possibilities for all.

My service dog now has many tasks. He is well behaved in all settings. He has had months of individual training. Granted, I consider him a service dog in training as his guide work needs to finish. 

I know I need better friends, but I have hoped that my friends would accept me even though my disabilities were no longer invisible.

I know I was pushing it and being more aggressive than I ever have been in the past during our conversation today because I am tired of being treated this way. I didn't intend to bring up the past discrimination, but GL kinda made it happen. I was upset that he kicked me out of the only group that we have to talk about events. Even if there was a non-DND event how am I supposed to know??

Not everyone in our group is involved, but it frustrates me that not a single person stood up for me during the times. Everyone I have talked to also pointed this out. DND now makes me very sad. And somehow I feel its all my fault so I went to this from today. 

&amp;#x200B;

*Conversation Today:*

**Me: Hey is there a reason you removed me without any warning? I dont think i did anything wrong??**

GL: Hey no you didn’t. Forgot to message you and give you a heads up. For me it just felt awkward having you on chat where you’re never going to be playing DnD. once again you did nothing wrong. It was a choice I made.

**Me: I feel like your choice of “you felt awkward” is not justified for the whole group. I have been waiting for the chance to play again or do anything. You told me there would be outdoor things.... and other events.**

**You didnt even talk to me beforehand. Your decision has hurt me a lot. Especially im the past but i have forgiven you all and have just been politely waiting. Yet, it feels as if I am punished for doing that. I am hurt again. I do not understand why some members of the group do this.** 

**I would have appreciated if you talked to me first. Nevertheless, if anyone even tried to accommodate me in the slightest. Now, you wont even let me in the group chat? Im very confused and hurt.**

GL: There has been we been doing trivia in zoom

You never join

**Me: Okay well there will be in the future... and i can go to dnd technically you just wont let me. You discriminated against me. But i was hoping things would change over time once you settled in.**

GL: \[OP NAME\] I promise I would be honest with you and I’m going to be. Stop it with the bs if your discriminating or y’all are against me. I’ve tried to be reasonable and keep in mind I did the same to Sarah when she wasn’t playing DnD and all that. So it not like this is only happening to you. I’m tired of these discussion where if I do something you must immediate defend your self then start declaring how things are so unfair. I’ll tell you what’s unfair. Not ever getting a simple moment of understand and just moving forward. Like stfu about me being un inclusive. We’ve tried. I’ve especially tried. And now I’m done. Cause every time something happen to you it’s I’m always in being mistreated. Or y’all not fair to me. I’m done with the excuses and I’m done with these conversations. Here’s what’s going to happen. I’m going to step my foot on this. I removed you from the chat because you have been inactive. No sentence or full length essay will convince me otherwise. If you want to do something right you move on and accept my decision. Thing can always change but I’m telling you if you keep this act up I will be less forgiving.

**Me: But you are discriminating against me by not letting me come with my medical equipment? I am not even talking about that past drama with sarah like im over arguing with her. Ive forgiven her.**

**But everyone who i have talked to. My therapist. Other handlers. Friends. They all agree you are discriminating against me. Its defending my rights. It is unfair how you wont even consider or talk about a possible solution.** 

**I have given multiple options just to discuss. Offered to meet not at dnd. Just trying to find a way.** 

**But you only stated that it was the landlord that was the issue. Which has no standing or right. I am still allowed to go by law. Yet, you just wont even consider or talk to me about possible solutions.** 

**YOU ARE BEING UNINCKUSIVE thats the freaking issue ive had since January.** 

**Sorry you cannot accept you are ableist and a bad friend.** 

**Its not a fucking act its my fucking life and you wont accept me. For all my medical conditions. My health has gotten worse and I use guiding tasks daily. My brain fog is so bad i dont remember what i do an hour before or basic things from elementary school. All i wanted was friends. All i wanted was friends who accept me. But as soon as i am no longer invisibility disabled you all threw me out.**

**You are acting like im being unreasonable but its perfectly normal to fight for rights and ask for change.** 

**Youre acting like its totally okay to kick out friends. Totally okay not to even discuss possibilities or find a different accommodation.** 

**I would have never given up on someone who is disabled. If someone needed accommodations i would have made it accessible without putting up such an argument.**

**Im not even trying to argue i just wanted to talk and discuss but blame me and act like im asking for the most unreasonable and unthinkable thing possible.**

GL: \[OP NAME\] you crossed the line

And now I’ll show you unfair

I’m not adding you to DnD for now on

You welcome to other events

DnD is off limit

**Me: Thats not crossing a line. You wont even talk about possibilities. Thats all i wanted.**

GL:

You won’t just read a message and move on

Like jeez

Where Ok I understand

**Me: Because im hurt? Because i want to be your friends so badly? I want to be accepted? I just wanted to discuss what we could possibly do yet that was always ignored and i was yelled at for harassment when i sent one message**

Gl: OP YOU’RE HARASSING ME

**ME: You have to understand somewhat. I just don’t understand why you treated me like this. When all i wanted was to discuss. It was always one way.**

**Because we are having a conversation?**

GL: What do you think 5 long paragraphs do

Ok a coversation is hi how are you

**Me: Help to show you my side and try to understand yours? But its usually disregarded and only one right way?** 

**I am trying to see what happened to the chat**

**And you made decision by yourself with not context or asking me**

**I asked in the past multiple times to meet and chat just about possibilities**

GL: You always say I’m a BULLY and IM DISCRIMINATING

OR BEING UNINCLUSIVE

LIKE WTF

DONT YOU DARE TELL ME THAT BOT HARRASSMENT

NOT

**Me: Because you are. You are discriminating. There is not ifs and buts. What you said is an example of discrimination.**

**You literally are. Many people have read conversations and agreed. I dont want you to necessarily feel horrible bad person but more of a wake up call**

**Like yea i did do that**

**What can be done for the future? How can we work both sides?**

GL: \*sends definition of harassment\*

**Me: Im saying discriminating**

**Not harassment**

GL: No who started the long as paragraphed

Well guess what

You’re the one harassing me

**Me:**

**I started the paragraph to put in examples and reasoning and such? It makes perfect sense to be clear**

Gl: OP

You do that all the time

Then I asked you to stop

And did you stop

No you didn’t 

And I’ve ask this in previous conversations before

**Me: Because you continue to discriminate? I left you alone for months and just tried to be nice**

**You are being stubborn and wont accept you are discriminating** 

**Okay i may be harassing by continuing saying things**

**But you are discriminating**

Gl: OP

This is my last text

Don’t speak to me again

**Me: Im harassing because i want my rights? I want to have accommodations but really just wanted to discuss possibilities?**

**And you never gave me the chance? So i feel the need to keep asking and bringing it up?**

**Im sorry i message you a lot its just im passionate about rights and accommodations for anyone who needs it.**

**And no one will agree that they are discriminating or at the very least not giving it a chance.**

**All i wanted was a chance to talk about accommodations and that was turned into me being a “bully” harassing people (i say bully because they harass) you literally turned this on yourself (fair i have sent many things) but you have never one agreed with me or stated you were in the wrong or IM SORRY for discriminating** 

**You apologized for lying to me about a severe medixal condition and that meant a lot.**

**But it was not the only problem.**",23Sep2020,1

837,"Hi all, thanks for reading my post.

So, I'm about to venture into the great beyond again of looking for work. My current employer is verbally abusive, and I'm done.

Here's the problem: I'm male(maybe not an issue?), 37, generally fit, disabled (to the point if anything I have acts up, I'm in the hospital), and I've had two major surgeries since October, rendering me unable to lift more than 10 lbs and exhausted all the time.

I moved back to Seattle from NYC a few years ago, and since then, I seem to have found one bad employer after another. I'll list some of the insane stuff I've dealt with since coming back ""home"".

Boss 1: attempted to provoke me into a fight during lunch, off-campus, he also told me (verbally and alone) that if I had to have brain surgery (there was a big worry of this), the company would just let me go, as it'd be better for me in the end. I didn't have it, so he had me train a replacement and then ""eliminated my position"". Oh, I also got moved around like Milton from Office Space until I was put in a hallway without heat/AC

Boss 2: set me up for failure when I was supposed to take over supervisory roles because the other person with my same title was upset because she'd been laid off with the company we were contracting with and did everything in her power to make my life miserable and not allow me to be trained during my time I was there

Boss 3: was newly promoted into her position but clearly chose favorites (literally known as ""the cool kids"") and set my schedule so someone who wasn't my boss both sat beside me and didn't have the authority to tell me what to do, yet every time I attempted to perform a task, it was wrong, and he went to my boss' boss about my poor work ethic (though I was pretty much immediately made the lead of our division)

Boss 4: gave me exactly 0 training and expected me to understand a convoluted billing system. I couldn't send out any work before she said so, and she was out at least three days of any, given week. Any time I would ask her to look at what I'd done, she would get mad and wait a day to give the work back, so I'd, at best, have fifteen minutes of real work to do. I was fired from this position for not performing my duties, and they attempted to deny unemployment

Boss 5: sold used cars and did everything unethical you can think of. Also, every paycheck bounced, so I did too.

Boss 6: allowed other employees to implicate me in fraud, and I left before it would happen a second time

Boss 7: sold boat parts and was expected to understand what was/wasn't available without resources and was let go after having my surgery last October because I just wasn't going to get better (they didn't say whether it was healthwise or performance-wise, but I was never reprimanded or anything while doing the job)

CURRENT BOSS: verbally abusive. Don't need to get into it any more than that, really. I got yelled at for him calling me at midnight on a Saturday (I don't work nights/weekends)

&amp;#x200B;

After all of this, I'm trying to figure out this:

How do you find a job where you don't have stuff like the above happen on a daily basis?

How in the world can I write a resume with the fact I've had literally 8 bosses in five years and not look like a total fuckup?

Anyone have general, helpful thoughts on how to get employed by something less shitty than this?",23Sep2020,1
838,"I’m (16F). So, theres 3 of us who I’ll call Jen (17F) and Alex (18M). Jen and I have been close friends for 2 years. Alex and I only got to know eachother a few months back when COVID hit. Alex used to like Jen for months and months and got rejected when he asked her out. Jen kind of lead him in for a while but they remained friends despite all of this and are really close with eachother. I’ve hung out with them almost daily.

But, recently I just been hanging out with just Alex and I’m not quite sure but I might be catching feels. We’ll cuddle and stuff but who knows if thats platonic or not. Im terrible with signals. But, Alex been kind of bad talking Jen because she drags him down quite a bit from what I can see. Early I was calling Alex and he declined a call from Jen because he didn’t wanna be sad. They fight a lot and it honestly seems unhealthy. And, its kinda stupid because they’re not in a relationship at all. But, I attempt to stay out of their shit because its MESSY. I once tried to ask Jen about if everything was okay and her response was “well it really is none of your business” so I stopped trying to ask about it.

But, here I am in the damn middle of it hanging out with Alex like hes my bf. And, Jen hasn’t been talking to me as much as she used to. This situation seems like its gonna blow up soon in our faces and I don’t know what to do. Am I being awful right now or is it Jen?",23Sep2020,1
839,"Ok, this might sound like am crazy but I think someone is watching me and following me around. This all started a few weeks ago when I came back to my mother house (my parents are divorce) and went into my room. At first everything felt off like something was moved around and messed with. I asked my mom and she said she closed the door and haven’t been in my room the time I was gone (to keep my cats out of my room) and that she didn’t open it once so no one touched my stuff. After looking around more I found that someone definitely moved things around I told my mom and she wouldn’t believe me and that I was paranoid. I look at my window and it was unlocked. I told my mom again about my window and she said she must’ve open it before I left or that I forgot to close it. I believe her and went on with my day. Later that week I couldn’t go to sleep and it was around 12:00 - 1:00 when I saw a bright light that flashed from my window. I think someone took a picture of me when I was sleeping. I told my mom and she said I was paranoid still and to forgot about it. All she did was close my blinds for my window and even with that there is still a small crack in the blinds you can see though. That day I went to my dads house and the same thing happened. Things misplaced and gone. Even one of my underwear went missing. But the deal breaker for me was when I found a long black hair on my floor. I don’t have long hair and nether did anyone that lived in that house. That I knew of. I told my dad almost crying and he told me that no one was here and he was gone when I left for my moms for training for his work. No one was home the time I was gone. Who moved my stuff. Is someone watching me? Please help am scared and I can’t go to sleep.",23Sep2020,1

841,"We’ve been best friends for almost two years now, i’ve been on vacation with his family, stayed at his family’s house for days and even times when he wasn’t there. He would give me a ride in the morning to school. We were practically brothers at this point. He didn’t have anyone else and neither did I.

The second he started talking to his girlfriend I was in a sense replaced. You probably think i’m jealous but just hear me out. We went from hanging out every single day to now, i’ve been to his house 5 times in the past 5 months. He takes his girlfriend to the beach-even though there’s another room for me. He practically lives on his girlfriends timetable and does whatever she wants. She’s toxic and controlling for the most part but he’s blinded by love to even notice it. - a side note, she cheated on her boyfriend of a year and 6 months with my best friend, then broke up with him a week later. 

Take it back to the start of the year when they first got together. I would hang out with him about 3 times a week, then two, then one. EVERY time we would hang out his girlfriend would either A. pull up unannounced or B. tell him they are going to hang out. Every single time she would do this, without hesitation he would take me home even though they’re together every single day. The one day a week I would spend the night she would pull up unannounced, talk to him for an hour or two and then go home. Then on top of this she would show up at 9 in the morning and he would take me home immediately.

Anytime i’ve ever tried to tell him this it’s “you just don’t know real love.” It’s like he doesn’t even realize or care how I feel. In reality his girlfriend just controls him and he’s too scared to say no to anything she wants. He has too much pride to admit this but I think he knows it too. 

A part of me wants to help him realize who she is but another part just wants to cut him off completely even though I love his family.",23Sep2020,1

I thought I knew my mind pretty well, but evidentially not. I’m afraid that if I go to therapy I’ll just be spending all that money without actually coming to a solution that’ll make me feel better. I’m also not the type of person to share my emotions and I’m afraid that talking to a therapist will just dredge up everything that I’ve tried to forget about and just send my emotions over the edge.

Hi everyone, I’m a little bit stuck right now and really worrying about the future. Sorry if this post isn’t allowed here. Just after some advice. My partner has depression and anxiety along with some physical health conditions that prevents them from working in places such as retail jobs. Unfortunately, where we live there aren’t many jobs other than retail but my partner isn’t willing to move away and we can’t afford to anyway. I work as a waitress but don’t earn much. I’m currently trying to find work where I will earn more and one where I won’t be on my feet so much (I also have a long term health condition which causes me so much pain but I have no choice but to work as a waitress because there’s nothing else currently). My partner stresses about money a lot because they aren’t earning their own money and they have to borrow money from me/family, this is one of the biggest stresses for my partner. However, they’re not willing to look for a job either. They say they want to work, so I’m always looking for jobs that’ll suit them (especially work from home jobs) but there’s always a reason as to why my partner can’t work that job. My partner has also now said that they only want to work in a specific establishment (a very good one with lots of benefits) however there are very limited jobs in that establishment especially for people who don’t have qualifications like us. It could take years to find a job there. I’ve found jobs they would be perfect for but they say no every time, but we’re not in a position to be able to be picky with jobs right now. The jobs I have found are work from home and will be accommodating to his health conditions, so I’m not showing them something that they wouldn’t be able to do. We’re currently living with a family member but I’m getting increasingly worried that he might kick us out as we are both in our 20s. If we do get kicked out we can go and live with family but I don’t want to be stuck in this living with family forever. I’m also worried that because we can afford our own place, we won’t ever be able to afford to have kids which is something we both really want. I can’t keep afford to support both of us living with the family member, let alone in our own place. I understand that it’s so hard for them to find work with their depression and anxiety but we really can’t afford this. (Please no one suggest breaking up with them, I’ve had this too much on other forums and it’s getting really annoying that people are just jumping straight to breaking up). Sorry for the long post, I’m just not really sure what to do or say because every time I try bring it up they avoid talking about it.",23Sep2020,1

850,"I am only 13 so please excuse me if my grammar is poor I have been cursed with bad grammar/writing skills since my birth.

So, I just want to get this all off of my chest because I feel like nobody I am talking to understands my situation.
I have recently moved house/schools after a six month break of no communication with anyone else my own age and no hobbies. My Parents think I may have depression as I show a lack of interest in alot of things but I haven't yet seen a therapist to confirm as my Parents are still taking time to think things through but I do show many symptoms of depression e.g: Always feeling tired, Eating too much, Sleeping less etc...

So anyway I went to a new school last Monday but it just wasn't for me. The school didn't know what they were doing and everything felt very disorganized and rushed so I wasn't eased in carefully because it was the first day of Every School in the country re-opening so I guess they had other matters to attend to.
I didn't enjoy it so I wrote my parents a lengthy letter saying why I would prefer some alternative such as Home Ed/Online school but they thought it would be best just for me to join another local area as they say they are unable to Home Educate or online school as they are busy working.

So I have been going to this other school for two weeks now and it is causing me awful stress and anxiety. Waking up is the worst part of my day and then being at school is just a nightmare. Everyone is trying to show an interest in me because I am the new boy but because I am quite quiet and reclusive I think they may be under the impression I am being rude or disinterested.
The truth is I don't really want any friends and I like my own space but due to covid restrictions I can't go outside of a small area which is basically a square court where it's hard to avoid people which is bad because I just want my own space but I am unable to as people will spot me and keep inviting me to their groups.
It probably sounds pretty dumb but due to me being socially awkward as a result of lockdown I get really stressed whenever people invite me into their groups because they are usually quite loud and it makes my breathing funny and causes me some rather bad pain in my chest.

So I don't know what to do. I've already talked to my parents about this and like I said earlier they want me to keep going to school as there aren't any alternatives but it's just making me more upset and I've cried myself to sleep these last few days because I can never relax even when I go home because I know I will just have to go back in tommorow it's the worst feeling.

So any advice/feedback would be really appreciated and I apologise for the wall of text....",23Sep2020,1

866,"Hey all. I've been posting here for the last three years or so about all manner of different topics and this has certainly been one of them. If you wanna look at my post history, feel free to do so, but do it with the knowledge that I've been feeling much better for the past month. I know, a month isn't that long and I'm totally prepared for it to spiral back again but for the time being I'm hopeful. My choice in that is to keep the momentum up and not back away from stuff that seems hard or even impossible. 

But the thing is, it's always been hard and impossible. It's a decision I've been facing for over four years and it's one I've been putting off for just as long. Short backstory: born in the city, grew up in the countryside and the mountains. Moved back and forth a lot, my life feels ungrounded. Never kept friends, never dared to make new ones. Having to deal with a serious control freak of a mother and a complacent dad. When I had to choose what to do with my life after high school, I went for the only thing I knew I was good at, computer science, but after mere months I started to hate it and I dropped out after the first year. Took a break year, went to see a counsellor, went traveling on my own, but nothing stuck with me. I decided again to go study something I knew I wouldn't be wanting to work in, ever, and now I'm over two years in and struggling hard as fuck to keep working towards a non-goal, one I know I don't really want. One condition for me to study this was for me to move out (spoiler alert, I never did) and the other was to see a therapist (spoiler, I did). Therapy has been working out, finally after about two years of seeing the wrong one, having to wait for another, and feeling uncertain about the new one as well. But I'm here now, and I can't argue about the role of it in bringing me here.

So what's bothering me now? I've got some energy that I've been missing for a long while. I'm finally realizing I have way more control over my life than I thought I did. But what good is that realization when you can't actually put it to use? I need to leave my home behind for a while for sure. I need to be away from my parents, who make me feel like I have to justify myself to them. I've realized this summer that I really don't. Next, I need to 'get out there'. I've got a list of things or jobs I'd love to try out, I literally wrote it out today. I can't do any of them here, not with my parents around and not in the big city. Away from everyone I know, preferably. 

But I said it was a hard choice and it wouldn't be without some major counterpoints. I'm still studying. In fact, I started a project three weeks ago that I have absolutely zero interest in, but I've got people counting on me now and I don't want to be the kind of person who just leaves. It also just feels really wrong. I've invested about 15k in this and in my previous programme and I need to pay that loan back. I've got thirty years for it and a 0% interest rate, but it's still an obligation that hangs above my head. Quitting now also feels like giving up. It is something I wanted. It's something I invested time and money in. I like the place. I like the people there. It's not something I just want to leave for the fun of it. Especially not when I don't know what I'll find on the other side. I've felt desillusionment before, several times. I'm scared of it. Finally, I won't have a degree...

So am I going to spend over two more years in mental breakdown because I don't want to give in to what I really want? It sounds ridiculous from almost every viewpoint, except my own...",23Sep2020,1

She eventually got over me but started liking me again at the beginning of this year. I told her j had no feelings but during quarentine we spoke alot. She again said a few months in she was over me again which I was fine with because I have no feelings towards her. A week later she told me she wasnt over me. She's told me she ""fell in love"" with me before but when I confronted it she played it off as a joke but it left me uncertain. A few months ago again she told me she was over me. But sometimes she still makes comments and seems to act the opposite like she still has feelings. She tries to get my attention still and just makes odd comments that she wouldnt normally say if she was over me again. But then sometimes she seems fine and actually seems like she has no feelings towards me anymore. It just confuses me because I just want to know how she feels. She has distanced herself a tiny bit since she said she was over me but I still feel like theres something there for her. I dont know how to bring this up with her or the signs to really look for if she still has feelings for me. So I guess I'm asking for girl advice? Lol anything helps, thanks :)",23Sep2020,1

880,"Here's a timeline for context (Hopefully you can understand my worries)

Sept - Jan 2019: I was in 2 classes with this girl for a semester upgrading my gpa. We talked/studied between and after classes casually. I was slightly interested but more focused on the classes at the time. 

During this semester we exchange snaps and insta's to help aid studying, however after Jan we stopped talking almost entirely. 

June 2020: I'm at a party on a farm around 250 people... Covid restrictions barely lifted (Yes i know this was dumb, hindsight is everything) About a 2-1 ratio, guys to girls. This also happens to be the going away party for my buddy who is off to become an Army Ranger... During this night in no particular order: I lit myself on-fire with a flare by accident, got into an accidental fist fight with the soon to be ranger and helped my friend break his leg/collar bone.

To my surprise, the girl i was speaking about was there. We are probably an hour outside of the city, with a crowd i couldn't fathom her being a part of. This girl barely spoke a word during our classes or while studying. The general impression i got from her was that she wasn't into partying. 

She came up to me to talk (if that matters?) We talked for a good while that night laughing at the trilogy of things that had occurred, just catching up on the missed time. We exchanged phone numbers and then... i didn't text her... I know.

Sept 2020: So we are going to the same University now, with similar majors. However we haven't spoken legitimately since that night (Maybe once or twice on insta) I want to ""hit her up""... for a lack of a better term. Due to covid restrictions + the fact we have 2 mutual friends both of which i barely really know in order to start a legit line of communication i  would have to text, snap or DM her out of the blue... Here lies the problem(s) 1) I worry too much time has passed and that I've already kinda fucked up my impression. 2) I have completely over thought this and if i message her trying to spark a chat i'm going to look like a huge fool because i'm not even on her radar. 3) The fact I've written this out and cared this much proves i'm not only a huge creep but also an idiot.

I might be ridiculing myself too much or not enough... i cant tell. I'm pretty sure I've over thought this as well. However, if anyone can offer any advice that'd be great.

Specifically advice on: I should message her? How do i stop overthinking about shit like this? How should I do it?

HELP PLEASE!!!",23Sep2020,1
882,"I'm going to be kind of vague since most of my friends use reddit and I wouldn't want them to know certain things in this post.

Anyways I've always planned on going into a certain area of STEM that deals with robotics and prosthetics. I went to a ""higher ranking"" highschool only because I had the grades and it was paid for. It's the same with college, I got a big chunk paid for as long as my grades are above a certain mark. In highschool the workload was okay. I could deal with it and have a life. In college I can deal with the workload but I end up having no life. Especially as I go deeper into my major. 

My problem is that I think I actually might be better suited for another field. About a year ago I got a basic minimum wage job at a general type of store. Originally it was only part time because I wanted extra money to buy certain parts for projects I was working on. A year later I run its social media page. Not only that but I give the boss advice on what to sell and what not to. I sometimes get to decide the prices of products as well. 

All of this feels natural to me. I don't really know what explanation to give but I just have a certain feeling about how this business runs. I've never taken any business or finance related courses in college either. 

I've made enough money that I plan on starting two businesses. I like my job. I don't plan to leave it as soon as I start my own but I feel like I've learned enough to start them on the side. 

What I've really been hiding from everyone is that I decided to invest in real estate about half a year ago and made a good chunk of money. Nothing to say I'd be a millionaire in a couple of years but enough to make me wonder about going a different direction in life. I'm hiding this from my friends and family because I'm poor. They also still think I'm just working a minimum wage job. Most of them kind of made fun of me for saying I could do it but I don't really care about showing anyone up. I'll still help out and say I borrowed money if anyone needs help. I'm not making enough to be rich rich but I'm comfortable. 

Everything I've said so far seems kind of incoherent but it's because my life kind of changed drastically from a year ago to now and I don't really know what to do from here. I was thinking perhaps I should leave my STEM major and pursue something in finance or business. Although, I don't seem to need it to make money I feel maybe it'd be good to have a structured education to understand things more formally.  The way I see it is if I stay in my major I get a certain type of mental satisfaction that comes from solving problems and working with ""cool"" things. But I get nothing from it. In terms of money. If I decide to go down a path of investing and starting my own business(es) I have enough money to do things I want and care for my aging and poor parents. But I feel I won't get that same mental stimulation. 

I have the money to do things now which is like it doesn't even seem real, but I feel it's the more realistic path to take. Because mental stimulation and intellectual challenges won't put food on the table or pay my bills. I don't hate what I work in or dealing with money I just thought I'd stick to working with computers and electronics. I plan to move my family out of where we currently are and let them know that I actually have enough money to give them a better life. 

I feel like I've made up my mind on changing what I had planned but I can't go full force in the new direction until I let go of goals I had in the original plan. I'm really liking the turn my life is taking and obviously I know failure is abundant in that area but I feel more natural I guess you could say doing this than what I was doing before. 

How do I fully let go of being the person I wanted to be in the past so I can focus on being the person I want to be now ? 

TLDR: Wanted to work on creating robots to help people but found out I'm a lot better at dealing with money wdid?

888," Months ago my friend recommended that I started writing and posting small stories to build confidence and limit stress, making some friends if I could. But the most recent one I was going to write has been overtaken.

This isn't a serious book or anything, just a story I was going to put online for fun, but I haven't even written a chapter yet and it's already got me stressed, which is annoying because I mostly do it to improve my English and for pleasure.

I had posted a few stories before. About two months ago my 'writing partner' messages me asking about creating a story together. I was very excited about it at first and I was expecting us to be bouncing ideas off of each other. But I was wrong.

He gave me the vague outlines of a story he wanted to make, more like character beats then anything. Cliche's really, dead mother, out for revenge, bounty hunter etc. But anything I threw out was quickly dismissed as he really liked being in control.

Anyway, we did crank out some pretty cool ideas at first, I wrote a few hundred or so word samples and sent them to him, I got feedback, but nothing that moves the plot along.

It was like he was expecting me to write everything and fill in all the blanks as he just threw out some either very specific and uncompromising ideas that he stuck to relentlessly, or vague points that I have no idea what to do with.

When I asked him if he had written anything, he made an excuse about why he couldn't, saying something about writing on paper, which I thought was weird, seeing as there were two of us working on it, but went with.

To make a long story so much shorter, ever since, he has insisted we were ""Partners"" but had little to contribute writing wise. I was too timid to say anything so for a week or two I went with it.

It got worse when I got messages from him saying something like 'How are you partner, how is our book coming along' etc and then ask me to write specific scenes for him to look at, without ever offering me any writing of his own.

Every so often I would get another message from him about 'our' story, that he has yet to write anything for. I decided to post this when I asked him what he had written and it was next to nothing.

I have begun to have the suspicion that he wants me to do all the writing for the series and then just tack his name on the end.I have yet to confront him, but I have all but convinced myself to cut ties. 

Sorry if it's long, it's the writer in me, and sorry for being vague, trying to keep us both anonymous and hoping to god he doesn't read this. How would you recommend I bring it up to him?",23Sep2020,1

891,"We live in a duplex. We are moving next year. This is one of the reasons why. I need advice to make it to next  year. 

This is a long story. But I need advice. 


Until March things were somewhat okay with our downstairs neighbors. Sometimes they would get our mail and it would take them a few days to deliver it. 

Another issue we had was I’m the only one who takes the trash to the curb. It’s a shared trash can. They have a laundry machine and we do not. We would use their laundry machine and in trade we let the, use our internet since in our town it’s based on credit score and a hefty deposit . 

Sometime since March one of the roommates upstairs  has let her boyfriend move in. There is just something about him that is off. He is always smoking cigarettes and is drinking. He really makes me uncomfortable. If I walk by their front door and he is sitting outside he goes inside. He tattooes himself on his front stoop.  He used to be here every once in awhile but now he is always here. I am very aware he is living downstairs.

We started doing laundry on a home foot pumped washing machine in March because of COVID but now I don’t think I would feel safe doing laundry there. One of our neighbors is a nursing assistant. 

We have debated turning off the internet but the last time we did it on accident they called us twenty-seven times in a row. It was turned off because we accidentally unplugged it. 

Now when our mail goes to their house we have to prompt them to give us our mail. It was taking days and we would have to ask multiple times. 


So now we put our mail on hold and have it delivered weekly when I know someone can be home outside waiting for it. 

I really want to ride out these next six months with little to no interactions with them. 

We try not to order things online and if we have to have groceries delivered someone waits outside. 

Recently we had an incident where boyfriend bought a broken down car and parked it on the street. We had our groceries delivered and the delivery driver “backed up and hit the broken down car” our neighbors demanded that we tell them when we were going to get food delivered and threatened to sue the delivery company. Nothing came out of it.

Our delivery drivers are now asked to not use the driveway 

We have decided to not travel and we are trying to decide if we should rent a storage unit because of the way the boyfriend acts. He just seems like he is up to no good. 

We always pay our rent early and we’re good tenets except my wife and I both work two jobs so our house could be more organized and we now have a clothesline in our house. We also should vacuum more. I am really trying to not involve our landlord because these are COVID times and she has three sons under the age of five. I also am not trying to involve him because our downstairs neighbors (who moved in after us) have grandparents who are personal friends of the Landlord. 

We currently do not have enough money to pay off our lease (medical bills) and move early but I think we could save up enough to get a storage unit. Should we move our stuff out of our house would it be safer in a storage unit?

W0. We try to not make to much noise and we try to be nice to them. One time we helped them look for their puppy when it went missing. 


The last time we went out of town we had to pay someone to do pull our trash in and out because we didn’t want 
A) Boyfriend to know we were gone.
B) They will say we’re going to take it out and never do it.


Despite the fact that it might be a COVID reality I don’t want to spend six months scared of where I live. 

I am also concerned because we have some family who have been isolating because of COVID and asked if they could come visit us. I said yes but now I’m unsure because there have been suspicions before that if we do anything “wrong” our neighbors tell the Landlord.

The neighbors are 21, 22 and boyfriend.

I try to cut people like this out of my life but this guy always seems to beg me to hang out or play a game. I have tried to cut this guy out 4 times but I always believe someone can learn from their mistakes.

The latest time that I have done this was when he got a friend to come just so that they can both get me to feel bad about my appearance or my achievements throughout my life. He always brings up the most personal issues that I only share with people that I trust, it was wrong entrusting someone like him with secrets that he can and will use to insult me verbally. He has now made 4 accounts on discord, he had tried calling me with almost all his friends phones and added me on Twitter with 3 accounts. He didn’t apologize once as if I’m supposed to just blast past the fact that this guy doesn’t understand how to talk with people without having an insult in the sentence.

I have never been a very sensitive person who gets easily insulted but this guy does things like this: “you’re (fat or stupid) even (name of close friend I know) said so too behind ur back.”

I have known him for the last two years and we really close. He is also a great math teacher. I am really close to him and I look up to him a lot. The other day I was in his room after classes talking about something. Later, I ended up showing him my necklace so he ended up standing behind me because I was showing him the clasp. He ended up kinda tickling me from behind which I thought was kinda weird. I was laughing and he made a joke about something. He kept talking but didn't move his hands they were right on tops of my boobs. He might not have noticed tho. Later he was teasing me about the uniform and grabbed my button up because it was tugged in and he pulled it out. He made fun of me for still having my shirt tugged in after school. He told me I was a good girl and I told him I wasn't and that I broke the rules. I don't always follow them I just forget. He laughed and told me it was fine. He told me I looked better with the shirt untucked. It went almost to the end of my skirt and he told me it made me look so little and like I didn't have anything on. I just laughed and he said but of course thats not how we do it here. I thought he was just teasing me but he kept his hand on me like at the top of my skirt with like his thumb kinda under it. He wasn't acting like it was weird tho or anything he just kept talking. He was teasing me. I told him I didn't like the skirt and he told me he loved it. He told me I did look good in it. I told him he just said a looked like a baby and he said some guys like that. Then he was touching my face because I told him I had a baby face and he just laughed. I thought it was fine but I was a little uncomfortable but he acted like it was all good he just kept talking. 

I told two of my friends and one said he was just being nice and he does that all the time. He does he is just an affectionate guy.

I don't want to look dumb or ruin our relationship but I have had a crush on him forever. Plus I think he likes me better then other people. I want him to like me. He gives me extra points and always takes pictures with me. Do you think I should go for it? I don't want to regret not doing it. I mean whats the worst that will happen he will just saw no. I just don't want to lose our friendship. I was kinda uncomfortable but if he likes me I like him too. Do you think he likes me? What should I say to him

Tldr, I (16 F) have known my coach (30ish M) for 2 years and I think he likes me and I like him too but I am not sure if I want to sleep with him",23Sep2020,1
897,"So ugh okay long story here y’all. So recently I reconnected with a guy who was a huge narcissist to me and was very verbally abusive. So I decided to invite him for a night walk to see how life was going and figure out why he unblocked me and followed me again. So we talk and talk about stuff and personal stuff, but he seemed real off he kept complementing me and said sorry about the fight we had before he blocked me. And so I forgave him because he seemed very genuine about it and we ended up kissing and getting very touchy. The next day he decided to say it was the heat of the moment and we can’t do that ever again! I was beyond pissed and hurt. I had to remind myself this was his choice and I can’t force him into anything but why would someone kiss another without a reason? So fast forward to a couple of days later he decides to ft me and ask me to come over to his house which I’ve never done ever! I’ve known him for four years and he actually invites me to his house. HIS HOUSE! So I was a bit nervous but had confidence because I thought we were gonna vibe and chill. So I get to his house and looked around and just didn’t judge and said I thought the place was bigger but oh well it’s fine. Then we go to his room and sit on his couch... this was a long pause and I decided to look at the place and stare at one of the paintings in his room. Then he asked the big question “let’s talk about what happened during that one night.” And I said out loud “Oh no.” He asked if he was good or not at what he did and I said yes he was good which really made me think “Is he serious right now???” So then he said “I’m still thinking about it and I wanna know if you... wanna do it again?” I looked at him baffled. Then I agreed and we ended up having sex... unprotected sex which was stupid of me and him. Then afterwards it felt like he wanted to me to go now instead of staying and I felt a pit in my stomach about it. It hurt thinking “Did he only invite me over for this!?” And now fast forward to today it feels like he’s ghosting me. No matter what I do or what convo I try to start it always feels like I’m talking to a wall. And what’s even more upsetting is when he tells my girl bsf more about stuff that happening then to me. Then he said he wants to be friends only... Idk guys something feels off, something feels painful in my chest, and my head isn’t resting it’s wondering and thinking. Does he even care about me? Does he like like me? Why did he do that? What does any of this mean?",23Sep2020,1
898,"Hi Reddit, throwaway for obvious reasons. As stated in the title, my (27f) boss (60+m) is bullying me. We work in a small team for a small-ish company with no HR department and my boss is one of the partners so there is virtually no one higher up I could go to (except for the managing partner who is good friends with my boss). I never particularly liked this job due to its boring subject matter but it was fine before covid as I’d go to my super nice office every day and spend time with my colleagues. Now that we are working from home, I’ve been struggling with productivity as it is because my job is very independent and I’ve been feeling very isolated. 

I had never had much interaction with my boss due to the structure of my team. Previously we’d just chat sometimes when I needed final approval for things and always in the presence of other people (my office is open plan). We’ve been working from home for months now and because of that I have to speak to my boss on the phone weekly one on one. I am now finding out what kind of a person he is. The way he speaks to me is unacceptable (with things like ‘I thought you were smarter than to say things like that’ and pushing me to explain to him exactly what and why I did wrong once I admit to him that I should’ve done something differently for what seems like his own personal satisfaction). I am now anxious and almost physically sick every time I’m due to speak to him. 

Recently I did something that was well within my rights (and something he himself does regularly) without his own personal approval and all hell broke loose. It is akin to me saying I will not come to the office because of the pandemic even though no one else is in the office. He called me screaming about my audacity and how annoyed that made him feel. He did not let me say a word to defend myself and then hung up on me with a little satisfied ‘thanks bye’ in the middle of me saying something which was so inappropriate from someone of his standing. The fact that me doing the thing made him so upset is ridiculous as it does not impact his or my workload in any way, it’s just a power play. He has since been picking on me whenever he can and criticising every single piece of work that I do. I honestly believe he hates me which is just dumb as given our different positions within the office he should basically ignore me and everything I do as he’s way too high up to have a reason to care. For some reason though I seem to naturally clash with him. My other coworkers had warned me about him and him ‘picking people to pick on’ before so I know it’s not just me although I do believe it’s just me escalated to this level. 

Now I know that me bitching about this must be annoying to people who have actually lost their jobs due to the virus whereas I am in stable-ish employment. But the thought of working another day makes me want to give up and cry. I can’t afford to leave the job yet (the earliest date I can will be May next year due to other reasons). I can’t think of anywhere I could report him to. I know it probably doesn’t even sound that serious in this post but it’s been constant and subtle and pushed me over the edge today. What do I do? Do I bite my tongue and keep working with him? How do I stop caring about what he says and does? At this stage it almost feels like abuse sessions are in my weekly schedule and I dread them. Do I put myself in massive debt and quit early just to save my mental health? Do I try an talk to him? 

With everything else that has happened in my life this year, this has been the cherry on top. Nothing in my life is satisfactory in any way. Work wise, I feel trapped and terrified and terrorised. Thanks in advance for any advice!",23Sep2020,1
899,"I am renting a room in a house along with another person a similar age as me. We share a living room like space except all my shit is in this room since I guess my room is too small for it. Her stuff is in her room (like her tv)

Anyways, she potentially is sick with coronavirus, and when I woke up I come out to see her chilling on the couch. I don't care if she chills out on the couch, that is her right since it is technically her space too even if my shit is in it.

BUT what I am concerned about is she being very sick and I don't want what she has because I could very well die from it because I am extremely high risk and I have already almost died from an issue with my lungs (one collapsed before) and I'm not sure I could take another hit from a serious lung illness.

I am wondering if I would be the asshole if I ask her to please stay mostly in her room until she is no longer sick, I understand needing food or to use the bathroom ofc but just hanging out in an area where you can spread it to others just makes me kind of upset.
 I really don't see that being an unfair solution since like I said she has her tv and stuff in there, but I understand the room is her space too and I understand being holed up in a room sucks.

I don't know, do you guys think I'm being unreasonable?",23Sep2020,1
900,"This is long, but if anyone reads this, it will seriously make my day.

I’m 14 years old, and I have no idea why I feel this way. If I ever opened up about this phobia all I ever obtained was a similar response from everyone. “There isn’t anything to be afraid of, enjoy life while you have it” or “death is just another part of life.” There was this hidden correlation between death and life, almost as if it were the same thing. Almost as if I wasn’t fearing death, just afraid of life. Since nobody closed to me passed away, I automatically assumed I would be the first to
go. But I think this fear really started with someone named Luke. 

I never entered Luke’s life until we knew he was going to die. He was 7 or 8 by the time I saw him, and I was 11. Luke was a part of a family well known to everyone but me. I mean he was my sister’s friend’s brother (her friend’s name is Lucy btw,) I wasn’t supposed to meet him, but I’ve never been so happy I did.

Their was a 0% survival rate for the type of brain cancer he had. I remember when he was diagnosed my mother got a text while she was driving from Luke’s parents, and she broke down in tears and had to pull over in the middle of the night. My response was stupid and insensitive, “Lucy has a brother?” 

Over the next few months Luke was celebrated. A new Facebook page was created to bring awareness around the fatal disease. We ran races to donate charity for people who researched children’s brain cancer. We threw massive parties. He even won a cruise. And through all of this, I knew nothing about him, until his birthday. 

I remember he told me, “Do you believe that I will be a pirate when I go to heaven?” I’m not Christian, and I wasn’t too sure how to respond. It was kind of shocking to me that he asked me out of all people. “Yeah you will be a pirate,” I said. “The best pirate to ever exist.” He was silent for a few seconds, he had a hard time responding because of the condition he was in, but it was something similar to, “I know I’m going to die, but I also know I will be a pirate, and maybe one day you will be a pirate with me.” And then I said trying not to cry “I’ll be a pirate with you, don’t worry, you might have to wait for me, but I promise.” 

He died the next month. We all mourned. People who didn’t even know he gathered in the street and made signs to hold while we were passing by his funeral. I didn’t cry, today was the first day I cried about this, and that’s two years after it happened. The next year when we went to the same race (it was an annual event) only me and Luke’s family ran. The Facebook page lost followers. The world went silent. 

I’m not afraid of death, I’m afraid of life. How quickly something can happen and you don’t get to change it. What surprised me most was that Luke was never sad. He wasn’t afraid about what was happening, he wasn’t afraid of death.  Luke was the bravest person I know, and I only talked to him once. I don’t believe in Christianity, I’m a very strong Atheist, but if heaven is real, I’m happy to know I will be a pirate with Luke. And that might be the only thing that is comforting me.

This fear has only taken over my life recently. I‘ve become more cautious and anxious over every little thing. I’m afraid to even leave my house sometimes. I have a feeling I’m going to die young, but I don’t want to, and I definitely don’t want keep believing I will. I feel almost selfish wanting to get rid of this phobia, but I want it gone. I wish I knew how to stop this, this mindset, this idea, but I don’t know where to start. So I’m on Reddit, writing my feelings out to people who will probably not read it because it is so long. How can I get over this fear? If anyone can tell me it would mean the world. And if you don’t know, thank you for just listening. That means to world to me as well.",23Sep2020,1
901,"Hi everyone!

I've been a part of this community for some time bit I haven't been active for some time since I stopped using reddit.. But none of that matters. I've come to ask for your help or advice or even just reading this since it does mean a lot.

As we all know 2020 has been a literal shitshow but for me at least I had some good thing happen.

I got a girlfriend for the first time (I'm 20 btw) and we love each other and we're really happy together. I've set some pretty high personal records at the gym and I've also found a job I really love doing. 

And now... Even though I feel really happy when I'm eith my girlfriend or at the gym I don't really feel happy at home. 

I don't feel as if I belong in my house, we rarely communicate and we mostly have lunch together but my dad just watches the tv while my mom forces a conversation about something. When we do communicate it's usually through yelling since my father doesn't know how to speak like a normal human being and my mom gets mad that he's yeling. I'm mostly home during mornings so I don't have to listen to it except for on the weekends. I love my family but sometimes I really wonder what I'm doing in this house. Also I want to add that my dad is a police officer so I don't see him a lot usually but I'm glad he's home now.

I don't feel happy at home and I really can't wait to go to work, hang out with my girlfriend or go to the gym. Those things really lift me up but when I get home I just feel so down without a reason. I'm not sad nor depressed it just feels like a stone on yoir heart.

Has anyone ever felt like this before or has any idea how to work out the situation with my family?

Thank you all in advance and have a wonderful rest of the day!",23Sep2020,1
902,"Hello reddit. 

First of all, this one is going to be a very long post about one issue I have in my mind that makes me think alot and I can't talk about it to anyone. Very specific story.

So, I am 17 years old girl. This all was happening mostly before my 17th birthday - I was 16.

Quarantine did alot of bad stuff to my 2 years old relationship. It made it kinda toxic - we we're mostly locked down with my boyfriend in one house and we got into arguements almost on daily bases, shouted at each other, alot of silence treatments, no apologizing,... just very toxic. I was very mentally unstable during that time and even before, I was crying everyday about stuff that included me not feeling loved and wanted by my boyfriend and being alinr cause I had literally zero friends and I was scared to lose my boyfriend (let's call him Bryan) since he was the only person I had. 

When I left him during quarantine and went home since I couldn't deal with toxic atmosphere anymore, I out of boredom and crave of wanting friends or affection in any other way decided to contact my old, not good toxic friends. It was all fun at beginning. I started to slowly go into numb phase of feeling almost nothing at all, including my boyfriend.

One day, they decided to take me to one alternative everyweek public meet-up of people. I, my dumb impulsive self from all negative feelings, got frunk and met this guy. Not a guy. More specifically a 24 years old man. (let's call him John) I spent night with him outside, we talked alot, he complimented me in a way of how he can't believe how mature I am for my age, that he never thought he could understand and have so much common with a 16 y o. He never hit on me sexually at first. After hours I told him I should go home (still drunk) but he invited me to come over and stay safe at night. I agreed and went to his place. He had only one small bed so we slept there. John tried to kiss me but I pushed him away, saying sorry. He apologized. Nothing happened, I left that morning forgetting that evening we exchanged numbers. I kinda felt cared about after that night, after he complimented me in this kind of ""mature"" way. 

I felt confused and more numb towards Bryan that time, I decided to end the relationship in good terms, thinking this was the best thing we could do for each other. He agreed and we decided to stay friends. 

John texted me and tried to get me out with him on bikes and stuff like that and first I was very refusive. He was really pushy but luckily I was able to get my no. Even tho it took me some time, including me saying that it would be weird because of our ages and age gap but he didn't care at all about that. I even said ""what my mum would say about it if she knew"". We again met up next weekend on that meet-up. Got drunk with my toxic friends, then impulsively spent night again together with John, I slept at his place, he didn't try anything on me this time, other than again complimenting me in these kind of ways I said. 

I really thought I was having finally a nice friend, plus I thought it was super mature to have a older friend like him. I didn't think anything of him more than friends. Looking back, I was very blind and naive, lonely girl.

We met up few times, normally as friends. The second public meet-up we went on together, I got drunk again and the same scenario happened, expect few more things happened. He started to kiss me and I didn't hesitate but I was uncomfortable pushing myself on purpose, thinking I can maybe find affection in him. He put his hand down there. He asked me if I that was ok, I said yes. But felt wrong. I was just waiting till it ends. No penetration sex happened. 

That morning he apologized and said hr was drunk and didn't mean to do that. I said I was drunk too. But that morning he processed to touch me without consent. He pulled out his junk and said if I wanted sex. I didn't want to, I said that I am NOT sure and that he should wait. But he said ok and ignored it, trying to get in but because I was stressed, he couldn't get in and nothing happened. I left.

During these John meet-ups, I kept contact with Bryan and we we're friends with benefits. I told him many times that he should definitely not take this as we are dating and that we are only hooking up. (He is also 17 btw) He understood. Bryan was even aware of me seeing John and he was counting on that maybe something might happen even tho he would rather not want me to have anything with him because he was lusting for me and still secretly clinged on me. I explained that it is up to him if he wants to still hook up but he cannot tell me to not do stuff with other people because he is my ex and if he is uncomfo, then he should leave. He did not. 

When I explained to Bryan what happened with John, even about that morning, he got angry and emotional and left. (He wished me to tell him if something like that happens). 

After these things I didn't really want to see John anymore. I was trying to avoid him because he took this thing as start of friends with benefits even tho I explained that I felt I did mistake by allowing him to do that because of his age and that it should not ever happened at all. He started to be manipulative in many other ways, pushy, saying it was totally okay that I was 16 and he 24, that I should give it a try and when I said no he kept saying that I am not aware that I actually want him and I just refuse to admit it. I told him many times that I did not want him.

After spamming messages, I blocked him.

We got back together with my ex, making our relationship healthy and better. (which actually is, he changed to better and is very affectionate, etc) but he still sometimes brings up John, that it felt like cheating. But I remind him that ee weren't couple that time. He did not forgive me and I told him that is ok, he should take his time.

Anyways. Yeah, this is my story. I feel used and guilty after I read grooming stories like that on internet. So was I groomed? Or I wasn't and sadly it was my mistake of giving consent? Did I cheat on my boyfriend?

I think if John new better a adult, he would not allow this to happen when I am 16. He was lying to his friends that I am 18 so they don't take it weird.

I am sorry for long text. I probably will delete it after while. Thank you for reading.",23Sep2020,1
903,"Hello guys. Im in need of serious advice on whether or not i should stay at the college im going to (freshman, first year rn) or should i drop out and go to nail tech school ?? Just to let you guys know ive been doing nails since i have been 15 y/o (now 18) and ive gotten a lot of offers from nail salons to work for them but i dont have a license.

904,"I am 15 and had sex for the first time. I am so scared that I'm pregnant, I think about it all the time. 

I had sex this sunday (so three days ago). I've been taking the pill since the second day of september, which was the day I started bleeding. 
So in total I've been using it for 21 days. I haven't missed a single day. 
We didn't use a condom, but we used the pull-out method as I'm on BC. I now realise that a condom would have solved all the worries I have now. 
Now I am really worried because I THINK my doctor said to wait a month to be safe, but I'm not sure and I can't ask my mom. I was so stupid and now I'm so so so scared.  I think I'd much rather use a condom but the last time I talked about it my boyfriend really didn't quite like the idea and I know this sounds ridiculous but I don't want to dissapoint him BUT I definitely know that i DO NOT want any babies anytime soon.

Does the pill only work after a month? Everything I read online says a week, and the description that came with my pill (Louise) says one month if you haven't started the right day, one week if you did. There wasn't much blood the first day I took the pill so was it really the right day?

907,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. 

I’m really not one to come to strangers for relationship advice or anyone else really for that matter but at this point, I’m a bit lost. It’s been about 5 years we’ve been together, 2 living together, 1 of which a lot has come into the light. It started out very abusive, lots of physical and emotional fighting, overall poor communication and trust. I don’t know why I didn’t see it wasn’t right then, I was so young and him half a decade older than me, but the flags just didn’t show. When it was good it was incredible, it still is, so much passion and love, beautiful words exchanged from someone who I thought I’d spend my entire life with. But he kills me with his actions and insensitivity, his inability to give me a moment of his attention or time all while showering it to everyone else, his lack of sight to the pain I’ve been trying to heal from now that he’s making progression and trying to change. I’ve tried to get over it, the hurtful words and name calling, constantly comparing me to everyone else and questioning who I am, the hand that met my face one to many times, the fist that held my throat and told me I would never be able to get away. Every time I’ve tried to leave, he’s used his size against me, claimed he’ll end his life, throw me down until I simply cannot get up anymore. He tells me the things I hold onto are old news and to get over them, to just forget it all and move forward, but I still have flashbacks of everything, I still flinch when he moves towards me the wrong way, and I still spend my nights in tears because he doesn’t see the trauma this all has caused me. It’s been a year since things were so violently serious, but everyday he’s the same, telling me how much he just wants to hit me, to shut me up and it’s just shutting me down. Sometimes I wonder if he’s right, maybe it wasn’t that bad and I should get over it, people have had it worse. I just don’t know why I can’t heal, why his touch no longer sends tingles down my spine, why his beautiful words no longer warm my soul. It hurts so much because I still love him, I just don’t know if it’s enough anymore.",23Sep2020,1
908," I would love to hear from other women digital entrepreneurs who've been through this.

After working online as a freelancer, I've decided to teach other women how to do the same. I'm using Facebook as my main platform to market. BUT I'm absolutely terrified of putting my full name and face out there. I've always been a private person. But having my first and last name out there along with my face and having people know who I am and wanting to be in my personal life scares me. For example, I had my Facebook page completely on private, and after posting about my business in a group, someone commented on my post and said my page was fake and I was a scam...just because my page, photos, old statuses, etc. was private. I immediately got anxiety from someone publicly calling me a scam/fake page and deleted my post immediately. The thought of someone trying to smear my name instantly got me worried. I started to think...what if they take a screenshot of my page, with my full name and face, repost it, and tell others I'm a fake page?

I know I think irrationally sometimes, but these are the things that go through my head. I literally cripple myself with fear. Fear that I have my real name out there for the world to see. Fear that my face is out there. Fear that I'll get stalkers. Fear. Then I also see that some other coaches make posts about their business on their personal page, which I have no interest in doing. I don't care for old high school friends and family to be in my business knowing that I'm starting a coaching business. I also started getting friends request by random people from these groups I'm in. And I'm just like no.. why would I add strangers to my person page so they can pry into my life? I literally hate that I'm so anxious and worried all the time. What should I do though? I haven't been posting out of fear. Haven't been doing anything pretty much out of fear. I could've made this post in a Facebook support group for women entrepreneurs, but I'm afraid of having my name attached to a post like this. :( Help.",23Sep2020,1
909,"I’ll try to shorten this as much as possible. 

Both my ex and her roommate have a cat. A couple of months in, her cat began to become affectionate towards me so I would pet it- at first with no issue. Soon I began to notice hay fever allergy symptoms. 

This initially didn’t alarm me, as allergy season was just starting to peak and I always tend to have mild allergies (itchy eyes and sneezing mainly) however, I also began to notice that my skin would now get extremely itchy after touching the cat. Over some time we came to the conclusion that I was allergic to the cat/it’s dander, and considering that the more I touched the cat or anywhere it came into contact with- the more miserable I became, I began avoiding the cat entirely (Though this backfired as it only seemed to attract the cat to me more, and make it follow me around).

Eventually it got to the point where even avoiding the cat entirely didn’t help much, as she allowed the cat to move freely throughout the house so I constantly came into contact with what we thought was dander. My allergy symptoms seemed to get worse each visit, and one day I even broke out into hives. I hadn’t had any cat allergies prior, but read that sometimes allergies can suddenly pop up as we age. We tried almost everything to make me comfortable in her home, allergy medicine, air filter, constant cleaning, etc. 

At one point I began to have suspicions about the cat having fleas. My ex admitted that she had dealt with them before, and early on I would occasionally spot brown/black dots on the floor where the cat had just been as well as occasionally feeling like I’m being bitten on various body parts. (A couple of times after showering at her place due to skin irritation, I even noticed unusual brownish things on my wash cloth...) Eventually I asked my ex when the last time she had checked her cat for fleas was, and she agreed to check it’s fur then later claimed the cat was clear. Over time my skin issues in particular proceeded to get worse each time I would visit her house, and eventually even when I would sit in her car, or sometimes even if she would touch my skin, or if her hair would touch me. I assumed this also had to do with cat dander, and continued relentlessly searching online for the possible cause of my skin issues. 

Fast forward to our last month together and my ex mentions her cat has been very itchy and pulling out its fur “again”. Immediately I suspected fleas, though she insisted it simply had normal allergies. We ended up breaking up not too long ago, and kept our distance for a while and for the most part, my skin started to feel better. Then recently her and I became friends again, (w/benefits) and she informed me that we probably shouldn’t hang out at her place since they were working on getting rid of fleas. 

Each time we met up, I went over with her whether or not she had showered and changed into clothing that had not been around her cat. I would still occasionally get the same itchiness when in close contact with her but at first it didn’t seem as bad. My most recent contact with her was yesterday (we had gotten a room the night prior), and after leaving her I try to be careful to remove any clothing that I had on and place it in my hamper to be washed. Yesterday evening once I was home, after brushing myself off a bit, I noticed a bug fall off of me and upon inspection, made the connection that it was a flea. I began cleaning my room and discovered a couple more dead fleas on my bed sheet. I immediately changed my clothes, sheets and vacuumed. I then showered/washed my hair and saw a few more dead fleas.

Now I am extremely paranoid and cautious and just want to get rid of them ASAP. I could rant forever about all of the feelings/thoughts running through my head currently, but for now I just need advice on how to get rid of them in my house/on me ASAP.

910,"My (two) best friends don’t have the best mental health, they know I’m always always there for them but sometimes I’m not really the best person to talk to in terms of mental health... they know that.

Sometimes I don’t understand it though, how a massive improvement in her home life and her love life didn’t change her general happiness in the slightest. Or how she’d choose not to talk much for weeks at a time and close herself off to possible fun or opportunities. Or how nothing I could possibly do or say would ever help.

Mental health is so difficult and I love her and want her to be happy and healthy all the time but none of my methods work and I think a few of the things I say piss her off (sometimes I say straight white boy jokes).

I’m used to happy people who are in the moment and joke about a lot, these friends can sometimes be in really grouchy moods, and I want to understand it more so I don’t seem annoying and bored but I can comfort them",23Sep2020,1
911,"Hi. I have anxiety since I remember of my existence. When I was 5 I didn't want to go to school If I was late to class, I would cry If I didn't finish homework before 10pm and I was bullied until highschool. School burned me out so much that I had to take a gap year before college. My parents are not supportive, instead they are overly protective, judgy and kinda narcisistic (I learnt to create some boundaries with them few years ago, but they still get in my head sometimes) I tried to seek help when I was younger but the therapists that I went told everything I said to my parents so I can't trust them anymore. I thought I could be strong and I was improving my mental health, but now I have more intense and frequent anxiety attacks that are affecting my routine.
The only thing that is helping me a little is depression naps, baths and sleep pills.
How can I overcome this?

I (23,F) was diagnosed in 2016 with bipolar disorder and was diagnosed in 2013 with paranoid personality disorder, I believe the symptoms of these disorders have ruined my life beyond repair and I do not have interest in living anymore. 

I am writing this because I have been seriously thinking about committing suicide for the past 10 months. I decided I would take a few years to really think about it and search for other solutions. If I'm going to die anyway what's the rush, right? May as well explore my other options first. I would like to live a good life I'm just not sure if its in the cards for me. I need advice on things to try. Meds and therapy isn't working nor is having a routine and a healthy lifestyle. I am still empty and confused and tired and unwilling to live. 

I grew up quite ""privileged"" financially. My dad has bipolar disorder and I have multiple dead blood relatives that had schizophrenia or killed themselves. I was abused as a child both emotionally and physically. I was sexually abused and emotionally abandoned and that's just my reality. Nobody ever had sympathy thought because they just think I'm a spoiled rich girl who should count my blessings instead of my curses. I have always felt so alone. 

I just want to be normal. I see you people. I see you laughing. Hugging. Smiling. Trusting. Eating together. Walking alone. Breathing the air. Wearing masks and seat belts. Caring. I see you all caring. I want to be one of you. Yet I know none of you would like me. I don't know how I know this but I do. 

I love my boyfriend so much, he is 25, but I don't trust him. I don't trust anyone. How could I? I was sexually abused as a kid. I learned from a young age that this world will not protect me or care about me it will only hurt me. I am afraid to be alive because I know the pain is not over. Its probably only starting. 

Please help me, anybody. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't want to commit suicide yet, I will give it another few years, at least two. I want to be sure its my final and only option. But if I don't find something that can help me it will be the option I choose.",23Sep2020,1

I would like to have complete financial independence. I currently am getting income from multiple sources -- doordash driving, 2 Etsy shops, and 1 Medium account (a blog type website). I am working morning and night pretty much with all of those but the thought of growing credit card debt and student loan debt and a bunch of other expenses (like car repairs and business purchases) is causing an absurd amount of mental strain. I don't really make that much but I also have a fairly low cost of living (&lt;$2000 to stay afloat). I can afford to pay my living expenses with all of those sources combined but I barely make enough to make extra to pay down any debt outside of minimum payments. I can't afford to move to get a ""real job,"" ""real jobs"" don't exist in my town (I'm not in a city by the way), I wanted to move to another place for cheaper rent but rental availability has turned to almost nothing (everything is either overpriced or it smells like a scam).

937,"I am 20s M 
My life has been okay for the most part, but I feel like I’ve been abused by my adoptive parents for a long time.
I belong to a cult, forced by my parents to attend. 
This cult I attend is really strict and morally wrong.
So.... aside from that, I have been always a little on the slower side. 
I needed to attend cult school for 8 years until I was kicked out. For something I did that would be innocent in a normal persons eyes. 
Then after I left church school, I did a homeschool high school program.... I finished that and then attended a community college to see if I could pass the state GED program. 
I did that, I found it not that difficult, except for the math portion.... but I passed in the end. 

So after about a year later, I attended a technical college center to become a caregiver/nurse aide, I passed every exam so easily. 
I was getting proud and thinking I was smart... big mistake. 
I made some friends while there, they helped “normalize” me (How to start a conversation, what I should do after I graduate, and how to stand up for myself etc.)
But I was a pervert with one of the girls I was close to, I kept harassing her. 
I slightly threatened her over a text message, so her father was super mad and wanted to hurt me. 
Needless to say we worked things out and everything went back to normal.
Then I got involved with another girl in class and same thing happened, except her bf was after me. 
I was able to get the police to back me up, because he said he had a gun and was gonna kill me.
So no charges against me or him, I showed him mercy.... but to never mess with me and I would leave his girl alone. 
So then I graduated, then a few months after. 
I start my first job at a nursing home, pay was bad, horrible benefits.
I thought they were good.... I guess my brain thought that it was a good job... LOL.
I ended up being bullied at work and then I burnt out within 12 months.... I hated my job. 
So I quit and got a job with a agency, I was able to work less hrs but I would still suffer from panic attacks (I didn’t know at the time) 
I had an amazing boss, she was very caring toward me and helped me for 2 years that I was employed with them. I just hated the nursing field, I hated being a slave for my patients day in day out. I would cry a lot because of it, in front of my co-workers and other staff... it was so embarrassing. 

So then I applied for a nursing program, it was a fast paced LPN program.
I thought I could do it, boy I was so wrong!
So I quit work to focus my mind only on my studies...... i failed my first class, so I waited to get back in.... then took it again.
Passed like nothing and made it halfway through the program.... about 6 months passed. 
Then I failed a very hard class... so since It was my second attempt... I was gonna be kicked from the program. 
But I was able to do an appeal and convinced the entire nursing office at college to give me another chance. By this time I was really close to all of them, I told them some things I was going through and my past. They told me to seek mental help and to see a therapist and to call an domestic abuse hotline. 
So I did that during my time off. 
I found out I have 7 mental health disorders and I needed to be on meds. 
I was in constant communication with my professors updating them. 

They had sympathy and gave me another chance. 
So some months passed while I waited to go back, so I the day came and I was actually passing! 
Then I had a lot of full blown mental health breakdowns in front of my professors.
They could see that there was something seriously wrong.
I almost committed suicide but one of my professors, she tremendously helped me out.
By the way during my time at college, I needed a lot of tutoring and needed to take my exams in a quiet room and needed extra time. 
Because I had a disability. 

I was done and gave up, (I quit college) one week before my finals. I never looked back and I got a job at Amazon about 2 months later and I love what I do now! 
I’m so so so glad I left the nursing field forever. 

So I have close cousin, we have been close for a very long time... then around 2017 she started talking to me a lot and it started innocently. This kept up until yesterday. 
Then I was bad, I started asking for nudes and sending also. 
I confessed my feelings for her and both had feelings for each other. 
I told her all my fantasies and my quirks and just opened my heart to her. Everything we talked about was mostly NSFW.

So I guess she told her mom and now I’m in trouble with her family, her mom is super pissed at me and her dad wants to kick my ass. 
The mother then proceeded to tell my older sister and she then told my adoptive mother.
Now my mom knows, she gave me two choices.... either I give her my iPhone (I paid with my own money) or to leave home. 

I know I’m an adult, it’s just I am scared.... i don’t have a car.
My credit score is at 700 for now. 

And just 1hr ago my mom told me she got all the messages from my sister.... I am so mad and embarrassed at the same time.

I don’t care if we don’t have cooked food all the time, I just want him to cook 2-3 times a week. What should I do to get him to cook more?",23Sep2020,1
945,"We’ve only been broken up for two weeks and a few days. The break up was a decision I made out of anger but he told me he agreed that we should. I was saddened that he wanted to go through with it because ultimately I really just wanted a break. I didn’t beg for him, I simply let let be and reached out a few days after the initial break up with an apology. In short he said he accepted the apology and that he always did his best to love me and care for me.

After 12 days of no communication, I reached out to him. All I said was “ I miss you so much my heart hurts. “ his response - “ aw yea I miss you too :/ hope you’ve been doing good “

Idk how to respond. I clearly reached out because I’m hurt by our break up, so no, I have not been doing good. At all. I don’t want to respond something stupid like “ thanks! you too” 

How do I respond in a way that can make the conversation go somewhere?",23Sep2020,1
946,"I feel like I'm the last person to complain here. I migrated to Canada 7 years ago, almost like a second chance towards life. I will explain why below, but I guess I is obvious why. But what I am struggling with right now is university. This will be a long post, because I have tried asking people to give me advise on single things, and the answer always seems simple enough, but my problem stems from other things affecting my life I think. 

So I am in 3nd year of undergrad studying chemistry. I have have had a horrible 2nd year where I failed 2 courses in 2 terms, and got an average of 55 that year. I was put on academic probation for the next term, where I could only choose 3 courses. Other than that, I have failed a drivers written test because everyone said it was so easy they only took a night to prepare for it, some said they didn't prepare at all, so I didn't either and I failed it. I also didn't get full marks on my first aid exam that I want to volunteer for, making the proctor think that I'm in some fake university. I guess, all this would failure would have been less damaging if my husband wasn't always there to watch it. He has seen me fail at calculus, at ochem, which was not the case before we were married. I always got good grades. I never went to high school but I managed to self study grade 11, 12. Got somewhere around high 80s, which I guess is neither good nor bad. I struggled my whole life with a continuous education because my parents move from Pakistan to china, back and forth a couple of times, until I lived the next 10 teen age years of my life growing up in china and learning everything in chinese. I believe I did great. I learned most common phrases in my 9 months there at the age of 10. But it was always hard for me to study and pass exams in china due to language barrier. This is why when I came to canada at the age of 18, I self studied at an adult education system, starting all the way from grade 9. My english was very poor in the beginning, again due to language I suffered at self study school for years. I had no friends, because my parents had decided to live in a town of 4000 people, and I wasn't allowed to go to public school due to my age. When I saw I got 94 in my chemistry 12, I thought I should study that at university, although there are no labs at self study, I had never touched a beaker. But that shouldn't matter. University requirement is to finish certain grade 11 and 12 courses to apply, I didn't finish grade 12 calculus and grade 12 english, cause for me those courses were too hard to self study. I applied to some random arts courses at a college for which I didn't need to have graduated from high school, got a student loan and went to another city. I didn't have any saving from working seasonally at the town, and my family refused to move out of there, and I didn't have the guts to move out without any money myself. I chose courses like anthropology, and philosophy, and I failed everything. My student loan was cancelled, and I had no money to stay in the city. Luckily I found out about an adult school, so I worked part time, asked some money from my mom to pay for rent and food, and there was no school fee. I got my high school diploma from there. But now I had no money to go to university because my student loan was cancelled. I met a few people in the city, but not good enough that they would care about helping me if I had no place to stay. 

In the mean time, I had a boyfriend in the city. When I came to canada, I had a boyfriend in China. We were in a long distance relationship for 3 years. I really cared about him, so I didn't want to leave him. We didn't see each other for 3 years, because we both were poor. The 4 months of summer work only lasted me a few more months, I had to help me mom with food and living too. I also liked to spend money, because our life in china was good. My dad had a small company, we would just work in that. But after my parents separated and my mom came to canada I came with her, we didn't know anything. For my 50 year old mom she had 2 kids to take care of. My dad took all the money that we had ever worked for, leaving us broke, and thats how we came to canada, with no money. So I didn't have money to visit him. 3 years proved to be too long. I saw him walking home with a girl everyday. I told him not to, and he stopped. Then I started going to the library to self study, and that is where I met my brothers friend. To this day I feel humiliated with what I did. I started having feeling for him even though I was in a relationship with my boy friend in china. I guess I didn't know how to break up, because I had been with him for 6 years (3 years LD), I made him stay with me even though he sometimes didnt want to. I told my brother friend that I like him, even though I didn't like him that much, I just needed support as I tried to get out of a 6 years relationship that I practically grew up in. And I found this stupid idea to do it. We would go on walks together and slowly I came to know he is a really nice guy. This mistake pushed me into buying a ticket to china, so I could make a choice. When I saw him after 3 years, I didn't care that much. I didn't care about anything that much, because I felt like I didn't like myself anymore for what I did. We stayed at his parents house for 2 months. Once I came back I told him we have to break up. He said okay. He had promised me that he will try to learn english and come to canada, but he not only was over spending but also failed all the elts classes he took. Even though I really loved him, I knew that he will never make it to canada and I will never be able to survive in china without a degree. I came back, for months I was depressed. And them a few months later I started dating the guy I met at the library (call him X). I always looked at my shoulder, because it was a small town, people knew each other, and our family knew that family of X. I felt like they knew that I had cheated on my long distance relationship. Every judgement they made made me think they had a hidden motive. I felt like I had lost my honor, and I needed to be punished. After dating for a few months, X decided to go off to unversity, and for the first time I felt like I had to courage to go to cause I will know someone there. Also, my mom wouldn't let me go myself. X had helped me apply to the college, that I took anthropology and philosophy at, which I failed, like I have mentioned before. I didn't know that failing a course would result in cancelation of student loan. I didn't know how the school system works in Canada, since no one in our family had gone to college, there was no adviser at the adult education that had info on that. My mindset was still stuck in China, where google doesn't work, and  when I came to canada I refused to use fb or other social media because it wasn't a chinese, which also means I had chinese pride, even though I wasn't one. So I didn't know how to study for university. After I failed my first term I told X. Before that if he had a question on how to do chemistry in high school he would ask me, but after this I could see that he was disappointed in me. I lost all confidence. His friends started to become verbally abusive me, I took it cause I thought after all that I have done, I deserved punishment. I would cry almost every day of the week. X got sick of me, but he never said it. I became so dependent on him. I always complained. He started to loose respect for me, he would make fun in front of his friends about how I don't have friends. I lost all confidence. But the more he lost faith in the the more I clinged on to him. Cause I thought if I waited long enough, and when I become emotionally stable I will show him that I am better than this. He paid for my food, which saved me a lot of money. I really didn't have any friends, because I didn't have the confidence after I failed a whole term, and everyone was laughing at me for going to adult school after that. I thought I would take this mocking as a part of pursuing my education, that it will be my motivation, but in actuality the cheating and the failing had proven my self-esteem, and the negativity that came with it was slowly breaking me down. After a year at the city, X finished his 1st year. He was told to transfer to another city because his grade was not in the top 10. It was actually a way for schools to push students towards another campus. It was happening all over again. I didn't want another distance relationship. I decided to move with him to the new city. We did care about each other enough to want to be together. It was sad being apart. But this is where the biggest decision of my life came in. So my mom knew that I was dating him, before him she knew I was dating the guy in china, and when I went to see him she refused to talk to me. She cried a lot to make break up with him. My family is not very religious, but when it comes to bfs or gf, its not allowed. The simplest way to understand how big of a deal this is is to think about being homosexual in the early 20th century, its a crime! So she told me I had to be at least engaged to him if I wanted to live together with him, then my elder sister made it worse why telling her that if I lived with him no guy in Pakistan was ever going to be marrying me, not only that people will not want to talk to the whole family. I was young and scared. Last time I didn't listen to my mom, this time I should. So I just told X what my mom told me. He said he had to ask his parents. His family thought it was weird, and they didn't like the idea but they agreed. So we got married. His family let me think that I was marrying him for money. They asked inappropriate questions before the wedding. I thought at the time that that was only because they think we are foreigners, if they know that I grew up in China they wont see me as that different. I was wring though. They hated me because they thought I had trapped him in a relationship with myself, my family doesn't want me because they are willing to get me married at 23. I never really knew how to deal with these issues. On the day of our wedding my family invited his family (not his parents, they are in china) to have a meal together, they refused to do so. All these things built up together made me realize that his family doesn't think well of our family, and we were both too naïve to know that in the real world people do look at your status, not your personality. I wish I would have thought more about it. So within putting out decision, the very next month we got married. No wedding, just a small meal with my family. I was really sad. I thought I at least deserved to be liked. Ever since then my state of mind has been worse. I lost all my interests, I didn't care for university. When we went to visit his parents his parents ignored me, I had to live with that for 2 months. They made me feel like an outsider in a bad way. They blamed me for not allowing him to drink. I felt like everything was my fault. These things were made clear before the marriage, but it doesn't matter what people say before marriage. The first 2 years of our marriage were bad. I would get stuck in the loop of thinking all the bad things that people have said to me, and cry that how did I let myself come to this. Every time I tried to study I would think of those things. 

Then I went for counselling. The psychiatrist didn't know how to help me because I looked fine. Those few years of my marriage was when I barley got things done. I dragged myself and got 70s in first year, transferred from college to university, got a grant to go to japan. His parents started to talk to me. He was also proud of me. But it didn't last for long. I thought that the only way people would care about me was if I accomplished something. My family was ashamed that I couldn't get along with my in-laws, but after I told them everything was good, they were also happy with me. After sometime I thought to better understand his parents I needed to improve my chinese, because they told me that my chinese was not good. It hurt me, cause like I mentioned I had worked really hard to learn chinese. So much that I am pround to say that I can communicate fine for simple conversation. I thought i should improve my literary chinese, so I picked up Lu Xvn. When I posted that I am going to improve my chinese, his mom came at me by posting the mistakes I made in the group chat. There was only one word, which was a mistake in a hurry. But not having spoken to me in moths after the japan trip all she says is ""here, I corrected it"". I felt mad. X tried to reply to her, but when asked he thought she was just helping me. So I lost all senses. That was a the worse year at university, it will always be on my record. And my dreams of doing coop, masters, and mostly medical school have crushed. This made X more disappointed in me. Now I am in my 3 year doing 2nd year courses. This summer I failed a drivers test and a Frist aid quiz. I am trying to get all As, I feel like I am smart enough to do it. I am letting go of all the things other people have said done. It's been 3 years, and it is time to let go of them. But the one person that I can't let go is my husband. His disappointment haunts me. Not in a good way. I have a test tomorrow, and to be able to get A I cant make any mistakes. Since it is open book, he said that if I can't get 90 in open book then... well he didn't finish. Every time I don't get over 70 I am disappointing him, and there are so many quizzes and tests and midterm through out the term, that once I do badly in one the disappointment starts. I lose confidence in myself and I can't get back up. I have anxiety now, and want to just cry sometime, because I'm afraid he is already thinking I am not smart enough. Every time I ask he gives me an unsure answer that I can really do it. If I fail this then everyone who thinks that I am no good will be right. And it all depends on the first test of the term. 

I know this is a lot of unwanted information. But I really feel like all these things accumulate to my frustration. I tried therapy once, it was useless, I was made to talk more about religion and communism than my problems. If anyone could give me a friendly advise on how should I approach this problem. Most people don't care to listen, and even if they do it seems to be beyond their understanding, just cause of the diversity part of it.

949,Hello all! So I am going to explain what my life looks like at the moment. I am 23 years old (f). I did graduate from college in May with a Psychology degree. The one job I could get after graduation was at the zoo. I basically work there letting people know to follow safety guidelines. I have been there for 4 months now. The only reason I do hesitate to leave this job is because with the corona virus this job is okay in terms of my safety. I do want to do volunteering or something that I could possibly add to my resume so that it won't look blank. I do not know what I want to do with my degree but in the meantime the money I am getting is helping me with my loans. I did apply to crisis text line and got accepted but is no longer offering training due to full capacity. Can I have ideas on things that I could do at home and add to my resume? Maybe a blog?

954,"TLDR: job pays hefty 11$hr but they treat me poorly and I'm now stuck between the money and my self respect


I looked for a job for MONTHS - covid and being a teen made things extra hard. I tried avoiding fast food with my life, but my boyfriends dad got me a job at a fast food place. It was okay the first 2 days then all the havoc began. Being young and a girl were always what they'd pick on me about. I couldnt do this or that and then a coworker just was relentless when it came to making me do the dirty work meant for experienced workers. 

My parents at first told me not to quit - 11hr is a lot of money. I know that. At the time I was more confident and think I deserved being treated like a person instead of an item. But now looking at my check for 208$ bucks I'm wondering if my parents were right. 

But I'm stuck as well, my parents began supporting my decision when they called *during*  my uncles funeral. Their tone of voice, their overall lack of care of how rude this was.

I (18f) recently graduated high school and decided NOT to go to college/university. While my parents think I plan to go back later on in the next few years, I have absolutely no plan to do so. I’ve never been able to pay attention in school, had bad grades throughout most of high school, and I was also bullied by teachers and students alike, making school a generally miserable experience for me. And to add, I also have no interests that I can pursue a career in. At least not any that my grades will be able to back up. 

Currently, I have a part-time job (with the option to go full-time in the future) and I’m quite happy with the job. I make very good money (17/hour) for my age, and while I’m not the best at saving money I’ve gotten a ton better and have grown myself a small savings account which I’m determined to continue. I do not plan to keep this job forever, as the hours are horrible (4am-12pm) but I do plan to keep this job for at least a few years.

960,"I’ve been thinking about how to word this over and over again. Playing this through my head for a bit.

My best friend of 22 years succumbed to suicide on August 24th. To call him my best friend feels like an insult, because he was closer than that. To call him a brother would be even more insulting considering he was far closer to me than my biological brother could ever be.

He was entirely a part of my family and with no real qualms whatsoever (inclusive of my spouse and child). We spoke nearly every single day for the last 22 years. Once I was on a tour in another country with no internet on my phone so I fiddled with my Kindle on the first day to get a browser on it so I could message him and while my tour-mates were drinking and partying (not my scene) I spend hours and hours just chatting with him. He was also my co-worker, co-writer, my manager for my acting career, my inspiration for working and often just living, 

I’m writing to here because I only recently discovered this community... through his browser history. I was the one to discover his note… no one else thought to look for it, not his parents nor his sister. I was the first person to turn on his computer and there it was waiting on his computer.

I’m coming here because no one around me seems to know how I feel… I don’t even know how I feel… and I just need to find some semblance of… anything. I don’t know.

Anyone I reach out to just kinda shrugs their shoulders. I’m the rock for his mother and sister and so when I ask them I kind of receive radio silence (they are convinced that he wrote the note but still died naturally somehow). The details of the note paint a very solid picture of what was going through his head and what finally sent him over the edge.

If anyone could maybe just, I dunno, tell me that in the future it'll be a sad smile when I'll think of him, or that continuing on is tough every day but honouring his memory is good. Or even if I can just get by without thinking about him at all.

I just wanted to ask someone who might kind of know what I’m going though. I don't know if I'll even be able to read the responses... but... I had to try.

hi!

For some context, my dad is Canadian and my mother is Metis. my parents are separated and I'm not close to her side of the family. (but I am close to her)

My brother and I both recently became eligible to apply for scholarships/bursaries. My uncle is very interested in family trees/hidden roots and won't give this up, and my dad seems on board too. I haven't done a lot of research on this because I'm not sure about it, but basically I can apply online and receive money/scholarships for my schooling solely on the fact that I am part Metis. But here's why I don't want to apply:

I'm only part Metis, and I am extremely white passing- Unless I'm standing next to my mom, It's literally impossible to tell. Because I live with my dad, I've only ever read about Metis culture- my mom shows me a lot of things, but I don't get to experience it. That's another thing- Indigenous people receive a lot of discrimination. I have never experienced that. I feel as though I would be stealing because I haven't earned the scholarship and just because I'm technically part Metis it doesn't feel right.

Subtle things like excluding me from group chats, calling me their best friend when I am around them but having another person set as their best friend on social meida. I know It’s all my fault because i barely talk to them because I don’t have anything to say, so I would rather not waste their time or bore them .

I do think that I am one of the strongest people mentally in my immediate family and social circle, I have felt pretty much unwanted by everyone around me since I would say the age of 6. I don't think I am entirely unwanted by the people around me as I also have recognized that without my immediate family would crumble. From about the age of 6 most people in my family have bullied me and pushed me around because instead of riding dirtbikes and going to dirtbike races I preferred to play video games. My parents would often force us to sleep over at our aunt and uncles house when we were younger so we could spend time with our cousin who was a year younger than us and for a long time he was an only child. I was always kind of an asshole when I was over there because I did not fit in and my two older siblings and my younger cousin would often ditch me to go do other things. I never bonded much with my uncle, my aunt was different, she was a good listener but the second the other kids were around it was different. I eventually refused to go to their house altogether. I would get to spend time alone with my parents which at the time I cherished. 

Through my teen years a lot of the feelings of being unwanted didn't really bother me because I was still going to school and I had people all around me that I could talk to if I needed it. Shortly after graduating high school in 2019 I pretty much lost contact with all of my friends as most of them went off to college and I hadn't planned on going to college. As 2019 progressed the self hate and depression became more and more prevalent to me. I would work a few days a week and sit in a big empty house the other days. Even though I had a lot of extra free time I no longer found any enjoyment in playing video games. Over the course of the fall of 2019 I lost contact with most of my friends and I couldn't talk to anyone about how depressed and lonely I felt. Towards the end of 2019 my family adopted a dog and we named her Ella. I love that dog so much and she pretty much pulled me out of my depression. I January of 2020 I decided I would give college a shot. I started off small with 2 classes. It was great, I didn't make any new friends but I really liked getting out of the house and learning new things. Around March of that year the pandemic became a serious thing in my area and school had been shut down for the foreseeable future.

Once the lock downs started I began picking up a lot of shifts at work, the first few weeks I worked over 50 hours. School resumed online and I hated it, I struggled to keep up as I was working most of the time. Everything slowly began to slowdown again towards May and June of 2020. 

My sister moved back in with us in June, she had a nasty breakup. She would often go over to my previously mentioned Aunts house to swim in the pool. I went with her one time. After swimming, my sister, my aunt, and I had a very long conversation about the struggles of living with our parents and basically she just let us vent. I quickly grew really close with my aunt who when I was younger I could never get close to. This Aunt is my moms sister, and she has always hated my dad. I recently learned that everything I told my aunt in private was told to my mom in a lens that made my dad look bad. She betrayed my trust, I was right as a kid. Things with my family have gotten worse we are all always fighting. I smoke weed again and have nobody to vent to. I started writing in a journal on occasion to document my thoughts and what not. I started remote learning again recently, I am only taking one class and I regret my decision so much as this class is not what I expected. I spent about a grand in total so I am going to try my best to get through it. I feel like I am spiraling, I have lingering thoughts in the back of my mind to withdraw all of my savings and just quietly leave in the middle of the night. I want to go far away and live completely off the grid. I know that is pretty much impossible nowadays and I probably don't even have enough money. 

Now that I got all of that out I really don't see the point in any of it. I think a few things I left out is that my sister and brother are pretty much failures in the eyes of my parents and they put all the stress on my shoulders to push through college and be successful. My sister also relies on me for advise with her relationship and deciding between her new boyfriend and her old one and I just don't know what to say when she wants advise because I am so damaged myself and I have never been in a relationship. I also feel as though I have nobody to vent my own problems to. So I guess that is why I am here. 

Sorry for long and confusing post, even if nobody reads this, it felt good to get it all out there. I am a sad man and have lived a sad life up to this point.",23Sep2020,1
968,"A few days ago I (22 Black F) was using My boyfriends ( 22 white M ) laptop for class and decided to look at his YouTube search history cause he had the tab open and i was bored. I saw that about a year ago he was looking up a few memes and songs with the word “N***er” in it, which was fully spelt out on his search history. So he obviously typed it himself. Me and him met about 10 months ago so over 2 months ago he was searching that up which made me EXTREMELY uncomfortable. When I brought it up he stated it was old memes and scenes from movies and songs he was looking up but i was still very uneasy about it. (Because I don’t know how anyone can find hun our or want to listen to that type of stuff )This eventually led to an argument in which I broke up w him . I’m not sure if I over reacted or not because he’s never said anything racist, has acted  or made me feel that way in our relationship. I’m just not sure what to do . Thoughts or advice would be really greatful?",23Sep2020,1
970,"My wife has this friend from college, despite them both having had relationships with men. Neither is an individual that you would surprised if they were gay (for stereotypical reasons, softball, kayaking, weightlifting deeper voices, earthy). We've been together 8 years and my wife has shown no tendencies or attraction outside of her Relationship with H. 

H and her were college and grad school roommates. My wife always wears a ring that H gave her after her first engagement  ended. H lives two states away and they rarely see each other  but my wife travels once a year alone to see her and H comes once a year to visit us. When she visits I give  them a few days alone, staying with  my sister. (They never  ask for it, I just kind of feel like I should.) 

H was always very rude and standoffish towards me until the wedding 5 years ago and we have been great since.

The final weird thing is that when H calls, my wife takes a walk or drives to a park. 

I just want her to know that if there's love in her heart for both of us, I am ok with that. No weird threesome, no romantic throuple. Just genuinely, if H is the woman she loves, and I am the man she loves I am ok.

I don't  know how to bring it up or if I ever can. 

So dear Reddit, how do I let my wife know I am ok with her being in love with her friend as long as she still loves me without making her feel bad, forcing her out, or having a dramatic confrontation?",23Sep2020,1
971,"I have already posted this on another subredit but i need to make up my mind fast before this Sunday (u will read the reason) so i need as many responses as possible.


I (23M) live in Pakistan. I am from Karachi but live in Lahore for university. I am on by 3rd Year in University. I live in a rested 2 bedroom apartment alone. Now right across lives a woman (30F) and her 7 year old son.

Often in the morning i would see her drop her son to his van and then she would leave for work. In those few intial instances when i saw her i was totally dumb fond by her beauty. She was a healthy woman with a mouth watering body and a gorgeous looking face. She wore a jilbab and hijab so i never got to see more but just the outline of her body triggered my male hormones crazy. This was 3 years ago when i first moved in.

Now slowly i approached her in helping her out and so begun my direct communication with her. At first i helped out in basic things like bringing certain groceries or droping her son to school. But as time went by she begun trusting me more and we became friends. I got her number and while her initial texts were list of groceries we soon got more causal and started having actual conversations.

We discussed our personal lives and other stuff. She told me she is a single mom and that she works as a receptionist somewhere. I told her about my education. She however is very hesitant on her child's father and i still dont know anything about him so i never ask so she doesnt get awkward. My intial checking out turned into a genuine crush and i started going to the gym.

A few months in oneday she even complemented by physical appearance when made me really happy and kinda turned on thinking that maybe i turned her on a little bit even if its slightly.

My the middle of my second year's semester she got so casual with me that now she even lets me buy her private items like pads. Since i knew when she is on her period i started buying a box of chocolates and ice cream everytime she asks me to buy pads for her. She really appriciates when i do that and her appreciation makes me happy.

Now i must tell u that i am still a virgin. And being so close with such a beautiful and hot woman and literally a dream for a guy like me. I dont wanna sound like a creep but her body esspecially her ass just drives me crazy. Even when she is all covered up in a jilbab her ass still pops out like a camel's hump. 

Now i would be lying if i said i never imagine myself nude with her when im alone. Infact i often think how her naked body would look like without all those layers of cloths and hijab to hide her hair, would she be a hairy lady like most Pakistani women or would she be shaved like Western Women either way i would love it. I know this sounds perverted but honestly these are thoughts that anyone would have when they are 20+ and still a virgin and growing closer to the woman they love.

She has even invited me to dinner on some rare occasions such as during any festival since they dont have any relatives in the city. So i got a good look inside her house. Its a nice clean house with 2 bedrooms. I was shocked to find out that despite just the 2 mother and child living alone they still had seperate rooms. I asked why and she responded with that her son has a fixed bedtime at 11 pm so she doesnt want to be around him otherwise he migjt get disturbed.

Now while this all sounds normal for me it got me thinking does she feel lonely at nights? I mean think about it a hot single woman that sleeps alone ! Like there must be nights when she must feel horny. 

Since then my mind has started working in all sorts of directions. Like does she think of me when she is horny ? I mean she has complimented my body and doesnt try to hide private things like her periods. I just like to imagine her laying nude on her bed thinking about me idk if that is true or not.

I really love this woman and as time goes on my feeling for her heat up more and more. But i want her to fall equally in love with me. She is a conservative woman yet she has let me be so close to her. She sees me as a helpful neighbour and a good friend but that isnt enough for me. I want to go beyond just being a friend. I want to be naked with her in bed, I want to be the man who she has allowed to take off all those layers and layers of clothing, I want to be someone who she can be shameless around and I want her to look at my naked body aswell without feeling shy.

Im sorry if i sound so perverted but I am so sexually repressed, the least i can do is imagine myself doing dirty things to her.

This sunday is my birthday and i asked her if she would like to go out for dinner with me, At first she objected that Monday her son has school (schools have opened up here). So i clarified that the dinner would be just between me and her and that i will pick her up after 11 (her son's bedtime) and drop her by 2 am. She then agreed.

Now i am beyond happy. For me I am making progress in winning her heart. We would be together late at night having a romantic dinner and then I drop her at her house. 

Now I know this isnt ""The Night"" where she might invite me home and we have sex. We obviously havent reached that point yet but still I imagine that would be a night much similar to this one.

During my time fantasizing of that day and imagining how her giant ass would look like without cloths I had a very serious and existential question.

The question was regarding the morality of what i am doing and my aim. Let me be a little specific.

Lets say she agrees to have sex with me and one night after 11 i go to her house and we both strip and start making love. Now is it moral for me to be naked with a woman whose 7 year old child is sleeping in the other room oblivious to what i am doing with his mother ? 

From the kid's pov i am just a friendly neighbour who sometimes drops him to school. Now imagine urself in place of that kid and tell me how would u feel if u oneday (sooner or later) find out that ur friendly neighbour actually comes to ur house after u sleep and ejaculates on ur naked mother. The same mother that covers herself in a jilbab.

In my love for the beauty of this mature woman made me forget that she has a child.

Fantasizing about anal was my favorite since i have mentioned she has a huge ass. However the same fantasy makes me look cruel in my eyes questioning if me entering a woman's rectum while her innocent child sleeps is me being a douch bag.

My question is this:
Is it moral for me to have sex with a single mother just next to the room where her child sleeps ?

Originally i was gonna post a picture of her and her son that i took oneday. And another one of a side angle where the size of her ass can be seen. However i found this idea really distasteful so i opted not to. But if people insist for proof i might post it but please dont do that.

I request u dont troll me but do point me out if i am wrong somewhere. I really need to know the moral implications of my soon to be relationship.

That kid really looks up to his mother. If what i want really does happen then am I doing any injustice to the innocent child ?",23Sep2020,1
972,"Stitch was the family dog of give or take, 15 years (from before me starting kindergarten to my junior year of highschool), we buried him in the backyard of our house and now my dad is planning on moving us somewhere else.

Leaving his body/bones/ashes isn't up for debate, I can't leave him alone, this dog helped me through it all and I love and miss him every single day and I still cry over him.

He was buried in what I remember, a blanket and I think maybe a box (I wasn't in the right state of mind to see him be buried). 

He was a Lhasa apso so he should be well,,,,decomposed now since he passed in 2019 but its more so the whole act of, digging him up that's the issue.

I'm definitely not gonna be able to, both mentally and physically, my sister as well. My mom may be able to since she was the one who buried him but I really would not want her to be the one to do it bc I can only imagine how traumatizing that could be on her or me and my sister. My dad never cared too much about Stitch so I doubt he would even consider doing it for us.

This is gonna sound weird but do y'all have any advice? I was honestly thinking of asking someone and paying them to do it and put him in the new property but I feel as if that's insane and no one would do that :/",23Sep2020,1
973,I have been a top student. Studied every night. Have got straight a’s. I have tried to be the best at the sport I play. I have practice every day for it. For the past year I have just been out of it. I have gotten bad grades at the start of this year. Also have just not practiced or have tried to keep fit. I just feel out of it. I have always tried to put a smile in my face and have never actually shown my emotions. I have always been told to be a man and never have shown my true self. Also my dad who is in his early 40s works 12+hours or 24+ and always comes home tired. But he tries to spend time with me. I feel like I’m making him suffer. Idk what to do,23Sep2020,1
974,"I'm bisexual (I think), that's the reason I'm on here.

I get turned on by the thought of a dick in the ass &amp; do watch gay porn but afterwards (once I cum) I feel absolutely disgusted at the thought of being with a guy. 

I don't really know what advice I'm asking for but does anyone or has anyone had the same ""issue"" and how did it change?",23Sep2020,1
976,"I (15f) am a feminist I guess you can say. I’ve been following newly appointed laws and such and heavily support BLM and about teaching history. I don’t support either political candidates (and I can’t vote either way) . My mom on the other hand is a Trump supporter and every time I ask her why she says “well Biden’s not any better” or something along those lines.

About 10-15 minutes ago I was talking about the executive order about not being able to teach about slavery anymore to my younger brother. My mom overheard and asked a question and I answered. She asked me if I was mistaken and I told her I wasn’t. I proceeded to slowly start to talk to her about history such as the mess with Christopher Columbus and how he was a huge jerk. She said that she didn’t care about anything that didn’t involve her. (I’m mixed, and she is white) (and she has happened to be racist on a lot of other occasions and I have just taken it with a grain of salt)

I never really chose to speak out to her before and normally just dropped it but this time she went on about how she doesn’t care about nobody else’s past and said that when she sees shootings around where we live it’s always African Americans. I’m not sure if I should get worked up this much over it or if I should let it bother me but it really just made me lose a lot of respect for her, especially since she WAS listening to me and said she didn’t really care.

And I’ve been in counseling for years (trauma with my fathers abuse) and sometimes I’m aware of bias that I have and that I should calm down but I can’t help but want to just try to get through to her. I’m not sure what to do. I can’t stand it and her husband uses a lot of offensive slurs on occasion.

She’s always going to be my mom but this has really destroyed the image I used to see her as. I just need some advice from someone outside of the situation.",23Sep2020,1
977,"More information:

 I recently got a job in a local chain pub (last few months) in Front of House, and they recently had the uniforms delivered they ordered months ago. The shirts which are just black with the pubs name on the chest were entirely female shirts. My manager on duty told me to wear one anyway as ""no one would notice"" when tucked in etc. So I complied for the rest of that shift. I usually wear a black polo shirt for work and I look quite smart for it. However this women's shirt due to the nature of the women's fit wasn't nearly as smart, and so my best bet was to wear one far to large so I could tuck it in, however it still didn't look right. 

 After work I politely messaged the manager asking if I was okay not wearing the provided shirts as they where women's to which she okayed until the head manager came back from holiday. However in work the following day the almost entirely female staff made comments on fact I was making a fuss over nothing etc.  One even said I was being sexist.... 

I am hoping the head manager will allow me to continue as I have been or order in male shirts for me. Does anyone have any advice? Surely they can't require me to wear uniform intended for the opposite sex?",23Sep2020,1
978,"So, earlier in our relationship we were in an open relationship. A few weeks ago, while we were open, he went over to his coworkers house after going for a walk and didnt message me for about 13 hours. He slept with the coworker and came home with a smile on his face an a huge hickey on his neck at 8 am. 
Now, this coworker is over at the apartment while I'm home and is dyeing my boyfriends here.

I'm feeling really unloved right now and like a third wheel. Please advise. Nothing aside from these two instances has ever happened in our relationship.",23Sep2020,1
979,"Let me be clear I am not trying to walk out on my kid. I love that boy more than life itself, but I can’t stay with his mother. Shit was nice at the beginning of the relationship, like they all are. We were together for two months before I got her pregnant, I had my doubts back then but saw it as a sign or whatever. I had been pretty suicidal prior to meeting her, maybe god is giving me another chance. I was wrong as her and I both were pretending to hide the bad things about ourselves until we had to see each other all the time. I found myself lying to her about small things because telling the truth would mean an argument. I developed an entire personality around her, how to act and speak. 

If I went against what she believed a boyfriend (and future husband) should be, there was an argument. I could sit here and lay out all the details but I’m not gonna do that. It’s been two years of lying to myself and everyone around me, trying to talk myself into being happy with this. I feel an immense amount of guilt as it was me that got her pregnant, my son didn’t ask to be born. I’ve tried to leave several times but my fear of not being with him everyday would cause me to take back things I said and blame it on “being stressed”. Because I have to, otherwise there will be no going back. She won’t take it lightly, the mask I’ve worn for two years straight is who she believes I am. Me coming clean will rip the mask off and things will be bad. 

She is going to the beach for 5 days with my son and her family this coming week. I can’t go as I have to work. I’m considering simply packing my things and leaving while she’s gone but that begs the question, then what? I plan to talk to an attorney in the meantime to find out legally what I’m obligated to do and not do. I just want out, I’m tired of being miserable in my own home. I can’t talk it out with her, won’t go well for either of us and my son is almost to the point where he knows something isnt right 99% of the time. I’ve gotta do something and I guess I just need to know if this is a good plan. I don’t think she will harm our son but there’s a good possibility she will keep him from me as she comes back on a Sunday and I have to work the next day. This is probably the only opportunity I have to take and not walk back out of fear of what’s gonna happen I just don’t know if it’s logical or a moral thing to do. I have every intention of staying in my sons life. He keeps me going and deserves a father to be there for him but I’ve gotta take care of my own mental health my own mind if I’m to be the father he needs.",23Sep2020,1
980,"About 3-4 months ago one of my coworkers was needing to get rid of her cat due to landlord stuff. I had always wanted a cat and figured why not, so I picked Cat up a few days later. At the time he was 3 months old, in a new home, and was naturally really stressing me out. Things have gotten better since but I still find myself dreading coming home most days because of him. I can't study in peace, I can't do anything by myself. I come home from a long day of work and he's right there to annoy me, or he's already fucked something up that I didn't expect him to be able to fuck up. I live alone in a small studio apartment so I can't ever just put him in a different room. I really do love my cat he's just so aggravating and I don't know what to do. I know he's a kitten and that he'll get better as he gets older, I just don't know if I can put up with the stress and frustration until that happens :( No amount of attention is enough for him, and he gets bored of toys faster than I even knew they could. I would feel horrible if I ended up having to give him up after the trust my coworker gave to me. I don't know what to do! :(
