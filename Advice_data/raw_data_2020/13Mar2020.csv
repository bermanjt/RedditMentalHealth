0,"I just saw a real rape video on Pornhub and I'm feeling sick. How to I process this? Like what in the actual fuck? I feel disgusted, and frustrated, and a little like screaming at the top of my lungs.

Also for the record I usually stick to erotica and I'm definitely going to be staying there in the future so 1) I never see anything like that again, and 2) I stop supporting websites that allow for this to happen .",13Mar2020,1

3,"So basically I'm 18 and my parents are moving across the country leaving my sister behind and I have to choose if I wanna go with them or not. My dad's job transferred him across the country for the remainder of his time working with them (max 10 years).
My sisters married and settled here and I'm single but just got offered a job about 3 hours away from here that is with a friend in his construction company. I want to do carpentry and later study business and start my own thing here, however my parents kind of want me to go with them even though if I stay they would come back here in either 5 years or 10. I have no clue what to do to be honest…my job would start in 2 weeks and to be honest it would probably jumpstart my life. So far I'm going along with taking the job and staying, but am I making the right choice? Any input or different perspective or whatever is welcome.

6,So like I wanna name my child Gaye and think it’s a unique name. But my girlfriend disagrees. Yes I understand that he may get bullied and stuff like that but here soon the direction our world is heading in it won’t be a problem.

7,"My dog is a mom to puppies again for the second time in a row.. I left her with my parents and their German Shepard the first time around because I was deployed. I paid dog food monthly, toys, and even new dog house for her. 
When I was halfway through my tour in Afghanistan, I was told my husky got 9 puppies from my dad’s dog.. my own precious dog, was pregnant and had 9 puppies. They told me they don’t have enough money to buy puppy dog food! I bought $5,000 in total for puppy food and medical supplies for 9 pups... all in 3 months... I was broke and I never got any money back from when they sold all the puppies. I was devastated because all I wanted was for my parents to take care of my dog but they got her pregnant BY THEIR OWN MALE DOG. And then ask me to help with puppy  bills..... that was a year ago. I begged my parents to not get her pregnant again as I don’t have money enough to take care of food and medical bills for puppies. Just my dog. I moved overseas for work again and had to leave her behind with my parents. Begging them to not let their dog near mine.

And now she got pregnant again because they noticed their dog was having sex with my dog again! And she gave birth to 5 puppies. My mother is once again asking for food and medical supplies and I’m honestly so lost on what to do. I feel like they don’t care for my dog at all and just let her roam free outside in the backyard without guidance. She doesn’t even get to come inside because my parents hate indoor dogs! So I have to buy her a dog house but the other dog uses it!! What do I do??? I’m stuck overseas for another year and can’t visit anytime soon due to the Europe and US issue.",13Mar2020,1

9,"Hello there. Today my partner felt quite alarmed, as she found a personal handwritten letter through her mailbox addressed to her. The person in the letter states that she has a parcel awaiting collection at the local depot, and if she wants it re-delivered she should call/text the number provided- it is the postman's personal mobile number, not a number at all affiliated with the post service. The thing is, if you want redelivery you have to go through official steps on the courier website. Also, she had already received an official calling card for this parcel, so the handwritten letter wasn't necessary.

Furthermore, the worker wrote in his letter that she can come to pick the parcel up even after the official depot closing time, which is odd.  I find the whole situation creepy, and my partner is scared.

Are we overreacting?",13Mar2020,1
10,"I had the flu and missed school. I’ve been good about making up the work I missed; turning in 2-3 assignments per class at once. 

When I returned to school I did a presentation on a book and it went great. There was also a test on this book I had to take; I asked my teacher to schedule for me to take it. (Like I’ve been doing in every class) He told me to talk to him after class. When I went up to him he was silent and staring at the computer. He would not make eye contact with me. He wouldn’t even turn and face me. It wasn’t an inappropriate time for me to talk to him because we planned to talk. On the screen he was just staring at my missing test grade. After awkward silence between both of us for a few minutes, I said “I’m talking another test tomorrow at lunch but I could take this the next day.” 

This is what messed me up. He yelled at me to stop talking. Which really freaked me out. Then he told me I could not take the test bc I did the presentation on the book first and that’s just not allowed. He then stared at me and I said ok that’s fine and left. Immediately after I started sobbing. Like in the bathroom having a breakdown. I talked to my mom about it later and she told me to suck it up. So I started crying more. I pretty much just had a big embarrassing mental breakdown for most of the day. 

The next day I tried to pull myself together, but when I was sitting in class I kept feeling anxious. I’m usually only anxious about presenting, etc. But just sitting in class doing worksheets I felt so much anxiety. I’ve never experienced so much anxiety from just basic class work. I feel really mentally weak. I’ve tried talking to family but they tell me I’m overreacting. I just want advice, not to be lectured for being a crybaby. Please tell me how I can pull myself together. I’m just in a horrible state of mind and barely can function at the moment.",13Mar2020,1
11,"Alright, so basically me and my girl can hang out and cuddle and kiss and stuff just fine, but for some reason, whenever I’m around one of my friends, I have a nervous habit of making a like bothered/disgusted “what the fuck are you doing?” Face when she even touches me. A couple days ago she told me that she gets really bothered by it and I told her I’d try and stop. Today it happened again and now she’s really mad at me and is basically ignoring me. She feels like I’m trying to prove something to my friend by making that face but I’ve told her it’s just a habit, idk maybe deep down she’s right and that is the problem. My question is, how can I show her that I have nothing to prove and that I’m proud to have her and not bothered by it?",13Mar2020,1

Even though we've never talked for real I can tell we click. It's been nice being appreciated for who I really am. However, they now want to see my face. I know from their profile that they are quite attractive, whereas I am very below average. When I told them this, they seemed to not believe me, assuming I'm attractive because I have a good personality.

13,"I live in a small city with just my parents. When I say they're abusive, I don't mean they whip me with a belt and lock me in a closet all day long. I mean they do things that sabotage my relationships, they lock me down financially so I rely on them, they tried putting me in an arranged marriage when I was 17 in a foreign country, etc. I also don't have any friends who have room for me to live with them.

I want to leave, but I'm also an unemployed 21 year old university student and can't find a full time job where I live because there just isn't enough investment made into my town. I can't work full time either because of my schooling, so I can't afford to as much as rent a small apartment. Because of my parents having made me ""just focus on school"" since I was 16 with promises of supporting my education I have very little experience to show for in my resume. I have an associates degree in general studies, but that's pretty much it.

What can I do? Do I just tough it out for 2 years until I get my bachelors (in math) and hope to land a good job? Or are there things I can do with the little credentials/experience I have to make enough money to at least afford a 1 bedroom apartment?

16,"I moved into a new place a few months ago.  Our next door neighbors are pretty close to us and we have a shared driveway (each have a half side by side).  They were nice and everything seemed normal.  My wife and I joked about how often they hung out in the kitchen (no seating) with no curtains on the windows and a glass door.  It seemed quirky but fine.  However, as time passed, I noticed the husband (30s, white male) staring at me (30s, black male) or my wife through the window multiple times.  He would even smile at me sometimes.  Our kitchen windows face each other and they are probably about 30 feet apart.  My wife hung curtains and we hoped that would be the end of it.

I smoke on our back deck and when I am out there, I've noticed him staring at me again.  At first, I would turn my back to him or move further out of his sight lines.  However, I started to feel judged and/or spied on.  I would stare back at times to see if he would stop, but he didn't.  I would even shake my head when I would catch him staring at me - nothing.  

Last night was the final straw.  I saw him standing in his kitchen door with a blanket on his head and draped over his body staring right at me.  He stood there for a long time.  Then he started pacing around his kitchen acting odd (an awkward dance move or some strange movements) and then smiled, laughed, and walked away.  No one was near him. This was pretty late at night, 10-11 PM. It gave me the chills.  I honestly think he may be mentally ill.  It's to the point that I am concerned for my family's safety.

We both get home around the same time so tonight I approached him.  I said hello and asked him if we could chat.  He said sure and walked over.  I asked him if we are good or do we have a problem.  He said no, everything is fine.  I said I see him staring at me, like last night, and it concerns me.  He broke eye contact and said he cannot see over here from his house.  He lied to my face.  Unless he is legally blind (which makes it even weirder that you would stand and stare out into the darkness), he has to be able to see 30 feet away.  If I can see him, he can see me.  There is nothing blocking his view and the back light is on.  Once he lied, I got frustrated and said thank you and walked off.

I don't know what to do.  I feel like I can't be in my own backyard.  I don't know if he is racist, mentally ill, very weird, or legally blind.  Whatever the cause, I don't know how to move forward.  We will try to implement some privacy on the deck but it won't fully solve the issue.  This is our home, we may be neighbors for decades.  Do I just need to avoid him and the discomfort he causes me?  Should I confront him again if it happens again?  Is staring at your neighbor normal to certain cultures or people?  My wife thinks it may be a white/black cultural thing but I have had plenty of white neighbors and friends and never experienced anything like this.  She also said he sounds like he could be schizophrenic or tweaking on weed or something else.  Friends have said he is probably racist.  

For the record, I cannot think of anything I have done to create any vitriol.  I have shoveled for them, been friendly, and do not do anything un-neighborly like being loud or inconsiderate.  When I smoke cigarettes, I dispose of them properly, and the smoke does not go onto their property.  

Thanks for any advice.",13Mar2020,1
17,So I’m in my first semester of college and I’ve been really trying to think of what I want to major in. Right now I’m in a behavioral science degree program because initially I thought I wanted to do psychology but now I’m not so sure.

18,"Help. 

My bf was out of town and I hung out with our mutual friend til 6 am doing cocaine. Nothing inappropriate happened at all, just a whole lot of talking and before you know it it was 6am. 

My bf is already a bit jealous and I didn’t want to make him worried that something weird happened and I was also ashamed that I did coke for that amount of time. so I lied and said we only hung out for 1 beer and then he left. He asked a ton of follow up questions which I also lied about and he was mad we hung out at all. 

Well, now it’s eating me up and I don’t know what to do bc now if I tell him he’s going to get more mad and think the worst bc I lied. I feel so stupid for the entire thing and wish I had never hung out with the friend at all.

24,"Long story below.

This may be my last post on reddit. It’s been over a week since this incident occurred and I spent the entire time since then conjuring up scenarios in my head and not paying attention to real life. When driving or at work, I’m not really paying attention, I am just going over things in my head...

Long story short I was on a porn site and I came across CP. I freaked out and ended up reporting it to as many authorities as I could find. But before I clicked out of it, I was already overly horny (was already mid masturbation) and I told myself “what If” and so I finished to one of the photos. After finishing, I instantly felt a wave of regret. I almost threw up, I was shaking, and I wanted to cry. This is the lowest I have ever gone. I didn’t know who I was anymore. I am an adult who prides himself on being a pure and clean person, who cares about others, and yet I did this... 

I am now constantly trying to seek strangers opinions on reddit to see if I am an actual pedo or not. I have non stop posted in legal advice, off my chest, confessions etc. some people say it was a mistake, others say call a lawyer, and of course some called me a pedo. Then one of my throwaways I used got permanently banned as I explained what happened like above, and now I am even more worrried about being thrown in jail as I had written out everything but that got me banned from reddit.... everyday I think how I disappointed myself and my family.... 

I would seek therapy online as I have an online counselor but I am also afraid of them reporting me despite not really breaking a law, as I did report the content and I wasn’t seeking it out.

I was thinking of finding a different counselor to cover this topic, but I’m afraid they too would report me right away. What should I do?????? I literally can’t move past what I did. I can’t focus when driving, when at work, at school, etc.",13Mar2020,1

Confidence is not easy for me, never has been as I was depressed all through high school and up until about 4 years ago I really hated myself.

I want to meet a good woman and start a relationship, but I don't have the balls to go up to a woman and talk/flirt, and although I'm not bad looking, no women talk to me.

   I live at home with my family but my life is going nowhere, I'm trying to take care of my mum who isn't well and I'm constantly getting into fights with my mum's boyfriend who is her carer. He treats her terribly but she claims she can't live without him. I need a job to make money and help out at home but I keep trying and I'm not getting anything. 

   I'm in a long distance relationship and my partner (19M) doesn't understand why I'm struggling. Or why I feel so terrible. We keep arguing even though I try to show him how much I love him everyday, he says something hurtful or callous or doesn't communicate at all and when I bring it up he blames me for causing drama and then apologises only for it to happen over and over again.

43,"It feels like I'm the only one who absolutely couldn't care less about following a ""path"" in life and pursuing a degree or seeking employment at all. Thankfully I have family who support me and I'm only 20 turning 21 soon but I'm seriously worried about the future. My family has already begun pressuring me into doing something and I just have no interest at all. I've worked in retail and have taken a few College courses but that's about it. I don't think money will ever motivate me enough to get a degree or care about putting in the effort that everyone else seems to.

No matter what I end up doing I can't get over how I'll likely spend a large portion of my day at some job. I can't understand how salaried employees do it for decades and decades. I can understand if you don't mind your choice of work but I could never see myself ""loving"" the time I spend doing something out of necessity. Providing monetary value to someone else is totally different than pursuing your own passions and interests. It feels pretty hopeless writing this and I've went back and forth between acknowledging the problem or just using forms of escapism to not think about it.

I've tried looking through most degree options and jobs available near by and none of it appeals to me at all. I spend most of my free time playing guitar/piano and video games but I'm trying to reduce the amount of gaming I do. Please don't tell me to just stop being ""lazy"" or the ""that's life"" advice because it really does not help at all. Also I think I'm a relatively happy person and I know that I don't have depression so it's not that. I'm interested in other things in life but a career is not one of them. 

tl:dr - I'm struggling with the concept of pursuing a career and I've never had any interest in going to school or getting a job. It seems like everyone else is ambitious about following a ""path"" in life and I just couldn't care less.",13Mar2020,1
44,"Hi everyone, my friend has been rejected from another university and I feel awful for her because she is the nicest and hardworking girl I know and I don’t understand why she’s getting rejected. I just want to know how to comfort her without sounding patronising or non understanding. What should I say or do to make her feel better even if it’s just a little thing.",13Mar2020,1
45,"TLDR at the end.

My mom has three dogs (DogA, DogB, DogC). She likes two of them (DogA, DogB) and can only legally have two and has only two of them registered (DogA, DogC) and can't even really afford to own one, but refuses to get rid of any of them.

She HATES DogC and loves to see him suffer. He's not an easy dog to deal with because of his anxiety but she likes to put him into stressful situations to laugh at him and then she punishes him for it (by lifting and dropping his cage by about 4-8 inches or kicking it. Keep in mind, DogC is under 8 lbs). 

He's very anxious about nail cutting now and when she does it she pushes him on the floor and he gets so stressed that his nose bleeds.

She throws things at him but they don't usually hit him and aren't too heavy/hard.

She doesn't take any of the dogs to the vet. DogA and DogB seem healthy enough. DogA is pretty old and should see a vet. DogC has rotting teeth. They are green and I brought this up to her and she told me that she would book a vet appointment.

So I ask her if she has the appointment set up and she's like ""yeah, but I can't get in until next month""...

A month goes by...then two...then three.

It has now been seven months...still no vet care. His teeth are going soft in his mouth and he can't take hard food, which she decides to feed him.

He has basically shut down and pees in his kennel and won't leave it even with the door wide open.

When I offered to take him, she screamed at me saying that he was her family and I wasn't going to take him from her.

My mom and I have had a very long, abusive relationship and so I know her to be very manipulative and I suspect very mentally ill.

I just don't know how to go about this situation.

She can only have two dogs registered but he's one of them.  

She isn't someone I'm going to convince to give him to me.

I also don't really know what's considered dog abuse.

I can't sit back knowing that he needs vet care and help and will NEVER get it there. He still has so many years left and doesn't deserve to spend them hiding in his piss.

TLDR: I want to take my dog away from my dog-neglectful/abusive(?) mother. She is only allowed to have two dogs in town, but has three. He is one of the registered two. She is very mentally ill and I won't be able to talk her into giving him to me. He requires vet attention for rotting teeth and she refuses it or to let me help.",13Mar2020,1
46,"I (17 F) have a friend (17 F) that I’ve mentioned on this sub. She’s more like a bully though, because she hits me whenever she pleases: just today, I was talking about how the weather was nice, and she just slapped me.
She’s done this for like 1 year now, but whenever I confront her she responds with even more violence. For example, today after she hit me, I told her to not touch me ever again. She said “Fuck you, you don’t tell me what to do”
Then proceeded to rip some of my shirt’s buttons so my chest would be exposed. That’s another thing: when she’s in a good mood, she lays her head of my chest, and, uh, kind of fondles them. I don’t tell her anything because I’m afraid she’ll make me look like a drama queen. Whenever I try to stand up for myself, she makes sure that I somehow look bad.

My gm says that he wants me to be the fom and he’s been telling me that a lot. Now he says he’s talking to a few different people who are interested, and wants to wait a bit before he chooses his next person for fom. Wait wasn’t I the one to be taking the position?

48,"Ok so I have a friend group. (we call ourselves the Loser Gang) In it there is me, a girl who I’ll call Nice Girl, and another Girl I’ll call Drama Girl.  We all love art and memes so we wanted to make a YouTube channel together. Drama Girl gets offended by everything, and crys like once a day. Me and Nice Girl both agreed that if we wanted to make a YouTube channel (and potentially an animated series) that shell cause too many problems. She already thinks that we’ll make the channel soon, but I don’t really know how to tell her that she can’t be part of the channel. Normally it would be easier to deal with something like this, but if I just strait up tell her, she’ll cry and make a HUGE deal about it. Me and Nice Girl were thinking about how we could maybe just make the channel without telling her, and then hoping she forgets we were ever gonna make a YouTube channel.

60,"The short story would be that as a student I need an account at this specific bank we'll call B that has an agreement with my Uni. On this account I receive transport money and would receive any future scholarship if it would be the case. Problem is, the bank is taking away my money, for no apparent reason.

On the first days of college we were approached by employees of B to open student accounts. We were assured these wouldn't have any kind of commissions/ fees whatever.

We all did, received our cards and that was it. Until the first time I got my transport money. 25 (not dollars) and they right away took 5 away. I said WTF, maybe an error.

A week later they took away 6. Luckily, Steam had sales and bought something so they couldn't take away anything else.

Next month, same issue. I'm so infuriated at this point, no one else that made an account with me that day gets these. B's contact / customer support email isn't receiving emails and their phone number always puts me on hold. 

Now, B is a huge bank in my country and I would never have thought that they would do something like this.

I have another bank account at a different bank. I used to get my allowance on it. They never took away money from that one, no matter what I did. Not even when I added a pretty big sum of money to buy a triple A game. No fees. I would love to make this my college account, but my Uni has no agreement with these guys.

So I'm left with B. I want to go to one of their banks and talk to someone, but I'm not really sure what to ask of them. I'm also afraid I'm too frustrated now to have a normal conversation with them. Do you have any advice?

All fees are labeled as ""various fees and commissions"" (maybe not the best translation) so i don't know for what they are.",13Mar2020,1
61,"I'm 15, however, my mom has rules that are like if I'm 9.

One thing that annoys me a lot is that I am not allowed to walk to or home from school. I live about a quarter mile from school which is too near so there isn't school bus available. My dad drives me to school every day. When I need to come home from school, my mom relies on my friend's mom picking me up and driving me home (my friend is allowed to walk home from school, I wish this helped convince my mom to let me but it doesn't). But some days my friend's mom is busy and can't pick us up, so I have to wait about an hour and thirty minutes for my dad to come back from work and drive me home. Walking home without telling my mom isn't an option because my mom monitors the garage door opener and the surveillance camera at home. And whenever my mom reads a news article about a driver hitting a pedestrian near the city I live in or about child abduction somewhere in United States, my mom then explains ""that's why don't walk home"". But most of the time when my mom shows an article about a pedestrian injury, it almost always was at a major road (and I don't need to cross any to walk home). My dad seems fine with my walking home, but my mom doesn't so my dad is just agreeing with my mom.

Now that coronavirus cases are increasing in Illinois, there's this thing that I don't understand about my mom. I want to go to my friend's birthday hangout (it's at his house), but my mom doesn't want me to go due to coronavirus. She keeps bringing up the fact that my school district has canceled almost all extracurricular activities and will likely be temporarily closing soon, but I don't get why going to my friend's hangout is a risk of contracting coronavirus. But I secretly think my mom is just using a very poorly made up excuse for me to not go to avoid use drugs and alcohol and dumb teenager activities (such as dumbass dangerous social media challenges), which my friends and I don't ever.

Until I was 13, my mom really didn't want me to go to public bathrooms by myself. Up until I was 9, I had to go to the women's restroom if my dad wasn't with us, but then I was too old to go to the women's restroom. But then after that, my mom wouldn't let me go to public restrooms by myself when my dad isn't here to come with me because she's worried about child rape. So she tells me to hold it unless I need to go. My dad was fine with me going to public restrooms by myself though. But until i was 13, I was able to convince my mom to let me go to public restrooms by myself.

62,"About two weeks ago, my mother in law (age 69, lives in Florida) was diagnosed with stage 1 bladder cancer. The current plan is for her to have a radical cystectomy (bladder removal) to prevent further spread; that surgery has about a 1 - 8% fatality rate (depending on the study). The cancer itself has a decent 5-year survival rate, but apparently bladder cancer is sometimes under staged; my mother-in-law has a PET scan scheduled for next week which should tell us whether the cancer has spread beyond the bladder, and crucially whether it has spread to the lymph nodes. 

As soon as we heard about the diagnosis, my wife and I (who live in Texas) scheduled a flight to visit my in-laws over spring break (wife and I are both professors and are lucky to have the week of). This week is also when the PET scan will occur as well as the first meeting with the oncologist, so we were especially eager to be present for those events. 

However, as fears related to the coronavirus increase, we're having second thoughts about the trip, and are currently leaning away from going. To be clear, we aren't worried for our own safety; we're in our mid-30's and pretty healthy, so we'd likely emerge from an scrape with covid-19 relatively unscathed (knock-on-wood). My wife and I live in a part of Texas that has not yet had any confirmed cases of the coronavirus. But we are worried that we might pick up the virus in an airport (flying through Dallas and Tampa, which have both had confirmed cases) and introduce the virus to my in-laws, or that we might bring it back with us. The in-laws also live in a retirement community, so although we'd try to stay isolated while there, there is some risk that we could introduce it to the community. Plus, we'd be going to a cancer center, which is obviously full of high-risk individuals. Plus it could be that if we just wait a or month or so things will have settled down and it will be safer to visit. 

On the other hand, I'm sure many other people will be flying to Florida and going to cancer centers or visiting relatives in retirement communities, so I'm not sure how much additional risk we'd be introducing. And while things might get better in a few weeks, they could also get worse. What if in a month all domestic flights are cancelled, and we can't even get out to see her? I don't like to think of it in these terms, but I don't want to miss our chance to see my mother-in-law before she dies if things take a turn for the worse. 

Do we have a civic duty to avoid travel at this point? Is the risk we pose to the in-laws not worth the support a visit might provide (to us and them)? Or is this a special enough case that it's worth the risk to see her?

The rest of the classes were OK at best, and at worst I despised them. I can reapply to the university 12 months after i'm kicked, but I don't enjoy it here. When I was first picking which university to go to, the other university that accepted me was my first option, but my dad pushed me to go the one i'm at now.

My interests (paleontology, history, archaeology, zoology, environmental science) have either no job security or don't pay well (I live in Canada), which is very important to me. The result of my failure is that I cannot transfer to the university until I fix my GPA, which I cannot START trying until fall of 2021 (assuming I get accepted).

Simply put, I get way too self-conscious about the fact that I'm single. For one thing, I'm way too young to really be worried about that (19M), and this really shouldn't be constantly nagging at me. 

It's not even like everyone around me is in a relationship. Most of my friends, in fact, are also single, but they don't care about it nearly as much as I do. 

I find it hard to describe how it makes me feel, but I've found that the closest I can get is by saying I feel a longing. Like there's some kind of warmth I'm missing.

It gets me down randomly out of nowhere. Sometimes I'll be hanging out with friends and it'll suddenly just jump in my head. 

I've told some of my friends about this and they have told me that it's dumb and it's really not that big of a deal, and I agree but it still gets in my head.

I asked my mom can she order me something only and she said it was too expensive, but she bought my siblings ps4's, tv's which was over $1,500. They needed those things anyway, but I can't get something that's only $800.",13Mar2020,1
78,"I'm 16M now and I'm really starting to get worried about life as a whole. Everytime I think about my childhood and all the good memories I feel like life as an adult might not be worth it. Why would I want to be an adult? There's no point on working every single day and doing things you hate every single day until you get old and retired and can't enjoy life anymore. 

During childhood we have nothing but time, teenage is the transition where we have a little bit of each, adulthood we have everything but time to enjoy things and on elderly we have great economic conditions and a lot of time but don't have the same energy to enjoy it.

My conclusion is that childhood is the best part of our lives and the rest of it is just not worth the effort.

I know I'm probably going to change my mind as the time goes by (and I hope so) but that's what I think by now.",13Mar2020,1
79,"I work part time at a dollar store in Canada and interact with tons of customers

The only physical interactions are our hands touching once in a while, and them giving me their items/money

The situation in Canada isn't too bad but it still worries me. I'm not worried for my health, I'm a healthy 17 year old and have no doubt I can get through it, but I live with my 84 year old grand mother which has cancer, and my 62 year old dad with diabetes 

I wash my hands as much as possible, and do not touch my face at all.

Quite honestly, I won't be able to live with myself knowing I infected either my grand mother or father and something bad happening to them

87,"Sorry guys I'm a brand new home owner so this stuff is making me panick and I'd just like some advice or reassurance from you guys who have been through this before.

So the first issue I noticed was that my sink was not draining. I ran the garbage disposale and it slowly went down after like 5 minutes. I thought that fixed the issue but when I ran my dishwasher it drained back into the sinks. It isn't even close to overflowing but I still can't run water in my sink for too long. I undid the fixtures under the sink and didn't find any visible blockage. In fact everything was crystal clear, they had recently been replaced. So I just contacted a plumbing service and am thinking something is wrong with my garbage disposal.

Second issue I noticed was when I went to the bathroom I noticed my tub had rusty pipe particles in it. And there was some stagnant water sitting inside the drain. I ran the tub and it drained perfectly fine. I sort of panicked and thought the sink drained into the tub, but then I remembered doing laundry while all of this was going down. So I believe my washer drained into my bathtub, causing it to back up..

My bathroom sink works fine and is clean and so is my only toilet. 

I live in Minnesota and recently all our snow melted if that is of any importance. I contacted 2 other plumbers and am waiting for them to get back to me in the morning. But my mind is racing and I'm worried that this is a sign of a bigger issue.. I have only been living here for 5 days.. so I'm sort of shook.

You might say, I'm sure that's not it, you're applying for the wrong jobs, your CV needs work - that's all! But I've covered all my bases, my CV is fine, it gets interviews. I apply for relatively suitable roles for me, a student. I'm not that awkward that minimum wage jobs wouldn't take me. But I know how people look at me. Like, oh wow, that's cute that you're even trying. But no, of course we're not gonna hire you. 

I'm going to be transferring to a more 'face-centric' degree next year. Like you're in the limelight, you're in photos and videos. My work (on literal paper) is praised as talented, that my future is super promising, but I don't think I want to immortalise myself as what I look like now forevermore, professionally. People on my course won't have known what I looked like before, so this would be a great time to get it done. 

I'm insulted for my nose straight up sometimes too. I feel like people find it more offensive because I'm not a man, I'm supposed to be pretty. 

My nose has a deviated septum and it really shows. It's been causing me sinus issues, and it's SUPER long as well. Like, when I see people complain about their noses being big, mine's like at least a third longer. It warps the rest of my face with its pull. I'm not delusional lol. 

I'm not rich, and what family I have cannot afford to help me on this. I have some money because of student financial help that I've set aside, but I need like double to do what I need to do (septoplasty and rhinoplasty). I don't think I can (or want to) take out a loan for this. 

I just feel so desperate. The summer break keeps getting nearer and I still haven't been able to find a job.

I’m currently on spring break now so it’s very exciting, yet scary at the same time. However, one of my professors emailed us instructing that on Tuesday she will be hosting a video conference class during the time we would have been in regular class. She also mentioned how she might hold a video conference on Thursday of next week as well because that’s also when we normally have this class scheduled. She said she wants to prepare us for a quiz when we return (classes resume March 23) and just wants to keep the lecture going so we don’t “fall behind” this semester.

However my other professors aren’t doing this, so I feel as though it’s unfair that she’s continuing to hold class online even though my other classes aren’t. Besides, I feel like attendance shouldn’t be required because classes for the entire campus are cancelled next week. Also, she makes it very clear if we miss her class we loose points on our overall grade (yeah she’s a hardo). 

So should I call my school tomorrow and let them know what’s going on? Or is she allowed to do this?

120,"(This is a throwaway account since a few people irl know my primary username, but DON'T know how much of a loser I actually am)

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to get my life started, 3 years after receiving a marketing degree (2016).

  
I have held a couple short-term jobs since graduation, but each lasted for less than 4 months. First one was a payroll position at a Biotech company, which I was laid off from after a few months (amicable reasons). This left me depressed and on top of it, my parents were in the middle of a bitter divorce and I had to move in with my mom to help her through things. My next job was Costco during the following summer, which I quit after being recruited by a local police department. Unfortunately, I failed the psych test (thanks, depression), which was the final step before academy. So here I was, unemployed again. I went the next whole year jobless and then re-applied for the same police department after the 1-year re-admit wait period. Well, yeah....same result as first time. I'm too depressed to be a police officer... 

&amp;#x200B;

ANYWAYS I'm here now, still unemployed and now 25 with little job experience on my resume, and a degree that has gone unused for 3 years. I'm not married to the ideas of marketing or pursuing police again, but I just need a direction. Scanning indeed everyday and shotgunning my desert of a resumé to any sort of company has gotten me nowhere, and **I desperately need some advice on possible routes to pursue,** given the situation I've let myself fall into. 

Options I am aware of, but am unsure about:

1. Going back to school for another degree(I don't know for what... WHAT COLOR IS MY GODDAMN PARACHUTE?!)
2. Career coach/ temp agency (What companies would take me though...)
3. Grad school? 3.0 GPA in undergrad seems to be limiting

&amp;#x200B;

***Interests:***

1. **Fitness:** Though I am an unemployed loser, I am a decently fit unemployed loser. It's one of the few positive things that I've kept consistent with since college. Physical therapist seems out of reach, and personal trainer does not look like a viable option (self-starter kind of career with a lot of uncertainty).
2. **Law enforcement:** If I could somehow apply to other departments, then I would. But agencies share information and that bodes poorly for me, not to mention I still have such little experience... What draws me to this option are the job security and opportunities for advancement, and I know I would make a good cop (we need more of those!).
3. **Teaching:** I've considered pursuing a credential/substitute teaching high school and have passed the preliminary examination for my state, but all districts require 3 letters of recommendation and will look at experience (or lack of). I have no idea who I could go to for the letters of rec. As far as becoming a community college or college professor, I think I am too deep in my hole to attain such titles.

I know it might be a bad idea to be licking on inanimate objects during a time of crisis, but can I help myself. Would it be okay if I get at least 1 lick in or should I try to show some restraint and just leave my friend’s place?",13Mar2020,1

Due to the growing anxiety caused by the coronavirus, I cannot simply tell my grandma that I'm not visiting her because I'm sick.

125,"ok so my life currently is kinda shit in a self inflicted way. I mostly just sit in bed and occasionally play video games with my people i wish i knew in real life. Ive never been into the ""lets meet up and and study or go do wholesome activity"" type friend groups unfortunately i usually only meet up to smoke weed with people i like but also don't trust because they've robbed me before and aren't really like me, like they look out for me and (sometimes) share with me but they know i'm not like them and i just want wholesome stoner friends and a thicc stoner gf. These things are probably obtainable for me (emphasis on probably) but i'm the least pro active person i know, i have a school attendance of no higher than 40%, I wait for people to message/talk to me resulting in very poor social skills and due to all of these things i come off as weird and quiet. I want to be pro active but fuck that i'm comfortable as is and i have to go out of my comfort zone to get what i want so why not stay a sad but comfortable low life.

126,"I have a friend that ive known for almost 2 years now. shes like a sister to me in some ways and even though ive known people much longer than her i feel like we have a stronger bond as friends then ive ever had in my life. but sometimes she can be very.... sexual? i dont know how to describe it ill give you a couple instances.

she constantly send pics to her male friends that accent her boobs and whatnot even though she knows she would never date them. she told me that she once got in trouble for sending nude to some guy she met online posing as 'offenderman' a guy from a fandom she likes and he promised to make her his proxy if she sent him the pics (she's a teen and hes was like 31). shes not stupid she knew he wasnt real then did it anyway. and she tells the story to people acting like shes proud of it? 

one time when we had a sleepover we were lying in my bed and she asked if i wanted to fuck. i said no and decided to sleep on the couch since it made me feel really uncomfortable and she insisted it was a joke after i replied but im 99% we wouldve screwed eachother that night if i said yes    ( im a girl btw. im also lesbian so that wasnt the problem i just saw her as more of a sister) she also identifies as poly but im pretty sure she just uses it as an excuse to date alot of people and not get judged.  

let me explain since it sounds kinda mean. poly is when more then one person is in a relationship and there cool with it ( there all dating eachother or know about eachother kinda thing ) but she has like 5 boyfriends/girlfriends and some of them dont even know the others exist. ive been thinking over all of it and i dont know if i should be friends with her anymore. but im afraid that im just being a jerk and her lifestyle choices arent my buisness and dont effect me?

129,"TW: rape, child abuse/sexual abuse?

Throwaway acc for obvious reasons. 

I seem to have somehow “unlocked” so to speak some memories of doing sexual acts with another girl when I was younger. There are 2 occasions which I’ve always had vivid memories of, the first time and the time I suspect we did stuff for the longest. As of late I’ve been having really stressful nightmares that I wake up from, about being raped by another girl. Thinking’s about these dreams I’ve been thinking more and more about what happened when I was 6-8, something I haven’t thought about for the 10 years it hasn’t happened. 

I was 6 and she was 8 and it was a “game” that now I can only assume she had unfortunately played with someone else, probably an adult. 
I never did anything to her, I was just confused but it felt good. I remember feeling really guilty after we had done it and I knew I couldn’t tell anyone or I would apparently get into trouble. This carried on for about 2 years, and only recently I have realised what effects it’s had on me (I’m now 18), it also had made me feel really weird about my kinks, I feel like I’ve always been into ddlg which was introduced to me through fanfic when I was younger, but maybe I’m into it because I was sexually pleasured as a child?

The advice that Im asking for is,
Is this a thing/has it happened to others?
Does this seem like a type of sexual abuse?
Could this be the reason I’m having really bad nightmares?
I’ve also totally lost my sex drive since these nightmares have started, (I have male long term partner who I love and we’ve always had great sex) sex is more stressful than pleasurable now as all I can think about is feeling trapped and out of control. 
Does it make sense that something that happened when I was way younger has come back up now?

I’m so confused and idk where to go from here, maybe I’ll go see somone to work through it, but at the same time, we were just kids so it seems pretty harmless when I rationalise.",13Mar2020,1

But overall business was increasing and even in the slow months, we were steady. With my projections we were supposed to start being profitable end of april. Now, due to the cornavirus, the business has all but tanked in a matter of a few days. $1000 days have turned into $100 days and I cant afford to keep my staff.

135,"I've been working at a snake breeding facility for 2 years. In this time I've only received 1 raise and then I found out everyone got that raise a month later. The thing is, I do so much more than everyone else. I am the data collector, I manage all 500+ babies (we've had over 2,000 at a time), I'm the only one who knows how to use the database and I've been there the longest. I'm getting paid $10 an hour and am scheduled for ~25 hours a week because of school. This has been fine, I've been making it by, but recently my boss keeps cutting my hours. He'll have others do my usual duties when I'm not there and then I'll get the cut and be sent home early or be given a day off. It's cool and all except I can't afford to pay my rent lol. 

Ive tried talking to him about either a raise or more hours. When I asked them for a raise a year ago it was demoralizing. I never want to ask for one again they made me feel so bad. They laughed in my face and told me I'm not supposed to ask and that I'm rude for asking and should know better. They said I have to earn it, which I get but this discussion happened at the same time they were asking me to work full time in the summer (6am-6pm every single week day + Sundays). Then today I was trying to tell him I needed my hours this week (he made me take tomorrow off) he said he hired too many people and I have nothing to do tomorrow so to just take the day off because he can't afford to pay me too. 

I feel like this is a slap in the face. I've done a lot for them. I'd leave school early to help, I have given up my Sundays to them to help when no one else would and they just cut my hours. I can't afford my bills. I made $150 this week and it'll be gone by Monday. Usually I make $250 a week and that's fine. I work part time right now because of school, but they just keep sending me home early so most weeks I miss out on anywhere from $50-100. I don't have a wealthy family to help me pay rent and I don't have time for a second job. 

Despite all this, I'm scared to leave. I'm comfortable there. I like my bosses, they're like family to me, and I desperately need their recommendation on my resume for future jobs in my field. They think I'm going to work there all through college. I want to talk to them about it, but am afraid I'll be guilted into staying. Honestly, I do want to move on to different opportunities, I'm just scared. They are flexible with my schedule and I appreciate what they do. I just can't afford to live like this.

153,"Long story.... but I really need advice so thanks in advance to anyone who reads this all! 

My parents, still married, still living together, have been in separate rooms for about 10 years. My mum  who has both physical and mental disabilities has been asking him to move out for around 2 years.
I am almost 30, and they have two more children together aged 9 &amp; 10. (Very strange sito, I know).

Recently my mum has informed me that she allegedly found evidence on my dad's iPad that he had been searching not so savoury things into YouTube that lean towards him looking at child porn I.e 8 yr old with breast implants, teens having sex etc... she has told me that she screenshot the search history but I haven't seen them myself yet. She told his boss at work in regards to him smoking weed and apparently looking at porn on his lunch breaks and then kicked him out. She spent about 3 weeks 'preparing' for this moment, she said she needed to gather evidence... however when she kicked him out, she did not bring up any 'child porn' there were other issues between them aswell. Weed, spending excess money etc..  

She has now gone to the police with this information. I spoke to my dad for the first time last night since this has happened and he admitted to me that he smokes weed but said he doesn't even look at regular porn, let alone child porn. His main concern with the whole ordeal is that he didn't want the kids to be left with my mum because he is worried about her mental health. My dad seems to believe that she may have taken these screen shots herself or found them online... I have a really messy relationship with my Mum... and we're estranged up until about 6 months ago... because I 'didn't call her enough' and then when we did reconnect she accused me of stealing her prescriptions from her house (definitely did not do this). All through out this my dad still spoke to me and has never faltered in his support for me. 

I am finding it incredibly difficult to believe my Mum as she is not willing to share these 'screenshots' &amp; has recently came off of Xeroquil and other anti-psychotic meds... She's a very smart woman and very tech savvy aswell. Also the fact that their first 4 kids out of 5 were girls, 3 of which are now over the age of 25 can confidently say that we have never had any issues or concerns about my dad being a predator. 

I don't know what to do, I feel like I'm stuck in the middle. I know someone is lying and I feel like I'm going fucking crazy. I don't want to call my mum out, in case there is a chance that she is telling the truth and I end up being a horrible person not supporting her through this time... but I am lost.",13Mar2020,1

I have a job that doesn’t pay amazingly, but is career oriented and part of my stepping stones up the ladder. I have a very clear end goal. My boyfriend moved out to XXX with me for my job and got a minimum wage job to hold him over while he pursued his career.. over a year ago. Before that he had another minimum wage job while he was “taking a break to enjoy life after college”. He’s never really had much more than a minimum wage job. I ask him what he wants to do and he has no idea. I have been begging him to look for better jobs for 6/7 months now. He hasn’t even drafted a resume. He gets very defensive when I try to tell him I want to have money to raise a nice family and says it comes off as condescending. In no way do I need to be rich in a mansion, but I also want to be very financially stable before I have children so I can set a good example for my children. If he seems so unmotivated in his early 20s to find a career, am I wasting my time and setting myself up for failure?

Hi reddit I need a different perspective on a matter, I will try to be brief.

One day I was kidding around with my SO, then she made a sexuall suggestive comment about a guy.

At the time of making that comment/joke, I didn't know the guy I didn't know they had slept together.

So weeks later I find out she slept with the guy. But when I asked her about it she agreed that she did sleep with him.however she says she did not consent to it

Mind you that she gave him oral sex that she says was pressured into doing it, because he repeatedly asked her.and weighed her with his repeated request 

And then she ended up sleeping with him

I'm probably not making sense my head is all over the place, I just don't believe her when she says that she never wanted to sleep with him.

Because mainly she joked about him, when I had no idea who he was.

Tl:DR Girlfriend joked about a guy she slept with, denies giving consent",13Mar2020,1

I’ve been doing this for only 6-7 months and it’s really getting to me. When I’m on days I barely get to see my family for all of an hour or so each day, and even when I’m on days off, I don’t want to do anything other than sleep and play video games because I feel so dead and worn out. I just want to know if I should take the pay cut and live check to check on the off chance I could be more happy, or continue working like this for the sake of my family, having some extra money, and having that disposable income, while also guaranteeing I’m not going to be truly happy for as long as life is this way.",13Mar2020,1
171,"I’m not sure if this is the right subreddit but here goes. For years, I can think back to being as young as 10 (I’m 27 now), I’ve been getting this nasty stomach ache about an hour after consuming spicy food of some kind. There’s only certain foods that do this. Less than a week ago my Uncle served some Nasi Goreng from the fresh ready meals at a supermarket. As always, about an hour later I start getting a stomach ache that makes me feel sick sick and the need to try and inhale air to burp out some of the gassy feeling in my stomach. Anyway, this lasts for hours and the only thing to rid it is time or sleeping it off. It kind of annoys people when they’re cooking for me and I say can’t eat spicy food as im obviously being vague as Im not sure exactly what causes it. Once I have the stomach ache they never sympathise when I say I get it because of something I’ve eaten with spice in. So many people respond with ‘you just need to have a shit’ - but I don’t feel like shitting, I just feel sick and my stomach hurts.

 I like spicy food, sometimes I can eat spicy foods and be fine. If i go out to a restaurant then drinks with my friends, it just ruins the night as I feel crap.

Some foods that have caused it:

Nasi Gorgeng

Chilli

Spaghetti bolognese

Chilli based pizza

Nandos piri anything - even the salt :(

A southern fired chicken pot noodle

Theres so many more I just can’t remember!

I took 2 antacids after the Nasi Goreng last week and it didn’t do anything. So I don’t think its heartburn?

What could this be? I’ve just let it happen for years but if i can avoid this stomach ache and still enjoy spicy food then I wanna give it a go! Also want to make sure this isn't something more serious!",13Mar2020,1

176,"I usually do not spend time on this subreddit here, but I am curious if I am in the complete wrong. I even talked to them about it, like telling them that I am not ""mad"" at them it was all for jokes. All they do is get defensive about it. I'll admit it, I could get angry at times, but that is because no matter how much I explained to them it was all harmless jokes, they would say stuff like ""well look at yourself first"" or ""stop being so angry all the time,"" when all I am doing is trying to play along with it (maybe it is a coping mechanism idk). Maybe I am not funny or what, but I usually end up blaming myself for everything that I have done. It is not a good feeling for some reason (I know when I joke around that it goes too far, that is on me and should only be on me), but harmless jokes to them also kills the mood. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is my sister and my mother, no matter what I explain the context to my father (who is usually on webcam because he works overseas), he goes to their defense first. I dunno I kind of feel hopeless expressing my feelings towards them, of course I could get angry at first, but then I reflect, lately though I feel sadness and depression. I hate seeing my family look at me and cry, because all they would do is get angry at me. Is it normal to feel like you are gonna cry in these situations because all I have been feeling is guilt and dissapointment in myself. I always feel like they would rather not have me at the table for dinner than anything else. 

&amp;#x200B;

For example, today my mom told me about some superstition that you should have not been doing like putting my arm with my face resting on the palms of my hand. She said it was bad luck, my sister even acknowledged it too. I did not feel the slightest bit of anger, so I joked around with them, ""oh the phone should not be allowed on the table at all costs"" in the most mellow way possible. My mom and my sister got defensive about it, specifically my sister saying, ""well look at yourself first."" I dunno what she means by that, I was curious and asked her, ""what do you mean?"" My mom took offense to that and said, ""why are you so angry about it?"" My sister agreed with her, now I have gotten a little annoyed, not angry, just irritated because they never told me. All I wanted was an answer, but I end up with all these half-assed answers from my family. I told them I am sorry about everything, geniunely blamed myself for the joke even though I never talked down on anyone. During my explanation my father on the phone, got pissy about it, saying ""what the hell have you done?"" I tried explaining to him, hoping to get some kind of resolution, but I end up as the blame on the end of stick. 

&amp;#x200B;

In fact now I think about it, I never had talked down to my sister, my mother, or my father about their looks or appearance. To me that is a line that I will never cross, but for them it was ok. So I just ""roll with the punches"" I guess. As of right now, I kinda don't want to talk them because I feel hurt, but I could only take so much of it.

180,"My roommate works in the same position as me and just went into an interview for the same promotion. For, what could be an awful scenario, we supported each other. However, as much as I praise the work that she does, she has low self esteem and thinks everyone in our department does not like her. So much, that it is almost a self-fulfilling prophesy. We work from home, so when we do go to the office, she sticks to herself and then comes and filters through every interaction she had. 

Today was her interview and she called me crying because our head of our department told her that, although she has been working hard for it, he thinks she needs more growth for the role and her interactions with her peers has hampered it. We then proceeded to have an insanely busy day at work and she progressively became more dismissive of the job. She said no one cared about her, exaggerating every interaction, and became more maniac. At some point she threw her keyboard and a glass across the room, and started sobbing. 

I think part of it is self esteem, part is not feeling appreciated, and part is not being able to take constructive criticism. However, I don't know how to talk to her or help her. When I do, it comes back to me being better than her in every way which I am not. I don't think this is a natural response but who am I to say?

We'll then have at least 1 week of classes being online, and I need to figure out how I'm going to offer tutoring online because I'm a tutor for the biology department. It feels selfish, but I'm pretty upset about my senior year being changed in an unexpected way. I just want to see my friends and classmates and professors on campus like normal. I have friends at other schools who now have their entire semester online and had to say goodbye to everyone early. I just want to be able to say goodbye before we all graduate. 

I also didn't get into grad school. I'm unsure why. I have a 3.8 GPA and am a TA. I'm also a tutor. I've judged and moderated science fairs. I do research. I can't think of what makes me not good enough so those programs wouldn't want me. And, though I've applied to jobs, I'm just unsure what I want to do beyond grad school. 

I have OCD and this week has been really bad. The idea of getting others sick or that I'm contaminated  is killing me. I love a lot of people who are immunocompromised. I've stopped following the news due to a feeling of impending doom. And I don't even get the reassurance of having my normal academic schedule as some sort of constant in my life. 

And this is what feels the silliest, but ice hockey means a lot to me. I got into it when my dad took me to a game during high school and I fell in love. I never played because we never really lived anywhere with youth teams and, when we did, it's so expensive to play. We could never afford it. But I watched it all the time and spent so much time pouring over the numbers. I love it. The Carolina Hurricanes have helped me through a friend's suicide, moving to a new state where I had no friends, starting college, waiting for a diagnosis for health problems that cause me a lot of pain, my great grandfather's death, my grandfather's health problems, and my first real breakup which felt like the end of the world at the time it happened. And the season has been postponed, so I don't have that right now. I could really use the 'Canes right now.

185,"Backstory: Grandma (used to do drugs and partied hard) is 63 now.. has two hip replacements, a shoulder replacement, Hep (not sure which one), COPD, Renal failure, MRCA in her bones, cirrhosis of the liver, she has seizures (which didn't begin until she was struck in the head with a baseball at one of her grandkids games, had to be airlifted to San Diego) and IMO early onset dementia or something.
 
She has been in and out of hospitals, and nursing homes for the last year and a half or so. Since her hip and shoulder replacement she has also become addicted to pain medicine. Her husband is the second in command at the ag facility he works at (it's  chemical mixing for fertilizer), and is trying to wait to retire. My fiance (their grandson) also works there. So for a long time now it's just been me (and her granddaughter for a little while, she now has a newborn) taking care of grandma. 

She was told that if she wanted to be put on the list for a transplant (kidney) she would have to quit smoking. She refused to quit smoking. So obviously she can't have the transplant. Since then a lot has happened. There are a lot of times where she looses her mind and begins to strip naked in front of her grandkids and screams for her dead parents. She has turned into this weird hedonistic person, she constantly craves sweets and candy. She often forgets things, and will sometimes need you to repeat a sentence more than once because she has already forgotten. Recently she has started to lose her hearing. She falls often, she tries to do things that she thinks she can still do but really she can't because she's not strong enough to hold her body up. Let alone bend over and pick up her lighter. 

She constantly screams that she's in pain everyday all-day, but we can't give her more meds. She does things and tries to go to the hospital so that they will give her meds. She tries to tell everyone that we are mean to her and don't treat her right. When in all reality, I've cleaned up her blood/poop/pee/vomit, she's coughed in my face, spat in my face. And I still am here.

When things get ready bad for her she tells me she just wants to die.  And when she gets into one of her loopy states, where sometimes she undresses, she will just scream and cry at the top of her lungs and wants to die. She talks to her dead parents a lot. She has coded probably around four or five times. Sometimes we think that she has one foot on this side and one foot on the other side. We just don't understand what is keeping her here. I feel bad saying this but our lives would be much better if she would just let go.. we've all been stuck in the exact same situation for 6 years literally because of her.

I did this because I was scared of her cheating or something which is stupid because shes a really good woman and would never do that.

195," 

had to make a throw away account to talk about this. Also, before I start, I want to make one thing clear. No, I will not be giving pictures or videos of me or my sister to anyone that asks.

We're both 25 year old bi girls. I'm a few months older than her. So our parents got married about 10 years ago, but ended up getting divorced like 3 years later. Even though we didn't really like each other at first. While they were dating, my mom and I moved in with her and her dad, so I had to switch schools. After a bit, we ended up becoming really good friends, and stayed in touch when our parents got divorced around the time we graduated High School. It helped that we went to the same college. I think it was at this point that I kinda got a crush on her. We're both Bi.

Neither of us ended up staying close with our parents. I ended up having to drop out for financial reasons, and just kept living with girlfriends that I didn't stay with for longer than 6 months. She ended up getting into a relationship with a guy she met at school. He seemed really nice at first, and I just told myself that if they're happy together, that's all that matters. But he actually ended up being a humongous asshole. He would easily get jealous of her whenever she'd hang out with friends, especially me, and tried to control everything about her. It had a terrible effect on our relationship, and we went months with out seeing or contacting each other. About 6 months ago, I tried to reach out to her. I knew her favorite band was having a show at town a few weeks later, and I bought tickets for us, and even for her douche boyfriend. Naturally, he ended up getting super territorial. This ended up causing a big argument, and he kicked her out of their apartment. She stayed with some of our friends.

Eventually, she ended up moving in with me in my one bedroom apartment that I can barley afford. She just crashed on my couch. She was about to get her own place, but after we went to that concert, we talked about finding a two bedroom apartment for us when my lease ends. And I'll be honest, her living with me has only made me fall for her more. We almost immediately went back to how we were before she started dating him. There were a few times when she really wanted to talk to him, usually when she was drunk. And I had to convince her not to. She's fine now, and has been on a few dates. Unfortunately for her, and a bit fortunate for me, none of them really went anywhere.

The reason I posted this now is because I'm starting to go a bit stir crazy. The other day, I was doing our laundry, and ended up touching myself while smelling one of her shirts. Besides the entire step-sister thing, I didn't try to pursue anything for two reasons. The first, because I didn't want to just take advantage of her when she was vulnerable after a bad break up. And also because I'm terrified of ruining our friendship. I just got her back in my life not that long ago, and I'm terrified of loosing it. But I'm being less and less subtle about how I feel. My birthday''s in a few days. Yesterday she asked me what I wanted, and without even thanking, I said, ""I want you to sit on my face."" She thought I was joking, even though I'm not. And I'm terrified that I'm not going to able to keep my secret from her any longer. She's the kindest person I know. I could get lost in her eyes for days, and just knowing she's in my life can pull me out of the deepest depression. And I don't want to loose her.

I didn't realize how long this post would be, so I want to thank anyone. Once again, not sharing any pictures or videos of us.",13Mar2020,1

He said personality wise I’m more like a best friend to him. I didn’t wanna lose him completely so I let him touch me and stuff so he could stay.

However, i don’t think he’d remain loyal and I’m feeling used just for my body. This week has been so confusing.

Should I continue this? I’m the one that suggested we should have a fwb vibe but I don’t wanna see him with other girls.

This past week has been hell. 
A few days ago she attempted suicide, her friends and my mum found her she had taken a lot of night cold and flu tablets and wanted to sleep and not wake up. I told her I'd call an ambulance but she refused that. I gave her the option of letting us help her and she talk to us about what's going on or id call them and so she has started speaking up about her worries. 

Then today she is telling me her ex partner is threatening her and saying he will light her car on fire and a bunch of other violent threats. He has been physically violent to her in the past so I am really worried for her safety. I told her to go to the police and she refused. I told her to pack a bag and come stay at my house and she refused saying he would come here and she doesn't want me and my daughter in danger. I told her to park her car at mine so he can't do anything to it she refused. I told her she could get an AVO or DVO, she refused saying he would still hurt her. Her two daughters are at there dads this weekend so they are of no worry at the moment for concern but she has even said she is in fear of her ex because if he doesn't do it this weekend he may come any day and hurt her or do the things he has threatened to do. Which then puts both her and her children in danger.

I didn’t Text her at all after that, but I use to see her in university and say hi and start a short conversation and that is it 
Today I saw her and she engaged a conversation and tried to kiss her and she refused it ( I tried to test if she was really weird or not)
But I have noticed she was weird ready on Tuesday

202,"I'll try to keep this shorter and to the point.

I'm renting a room from and living with my landlord (don't do this). He occupies the upstairs, which has a large bedroom and living room, while I have a smaller room on the main floor, which also has a living room. Pretty often in the evening my landlord will occupy the living room on the main floor until about midnight, just laying on the couch on his phone. Some nights I will hang out there with him but lately I've been doing that less because to be honest I'm just uncomfortable when I do. Among other reasons, there's a bit of an age gap - I'm 24 and he's in his 30s. There's another roommate around my age who avoids hanging out in the living room too. I'm reluctant to say something to my landlord about hogging the living room when he has his own because, after all, it's a common space and ultimately his house. I also think he's the type that would take it very personally. What would you do in my situation? Thank you!",13Mar2020,1

207,"I'm 17 and a Junior in high school. I have had a crush on a girl, let's call her Dee. I met Dee in 8th grade and always liked her, but she was out of my league and I had no balls. My sophomore year I met a freshman guy who I'll call Sam. Me and Sam hit it off and we have been best friends since we met. We're both theater and robotics kids, so we're dorky to say the least. We also happen to be incredibly, and I mean incredibly, similar. Which is why it sucks that...

Halfway through my Junior year Dee asked out Sam out of the blue. Dee is incredibly popular so he was shocked, but of course said yes. So now they just recently had their three month anniversary and it is hell to be around. Me and Sam have spent practically every day together since we met, and now I rarely see him. When I do see him, he's talking to Dee. When we go out in groups, they only talk to eachother. They are both really happy together but being near them rips my heart out. I'm often alone at school since Sam is my only buddy but drops me at the drop of a hat when Dee arrives. The fact that me and Sam are so similar we are often asked if we are siblings is the nail in the coffin. If she likes guys like Sam, then she might have liked me had I had more balls.

So there it is. I feel like I've lost both a friend and a potential girlfriend in the blink of an eye. Sam knows I liked Dee but if I bring up being excluded he will think I am jealous. I dont know what to do and i have no one to talk to, because my mom is sickly and my sister is depressed, and I don't want to burden my family with anymore troubles.

208,"I (21F) have a (male) friend in college who seems quite attached to me. 

Here are some of the things he's said. (My responses in parentheses) 

*You should take one class at 9 and the other at 4.* (Why?) *So I can spend all of that time with you.* 

\[via text\] *I love you / I love you so much / Just wanted to say I love ya a lot and am very grateful for you* (I responded to all of these by skirting around his words and saying something very blase back)

*I just finished sobbing* (Why?) *I don't know if I'll see you again* \[because of covid19, uni cutting off early, and him possibly transferring\] (I responded by telling him don't be silly)

*If you were by my side 24/7, I would never have tried to transfer*

He's also Skype-introduced me to his brother, telling him I'm the only ""woke"" person on campus. He has also often tried to catch me alone, but I always slide out of those situations. He once invited me to sit with him in a super hidden study room in the university, and then when we began talking, he closed the door. I told him I had to leave and left. He has told me about girls he's fallen in love with before, and about his failed romantic pursuits. 

We go to an elite school and we are both minorities. 

Anyways. You get the idea. He's a dear, dear friend but sometimes I wonder if he entertains romantic notions towards me? Or is this how platonic male-female relationships work (unsolicited I love you's and all)? I have very little experience in this regard and would appreciate any thoughts.

context: parents have been fighting for most of my life, few years ago they decided to live separately. still not officially divorced. my dad’s side (including him) seems ok with my mom, even displaying concern for her or complimenting her, but she despises them. i don’t know exactly what went down, but from what she says it sounds like they were literal demons to her.

she constantly makes comments like “oh, you’re just like your dad” or “must be from your dad’s side”. anytime i go out somewhere she assumes it’s with my dad and his “girlfriend”— there isn’t one, as i’ve tried to explain, but she refuses to listen. anytime i disagree with her about anything she always says “i know i’m not your real family, it’s ok” or something along those lines. it never stops and happens every time i see her. she does try to “make it up” by buying me something or giving me food, but the cycle never ends. 

just now, i mentioned that my grandpa had heard that there might be a coronavirus case where my mom’s mom works and was concerned for her. immediately she decides to say “i’m sure you guys are all glad to hear that, you want me to die”. everytime she makes these stupid comments i feel sick and i don’t want to deal with this anymore.",13Mar2020,1

219,"As the title says. The blackmailer has both explicit photos of me and a list of all my followers. They have sent me proof of both. They say that if I don’t pay them they will send the photos to all my followers.

I’m a minor myself, but I think this blackmailer is a minor too, if not then pretty young. The ransom they asked for was a 50 dollar Amazon gift card. Obviously I’m not going to pay, but what do I do? Since I have seen proof of what they have, I know they are not just making baseless threats.

I have both an Instagram and Snapchat account from them, but obviously they are fake ones. There is no way to contact Snapchat directly, but I have contacted Instagram. What I’m afriad of is that even if their accounts get deleted, then they can just make a new one and send the photos to my followers, since they already know my followers.

I have contacted a cyber blackmail company, but they haven’t reached out to me yet. But even if they can track down the blackmailer, they can’t delete something the blackmailer has saved on their phone. And if the police get involved, the blackmailer can still send the photos when they know the police are after them. I will contact the police tomorrow, but I’m afraid they won’t do much, and if they do, they might not be able to stop it in time, as I just mentioned.

But I was easily able to buy more time with the blackmailer, I told them that I had to borrow money from a friend to get the card, and that it would take at least a day. The blackmailer agreed and even asked if I was able to borrow the money. So the blackmailer isn’t super aggressive or sly, which is why I think this is someone young and not seasoned. (Before they revealed they were blackmailing me they also pretended to be minors, and that might be true)

What should I do? I have a blackmailer who isn’t super aggressive and seems young and inexperienced. But they have both explicit photos and access to all my followers. If the police get involved I’m guessing it will take a very long time till this gets resolved, if anything happens at all. I have photo evidence of the blackmailer threatening me and demanding payment.

The blackmailer said if I blocked them they would send to my followers. Should I just ignore them? Ignore them and block them? Buy more time? Get the police involved? I have read that most blackmailers don’t follow through on their threats, and they wouldn’t gain anything from it, it would just be a lot of work for them. But there is always a possibility of it and that really makes me afraid.

Also if these pictures get leaked it would be social suicide, my social life would be ruined, and I would be embarrassed to show my face outside the house. Thank you for reading my long post. Please help me, any advice is appreciated.",13Mar2020,1

The thing is,  you can fill out forums before you actually draw in the store which is what most people did.  I looked at all of the art the day I submitted mine and hers wasn’t there.

To make a long story short our life hasn't been easy, her childhood she was badly abused and neglected and never had anyone, so when she had me she thought of me as the only one that would truly love her, growing up I see that's pretty much true. She married my stepfather and for 13 years he physically and mentally abused her and I until he was arrested. He got out last year and has since then been just as mentally abusive, if not more so, than before. So my mom is very unstable. We're in a pretty poor financial situation and I had to drop out of high school right after I turned 16 to help with bills.

I feel like my life needs to really start anew, if it ever really did start at all. 

I feel like I want to have the whole collage experience, and regular life experiences as I didn't have anything normal growing up except in childhood sort of.

Is 40  too late to start again? I feel and look exactly the same as when I was 17. Seems like 40 is the new 20 with lifespans feeling like they gone up.

I wanna learn a new career and make something new of myself.....but I feel society puts us in boxes based on age. I'm still the same person???

What should I do??",13Mar2020,1

I’ve watched them for a day before and it was really tiring.  I’m just worried watching these many babies overnight and all. I know I can do it because I love them but any advice on keeping all kids calm and me not stressing out the whole time?

It’s a few months until I graduate and a group of 7th graders are sitting at my table, and it’s gotten so bad that they have been putting their backpacks on the seats just so they can have more space than us and they throw our backpacks on the ground to sit in that space. They have half the table and 6 of my friends have had to move away because of what they have done. There is an empty table in front of ours and I told them they could sit there, as it would be more convenient for us and them. They refused and said they have “been here longer than us” and they said they “don’t care”. I’m starting to get annoyed because of this but I don’t know what to do.

249,"Might be hard to capture the whole situation briefly, but I’ll try my best

I’m a senior in high school at a high school with about 80 students 9-12. I’ve played baseball my whole life and am pretty good, good enough to play in college if I wanted to. I’m the only senior on our team of 10 guys and am our best player by a decent margin (won conference player of the year last year). But honestly, I hate baseball. I’m only really friends with one maybe two guys on the team, and all of my friends are running track and I ran track in middle school and have always loved running, and am above average in that area.

Oh yeah, and I have had a nasty shoulder injury (larval tear, had surgery in October) from last baseball season that I’m just now about to be completely recovered from, but my shoulder will never be the same. I’ve also been super stressed about baseball which is likely causing lots of stomach problems recently like lack of appetite and nausea.

The problem is, I can’t quit because we would only have 9 guys which is the bare minimum and the team would likely be dissolved, unless they could find someone else to play.

Also, the coach (whom I don’t have any fond feelings towards) has been a family friend since I was born, which adds extra pressure to stay on the team.

I’ve had multiple times during practices so far where I literally want to just go pack up my equipment and leave. I think out the scenario and decide I shouldn’t. The last two days though, have almost pushed me over the limit.

Yesterday some of my teammates were obviously mad at me for a couple different reasons, mainly for expressing interest in track, and making it seem like I don’t wanna be playing baseball (which I don’t). The coach heard about this today and as soon as practice started til it ended I could tell he had it out for me and was yelling at me for anything he could, even when I did nothing wrong. The players also seem hostile besides my one friend on the team.

Basically, I have been suffering through baseball and now it feels like my team doesn’t even want me, although they definitely need me, disregarding my skill they just need a body to play. I see the track team practicing and am just longing to join them and it really is hurting.

I have a feeling the team is going to have a meeting with me tomorrow to discuss how I clearly don’t want to be there, and I’m planning on just telling them the truth. It’s so hard because I definitely have the option to quit; I can just not show up and they can’t stop me. But at the same time, I can’t just quit.

Any sort of insights or comments would be appreciated. I really need an outlet for this as I clearly can’t talk really talk to anyone about this.",13Mar2020,1
250,"My close friend of four years who has little relationship experience (she’s 21) recently met a guy who is a bit older than her (he’s 35) but when they first met he said he was a few years younger , when they went on a date and hooked up he told her his real age which is 35. 
The guy is really secretive and hasn’t told her much about himself , they just sext , but whenever she asks him questions on his life/his interests or even talking about his family he always changes the subject , like she doesn’t really know if he wants to pursue a relationship or strictly just a friends with benefits type of thing. 
He also leaves her on read and doesn’t reply back to her messages for two days and uses crap excuses. 
I just feel really concerned cause I do not want to see her hurt... but I also don’t know if I’m just being paranoid and overprotective, him lying about his age was the first major red flag to me. 
I’ve spoken to her about the way he treats her but she doesn’t seem to see it or understand so she just continues talking to him.

251,"It was my freshman year of highschool. I was fresh out of Catholic school and I didn't exactly have the best social skills in town, so making friends at first was kind of hard. Then one day I met someone who we will call K. K was in my American Government class and was very interested in history, especially military history. I was also interested in military history, so naturally I wanted to be his friend. Now at this time I had thought of myself as a person who like to crack jokes and try my best to make people laugh. I wasn't very good at it then and I was, to put it simply, pretty cringe bro. So I tried my best to get to know this guy. It was obvious from the get-go that he didn't want me around. He and his group of two other friends made fun of me for the things I did and said, and I should have left it at that. But I kept on persisting and trying to be this guy's friend. And one day something must have changed his mind, because we were walking to class together and sitting with others in the lunch room. There were so many things I should have caught on to, to personally attacking me with insults that reinforced my insecurities, to not apologizing for mistakes that he had made and making big scenes about mistakes that I had made. But for some reason I kept on being his friend. Him and I did a lot together, from volunteering at a local museum to going out a drinking whiskey in the park with some other friends. I will admit, I did have some good times, but once I started hanging out with him more frequently I started to take his side on almost every issue. When one of our friends was hooking up with someone K had had a relationship at one point, he called me up, told me to dress in nice clothes and told me to meet him at this guys house to confront him about the whole ordeal. It was very strange looking back on it. I started to become more close-minded and more submissive to ideas like ""if you don't have a job at working age then you are a leech to society"" or ""anyone who has sex before marriage is a terrible person and cannot be trusted"". He was essentially a boomer in a teenager's body. He would also borderline force us to spend money on things, then completely forget about them mere weeks after he said it was ""cool"". In junior year, K and I and a few others decided to try and win a competition for a scholarship. It was a history related competition, and we were going to make a video about the Vietnam War. K decided that we should do a reenactment type deal, so he told us to go the local Army surplus store and spend a couple hundred dollars on clothing, gear, and air-soft guns to make things look authentic. We soon realized that we were all too busy with extracurricular activities to actually do the project far too late into the project and $300 dollars was sent down the drain. I soon realized that this was the wrong person for me and cut ties shortly before the end of the first semester of senior year. Of course he spread rumors about me to everyone he knew, and even tried to pity me into being his friend again. He was a narcissistic, over-bearing, piece of shit who I should have never been good friends with. And now that I'm in college, I think the mindset that he put in me still lingers on. Before coming to college I had wanted to go Greek, but something told me that I wasn't going to like because I didn't belong there. I'm not the party hard type of person like most other fraternity brothers, but something told me I wasn't going to like it. I'm scared of getting out of my comfort zone because I'm afraid something will happen to me that will be embarrassing socially. I'm scared of inviting people I know to spend time together because I feel like I'm intruding on their space and wasting their time. I'm scared of asking people out because of the chance that, again, I might be embarrassed of my actions. I'm scared of getting a job. ""What if I don't know how to do this thing or that thing that's really easy to do to some people? Am I stupid? Am I useless/incompetent?"" These are some of the thoughts that go through my head when i make a mistake and mull over it so much. I know that these thoughts are wrong and that I should try new things and forgive myself for the mistakes I make, but this mindset is always there. ""You're not good enough"" ""You shouldn't even try"" ""Those guys look like assholes you shouldn't talk to them"" ""That girl looks like a thot you shouldn't trust her"".  Are actual thoughts I've had in the past year since I cut off contact with K. Any tips on how to get rid of this monster plaguing my social life? Any places to even start? 

TL;DR Toxic friend kind of fucked my brain up, need tips or starting points on how to remove the immature and close-minded mindset that is know a part of my thinking process.

254,"So I live in Sweden, still at my parents' but Im moving after I graduate to study abroad.

So basically Im a troublemaker, I got into so much trouble and always got caught by my parents: they found weed in my room, I made a fake email of my mom to justify my own absences from school (so that I can skip school sometimes without parents knowing) and I lie a lot to my parents. And I get caught all the time. Thing is Im a straight A student tho hahah.

Anyways my (arab) parents will sound way less stricter than most arab parents but thats because Im very stubborn and I always end up doing what I want. Hence the reason why I have a VERY BAD relationship with my parents.

Anyways they dont let me sleep over at my friend's house and won't let me stay out late (like after 10-11pm). They suspect I do bad/illegal stuff. But thing is I just wanna live my life by my rules. Its my life and not theirs. I cant move out now already cuz i dont have the money and also even if I did, they wouldnt allow me to (arabic culture...).

2 weeks ago I went to my friends place and slept over even if my parents told me not to. When i got back home the next day we fought a lot and didnt talk for 2 days.

Anyways Im going to a party tonight (celebrating 100 days before exams) and it ends at 3AM. Im probably gonna get drunk (which my parents would kill me if they knew I drink) so Im planning to sleep over my friend's place. I just told my parents that Ill sleep over and they burst in anger. My dad said in arab ""I will break your neck if you do (its an arabic expression 😬)! There is NO sleeping over while you're still living under our roof!"". I ignored him and in my head Im just thinking that Ill still do it. (Btw they are literally capable of driving to the party to pick me up, without letting me know so thats a risk)

Next friday also is my friend's birthday and Im also planning to sleep over so that will be 2 fridays in a row (didnt tell them yet but they will KILL me, not literally ofc).

Anyways I just wanna have fun while im young and live my life cuz who knows i might die tomorrow. I say this to my parents and it just makes them even more angry. They think they can rule my life and that thzy have the right to tell me not to sleep over etc. Ugh what do I do?",13Mar2020,1

259,"So, about late August, I was casually sitting in my local Starbucks downtown drinking my coffee and drawing in my sketchbook, when someone approached me rather suddenly. I already knew of this guy’s existence, he was the deaf kid from high school who was also mentally unstable. He kept touching my sketchbook and getting really close to me and not leaving me alone, until I pretended to be in a phone call and he eventually left. 

I hadn’t seen him in months until today walking home from college, March 12. I was waiting at a crosswalk when I felt someone aggressively tap my shoulder, and I turn around to see the same guy babbling gibberish in my face. I ignored him, pretending I was too occupied with my phone and he just started literally screaming in my face and tapping at my shoulder. He then tried to turn me around to face him, but I kept my focus on my phone. That didn’t work, and when I faced him again glaring at him, he continued babbling and flipped me off, to which I thought he was going to punch me in the face. I didn’t really know how to react, as I didn’t feel like I could do much as a 5’2 skinny woman. He kept doing that until the light finally let me cross and I was able to get away. It took everything within my power to not knock his teeth in.

I guess my question is what should I do? Should I report it? Call the police if it happens again? Pepper spray him? I always go on long walks/runs around town but now I’m afraid and currently planning a new route, hoping I don’t run into him. I’ve been afraid to ask other people this because of morals, I guess. He’s a mentally unstable deaf guy. Is it wrong for me to call the cops on him? Is it wrong that I pepper spray him if I feel threatened as a result of my panic disorder? Would I be arrested or jailed for pepper spraying a mentally unstable deaf guy if he continues to harass me when he encounters me? Please help.",13Mar2020,1

As first, I was not engaging in the mass hysteria and doing the same precautions that everyone does. Hands washed frequently, less face touching, yada yada. 

But as of late, I feel like I am starting to not understand the full length of what is happening. I am a huge Disneyland fan and the fact that it’s closed it’s very significant to me. That does not happen often. Like, ever. 

I work at Starbucks, and obviously have regular customer interaction. We are incredibly clean and upheld to a food safety standard but I am a manager and handle a lot of money every single day.

263,"I work at a lovely vet clinic that is just wonderful, and I take a lot of pride in my work, because I help the vets help animals. I am the most senior receptionist, having worked there a year and a half, and I have worked my butt off to get a promotion, which I was so happy and proud to receive a week ago (on a trial basis for a month.) My coworkers are so happy for me; I'm far from perfect, but they know how hard I work, and how I've picked up a lot of the slack in the past 6 months since our manager left.

The new staff member, we'll call her ""Cece"" was hired one month ago and told my boss that I was horrible after I she felt I was overstepping when trying to ascertain her schedule, and possibly a misunderstanding where she didn't realize I couldn't hear her or something. My boss was stressed and yelled at me that time, and told Cece we needed her, not wanting her to quit as it was an important week.

Since then, Cece has been challenging me at every turn, even though we resolved everything that day, and it had turned out to be a misunderstanding. I had to get a new anxiety medication it has been so much for me. When I got the promotion, and was put in charge of scheduling, Cece told me she couldn't work that weekend actually anymore, and also next weekend, and then wrote down what her schedule ""would be"" and said if I didn't make it happen, she was going to have to talk to talk to Boss and tell her how I was being. When I told her she could do so, and while I would do my best, I just can't guarantee she be able to set her schedule, she tried to go to my boss, which was fine, but when my boss wouldn't talk to her (disillusioned and annoyed) Cece insisted I go outside with her, and went off about how she ""Wouldn't tolerate the attitude."" I literally almost threw up, I don't do well with that level of confrontation, especially since I don't feel comfortable defending myself and creating more drama. My coworker is in charge of HR, and I just didn't want to mess things up, you know?

Well, luckily, when I had a couple days off, Cece got mad at my Boss for getting snippy with her, and put in her two weeks. The others were pleased, I was relieved. Well today was my third day on my new medications, and I let my coworkers know I was a little off. I was also like 7 minutes late, and I want to kick myself. Anyway, Cece kept basically being a jerk, and when I sprayed perfume on, she told me how gross it was, and made me feel horrible, and when I was talking with my coworker, urging her to take which lunch slot she wanted, Cece snapped that ""I can't even hear the call I'm trying to make"" and it was just rough. I tried to maintain a positive, friendly attitude, but a few hours before close, Cece went off on me again. I don't even know why. She went off about how she wasn't going to tolerate me, and she was going to be forced to complain. I said ""Okay."" That set her off more, and my coworker took her into another room. I spoke with my coworker after, and she asked if I wanted her gone today. I said no, I don't others shorthanded when I go on vacation next week, but maybe it's better if someone leave tonight. I was shaking. She said I could if I wanted, so I did.

How do I act tomorrow? The coworker says she has an almost supernatural hatred of me. She is only going to be here one more week, and I want her to stay that week so my coworkers aren't shorthanded. Should I pretend nothing happened, or act as if she doesn't exist? What will make it more calm? I don't want this.",13Mar2020,1

269,"This is kind of tl;dr post of a previous post.

I'm the most senior receptionist at the vet clinic I work at, and we hired a very entitled young lady with a neat bachelors degree (Cece), but she's never had a real job. She has always challenged me hard, and I'm administrative manager, but another employee (Abbie) is HR manager, and she's so good at it, I just figured it would make her job easier if I backed off of it, and didn't create drama, and if problems remain, well it'll be easier if I don't make it worse and Abbie will do a better job figuring it out than I could, especially since Cece feels so... something, about me.

Cece was hired one month ago, and tried to sabotage my promotion to the Boss. Both my and Abbies promotions are still coming I believe, but they are probationary, so the boss said she wanted to see how it goes this month. Cece has been awful to me, and it's been rough, and I actually had to start an anti-anxiety medication, but she put in her two weeks after the boss snapped at her about being a bit overbearing, so she only has one week left.

I was still a bit nervous today, and a bit out of it as the new medication is making me feel a bit weird. I didn't talk so much, but I tried to be friendly when I did, but I was nervous about talking to Cece since she challenges so much. She flipped out again, I have no idea why, and Abbie pulled her because she was going off. I spoke with Abbie after, and we agreed I should just go home because it's too much drama right now, and we want Cece to still come in next week when I'm on vacation. Abbie called later, and told me she had never seen such hatred from someone, and that there was nothing I could have done, Cece is projecting something onto me.

But I have to work with her again tomorrow. Abbie has already made it clear if I want Cece to not finish up the two weeks, she is gone, but I need her to finish up next week. Should I act like Cece doesn't exist, or act nothing happened, or just say hi and nothing else?",13Mar2020,1
270,"So, I don’t believe I have coronavirus, but I am sick so do I still need to self isolate? Not really sure what to do and Google is telling me nothing! 

I spent time with my baby nephew at the weekend who had a cold, he just had a very snotty and bunged up nose. A couple of days after I saw him I started getting a headache and then also the bunged up snotty nose which I still have but it isn’t as bad as it was in the week so it’s on it’s last legs now. I have a sore throat too but no coughing or any other symptoms suggestive of covid-19. I’m pretty sure this is just the common cold but I feel like people are looking at me like how do I dare leave the house or something. I’ve just started a new job, this was my first week there so I can’t self isolate just in case, if I was in my old job I probably would have (I don’t want to make a bad impression, and also I wouldn’t get paid for it!) what do you think I should do?",13Mar2020,1

272,"Hi, first time posting. Sorry for mobile format, I will keep this as short as possible. 

I (F23) met my ex (C -M27) in January 2015. After being together for about a year, he began raping me. I couldn't leave until May 2019. 

He is not a horrible person. He has a good heart but he has this monster side to him that only I have saw. A month after breaking up (I left after he tried to rape me again and I finally kicked him in the face away from me and left home) we were talking and he came clean and said he has a sex addiction. I said to him that I am struggling with the thought of him doing that to someone else because I would be part to blame for not reporting him. He has never ever denied the rapes, not once and I know that if I went to the police he wouldn't lie - he couldn't anyway as I have evidence of every single time. In return, he said he would start counciling and show me evidence that he is getting help to overcome this. 

The thing is, I haven't heard from him in 3 months now - last I heard he has a new girlfriend - and honestly I don't want to hear from him. I don't want to speak to him or know that he is getting help, I just want to know that he won't do this again and I'm realising now that this whole 'sex addiction' thing is just to have an excuse.

I don't believe he deserves jail time, I really don't. Is it possible for someone to willingly sign themselves onto the sex offenders list? Or is there anyway to do that without involving law? I have just started therapy myself and finally getting the help I need, but I can't have closure yet and I think it is because I feel like this. 

Any advice would be wonderful, thank you!",13Mar2020,1
273,"I am living at home after spending spending 10 years away. I moved out at 17. Now i have been living with my parents(both in early 60's) in two months I've gone to having zero self confidence and self esteem, 

They try to micromanage  and question everything I do and tell me I'm doing it wrong, my mother is constantly combative, and my father has dismissive narcissistic tendencies. I believe they were always this way and that I'm just realizing now. Interacting with them is causing me to feel psychological regression.

274,"I know I’m skinny. If you saw me for the first time one of your first impressions would definitely be about my thin figure. I’ve been called out many times about my weight and I’m always told to eat more. I have been skinny my whole life but for some reason I feel “fat”.

I know deep down my figure is great. I checked my BMI and it hits perfectly. I’m 5’5, 18 y/o F and I weigh 115lbs. But every time I look in the mirror and stare at my naked body, I see a “fat”body. When really it’s a bloated, unproportionate, and pudgy body. (Neither is good to say but the second description is accurate lol)

But my BMI used to never hit perfectly. Back then, I was under weight and for some reason I was happy about that. I really hate to admit it. When I look back at old photos (when I was literally an underdeveloped pre teen) I missed how skinny I used to be. I still am skinny but for some reason I want to be skinnier?? Like as skinny as I was back then. Now I feel gross about my body. Even though I JUST barely hit the perfect weight for my BMI. 

I do everything I can to try and get back to that figure. I’m beginning to have a bad relationship with food and I force myself to workout every other day (even if it’s 2am in the morning). I also became a vegetarian which limits my food greatly (considering I live in an Asian household and all they eat is meat). If there are meals that contain meat and meat only I skip eating. And that’s a lot of the time.

I have no idea if it’s body dysmorphia or anorexia or bulimia or idek. I have never looked into those things. I would like to know if anyone else is going through this or if anyone could give a name to whatever this is I’m going through.",13Mar2020,1

So, for a little background, i(asexual(?) female, whom has never been in a relationship) have an online best friend that I met in summer and she's super cool and funny, but the problem is that, I'm not going to lie, she's kinda bitchy. She's had 3 exes and 1 person reject her since summer.
The thing is, that crush rejected her yesterday and she cried with me about it and all. Problem:We talked about liking each other earlier that day and I said I think that I like her(she asked me if I do) but she has a boyfriend AND GUESS WHAT. She ""broke up"" with him coz ""he didn't give her enough attention. And the truth is, I said"" I THINK I like you"" bcoz I've never felt love before, and from what she described me, I've never even had a crush.
So, after crying with me, she said that she has another crush, I asked her who, and guess what, IT WAS ME
Now i'm not an asshole to people's feelings, so I said I like her too and now we're together
The main problem I need advice to is:Now she's all affectionate and ""💕💕💖💞"" but i FUCKING HATE IT. I wish things were how they were. She's not the chill and cool person she used to be.The worst thing is that she's very sensitive. And when she is, she's rude and annoying and awkward.
How do I break up with her? Or at least get things back to where they were? Should I just ghost her? I don't want to be known as ""one of her exes"". What if she posts about me or something? (that would be a problem, because if my (homophobic) mom finds out, I would sincerely be disowned)

276,"My teenage years sucked. When I was 13, my father made me leave school, and since then I’ve spent nearly all of my life up until now inside my home. I have missed out on so many “teenage experiences”. I couldn’t name a single friend, I’ve never ”hung out“, I’ve never been in a relationship. I’ve rarely left the house. Since leaving school, I’ve spent most days tending to my parents and chores at home, where I’m responsible for nearly everything and then some. My father is mentally abusive, and used to verge on physically abusive. I could go on about the awful things he has done, but I think you get the picture.

As you might imagine, it gets to be terribly lonely and depressing. I’ve gone through periods where I more or less had no will to live, no energy, nothing. It’s a weird feeling, not unlike sadness but also not the “sad feeling” you might imagine a depressive state to be. It’s an exhaustion and deep pit of loneliness, not physical exhaustion, but complete mental exhaustion. I also suffered from anorexia for a short period of time, but I snapped myself out of it before I got to be terribly ill.

I’m 19, about to be 20 in a couple months, and I can’t believe so much time has past. I missed out on so many years, what are generally some of your most memorable years. I’m moving into the adult world, completely unprepared and with no family or friends to talk to, ask advice of, even to trust. I’ll never be a kid again, and it feels like I never was to begin with.

I took and passed the GED, and I start college in the fall. I‘m not sure where I’m going, but I‘ll probably go out of state. I’m aiming for somewhere with significant financial aid. My parents wont contribute to my college expenses, and what little money I had saved over time my parents have taken and spent. I want to start anew, and leave the past behind. The problem is, I now have awful social anxiety. And when I say awful, I mean \*awful\*. I can’t generally carry on a conversation, and when I do I don’t know what to talk about. Someone might ask me about myself, but I don’t know who I am. I don’t have a hobby, I’ve never had time for one. I don’t have a favorite band, my parents have physically limited what music I’ve been able to listen to. No, I don’t know about that TV show, I haven’t watched TV in months.   


People have asked me about what school I go to. Usually I answer with “I’m homeschooled”, because “my parents forcefully removed me from school and I haven’t been back since I was 13” is a mouthfull. But then they’ll ask me about it, and you are suddenly forced to craft a whole lie around it. “Oh, yeah, sure, I’m taking calculus this semester”.

What advice do you have for me as I move into these next few years? Youth doesn’t last long, I’ve wasted so much of it, and I don't want to look back and regret missed time. You don’t hang out with your friends when you‘re 45. You don’t go to parties in your 30’s. You don’t have sleepovers at 50",13Mar2020,1

280,"Okay so, this is somewhat related to my first post in r/advice but this is more about me. I suggest you can maybe go read that one first. Or long story short about that post: I had a friend who sent me a photo of her standing at the edge of a window and I managed to stop her from jumping, confronted her about it and she laughed it off. I was worried the whole day but she rejected to go to the counsellor. and I was trying to find advice from reddit. I informed 2 teachers and spending more time with her, so far she hasn't done anything. 

Anyway, the post I posted has comments about saying how I shouldn't be thinking that I'm responsible for my friends, like a ""mom"". It made me think for awhile, and I realise it's really taking a toll on me.

I have 5 close friends in my group. Aside from Jane (The girl who sent the photo), there were two other girls who were depressed (not diagnosed professionally and I don't know what to call those). 

One of the two was Julie. Julie grew up in a household where her mom is a gold digger, her dad cheated, and both of them ignore Julie. One night Julie told me that she tried to commit suicide but she was scared so she backed down. She said she thought of ""murdering"" her mother and everything was her mother's fault. I panicked and called my other friend, Anna. While I was panicking I spammed Julie trying to convince her not to jump and murder. That was 5 months ago. This situation I (think) have resolved. I've been spending time with Julie and trying to make her happy, let her ignore what was happening in her house at that time. She seems happier ever since she got it out.

Anna, the other one of the two, was actually the first one who was ""depressed"". She showed me messages between her and her 15 year old online boyfriend, and it was showing so many red flags. He was saying how if she doesn't do anything he says he will commit suicide, and throwing tantrums, acting all childish. I told her that he seemed to be manipulating her, and she said ""yeah, but he's going to commit suicide if I don't listen."" 

I met her bf online and talked to him. He showed so many red flags and then I found out that Anna was cutting herself because of him. I'm powerless against this, I can't do anything. I told Anna to please stop, and leave him because he's emotionally hurting her. She did and she also seems happier nowadays.

A lot of situations happened too, but all of them ended with me taking care of their health and safety. It was always the same. But after Jane's situation, everyday I feel scared and pressured that one of them would come up to me and say that they've been depressed and want my help. Because I already have the title ""mom"" in the group, all of them would come to me if they needed help or comfort or just a listener.

Don't get me wrong, I really love helping my friends (they're amazing people, they make me happy, they do care for me). I love to help. But this is scary. I don't want to know anything anymore, but I still want to know. I don't want to help them, I want to help myself first. But they're my friends, I care for them. My mind's a mess, I want to help but I don't. I don't have anyone to go to. I can't go to them because IM the one who is supposed to help them. I want somebody to listen to me, but I don't want them to suffer. I don't want them to be pressured, to think that they're responsible for me.

I want to help myself instead, because this is my situation to deal with. I need opinions, I don't know anything anymore. I'm lost. I want to change myself, but still be the same caring person to my friends. 

My friends always say, ""why do you keep saying sorry?"" or ""why can't you be selfish more? you deserve more"" ""why can't you say no?""

I DO want to do that, but it's so hard. But yet, I feel like if I change myself, nobody would like me. Does anyone have like a list of things or challenge to change myself? To maintain as a caring person but still selfish? I don't know. Please. Sorry if this whole post doesn't make sense, I'm just getting it out from my system. Does anyone have suggestions?",13Mar2020,1
281,"Most of my “friends” are toxic, but it is ok with me because they still tried to be nicer and improve. But this one girl, I was able to deal with everything she’s done to me until today. Ok, so I’ll tell the story from the very beginning. Our parents are friends, and we went to the same elementary school. She used to tell me how fat I was and how I should lose weight, in 1st grade! That caused some major self esteem issues. From 1st grade all the way to now, high school, I hate looking in the mirror. I only wear certain pants that don’t make me feel fat. Every time I look at my thighs, I want to throw up. I hate that they touch when I put my feet together. I hate that i don’t have a skinny body with a flat butt and chest. I wear baggy shirts to hide my butt and upper thighs. The worst thing is that she eats fast food everyday, and the only reason she’s skinny is cuz of her genes. Yet, she loves to talk about how skinny she is with her “22 in waist”. I know I’m not “actually” fat, but it still doesn’t make anything feel better. I went shopping with her once, and she said I should try on a size 4 pair of jeans. I’m actually a size 0, but thanks for ruining my self esteem. She’s literally the reason why I’m so insecure about my body, why I am not happy, and why I work my self to the point of literal exhaustion. She’s the reason why I quit swim, dance, and gymnastics because I didn’t like how exposed my body was. 

Also, she sees me as someone underneath her. Like, she just HAS to talk about how she won some award when she knows that I didn’t get it. For the achievements I do get, she undermines them. For example, I play the violin and I do auditions/competitions. When I get into a good orchestra, or have something to be proud of, she keeps on referring back to the time when we were in elementary school and how she beat me in a seating test, so she’s still able to play just like me. Even though she quit years ago. It makes me so mad because i dedicate at least 3hrs per day to the violin. Yet, she doesn’t even touch hers, and says that the music I’m playing seems “so easy”. When I decided to take 4APs, she HAS TO one up me. She just HAS TO be better than me.

I can’t complain to anyone, because she only treats me like this. She’s only mean to me, not her other friends. So, if I complain, people just tell me about how she would never do that type of stuff. But she is the biggest snake. As soon as someone is out of earshot, she would tell me how much she hates them, or how “they smoke weed and do drugs cuz they are white” (we are Asian). She calls my best friend, a Wasian, whitewashed and stupid cuz she’s half white.

She’s also manipulative. I didn’t really have any other friends in elementary school except her because of her manipulation. She told me that I couldn’t wear nail polish, have certain friends, or tell my parents about her because she would “come into my house and kill me”. Obviously, she couldn’t do that, but a young 7 year old me believed that, I was so isolated. The first time I had a true friendship was in 6th grade because I went to a different school than her. I realized that my friends don’t make me feel fat and inferior. 

Maybe I’m too sensitive. Maybe I’m not finding the humor in her jokes, maybe I’m too serious, maybe I’m too easy to manipulate. I don’t know why she targets me. 

I blocked her on instagram, because I felt that her posts were not doing good things to my mental health. But, she found out, and asked another friend to ask me why she couldn’t find my accounts. She basically asked me why I blocked her. I just lied and said it was a glitch. But I can’t believe that she thinks that I don’t have a right to block someone. 

I need to maintain a good relationship with her tho, cuz I live far from my school. She lives in my neighborhood and she goes to my school. Her mom doesn’t work so her mom can pick us up earlier than my mom and dad can. I hate staying at the school too long, so I just bear the car rides. Also, she might be in my classes in the future, and I dont know what to do if I broke things off with her. I can’t wait until I get my License so I can drive myself home, and not be with her, I can’t wait until college, when I’m going to go to a totally different college from her. 

I really need help. It’s been 14 years, almost 15. I don’t know what to do anymore. I can’t handle this anymore. I’m sick of feeling inferior and having to hide my body. How do I distance myself from her? I can’t block her on social media anymore, because she is just going to turn amy few friends against me. I don’t know if i should just let her know that I hate her and I can’t stand being in the same room as her. I don’t know what to do. I’m sick of her telling me that I’ll never be able to do anything. I’m sick of her making me hate myself after a conversation. I just want to be free.",13Mar2020,1

So today we agree to hangout and have a little chat about what she wants from me as a “friend” around 4:00pm and i’m not really ok with the friend thing and she knows. she never gave me a straight forward answer and i told her that if she doesn’t wannabe in a relationship anymore i don’t wanna communicate anymore. she got upset and angry and started to accuse me of going out with other girls etc. i was very calm through all of it and it seemed to make her even more mad. before i got out of the car i let her know, is this really what you want? and i said i plan on texting u in a month or 2 to check on you. she said “you won’t even care anymore at that time”. and i got out of the car slowly and said goodbye then she sped off. 

fast forward 7 hours (now) she text me that she apologizes and she is still hurt and angry at me. and explained i don’t know how she feels etc. do i respond to it in the morning or continue the no contact i got out of the car saying i was going to do?

285,"I’ve been struggling for the last 2 years with something that’s been eating up at my brain and I just need to get it off my chest and get some for of advice.

When I was 19 I dropped out of college (art school) because I didn’t think I was ready mentally to be thrown into that world. My actions during the semester I spent in school made that really obvious to me over the years since. As soon as I moved back home I spent time looking for a job to pay my bills and found the first job that accepted me; a small locally owned restaraunt, I was so fortunate to find a company that would care for me and treat me like family. I’ve become beautiful friends with the owner and all of his employees and as of this week I’ll be spending my 4th year with them.

It pains me to say that for the last 2 years I’ve been dreaming of leaving the company, but I never have because I’m still so lost as to what I would do after. This job treats me well, they pay me nice, and we have a trusting relationship. I don’t want to just leave this job to wind up at another dead end place where the relationship is not as great. However this is not what I wanted to do with my life and even though I know I don’t really know what I want to do with my life I feel like this job is holding me back from finding out.

I work so many hours and I give so much to this company and I don’t feel under appreciated, it’s just that I have other things I want to work on, my hobbies that I want to take places and make careers out of. Unfortunately with the time and effort I put into this job I feel like I never have the time or energy to put everything I want towards those skills.

All I keep hearing in my head is “don’t quit your day job” and I don’t feel like that’s a healthy thing to be telling myself but it’s a realistic thing to be telling myself. Don’t leave this financially and stable environment just to throw everything towards art and crash.

I just can’t be scared like that forever can I? I mean if I truly believe in what I want I need to work for it with all I’ve got, right?

287,"Hey guys. I don’t have many people to speak to, so I’m writing this here. I apologize if it’s a mess, I’m all over the place right now. Some backstory: my dad is paying for my mom’s place. A couple years ago she began dating a homeless man (he lived in his vehicle). He moved in shortly after, and they had a baby.  He barely works, barely pays for his child or my mom. My dad still full supports my mom. He has extremist views, is incredibly sexist, racist, homophobic, misogynist, and anti Semitic. He’s also very into insane conspiracy theories. 

He would pick fights with me for nothing, during which he would ignore all of my points and responses, changing the subject to attack me from a different angle. He would always pick on me and my appearance in these arguments. He has also physically abused my brother - slapped him, grabbed him, etc.) 

For the past couple of days, he has been telling my mother he believes he has corona. The day before yesterday, my mom purchased me an old car (for my 17th birthday). He became very triggered and jealous, as well as complaining about corona. My mom told him he does not have corona, and was joking about it. (He didn’t have corona). Also, a couple of days ago, he spent $2,000 on his credit card buying food and stuff. I guess he was angry he wasted all that money because nothing major was happening. Anyways, he flipped out at my mom after her doubting his corona. He started beating her and saying “when my fever reaches 104, I will kill you, the cats, and crash all our cars, wreck our house.” He threw her on the ground, and beat her. Threw her onto the air conditioner. He grabbed the FUCKING gasoline portable heater, which is rather large and quite heavy, and tried to kill her with it. She managed to get out of the way in time. He left the room, and she called 911. Once he heard she called 911, he stabbed himself in the kitchen. Came to the door, and was saying “I’m hurt, you stabbed me, I need first aid.

288," I've always had an interest in art, whether it be drawing, designing, or digital media. But I struggle with being creative. I get ideas but I feel like literally anyone can come up with or their just plain simple. I've only ever had 1 idea where I've really wanted to make it into something.

Am I not creative because I don't know what I can create? because I don't know the techniques? I've always had a semi-hard time in art class coming up with ideas for projects. I always feel like I struggle more to come up with the idea, and I never really have a good time drawing or making something until I'm done with it and it usually comes out looking bad which just makes me...disappointed.

Having a creative idea for anything is just difficult and I draw blanks whenever trying to come up with something original.

TL;DR: How do I become, creative? should I just move on? I have a huge interest in art and making things but I have a lot of trouble coming up with simple ideas",13Mar2020,1

By the time we moved in together we would be together for nine months. I’m trying to figure out my living situation for next year, but my brain just keeps going back to him. And I get the feeling he wants to to, he constantly asks me what my plans for next year are. But we’re both a little too apprehensive to bring it up in case the other person doesn’t feel the same.

2. If my girlfriend’s dad can’t find a job, they’ll have to move (I don’t have a car so I’ll rarely be able to see her)

3. My dad’s working from home because of the coronavirus, he can’t afford to get sick so we basically quarantined ourselves

4. If businesses shut down, he might be laid off

What exactly do I do? Obviously I’ll keep trying to get a job, I’m an adult (yeah I know, I’ve got some work to do) and my dad can’t legally hold me back from anything. But if that doesn’t work, how else would I get money? Or even be able to stay somewhere?",13Mar2020,1

294,"A few weeks ago, my friend was sleeping over at one of our buddies place, along with 3 other people, including me. She slept in one of the bedrooms, along with her best friend. During the night, she woke up to him groping her and attempting to go further. She woke everyone up, and left. 

She decided not to go to the police, because everyone was a bit under the influence and she didn’t want that to get out. She has reached out to assault helplines &amp; professionals to help her through this tough time. Obviously, we have cut contact with her assaulter, as any sane person would. 

We thought all was done, but the word around the street is that the guy has gone to therapy (supposedly), and that his therapist is telling him he did nothing wrong, and that he needs to see her. This is very alarming, especially since he has told multiple people he is going to see her whether or not she wants to see him. We are terrified he is going to show up at her house, we don’t know what he is capable of anymore. 

Question is, what should we do? The friend said she would go to the cops if he goes near her. I don’t know 100% if he is actually seeing a therapist, but if he is, what kind of therapist would encourage a molester to see his victim again? Should we reach out to the guy? His therapist? Should we report his therapist to someone, if that was actually his advice knowing the whole story? I’m at a loss, I want to help my friend but I don’t want to force myself into the situation.

( it’s always night time and my home is completely dark) Making me feel fucking terrified. And last night the dream was the same except they had members come closer standing outside my window and sliding doors. Before anyone suggest religion it’s not that. Hard core atheist here but I’m fucking terrified of cults. I understand why of course seeing as they are people who are stupid enough to follow a crazy idea or man, and stupid people in groups are dangerous. I don’t read about them or watch movies about them but I am so scared of them and my dreams are putting me off. Constantly have the fear of being watched by a bunch of cult members now and my dreams can’t calm down. I am strapped in my home while they get closer and just stand there waiting for something to happen. It’s unnerving and in my dreams I can’t reach out to anyone.

301,"Hey guys, I'm currently an exchange student living in a foreign country, sharing an apartment with 2 other people. The problem is I wanna move out because I can't take how toxic one of my roommates is, but currently can't. They're asking me to cover all of the fee including contract renewal and demand me to pay my portion of the rent until they can find someone new to move it, if they can. Not only that but they're also asking me to find a new tenant for them and take care of everything myself during the transition because me moving out is ""disrupting their live"".
The contract fee as well as the rent is impossible for me to pay on my own considering I have to put money into my new apartment. Also, I don't see why I have to pay their rent even when I'm no longer sharing the apartment.
There's no legal binding on what I have to pay at all, the only thing that can be considered legally binding is the contract renewal itself. The whole paper work for renting an apartment in the country is also very complicated and mandatory so I can't just leave without settling things on the rent contract.

Like as if we knew each other for a long time and we just bonded. We talked every night, deep talks. We talked about our past and growing up. We talked about our problems and dreams.

And fast forward to about 2 months in, Idk if it was even right for me to ask ""What are we"" at that point. I just wanted to know. And then she turns out she didn't want anything, and we were just friends. Of course I respected her boundaries and her wishes. And we stayed friends, but we grew distant. We didn't talk like we used to, the other person doesn't reciprocate the same energy and the flirting wasn't reciprocated anymore. And I realized I caught feelings.

She's in a rough patch in her life, getting through an emotionally and physically abusive relationship. Like she has her PTSD and had very traumatic experience with her ex. And I want to be there for her, but at the same time my feelings are just really getting in the way. And I don't know what to do anymore.

It started when my two best friends were having issues, I was basically the voice of reason on both sides and helped them to finally solve everything.

313,"I need some advice on life lol. 

This was my first year in college and it was alright. It could have been everything I wanted it to be but I’m a pussy. I need to learn how to assimilate into having male college student mindset. 

I’ve never been the ‘predator’ type of guy; The guy that sees something he’s interested in and pursues it. I’ve been the opposite my whole life. I play the ‘prey’ role and wait for females to come up to me and hit on me -lucky enough this works most of the time- but, I’ve been blowing my opportunities as of late. 

I feel as if I can’t communicate with people. I don’t know how to text people consistently, have consistent conversations with them... I don’t even know how to use Snapchat or Instagram to my advantage! I’m so lame haha. 

I believe I’m a simple person. I focus on my school, go to track practice, lift, and just try to play as much sports as I can. I focus a lot on my body image. I don’t support any teams or watch much any sports. 

I have a tinder but use it as a validation app: I smile when I match with someone and feel even better about myself when a girl messages me... but I never respond! Lmaooo

I feel like I need a life coach or something. Someone to teach me how to Snapchat and text, watch sports, and just talk to people. 

I know I have friends but most of the time I feel alone. 

I want to be the person others perceive me to be. People think I’m a fuckboy and that I have thousands of friends.  In reality I’m someone who focuses on hisself too much. I can’t find a ‘clique’ and I’m always hopping from clique to clique. 

I feel like I have to live up to peoples expectations of me. For instance: many people expect me to be a fuckboy or someone that gets any girls he wants. 

I HATE THIS. because I have a low self esteem when it comes to spitting game. I don’t know how to spit game and feel like a let down. I’ve been called “wasted potential” so many times. People always say, “if only I had your looks... I would get so many girls” 

This just kills me because I’m the type of person that sees an attractive female but doesn’t do anything about it. 

I enjoy math and playing sports. I have a little kids personality lmaooo.

I would much rather keep playing sports or practicing calculus than waste time on a girl. Either my friends prioritize girls too much... or I’m just... I don’t know... different.",13Mar2020,1

327," 

I have had this thought / feeling for as long as I can remember ...Frankly , I was never noticed anywhere , and I never accomplished something worthy of being noticed ...I spend my whole teenage life and early adulthood trying so hard to prove myself at anything but nothing seems to work ...Back at school , teachers told my parents that I won't amount to anything . I barely had any friends and I wish from time to time that the conversation would be initiated on their part as well ...Maybe a simple "" good morning "" or "" hey how are you "" even once a month will do .

I am always the person making effort to keep friendships , to be something but I am always forgotten, or go unnoticed . I was even wrote down as absent in many classes where I was sitting in the front row right in front of the professor .And tbh , I am just tired . I spent my whole life like this , no one asks about my well-being or cares about what happens to me .Also from high school fast forward a little less than a decade and here I am still struggling ...Maybe my teachers were right back then .What really hurts me is that I am trying , no sleep , day and night just to not seem that less than everyone else around me , thinking that someday I'll get my moment to shine , but I waited 23 years for it ... I was always been either the nobody , or if I was mentioned , my inadequate self pops out first ...Also during all of that emotional turmoil , I picked up drawing .Because every time I tell the one close friend what is wrong with me , they all answer "" we don't need you in our lives "", and cut me off . I needed a medium to tell through my art , what I was feeling , and maybe lessen my load ...Back in 2012-2013 when I was still 13 , I thought maybe I could make this my success story , and improve , and I really came to like what I was doing .I LOVE iit actually , i would always get new ideas , experiment and just have a blast ...But the reality reflects otherwise... My "" getting ignored"" in real life , transferred to my art account ...and I was reluctant about doing it full time because "" if i couldn't get my art seen by others after 10 years of constantly trying , practicing and improving , i won't be able to sustain myself economically wise....please do not misunderstand my point , I don't want fame and a lot of money , I just want to feel validated somewhere , and that my work matters ,my feelings matter or even what I have to say matters and maybe not so lonely ...  
Irl , no one listens to my opinion even when I voice it with confidence . With my family when I am talking or discussing something , they all don't even look or listen . Or I am interrupted for them to talk about clothes , shopping or nail salons ,or some TV drama .

I want that when I interact with others , they's interact with me , I want feedback and maybe a nice comment every once in a while .I JUST WANT TO SEE MY HARD WORK PAYING OFF , BUT I ALWAYS GO UNNOTICED...

PLEASE HELP , I am having suicidal thoughts because of it .

I envy people who go and live to their fullest while I am in that room working all day but never reap the results because nothing works out , not in my major field ( my professors don't see good results so they think I am wasting time and having fun and ask me to work more while I often skip meals for work ) , and I don't even have an audience art wise to be able to assess my work...Maybe I was born to watch others be fulfilled and satisfied.

TBH nothing i feel , do , talk about , matters to anyone ... Sometimes my relatives tell me "" can you not talk to use we are embarrassed by you , or can you not talk to us , because we don't care about what you have to say """,13Mar2020,1

334,"My mother is... I don't know how to discribe her. My past posts show that she's the main source of my problems right now. She doesn't listen, always starts up fights when there should be none, always likes to shut down any oppositing opinions.

People have told me she's a narcissistic, she always turns the topic to her being the victim and never being appricated. She always says that without her we would've been nothing, always says my father didn't do anything for us, and what she admits he did do, she always says it's bad and she could've done it better. Constant berating to everyone around her, children, husband, even mother.

I've tried the silent treatment when she's berating me, she gets angry that I don't respond and it escalates , I've tried cajoling her and telling her 'okay' just so we move on, she gets angry and things escalate. I respond with my point, she gets angry, calls me disrespectful and things escalate.

You get the point.

She's not mentally okay, but she isn't bad in the sense of having a mental illness that would explain her ways. Maybe she's paranoid, or depressed. I don't know, she (a doctor BTW) doesn't even want ME to go to a therapist because she doesn't want to believe her children could have problems (or God forbid, have mental illnesses)

I will have a period where i just feel great. I’m totally present and living in the moment and I’m not bothered by anything and i just take everything as it comes. I can laugh, i can be witty, i can be the best version of myself. I’m able to connect with people. I like myself when I’m like this!

but then it fades away and at some point i just feel totally blank. Like no emotion and nothing going on upstairs I’m just an empty person. I try to act normal because i want to keep up appearances but it always comes off as fake and weird because its not real emotion behind the stuff I’m saying. Then I’ll get anxiety about the fact that I’m being so weird and question why I’m like this and try to shake it off. Then ill catch myself embarrassing myself trying to be funny at work or something and then feel bad later and repeat it in my head. And the cycle just continues. I’ll go through that period where i feel nothing at all for quite awhile. And then something will happen where its like my brain just wakes up. Maybe ill watch a comedy special or something and just laugh my head off and its like I’m back. I’m living in the present moment again 

I’m at work and i feel like crying. I feel like ill never be normal and i wish i could be like everyone else and just have a steady personality.

My behavior towards my friends is very toxic.

I’ve made my friends very aware of this, only for them to be stubborn and ask me back... I take the easy in and we forget anything bad happened, only for the behavior to repeat itself. They don’t punish me for it either. They continue to be amazing and decent people.

My family life has also fared badly because of this. I burst out at my family a lot in heated arguments over politics. I make my mom cry a lot and she devastates over how they’ve ruined me. I tell them that’s not at all the case though. This behavior always repeats itself as well. I apologize, but nothing is done.

I went to therapy for my toxic behavior, but I faked journal entires, faked getting better, faked wanting to improve, because I guess deep down inside I want to continue to be toxic. Stopped going to therapy and my parents see no reason for me to go back. I do, but I don’t want to go back.

Hi, for backstory i have quite a controlling emotionally manipulative mother. I feel like she cares for me but has such a narcastic personality and catastrophes every situation. I have been brainwashed my whole life, for the full story see my post on r/depression (warning its a little long): https://www.reddit.com/r/depression_help/comments/ff27yc/depressed_student_with_helicopter_parent_need/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

I am a 21 year old female maths student from the UK who had diagnosed anxiety, am on antidepressants, and am going through a really rough time. I hate my maths degree course that i'm half way through and felt pressured into taking it. I cannot go against what my mother says because i am financially dependent on her and i feel like i really need her approval. She has always told me not to get a job as i don't need to (i have a bit of savings left from a relative) , and that no one will want me because i am shy and have no experience, and most importantly that it will effect my studies. Unfortunately i am so depressed i am not even going to class or doing any work at the moment.

I am desperate to get away and just found out i got a job at Greggs (a british pastry cafe place), which i feel will be very good for my confidence, give me a use for my time, be a good reference for my cv and give me some customer service experience. I was so ecstatic i called my mum (sometimes she has a good day and i thought it was worth a try). 

She said she was very upset as i will catch coronavirus from the customers and handling money and that if my dad catches it he will kill my grandad (90 years old) and uncle who is receiving chemo for bladder cancer. I have to go home every weekend to see my dog who has prostate cancer and is untreatable on dogs. She is threatening that i will get coranavirus, be quarantined and then miss my dogs final moments. I said it was unlikely that all that stuff would happen at the same time. I'm across a counter from people and am in a highly hygienic foodsafe environment . I am more likely to contract it at uni which has 30,000 in the corridors.

343,"I (22M) am just finished by BSc in Biology. I've managed to save the funding for a masters of my choice, but I'm split. I would love to do both a life sciences masters (There is a brilliant biotechnology course in Boudreau, France or a research masters in Nottingham, UK), but I also have a ""creative"" background and have been approached regarding a masters in Science and Environmental Journalism. 
I'm really conflicted, I've always been split between my love of the creative and my curiosity in science (my A-levels* are in photography, film studies, biology and applied sciences). Eventually I would love to combined them and go into documentary film making; but I'm unsure what's best to pursue in that regard.

So I put it to you reddit, no pressure but help me decide my masters degree? Also any experience in the fields of  biology (especially ecology, biotechnology and epidemiology) or in journalism/ film production would be super appreciated.

*for those who weren't inflicted with the British school system an A level is the qualification you get aged 16-18/19 (typically) prior to leaving the equivalent of high school. These grades and topic areas determine your eligibility for higher education

344,"I had a HUGE crush on this girl. I met her in the beginning of middle school and had been crushing on since until now. I'm 16. I asked her out (over text, yes I am a coward) and she considered it for a bit. Ended up rejecting me. I tried to distance myself after wards, I was still nice to her, but I stopped talking to her mostly because I didn't want to keep being around someone I liked and they didn't like me back. A friend of mine told me that she told him that I was bitter that she rejected me because I started to hate her. (I didn't hate her. But maybe she interpreted it wrong) 

So we stopped being friends but it didn't seem like there was bad blood. But you can tell our relationship would never be the same again. We'd talk here and there but we weren't close anymore which sucked. But here's the part where I hate myself for. 

She's actually a terrible person. I realised this when I was around 12? (before I asked her out). She makes racial comments, she's ignorant behind them, talks about how annoying foreigners get in and says things about Muslims. She's selfish, doesn't care about anyone elses problems but hers. She was never there for me simply as a friend. She didn't seem to care when I'd confide in her. I really regret telling her things. I thought I truly was being bitter but I had told some of my friends, both girls and guys, and they all said they noticed they same things with her. That she's judgemental and selfish. 

She's unloyal. She would talk about her boyfriend behind his back and say awful things about him. Like he's an idiot. She cheated on him too. It doesn't seem like a big deal but she kissed another guy at a party and was apologetic about it but to me, she twisted the story and made it seem like she was a victim whilst my guy was crying his eyes out.

And I still like her??? 

I recently moved to a different school, and I'm still hung up over this girl. It's nearly been over a year. I TRY MY BEST not to look her up on social media but my dumbass still does and it makes my heart ache knowing that I miss her and she probably doesn't even ever think of me. 

She's really pretty, but I don't think I liked her because of superficiality and I'm just another horny sixteen year old kid who wants a pretty thing on my arm. 

I think deep down, I liked the old version of her. The one that's gone. She changed tremendously throughout her teen years. When I first met her, when we were both 11, she was direct, upfront, didn't care what anyone thought of her, she was friendly and fun. Now she's sneaky, manipulative, fake and a lot more low-key which I don't like.  But I truly miss the old her. And whilst I know I should stop liking the ideal version of her when she was 11 and that now she's gone I can't help but keep reliving and thinking of those memories. 

I genuinely hate myself because I deadass feel like I'm gonna be hung up over her my whole life. I've had plain ass little crushes before, but never as deep as this one. I know I'm too young to know what love is, but I'm so pathetic that I feel in the near future if I ever saw her again I'd try and be close to her even though I know that she isn't who I think she is anymore. I think she might be deep down, but this is all a front or something..

However, while at university I fell in love and am super happy with my boyfriend. Our plan was to move from here (east coast) to Toronto. We were looking forward to being closer to my family who are also in Ontario. BUT my entire family has been hounding me about money. Telling me we can’t afford to live in Toronto, that we’re making a mistake and that they won’t be there to bail us out. At first I felt like we could handle it. I figured between student loans, working part time and my boyfriend working full time that we’d be able to afford it. It might be a tight squeeze but my boyfriend and I have been really unhappy living out here for the last few years. For 2 years now we’ve dreamed of moving to Toronto together and we were so happy when I got in. 
But my mum and sisters have me convinced that we can’t afford it. My mum wants us to move in with her and save money, and I can go to a school just outside of her city. 
I know this is her way of trying to help me but I don’t think she knows how much it’s breaking me down and making me feel like no one trusts us to be able to handle this. My mum and I have a complicated relationship and our relationship is SO much easier to sustain when I’m far away lol. living with her would inevitably put a strain on our relationship and sex life haha. But more than that, the city my mum lives in isn’t where I grew up and she moved there when I was 18. Shortly after that, my mental health got really bad and I had to take some time off school. I moved in with my mum and we fought like crazy. I got super into drugs and hungout with really sketchy people just to stay out of the house and escape. The next summer, my mum got seriously injured and I moved back in to help her. I still have some resentment to the rest of my family for not helping me more with my mum during that time. So I have some really dark memories in my mum’s city/house. I’m scared that I would revert backing to being someone I worked really hard not to be. 
I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to ask my amazing boyfriend to move to another province, just to live in a city I don’t like, with my mum who is pretty difficult to live with. But I also don’t want us to be financially drowning if my mum is right and I’m not able to work as much as I think I will during the school year, or if he has trouble finding a job, esc. 
Our plan was to live with her for the summer (4 months) while we get on our feet and look at places in Toronto.

354,"I (29F) live in Canada with my husband. My grandpa in Indiana died a few weeks ago. We weren't close - I have kind memories of him when I was younger, but he was awful to my brother and my dad over the last ten years. Still, when I got the news, I wanted to go and be there for my family. 

We made preparations to go. Took time off work, quickly replaced the car when the engine went (was the cheapest option at the time, 9-hour drive, then that car couldn't get safetied, so we arranged to borrow my mother-in-law's), made plans to stay with my aunt and uncle, let my mom know if there was anything I needed from home in FL, etc. 

And then all the COVID-19 stuff went down. Here in Canada, schools are closed for 2 weeks after spring break. The first case just showed up in our town yesterday. All non-essential travel is advised against. 

The funeral will likely see an abundance of older mourners. The reception is at my Gpa's favourite buffet place. 

Most of my family are hardcore Republicans, and are of the opinion that everything's being overblown to make the President look bad and traveling is still fine. My brother, who's more liberal, said that it'd probably be fine unless I can't do the 14-day self-quarantine when I return. My aunt and uncle still plan to go on vacation to the Carribean in 6 weeks. My sister and her fiancé are still flying up for the funeral. My parents already drove to Indiana. 

Conversely, my friend from college says definitely don't go. My husband says it's a bad idea to travel during a pandemic (but that whatever I decide, we'll do). My sister-in-law, a nurse, says don't go. 

I don't know what to do, and it's been breaking me down. My relationship with my parents hasn't been great (becoming liberal, pulling away from family religion - there was about 3 years where we didn't talk) but it's been getting better. I know that if I don't go, they won't understand why, and I'm so afraid to fracture everything again. 

If I go, the 14-day quarantine will hurt - we live in the country, and our WiFi isn't reliable. My boss says we can work remotely, but I'd likely have to go to part-time hours, which is gonna strain  finances after the car debacle. We'd survive, it'd just be tight. 

I'm scared that the States travel ban could extend to Canada, and we wouldn't be able to get back (plan was to return on Monday). I also don't want to bring COVID-19 back, or inadvertently bring it down to my older parents. I don't want to contribute to how it spreads. I'm not high-risk, but I know other people are.

I’m on an employability course, and with that I am on a work placement within a college library. It’s going well so far, this is the third week out of 7 weeks, but last week I was off for two days because of constant panic attacks (I suffer from anxiety and PTSD). 
My course only allows me to take a couple of days off because it’s all based on hours. On Tuesday I felt sick but still came in, and then halfway through the day my symptoms got worse and out of fear that I had the coronavirus, I asked to take the rest of the day off as I deal with a lot of books and I don’t want to spread any germs. My lecturer for the course, who works in the same building as me, told me that I have to just take a painkiller and deal with it or I’ll be kicked off the course and the placement. 
This upset me a great deal because if I have the coronavirus I could be potentially infecting other people and since I come in contact with a lot of vulnerable groups, it’s dangerous. My symptoms are getting worse and I’m not really sure what to do, I just have to keep coming in.

357,"For a bit of backstory, my boyfriend (20) and I (F, also 20) have been together for 5 years, and when we first got together his mental health was good), until March of 2019, when he had a grand mal seizure and was diagnosed with Epilepsy. He has since had 2 more grand mal seizures and has smaller petit mal seizures every few months or so; as a result of these seizures he cannot drive, and for every new seizure he has to go another year without his licence from that point in time. He also is unable to work, or even be left alone at home due to the danger of his seizures - and to top things off he is unable to have more than two alcoholic drinks because it reacts with his medication. 

I know he feels as though he has been reduced to a child again, despite being 20, because everything he does right now is regulated since his parents won’t let him stay up past midnight and they monitor his every move. This combination of things has seen him plunge into a deep depression and he often feels suicidal nowadays, and I feel so helpless and lost with no idea how to help. 

I have got him to go and see a psychologist - of his own volition - and I let him know his feelings are valid and that I support him endlessly; but I feel as though it’s not enough. I want to know what else I can do to help, but I have never suffered from depression or suicidal thoughts so I am hoping to get advice from someone who can understand his point of view and can give me some advice on what to do to help?

358,"Hello redditors, I’ve been struggling with having panic attacks fairly regularly for nearly a month now. I am on medication for them, but I can’t always catch them before I crumble. I have recently started a new job to try and keep my mind busy, I had a job for the Christmas season and it helped keep my mind away from darker topics and I honestly think I peaked mental health wise back then. There was a span of three and half months where I didn’t have a job and instead found myself preoccupied with a family member who was hospitalized and then I went on dive into the deep end. That’s when I decided maybe this job could help me feel needed and worth someone. I had a bad first day as I was essentially thrown to the sharks without help when I have zero experience in this area. Not only that but I had a coworker keep making rude remarks directed at me and continue to treat me like dog shit the whole day up until I couldn’t handle it anymore and had a panic attack in the middle of my shift. My manager allowed me to leave early, but I didn’t tell her about the coworker. I don’t want to be deemed as the tattle on my first day there. Part of me is ready to quit already. I am already in a toxic-ish home situation, I don’t think I can mentally handle the same or worse at work. I lose all control when I get too anxious and it leads to attempts to take my life. Is it best to just count this as a loss and put my two weeks in after the first day? Or should I push myself through and hope I don’t run into the same coworker again?

Bearing in mind we speak everyday, chat joke etc 

He hasn’t asked once since this conversation how is your brother doing or how are you coping and it’s annoyed me the way he is just giving small talk in conversation. I felt like I over shared immediately after our phone call but he asked me what was wrong. It’s not like I’m asking him for money or anything but I’ve distanced myself from him without really saying why.

I think staying in Amsterdam is somehow the least worst option but I don't really speak Dutch well and the chaos in a foreign language is really frightening.

361,"I’m 16 and quite recently got diagnosed with clinical depression. Catch is nothing really that bad has happened to me, I’ve grown up in a financially stable and normally quite happy family and so I’m trying to find reasons that may contribute to me feeling this way. 
One thing I’ve reflected upon is my mum always complaining about her life, especially to me. I don’t think she meant it in a bad way but she used me as a way of venting because she has quite a stressful life. Her and my dad who (one could argue) has a drinking problem and frequently fought, seeing them fight irl didn’t really bother me but even after their fight she’d always come to me and complain about my dad and tell me about how he’s really awful and stuff and it applied to everything else that went wrong in her life too or anything with the family, she’d always come to me and vent about it. 

I thought about this and I’m not 100% sure if this could actually pay a part with my ‘unhappiness’ so I just wanted an outside perspective 
(Sorry I don’t know why but I don’t really like saying “depression”)",13Mar2020,1
362,"I'm strongly opinionated when it comes to politics and that's because I've spent a lot of time read articles, op eds or watching videos. I know the biases of each of those sources so I only absorb the facts and form my opinions. My friends, on the other hand, are incredibly lazy. They typically have a few news sources (all of them known to have the same political leaning). We've had debates twice, I have always been able to beat them, either by proving them wrong or bringing up something relevant they were ignorant of and at that point, they either concede or say we'll have to agree to disagree. And I just find that offensive, educated people forming strong opinions without doing their proper homework. I respect their right to reserve an opinion but I don't respect that opinion itself and I'm very open about that. Although they haven't said it yet but I know they think I'm looking down on them. I don't know anymore if I should bring up counter arguments that challenge their opinion. It's probably better to have some ignorant friends than less number of friends.",13Mar2020,1
363,"I was homeschooled at 14 due to unresolved bullying, didn't shower often due to depression and it made me a pretty big target in school. 

Ever since being homeschooled i've stayed inside of my room, only sometimes venturing out to the kitchen, and rarely going outside of my home for psychiatrist and therapy visits. Got diagnosed with both OCD and ADHD at 17. I mostly lie in bed on my phone or browse the internet if I have the energy. My only parent is an elderly mom (76) and is the only reliable family connection I have. I've lost all but one irl friend due to being shut in. 

Because I would spend so much time online as a kid I would usually end up speaking to people I most likely shouldn't have (resulting in online grooming), like a boy I dated for about a year in a LDR when I was 17. The relationship was very sexualized and usually consisted of me doing things for validation from the person I was with, however I deal with mild trauma from sexual experiences I had in my childhood and the encounters frequently made me want to scrub my body severely and left me feeling mentally very unwell for a while afterwards (not that they were particularly weird or anything like that). I usually look back on this and other instances and end up feeling really disgusted and repulsed by myself and daydream about leaving my mind and body behind and being someone ""smarter and normal"" or wishing that I were never here at all. 

When I leave my house the only thing I can think of is if people who are looking at me or talking amongst themselves are gossiping or making fun of me for my appearance or mannerisms. This makes it INCREDIBLY hard for me to build up the confidence to leave my house and do anything where i'm not accompanied by my mom or a friend. I think i'm severely socially stunted in person, and each time I communicate with someone i'm constantly thinking of what a normal response is or when I should laugh or if something is meant to be a joke or not. 

I take methylphenidate and anxiety medications for my illnesses, but a lot of the time I feel like a failure and like i've ruined my life and disappointed my grandma because I have so many mental issues. I want to study, and start college, and do everything I can to be a helpful and contributing member to society but as soon as I think about how I used to lie to people as a child online or how I look or how my grandmother might pass soon I just feel like participating in anything isn't worth it. Most of the time I don't feel sad unless i've remembered something from years ago that I did that was shitty or something someone said to me. I just feel very numb. 
I am almost never comforted by anything that my friends or family say to me for very long, and most of the responses I get just come off as if they can't really understand. 

There are many many other things that've contributed to how i've ended up here, but I guess i'm looking for advice or insight from anyone (or preferably parents) 
about how I can take steps to change/if anyone relates to me and has pulled themselves out of a similar situation and how they've done so.",13Mar2020,1

She is not the type to physically hurt me but she has mentally manipulated me to do what she wants to do. Many times she has used passive agressiveness against me. One time, I opened up a about my issues with her and my issues in general but she was not supportive. (i said that i didnt like her fatshaming me, i said i may have legit anxiety so i should go to the doctor etc but she dismissed these feelings of mine. Instead she asked if she was not a good mom)

Just to be clear, I told him my age and he said 'Really?'
'Can I see pictures of you then?'

So T told me that these girls said that A was really touchy with them (bc that’s just what type of person she is, she loves hugs and cuddles). But the people said that it made them uncomfortable so i told T that i would talk to A abt it. A is very sensitive and doesn’t like when people talk so she wanted to clear the air. She texted one of the people after I asked T if I COULD text them and talk to them which T said,”no leave them alone”. She didn’t want them to get her involved. But A and T are not friends so A texted the person. They cleared the air but then T is currently mad at me bc I turned around and talked to one of the girls specifically saying,”T did not do anything. Do not be mad at her. She is not involved in this whatsoever”. Later on that day T texted me saying,” thank you for ruining it all” and “you’ve now created problems out of nothing i hope you’re satisfied” “you might not be affected but your grand speech in class didn’t really work”.

First of all, I'm sorry for my English, It is not my native language

I hope you guys might give me some advice to have more sexual arousal in general. I explain my situation.

Briefly, I had very few sexual experiences with girls (totally, three not complete intercourse), due to my shyness and performance anxiety. This led me (I think, and my psychotherapist agrees with) to repress my sexual needs. I only feel aroused when I watch porn, and I search most of the time BDSM or raw porn, they activated me a lot.  

I tried to quit porn, even with r/pornfree advice, but I can't resist watching that stuff. 

I'm reading ""The guide to getting in on"" by P. Joannides, that basically it's a sex education book, and it leads me to think at sex with less anxiety. 

Maybe I can try to read some erotic books, for approach sex thoughts with more calm e simplicity, I' don't know.

374,"Hi all, 

So, we were given the day off last minute yesterday. Like, my boss’ boss called in and told us we didn’t have to come in tomorrow because they were shutting down my classroom to start cleaning because of Coronavirus. We were given the option to come in for some extra money but I decided to just take the day because, I figured I wouldn’t be having another day to just HAVE off for no reason for a long time. So I might as well take advantage while I can, right? 

Furthermore, four weeks ago, I was hospitalized and unable to go to work for about a week because of a medical issue. And I also figured, since I don’t plan on calling out for a very long time, this was my chance to have a mental heath myself, because I won’t be having one for quite a while. 

So my coworker is trying to get me to come in and “chill” with her. But at the same time she’s saying she doesn’t want to be there and that she wants to leave early. She saying she’d feel “more inclined” to stay, if I were to come, and that she’s just overall not having a good day and that she wants to “be around friends”. I feel really bad, but I still want to stay home as I had planned. I explained my logic behind staying home to her, and she’s still persistent on making me come in. She’s a level above me, so it’s mandatory that she goes in regardless of circumstance. Like she earned that level of responsibility.

Am I wrong? Or am I just being paranoid? It seems unprofessional. 
Am I wrong to think that perhaps she just wants me to come in so she can leave early? Am I wrong to just stay home and do as I originally planned? And am I wrong for feeling like she’s wrong for proceeding on trying to convince me, even after I said no? Like what’s going on here?

379,"18M here. I already suffer from depression and self hatred (sometimes i harm myself, but i make sure it's just pain and no blood gets shed (getting help is off limits)), and school is one big part of the problem (although not directly the cause). Stuff is getting worse, so please hear me out.

I have trouble passing simple exams, even though i study a lot. For big exams i end up studying 10h+ a day when i have school and 16h+ on weekends, while i always study at least 2 or 3 hours a day (after having already studied at school) when there are no exams in sight. 

While i study i do a good job avoiding distraction if i do say so myself. 
I always listen to the lecture in class and i take several pages of notes, diagrams and charts to make everything more linear. When studying i explain the lecture to myself multiple times and highlight on my textbooks. I take part in group studies and always end up bothering my friends for constant help (they are too kind to me lol).
During the exams i keep a cool mind and i have no anxiety (i cope well with what little i generally have). 

I don't have any form of mental disorder. No ocd, no ADHD, no mild forms of autism. Nothing except depression, in which school plays an important role. 

The big problem is: i have horrible memory. I often forget stuff in less than 10 minutes, and even if i get 7 hours of sleep, i always forget stuff overnight. The problem isn't solved by going over my notes a few minutes before the start of the exam. Even outside school, i end up forgetting events that i care about. 

They say you easily remember stuff you like, but i love school and learning and science and music yet i suck at everything i like. So yeah thats bullshit. ""Oh, but you are good with languages so you're smart, you're just not trying hard enough!"" Yeah shut up, karen. It's just english, (im italian so english is a rare proficiency) and im not even good at it because i studied it. I've simply watched a lot of youtube. Heck, I don't even remember what ""past tense"" or ""present perfect"" means but I've probably used it in this text i dunno. Im dumb.

I know iq is just a number, but mine is apparently rather high (about 133). Again, just a number, but shouldn't it at least help? Why doesn't it help at all? I've seen students who are not very bright, but they are very strong and are good in school. I envy them, but they are my friends so i still love them and wish them the best. 

I make it my life's second rule to never give up, and that determination is gold. But if school has taught me anything, it's that you can wipe your ass with determination and thats about it. Worthless.
And if my second most important rule is worthless, then I also am. Ez.

So, what am i doing wrong?

393,"Hello all. As the title states, we are seriously thinking about purchasing a home in the near future but aren't sure the best way to go about it or when. For starters, we're getting married this summer. Originally we wanted to buy a house before that, in the &lt;270k range, but our area has such a high cost of living it's ridiculous. Most homes here are 350k+. In addition, the area we live in is primarily older people who believe that apartments bring in crime, so all of the apartments where we'll need to be are luxury (1500 for a 1br, 2k+ for 2br). If we were able to find a cheaper one, it would not be safe or livable. 

Our combined income is over 130k. We have \~15k to put down so would have to deal with PMI or an FHA loan. I know homes are expensive but at least we can get some sort of equity out of it. Not to mention, apartments are more expensive than mortgage and insurance, average costs of repairs, and basic things. 

Also, it's still a sellers market. The homes here in our price range get snapped up before we can even get a chance to go look at them. Should we take the hit and rent until the market flips? Wouldn't a corona-caused recession be in our favor if we were to buy?

399,"[ TL;DR ]

So, one of my friends (F#1) and I have always had a weird relationship. She'd come to me whenever she wants to vent out, she'd constantly bitch about the people around her. The next day, she'd hangout with the same friends and tell me about how they're best friends. This continued for a couple of years where F#1 would bitch about someone, but also change her opinion in a few months and claim to be their best friend. I've been there for her despite my busy schedule and the fact that she's constantly thrown me under the bus multiple times. I have a natural tendency to forgive people easily.  

One time F#1 started a brawl with me about something so trivial, a problem that didn't even exist. She conjured up non-existent problems, blamed it all on me and started accosting me. Told me I was being irrational, always justified myself and that I never accepted my mistakes. When I ask her when I did those supposed mistakes so I could change myself, she told me she can't be bothered to remember. Then she personally attacked me by claiming that I had nobody (no close friends) and that I was a sore loser because I wasn't very active on social media; she then bragged about how she has so many friends and that I'd never have close friends ever in my life because of my pathetic personality.  It all seemed like she was frustrated about her personal life and was projecting it on me. I tried to salvage our friendship, she wasn't ready to even listen to my perspective. 

I let her go; but the entire interaction triggered me to believe that I was indeed a narcissistic person and I had an identity crisis. I'd constantly take NPD tests online to check if I was a narc, then ask my other friends if I seem like a narc. I event went to the therapist to make sure I wasn't suffering from NPD. Fortunately, I wasn't. But, she was so convincing that I started to believe I was somebody she portrayed me to be. I moved on from this incident, and was doing good. 

A few months later, F#1 shows up in my life unannounced. She shows up conveniently when we're having exams and she needed my help with a topic she was unsure of. She apologised to me for everything that happened; her apology had  two lines, had a lot of LOLs; in general it seemed very insincere and disingenuous.  Since this is not the first time she's started a fight, I could sense that she had an ulterior motive behind her re-appearance into my life. As I guessed right, she immediately shamelessly asked me for help with a few subjects. She didn't even make it a point to ask me how I was or to make pointless conversation, she straight away jumped to asking me for help. It wasn't a request, it seemed more like an order. 

Told her I was very busy with life and I could help her later; she kept asking me again and again, but probably understood that I didn't want to help her and backed off after some time. While, I was having a feud with F#1, I used to go to F#2 — a close friend to vent about F#1. I told F#2 about how F#1 screwed me up multiple times and how she came to me again. F#2 sided with me and told me how she thinks F#1 is absolutely shameless and has no self respect to abuse me before, and ask me for help now. F#2 was mostly supportive, or so I thought. 

After a point, my friendship with F#2 got very toxic too. She constantly expected me to cater to her requirements which involved always talking about her life, helping her with her issues, waking up at odd hours of the night just so I could help her out. My sleep cycle was fucked up, I had exams coming up and wasn't able to focus; if I took a few hours out to spend some me-time - F#2 would get all riled up and call me selfish, she'd complain about how I'm not doing enough and that I should spend more time helping her out. No matter what I did for F#2, it wasn't enough and she needed more, she deserved better. If I ever started talking about life or problems, she would act uninterested and walk away, divert the topic or ask me to, ""deal with it"". After a point, I realised my relationship with her was getting very toxic for me and decided to confront her. 

As you guessed, the confrontation didn't quite go well. She was furious that I dared to blame her; she turned the tables and blamed me for everything. She wasn't ready to listen to my perspective. She blamed me for being an egotist, for not doing enough for our friendship. But she didn't let me cut her off either, she kept coming back and pretending as if the confrontation never happened; but if I go off radar for a few hours - she'd get all riled up because I wasn't there for her. I have a life of my own too, you know? I got frustrated after a point, so I told her that I wanted space. She again accosted me for my audacity to ghost her. I was very headstrong and haven't replied to her yet. 

A few weeks later she DMs me again about a random thing, out of the blue. She pretends as if the entire fight or confrontation didn't happen. But I do know for a fact that if I let her into my life again, she'd wreak havoc and try to make me dance to her tunes. I was sick of her, so I didn't bother to reply to her at all. 

A few weeks later, I notice that F#1 had unfriended me and hadn't talked to me as much as she did before. Also, F#2 unfriended me everywhere. So, I'm a little suspicious. F#2 seems like a textbook narcissist, I am afraid that - to gain control over me she may have twisted facts and told F#1 about how I bitched about her just to get back at me. I don't know what to do anymore; as much as I want to confront both of them - I know for a fact that it won't end well and I'm mentally exhausted of being part of such an emotional drama! 

What should I do? It was obviously wrong on my part to trust F#2 with my secrets; but I also feel guilty because I may or may not have said things about F#1 to F#2 like how she used me, how she didn't give a shit about me and how much of a bitch she was. Maybe F#1 found out I said these even after she reconciled (with her seemingly sincere apology) I don't want them both to gang up against me and spread rumours about me behind my back 🤷🏻‍♀️  what is the most feasible solution?",13Mar2020,1
400,"I'm 16 M. My parents are divorced, I live with my dad but the custody agreement says I must spend every other weekend with my mom. My mom's bf is now living with her all the time. I don't like him. He's a creep who watches tons of porn and doesn't hide it. Twice last time I went he told me to watch with him, he was like ""all boys like it, I know you do too, don't tell me you never watch"" and so on. I don't want to do this, this is grossing me out. So I don't want to go to my mom's this weekend. Thing is, she'll be super pissed and she will take it out on my dad and maybe take him to court as she did once. I posted on r/legaladvice and they tell me I don't have to go if I can say it's my choice and not my dad telling me not to go. But idk how to tell my dad. I'm not sure he'll believe me because in the past I have found excuses not to go to my mom's for silly reasons and she took him to court so he had to force me to go. The other times were just silly excuses but this time it's true. I'm not sure how to tell him, he's had a lot going on lately and he's kind of overwhelmed, not sure it's the best time. I was told the porn thing is abuse and to report to CPS but I think this is too much, my mom is a pain in the ass but she doesn't deserve CPS. Nor does my dad who's never been abusive.

411,"Hi!

I recently got a new iPhone XR through work. I made the transition from my Samsung S9, mainly because it saves me money.

I ran into some issues with my headphones. After some google searches I'm none the wiser, so I thought I'd consult here.

After I got the iPhone I realized my mini jack headphones wouldn't work because of the lightning port the iPhone uses. So I ordered an original Apple lightning to mini-jack adapter (10 euro). Yesterday it came in the mail and I tried it out immediately. Though when I connected it, I heard the sound was distorted a bit. The sound would play through the new adapter and old headphones, but (periodically and rhythmically) every two seconds the quality would change to worse and back again half a second later. I disconnected the headphones, tried them on my old phone (no problems), restarted the iPhone and tried again. Now the same problem occurred, but the 'quality clicks' would be a bit less spaced out; every second or so.

After some searching I found out that Apple has some software-hardware issues with certain headphones in combination with their mini-jack to lightning adapters.
So, my questions are:

* Has anyone encountered the same issue and how did you fix it?

* I'm willing to buy a new pair of headphones, but I would really like a 3.5 mm jack. Does anyone have a suggestion for a budget brand that does work with the iPhone XR, the adapter and current iOS?

* Where would be the best place to look for a solution?

412,"Hi guys,

I've recently started playing 6-a-side football with a few of my friends. I've always really enjoyed watching football but haven't actually played competitively in about six years, and I'm one of the worst players on the team. We've lost four games out of four and I've been responsible for at least one or two of the goals every time (either through giving the ball away or misplacing a pass etc.) 

The problem is now, before games I wake up feeling nervous and assume that I'm gonna play badly, and even in the game I get really annoyed at myself when I mess something up, and don't usually reward myself when I do something well. The other guys on my team are all nice lads and I get on with them outside on football, but on the pitch I can feel their frustration and just feel like I'm the weak link that's letting everyone down.

I don't want to just give up but at the same time I don't want to keep being a burden on my team and walking away from every game berating myself constantly. Any advice would be much appreciated!",13Mar2020,1
413,"I’ve always said cringey things, due to being socially retarded, but now I feel like it’s worst than ever. I could just be in my head too much. Plus I overthink things. The past two times I went drinking have been haunting me. Saturday night I went drinking with my old classmate. The first time we went drinking (October?), I went wild. Just recently, I felt like I was a total asshole. Plus, I almost showed my tits at one of the bars. This place gives you candy necklaces with every drink purchase. Well, we left and went to another bar. I don’t remember ordering drinks, I just remember us sitting down, watching people sing karaoke. The next thing I know, I’m flinging candy necklace pieces at random people (missing every time). We were standing at the bar, at some point, and I remember pinging a guy not too far from me on the cheek with one. Normally, when I drink, even binging, I’m never like this. I felt terrible the next day.

Last night, I decided to drink at my local bar. It was the fire chief’s birthday. So I bought him and myself a drink. I decided to have more, while conversing with him and several others. Things were fine until I started to talk to him and his uncle (who’s like, 10-15 years olds than him), and asked them about their opinions about showing tits at a bar. About a month ago, I showed the uncle’s friend my tits at that bar. That’s a whole other story. The uncle and friend are in their 40s, I’m almost 30. Back to last night, I felt bad about THAT night. The uncle said don’t worry about it, it’s not a big deal. Birthday boy goes “
I mean, if you to show your tits, go ahead”. I would’ve but I didn’t want to get kicked out of the bar. He previously, maybe the night before, for some reason, for really drunk and slid down the shuffleboard table in his boxers, but he said with his dick out. So they mentioned “Rock out with your cock out”. I asked what the female equivalent for that was. That’s how that conversation started. Anyways, i carried on conversation about whatever else. I talked to birthday boy previously about joining the fire station. I’m a part of one but this one is a stone’s throw away from home. He said he’d give me an application but he’s been so busy. This is where I also feel like an asshole. I brought it up at the bar and we were talking about It. I felt bad nagging him, if I was. He said it’s ok. I told him that i had the impression that someone was always at the station. He said no, but years ago things were different. He said people used to hang out there but everyone’s lives are busy now. I wasn’t trying to get on his case or anything. At the end of the night, I told him to take his time with it. I probably shouldn’t said anything. 

I don’t drink much, but when I do, I usually go hard. When I do get drunk, I’m usually decent. I’m never an angry drunk, though. I don’t know what’s in my head lately. I’m sure the textbook answer here is to quit drinking, but no I’m not.",13Mar2020,1
414,"I hope this is the right sub, otherwise please tell me where to post this. 

Please help me get my head straight, today I found something out that kinda shook me. 
For context: I am 31F, have Asthma (non-allergic) and from time to time I have severe migraines. Both illnesses are under control and are treated with medication. Since I am prone to respiratory problems/illnesses due to my Asthma I get more sick in flu season than others. Also I don't go to work if I'm sick. I do so for my safety (don't want anything to go chronic) but also for my co-workers and the company per se because more sick employees, more mometary loss for the company.
I work in this company now for about 3 years, I came with a package deal so to speak. My current company bought the company I was working for before. I tried my best to fit in but most work I do, is work that my teammates don't want to do, so I do it because someone has to (mind you I have the highest education of all of them, even my teamleader but I never complained because work has to be done) . This includes teaching the apprentices.
So now the discovery: I am currently at home sick with bronchitis. I told my teamleader the results from the doctor and he never even replied to my text. But my apprentice did. And she told my that everytime I'm sick, my teammates place bets when I will back.
It hurt my deeper than it should. I always try to be nice and kind to everyone even if I don't agree with their views. But now I find out that my health is somewhat of a game to them (they know about the Asthma and the Migraines). I obviously only have value if I am constantly working (like everyone else also when they are sick). They make fun of me behind my back and I thought that was something of the past (like in school). 
So this was the straw that broke the camel's back. I want to quit. But I don't know if I am overreacting. Please tell me if I am. And I'm happy to provide more info if needed.",13Mar2020,1

I work as an independent contractor and from August-December I was getting paid a very small portion of my contracted amount from my boss. It became a huge deal to where I almost quit and there was an unpaid balance sheet that approached $3k twice. Needless to say this put my fiance and I through some major financial hardships. Through all of this I wasn't able to register the car because I would have had to pay state sales tax plus registration... close to $800. I've finally gotten things (mostly) straightened out financially and am at a point to where I can register the car. But... the state no longer has the bill of sale that was sent as proof of the sale. This is required to register it and I don't have a copy. I need to ask him for one again but don't know how to approach it without wrecking my family dynamics and looking like a fool for having an unregistered car for 6 months.

1. Come clean, explain my problems with my contracting facility, ask nicely for another bill of sale
2. Ask for a bill of sale for my records, no further explanation
3. Ask for a bill of sale for tax purposes

430,"Hey there! So this is a throwaway account for reasons that are going to become clear I think.   


I think a lot of people deal with some degree of social anxiety and I always considered myself kinda average in that regard. I have some anxiety from talking with people especially people I don't know that well, some fear of what people will think of me even tho I might not have any connection with said people and sometimes I honestly just rather be in silence or by my own.   


I always considered those things kinda passable if that makes sense and never worried too much about it. Sometimes it's worse and I can't really deal with social interactions at all sometimes is a bit better and I can even make small talk and kinda have fun doing it. It depends on external factors, internal factors and sometimes I don't even know what it depends on. Just mood I guess?  


The reason I'm writting this is because there was a extremely small occurrence recently that kinda made me stop and think about it. I have a circle of people on facebook who are very active and are always sharing articles and commentating, etc . Tho sometimes I feel I have something interesting to add I never actually do it because I have that fear of exposing my opinion to public especially when I can't even gauge their reactions to it if that makes sense. Well this time I decided to kinda ignore that feeling and just go with it and add something to the discussion. The reaction to my input was not badly received on the contrary but as i get notifications of people replying to it I get like accelerated heart rate, shortness of breath and really present anxiety. And I'm thinking ""wth is just a facebook post what is wrong with me?"".   


I feel like that quite a lot that's I usually opt out of doing stuff like this. My question is I guess if this is kinda normal for any of you or if I should seek some kind of counseling in how to overcome this irrational fear of exposing myself to other people. I've been advised by some close people in the past to seek psychological help mostly because I had a kinda bad depression episode during last year which recently I think it got better and I'm doing a lot better now. But i never went through with it tho this involuntary reaction from me to a simple facebook discussion kinda weirds me out.. So do you think this warrants some sort of psychological help or is just a question of trying to get over it by forcing these kind of social interactions until I get used to it?   


Sorry it kinda ended up being a really long post but   
TL DR   
I always felt I had some kind of social anxiety but not that big of a deal. More recently was alarmed by it because even replying to something on a facebook post sent me into a semi anxiety state. Questioning if this is something that i should get help with or just get over it .

TDLR at the bottom:


So my friend Ill call ""Brock"" and I have been friends for a few years. In the recent year, I asked him out, realized I should not have because my mental health is wack rn, then thought maybe it was just butterflies, asked him out again, then was like no stupid your mental health needs to be taken care of, and called it off. (When I asked him out, I mean like asked him on a date.) 
He is a great and understanding guy (trans, if that matters) so we have continued to be great friends. We have even gotten closer to the point where, maybe once a week, Ill sleepover. 

So heres where I need advice:
When we sleep over we cuddle and while it is the absolutely one of the best feelings ever, Ive woken up before to him moaning in his sleep. When this happens I usually just play along and while rub his leg, or arm, it hasnt gone further than that, unless he is also touching himself and Im unaware. (Im little spoon) 

What Im wondering though, is if he is awake durig this? He moaned so much I always assumed he was, but between us never really talking about it and him recebtly telling me he was asexual Im confused. He said he would have sex with some special, maybe Im special to him?

I dont even know how to bring it up! I know that I have not done anything violating, nothing more than rubbing his leg or arm, but I am so confused as to what he wants or if he's even awake. I care for him so much, Id never do anytging to hurt him and now Im afraid I have.

Once, one of times I woke up, it was like I was in a dream state before and called him daddy(bottoms unite) while he choked me and he made a joke about being my daddy and so I assume he was awake for that?? 

He even moans until, at least it sounds like, he climaxed. (By that I mean it grows in intensity)

TLDR: Cuddling while I sleep with my one of best friends is great. The only thing is he moans in sleep to the point where it sounds like he's climaxing. Though it has never turned into sex, only massaging, I have some questions. Is he awake Is this sexsomnia? Does he want to have sex? How do I talk to him about this? (He is trans, again I dont thimk it matters, but maybe it does, or maybe some has some personal exprience and can help me out?)",13Mar2020,1

443,"Hi,

I go to college in NYC and classes the week before Spring Break were canceled so I took everything that was essential from my dorm and came back home. However, it was just announced that classes for the remainder of the semester will be canceled, and if I move the remainder of stuff out of my dorm I can get a refund.

Now - the best way to do this is to hire a moving company who can enter the dorm, take everything out, and put it in storage for you. However, the only problem is I had 2 copies of a Fake ID in there. Will they take this and report me to the police? Or does anyone know what the policy with things like this are?

Thanks",13Mar2020,1
444,"So I’m staying with my uncle and aunt in Taiwan.  My aunt recently got a stay at home / live in helper from Vietnam that helps with house cleaning, cooking, and bathing of my aunt and things of that nature.  

There was a small get together at another Vietnamese caregiver host’s house.   It was a small group of people my uncle, myself, the live in helper and 3 other foreign Vietnamese workers.  My aunt stayed at home because she has Parkinson’s.  

We had food and were drinking some alcoholic drink that I was not familiar with.  At first things were fine, we all were talking and having a decent time.  But towards later in the night my uncle was getting pretty intoxicated and the Vietnamese stay at home helper that lives with us at my uncles house kept pouring alcohol in his glass.  At first I was indicating to her that my uncles probably had enough because he is older and in his 70s.  I was trying to look out for him and also keep him from acting a fool.  She kept pouring him shots of this this weird drink and I kept politely saying he’s had enough and trying to block the pouring of anything in his glass.  

The night goes on and my uncle is slurring his speech and having problems standing.  I was thinking if he wants to drink let him drink, he’s a grown man.  And so the night progressed like this a little bit longer with my uncle drinking but soon my uncle and my aunts helper started arm wrestling and things got weird.  I saw my uncle kind of groping a bit and trying to cop a feel (lmao and yikes and the same time).  At this point my uncle is very annihilated and I could see on the helpers face that she didn’t like the touching either but she kept pouring him drinks and engaging in some weird ass wrestling/ dancing/ and groping with him which is weird right?  

At this point, I’m helping my 70 year old uncle stand and trying to convince him for me to take him home.  The helper also keeps trying to pour him more drinks and I keep saying he’s had enough but she wants to get him more drunk.  I feel like I should mention that there is also a huge language barrier problem as well.  They all speak Vietnamese and I speak English, but the common language in this situation is Mandarin Chinese.  So they are speaking very broken mandarin with me my uncle and my Mandarin Chinese is not very good.  They are also kind of laughing and talking to each other in Vietnamese so I have no idea what is going on.  

This is when I started getting a weird reading.   My aunt’s helper is really good at drinking, and she clearly still has control of her faculties while my uncle is super drunk.  She keeps trying to get him more drunk, he is groping her and talking about leaving in the morning with her to Vietnam.  Her face shows she doesn’t like the touching and she slaps his hands away, but keeps pouring him drinks and reengaging in these shenanigans.  The girls are all speaking Vietnamese so I don’t know what is really happening.  

So I just now managed to get my uncle home and I’m hastily writing this.  My aunts helper kind of pretended like she was throwing up she is drunk but still has control and followed us home.  Things are weird, because my aunt asked how my uncle got so drunk.  I said we were just having fun and drank too much.  My question is what was she trying to do?  Is she trying to start some shit?  I’m probably not doing a good of explaining the situation.  But things were awkward for everyone there.  I’m going back home to Canada in a couple of weeks.. should I tell my aunt what this persons behavior was like?  Should I tell her to me it seemed like she was hatching a scheme?  Should I just keep my mouth shut?  Is she trying to be a home wrecker I’m in a bit of shocked and just kind of grossed out to see my uncle behave this way lol.  But I am confused and got some sneaky snake vibes from this person, like bitch wtf you trying to do?  

Hopefully this all makes sense to you y’all reading this because i has some to drink too.  I’m not drunk but I get sleepy ... please leave some advice of your thiughts and I will check in the morning.",13Mar2020,1
445,"I’m relatively new to management (about 2 years), and one of my employees has a consistently negative and overall bad attitude, especially about herself. We work in an IT networking (office setting) where it is very high stress and fast paced. Since this is the first time I’ve dealt with this, I’m looking for some pointers on how to approach her. Some of the things she does on a daily basis that I’ve observed for a consistent 6 months:

- Constant scoffing/sighing noises every few minutes when she is frustrated at an end user or issue (which is about every 20 minutes).

- mumbling (loudly) under her breath negative things when she can’t figure out how to fix an issue (“this is impossible!”, “fucking ridiculous”, “I’m so tired of this crap”, “I’m such an idiot”)

- frequently calling end users profane names under her breath (when they are not present).

- Extremely low self-esteem: when faced with a challenge her first response is something like”I just can’t do this”, or “I’m so stressed right now, I’m such an idiot”.

- overall constant complaining about EVERYTHING. Basically, everything is a negative impact to her, even the taste of the coffee that day, or the fact that her computer is running slower that she would like. In general, things that should be mere annoyances to most people, are the “end of the word” to her.

-recently i sent her to take a certification and the entire process was grueling because all she did was complain about how dumb she was and how she knew she’d fail the test. Even when myself and teammates showered her with reassurance, she would respond with “yeah right, I’m going to fail”.

Here’s the thing, a while back she opened up to me about having some pretty severe anxiety and depression. I know that this affects her attitude greatly and the way she handles conflict at work. I understand deeply because I also struggle with these issues, but the difference is I don’t bring it to work with me. We all have bad days..but this is becoming the regular with her and I know it’s a sensitive topic, and I’m not sure how to discuss it with her without her taking it personally.

She is overall a great worker when it comes to actual productivity, meaning she always figures out those issues she claims she’s too stupid to figure out, she always meets deadlines and she has more tickets closed than everyone else on my team, but her attitude has got to stop, it’s creating a toxic environment for the entire team.

I am also worried that she will become so consumed with anxiety and unable to cope with stress, that it will start to affect productivity.

Anyway I've been thinking about sending him $2,500 to invest in the stock market (he's a daytrader) and we'd both take 50% of the profit. Up until this point, we've never mentioned this investment, we sort of both just came to the conclusion that it would be beneficial for us both.

456,"Hello everyone, I have been employed in my current role (retail) for about 5 months now. I started out as a Christmas temp, ideally wanting just a temporary role, yet they have kept me on.

I still live with my parents because my family deemed it sinful for a woman to live alone. Because in traditional Islam a woman cannot live without her husband or male relative. 
 
I have always been the type to just do what my parents tell me to keep the peace. They said wear hijab, I worse hijab despite me hating it. My father said don’t listen to music I did it. And whenever I would do something that wasn’t deemed permissible in Islam, my father would scare me with the threats of hell and how Allah was going to punish me. 


My mom was somewhat upset by the pregnancy. But she seems to be coming around. But my dad is another story. 

He goes into a rant about how I need to immediately be begging Allah for forgiveness. He also said I fucked up my life by getting pregnant out of wedlock. 

My baby’s father and I want to get married at a courthouse. My father objected because the marriages is recognized in Allah’s eyes. He called me a liar and deceiver because I was out with another man without telling them.

my father suggested going to medical school in the philippines, where my mom was born, and i was honestly considering it since i want to get away from my ""abusive"" mother (*it may not seem like she is by this post, but i could* ***go on*** *about how* ***toxic*** *she* ***truly*** *is, literally my entire family dislikes her lol*) despite not wanting **at all** to go into the field. the problem is; i have a below-par sat score to get into the colleges my parents want me to go to. i am going to retake it tomorrow, but my mom and i got into a fight (*over not trying her soup because i was full lmao*) and i've isolated myself from my family for three days so i don't really understand what's happening or what *is* going to happen tomorrow.. to add on, i've ate nothing but the small supply of apple sauce i hoarded by sneaking out of my room whenever they went to sleep, and of course, drank a couple of bottled water i hoarded too.

473,"So my younger sister (17) and I (22) took a greyhound from NC to NJ. Being dumb we didn’t have tags on our bags. During our lay over in Richmond, VA our luggage was was taken off the bus without us knowing until we got to NY. Lucky we found two bus attendants/ workers that had called a coworker back in Richmond and that person found our bags and took a picture. I gave this person my name and number. Although we were told it should be on the next bus up, it never came. Every time we called each station they could be at VA, NY, and NJ we were always transferred to a call center who would have no way of looking to see where our luggage is. We even went and checked in NY where it was supposed to go twice and no luck. We made claims, but the claims won’t cover what we lost.

So my mother and other sister back home have tried calling the stations as well with the same results. My sister was even given a fake supervisor number that was the phone number to a hospital. She had then spent hours research why this is happening to find Greyhound is known for sketchy stuff and maybe we should get the authorities involved since our stuff may not be list, but stolen.

And to be completely honest, i hate it.
Yes, i am jealous. Because i just don't understand why he would feel the need to look at other girls in their bikins and cat ears if i am right here and supposedly ""good enough"" for him.
I get a boy will look at other girls, but purposely follow them and like their pictures?

477,"hello! I am starting a new job tomorrow at a camp ground maintaining it and cooking for guests. I have to move into the camp today for the job. I'm a very small girl (20F) and I'd be living with 2 older men and it makes me nervous. I'm also scared about moving away from my family and friends for the job (despite my friends being wishy washy atm). It seems like a slower life with a lot of activities plus being with nature, which attracted me to the job cause I lived alone in a big city before and hated it, plus never really fit in with retail culture.

When I applied for the job, I was absolutely in love with it but now that I have it, ive just been so scared and nervous and crying nearly every day before even getting there. I feel like I should be happy cause everyone seems nice and I'll basically have my life made (no rent, live in job, free dog lol) but I just cant stop worrying about different scenarios. Im not sure what's wrong with me and why I cant be happy for myself despite everyone else being happy for me.",13Mar2020,1
478,"I've posted about my dad before but last night everything went to shit.

Last night my younger brother (14m) and I(17f) where aruging over our Xbox(mature I know). My brother never wants to give it up so per usual I ask my parents to do something. It was around 7:30ish last night when I told my dad what was going on and he said I had to wait until 8:00pm even though my brother had been on for a while. I was pissed but I told my brother what my dad had said. My mom was asleep and heard this whole thing. 

She gets up and goes to talk to me and my brother. After some back and forth she convinces my brother to get off 20 minutes earlier then what my dad had said. I turn the Xbox back on and all Hell breaks loose. I don't see what happened but I heard my dad screaming that I had to get on at 8 and so on and so forth. He starts to screaming at me to get off the Xbox and then I heard my mom yell ""Don't push me"".  I know better then to object when my dad is like this so I log out and go into my room. I then hear my parents aruge more and hear my mom say ""Don't you dare hit me"" at this point I'm terrified and I call the non emergency Police line.

The cops show up and talk to my parents, I heard my mom cry for the first time and leave, I later learn they threatened my dad with arrest if they get another call. After they leave my dad calls both me and my brother out to our living room and asks who called the cops. He said he has an idea of how did it and after I said I did it, he attempts to gaslight me. I tell at him that he has pushed my mom before and he tells me to give up my phone. I say no and run into my parents room with my mom crying. After a while I run back into my room and make a report to CPS. My dad again tells me to give up my phone, I tell him no and block up my room door with my bedside table. Last night I was as scared as I've ever been and I'm still shaking typing this. My dad as at work now and my mom is off from work tonight but we will be alone someday and I no longer feel safe. While my mom pays my phone bill, I have a headset I paid for with my own money, I have a job, and I think my dad might have taken it so I'm not sure what do to about that.

First of all, this does not involve me, but my mother and grandmother.

So, long story short, my grandfather is really abusive and horrible. My mother moved in with my grandmother a few years ago after her marriage ended. Anyway, both my grandmother and mother are physically disabled. There have been a lot of verbal fights between him and them, but never really gotten physical. Yesterday, it did. Was Skyping with my mother and she had to hang up very abruptly. Apparently he tried to kill my grandmother yesterday. He choked her pretty bad and there were marks around her throat. Cops were called, he was arrested and charged with a felony. Pictures were taken, statements, etc. Currently he is still in jail as he doesn't have the $$ for bail. Now, the issue is: he will eventually get out, and probably in a few days, and when he does, they have no where to go to get away from him. They have no money (they have disability checks but obviously it's middle of the month, so no cash right now), and no car even. They live in a super tiny town too, so there is no such thing as a women's shelter. I am not able to help due to distance. Honestly I'm at the end of my rope and I don't know what to do, and they are scared and freaked out. Any sort of advice would be DEARLY appreciated.",13Mar2020,1

On Snapchat I seen him post something suspicious that made him look single and when I confronted him he said that it wasn’t him that posted it that it was maybe one of his friends ... then then it changed and he said 3 people own the account ... then he changed it again and said his ex has it. But it was a video of himself. Why would your friend or anybody post a video of him on his own account. I tried to get his Snapchat password but he wouldn’t let up. His gmail email is linked to that account. So now Things are suspicious. I bluntly asked for his gmail password and he wouldn’t let up. He has my ss number , every social media handle I have , and many more. His reasoning to not give me the password was because “I have personal things in their” which didn’t make any sense to me. I explained to him that it should be fifty fifty on both sides if I can give up my passwords you should to the same , and when he asks I give it up.

He got a custom ring made on etsy and it didn't arrive here on time. He asked me for the favor of shipping it to Prague and I said of course. In a 2 hour block I had between classes I went to 3 shipping offices and finally got it shipped from fedex. It was almost double the price he expected. He also wanted me to declare a 50 dollar value and I declared a 100. I could not find one text that said that before I shipped.

489,"Long story short, I was supposed to go back to my dorm on Sunday. Instead, my parents are now forcing me to come back home despite the campus itself having no cases nearby and then saying just yesterday it was fine for me to go back. I live in a private dorm that I’d feel much safer in if I got sick with the virus but they aren’t listening and are essentially fear mongering. All they listen to is the news, reading parent pages for my college, and only consuming media which is making this to be much much worse. 

I have a sensory issue with hearing and my hearing is really sensitive. My parents refuse to accommodate me at all and always have refused to. They both constantly blast two TVs and I am trapped in the middle listening to the two clash together, while trying to also do something myself. It drives me insane and it’s impossible for me to get any rest or relaxation where I’m not constantly tense because of it. 

I was wondering if anyone had advice on how to drown it out best. Usually I blast my ears with my headphones but it’s physically painful to do this. Asking my parents to use headphones or even turn down the volume is not an option. They call me selfish.

492,"When I was 16, I started dating a guy who was 32. We both knew each others' ages and both knew it was illegal in our state, but I thought it was exciting that an older man thought I was good enough. We kept it secret from my parents, teachers, and most of his friends until I turned 18. A couple of years later, we got married. Several years after that, we got divorced.

This whole time, the story has been that I seduced him and then convinced him to marry me. I'm really starting to question that, though. I'm younger now than he was when we first started dating and I sure as shit wouldn't bang a 16 year old. So, was he really so helpless against the unskilled wiles of a nerdy 16 year old? 

I didn't actually even think to question it until some of my friends were talking about the whole Drake texting young girls issue, and I thought ""wait, why is that not ok but my ex's behavior was fine?"" Basically, I'm trying to get outside opinions on this because I have no idea what's right here. Did I fuck him over? Or am I allowed to be a little upset here? 

I don't intend to press charges or anything like that, but would it be wrong to talk about it with my friends? It feels like a petty move, since they're his friends too.",13Mar2020,1
493,"So slightly weird situation, but I’ve been gaming online with a few people every weekend for the past year and a bit. 1 of them in particular I’ve become quite “close” to (if you can call it that... close in a gaming world sense?) despite never having heard each others voices or talking on mics, we’d play 2-3 days a week and message each other lots of banter and make each other laugh a lot. I’ve had an extremely hard year and there were many times when playing and chatting with this guy pulled me out of a bad place and cheered up my whole week. I always look forward to playing with him and have grown fond of him. That parts all a-ok. 

Recently, over the past month, we’ve moved over to texting most days. Not constantly but a few texts a day. Nothing super flirty (if it ever is flirty, it’s very clearly jokey and what I’d do it with any of my good mates) but there have been times when he’s said I’m pretty and expressed a fondness for me (once again, nothing super flirty, just an “aw thanks” moment and we move on). We’ve also been exchanging voice notes. I have a boyfriend of 3 years who I love very much and would say I’m very committed to. These 2 things have never clashed, and likely never will, as gaming guy lives 6 hours away from me and neither one of us has shown any kind of eager interest in meeting up - we’ve said it would be “cool to meet some day” but we’re not making any plan. He also knows I might be moving to another continent next year and showed no issue with it.

Yesterday he said he’s “not one of those guys who talks to a lot of girls” implying he was “talking” to me in some specific kind of way. Wasn’t sure what to make of it. I do get the feeling he is semi interested, but I also think he has no intention of making a big thing out of anything or trying to meet up ever, so it’s like, how far can any interest really go? Think we both just enjoy talking and that’s that. But we’ve never discussed relationships, so he doesn’t know I have a bf. He’s never asked, and I’ve never told him. It’s just not the direction conversation has ever gone in. Most of what we talk about is light jokey stuff with a bit of universal introspection thrown in. 

I’m starting to wonder if it’s becoming inappropriate that I don’t tell him about my bf. I’m worried it would be weird if I brought it up or if we’d stop talking/playing altogether (which I don’t thinkkk would happen?) which Id find really sad.

Has his own life troubles like everyone does though).


He has family who wholeheartedly love him for being him who never ask anything of him but to be himself. His family often say he’s cute and don’t mind him playing any video games because he enjoys it. They don’t mind him not working because he’s going to school to get a degree that makes a lot of money.

Meanwhile my mom constantly belittles me and alienated me for not being masculine enough. Her and her boyfriend constantly make fun of me for not acting stereotypically like my race. If I play video games or watch tv they make fun of the things I play or watch and I’m reluctant to do things while they’re around because they’ll make fun of me. My mom constantly wants my money (that she already obtains from me anyways) and tells me she needs it for bills but always buys clothes and appliances with it. Even if I ask her to order me fries when she goes to eat out she’ll go on a rant about how she’s struggling to pay bills.

Full day hours - 9 or 10am til 8 or 9 pm 
Half day hours - 4pm - 8 or 9 pm (sometimes I would have to pick her up from his job because he doesn’t have enough time to drop her off at my house.) 

Last week, he was in the hospital because he was smoking a pack of cigs a day (not his first time doing this.) He couldn’t take her to school so I had to watch her for 5 full days. When he got out, he immediately started smoking again, mind you. I don’t care what he does, my point is I’m doing extra work because of his bad habits. 

She went to school this week for 2 days but because of the Coronavirus closing down schools in my area, I’m going to have to watch her for the rest of the month. Full days. 

I told him to give me 700 this month instead of 600 &amp; he says that this is too expensive.

Am I being unreasonable? He doesn’t bring her food for the day and I’m feeding her the food out of my pocket.

That’s a dumb excuse to un add me. If I was mad i wasn’t gonna be mad forever. I texted him a snap saying “What did you mean by “Since you got mad i didnt want to bother you so i unadded you but that didnt work....what didn’t work? You gotta be more specific when you say things” 
I fell asleep and opened it and it said opened 1 hour ago. Are you fucking kidding me?? He gonna leave me on read? 
I needed a answer back. And I’m thinking so he just was gonna leave me on read and never respond? 

So I texted him about it I said “wildwood is cancelled this year damn how you feel about that. I saw you left me on read. Is there something you don’t wanna tell me? (Maybe in the hopes of hurting me feelings? Like you wanna stop talking) because I feel like there is. I can feel the tension. I’m just trynna see if we’re on the same page 😕😔” and he said “Nah, I just don’t feel like saying it. Wait said that wrong and well we all said we shouldn’t go to wildwood. It was the right choice. Idk what i said. I just daid you were mad the other day and i was trying to defending myself cause idk what you were getting mad for” the defending thing made no sense, most of his sentences aren’t even making sense. I feel like he doesn’t even know what to say to me. The way he was “defending” himself..He was going about that the wrong way then cuz all he was saying was “Your mad, your mad because I deleted you, you were mad yesterday, you were mad today, still were”

What don’t you feel like saying I can’t read your mind (tho I wish I could, oh lord that would make life easier lmao) It’s okay that you didn’t know what to say, seemed just as confused as I was.

+ I have a lot of free time (no SO, kids, or anything tying me down) but don't use it wisely to expand my career like I want to  
+ I compare myself to others way too much; for example, I'll spend a lot of time looking at other peoples' linkedin profiles and it gets me down, yet I can't stop.
+ I lack grit at the moment even though I have a history of overcoming challenges  
+ I often actively hunt for things to make me angry or engage in escapism (binge watching Netflix, laying down and listening to music) to procrastinate dealing with my problems   
+ I spend time on reddit that I should be using for studying, we're not talking minutes either. We're talking hours.  
+ **I am an excuse maker and always playing the victim**. It is **incredibly** toxic, defeatist, and loser-like
    + ""I should be studying to improve my income potential"" 
        + ""Psh, nah. No serious employer would see much in you, your resume is just bad and you're a lost cause""  
        + ""The economy is going to crash, nobody is hiring anyways so who cares?""  
    + ""I should be more positive, it will help me be successful""  
         + ""What? You read reddit often and should know that positive thinking and hard work doesn't lead to anything. You'll have medical issues and be forced to file for bankruptcy like everybody else because you will never get ahead""  



This is no way to live and this is not the best version of myself, I am not proud of what I am at this very moment. I struggle hard with forgiving myself for so much wasted time and sometimes engage in self-destructive habits like binge eating as some sort of punishment or something.

What can I do to get out of this rut? It is my biggest problem by far. Steps I've taken thus far:  

+ Gym membership  
+ Eating better  
+ Cutting back on reddit  (trying, but it's hard)
+ Putting myself in uncomfortable situations (cold showers, talking to strangers, etc).

I did tell this person I was not willing to meet until after the time they were an adult and I wouldn’t want to meet for a long while anywho.

I explained to her that in all honesty I'd never really been around kids and might get used to hers (paraphrasing a bit here basically explained that if her kid wasn't a pain I'd probs be cool) things went well for a bit then last night she stayed and said she needed to bring the kid I wanted her to come for childcare issues.

I cleaned the house, baby proofed it as best as I could with what little knowledge I had, was extremely concerned as i have a dog (who is totally fine i was worried about the dogs safety due to an excessive child) picked her up, loaded up 3 baby bags and a pushchair into the car and drove her to mine.

The moment we started to do literally anything the kid would wake up, so sex was out of the question and the kid woke up screaming at around 6am and didn't stop until around 10am. When that happened we both kinda flopped onto the bed exhausted and then we fucked.

 This girl really liked me and told me as much as well and I did kinda have similar feelings for her too but definitely not enough to take on the responsibility of a child I'm just not ready for that.

Now this all kinda hit me when I took her home and I basically just explained as honestly as I could that right now just isn't the best time for me to have and care for a child. I explained this in the car on the way home, it was in person rather than over text and I genuinely feel like I've done everything right but I legit feel so awful about it and regret having sex with her before we left the house, it all seems like an elaborate scheme for sex but I genuinely didn't know I was going to come to that decision until I was literally driving her home. AITA here, could I have done things differently?

509,"Hi all,

I’m supposed to be getting married on April 4 (22 days from now) in Northern California. Our county currently has no confirmed cases but about 80% of our guests have to fly into Sacramento. They will be traveling from all over the Midwest and East Coast. 

I’m worried that it is too late to cancel our vendors as we have paid for everything at this point. I also don’t want to wait and then have them restrict domestic flights and no one can make it anyway.

i just got out of an extremely abusive relationship 6 months ago and recently started dating - so i don't know what's up or down here.

we've been on like 7 dates and i go to her apartment sometimes and i visit her at work

i like her a lot. like a lot a lot. she's extremely smart and funny and we click really well. we worked together a while back and i had a crush on her then. she says she likes me and i say i like her. we went on a date the other day then headed back to her apartment, we made out in her bed and touched and she tried to initiate PIV with me and i told her we could wait for that. literally minutes later she calls another guy, we watch TV for a minute and then the guy shows up at her door and she throws my pants at me and leaves

i leave my wallet on her house on accident, come back and sit outside for an hour waiting to text back. call her twice, lets it ring out. i knock on her door and she's awake, and so is the guy in bed with her

i think she has a lot of issues and ""daddy"" issues because she is wrecklessly promiscuous - enough to get genital herpes. but i care about her and like holding her and want to be with her. i got tested today to see if i have it as well, because like 20% of the population does.

is this a situation i should entertain any longer? am i just being young and dumb or are there any options from here on out?

1. I'm extremely attractive. 
2. He's extremely attractive.

So this super cute girl I love hooked up with this dude, it really f\*&amp;ks with me.

Her just being super vulnerable naked and ""giving herself to him"".   


So, like, I had previous partners too, also very attractive. I totally get it. This is NOT logical, it's emotional.  


So I really think and feel this is THE ONE, I want to marry this girl, that's why this messes with me. 

The problem is though, whenever we potentially get intimate, I literally get intrusive thoughts and feel really bad feelings about this dude. I literally cannot enjoy the present moment, and our experience together, because of the bullshit stinky past of that dude and what happened with him.

I don't want to bring this up and tell her, because I don't want her to think I am like insecure or something. I'm truly not, it's just this other dude all over my wife and her with him just really .... not good feelings, am I right? I would have rather that didn't happen. At least this is how I emotionally react, helplessly. It just sucks and he ruins everything. It's almost fucking traumatic.   


It totally ruins OUR experience together. It's awful. Like a clear blue sky and he's like this inky smudge all over it, ruining it. No matter what. He comes into my mind everywhere I go with her, or like with like intimacy, ""well, he kissed these lips. Well she sucked his.... well wow, she's kissing down my abs but she kissed down his abs too.. why am I special?"" it's so fucked up. He ruins everything and I feel horrible about it all.

I want her to keep safe, I tell her to be careful when it comes to some stuff.

So I've been back and forth to counsellors and therapists for years, sometimes it helped, other times not so much, but recently I was self harming and made plans to end my life. After this I split up with my ex, which has helped to a degree as I don't feel suicidal as much, but I have a lot of anger and self hatred inside stemming from years of bullying and an abusive father.

This week has been hard, I begged my psychologist to help me, I pleaded in tears for them to take me seriously because this animal in my head, this monster version of me is slowly taking over and when it does I have no control over my actions, it screams at me constantly, it wants to burn the world, it wants to kill everyone it sees and if I can't keep it under control then it is going to kill someone or I am going to be forced to kill myself to protect everyone else. I can't even look myself in the eyes in a mirror because I see that fucking thing looking at me through my own eyes.

Basically they've said they're going to put me through a ""multidisciplinary psychological intervention"" to try to help, honestly I have no idea what that actually entail but I have 2 weeks to wait minimum before that starts. So I'm asking for any advice on what I can to to control myself in the meantime and if anyone knows what this ""intervention"" entails, I've never had one so I'm unsure.

He always blames me initially when we fight and says that I provoke him and I think I’m so innocent.

But I also sometimes drink when I'm alone, after the most rough days at works.  (1 glass, around 1 time a month. Enough to get me drunk)  


My friends , who drink all less than me ( I'm the ""heaviest"" drinker here), think it's an awful way to solve my issues but If I don't do that the issue against which I'm drinking can turn around my head and have intrusive thoughts for months, who sometimes causes panic attack and loose of sleep and more impact on my work.

  
Most of my issue are guilt : there is things that I did bad at work and I need to fix after, sometimes with a coworker. Ones it's fixed, the gilt overtake me and destroy me slowly.  More I write this post, more I think Alcool is not a way to avoid fixing my mistake. It's a way to avoid guilt

544,"We have never met our friends sibling, I have only seen photos of them on social media. Not only are they attractive, but also extremely successful. 

Why does this make me worried? 

Because I have major insecurity issues, a past littered with partners who cheated or were abusive, and a low sense of self-worth. I tend to compare myself to others without intending to, and when my SO is around it becomes amplified. I feel threatened by my SO's interactions with others at times and therefore I begin overanalyzing the situation as a means to protect myself-
 ""are they better looking than me?"" 
""They do XYZ, that's really cool, and I'm not interesting at all""
""My SO is looking at them a lot and probably imagining being with them"" 
""My SO is making them laugh, my SO must be into them"" 
Etc.

I'm currently terrified about going to this gathering with friends because I've already decided in my mind that my SO will become interested in/attracted to our friends sibling and, while I don't question for a second that my SO would ever leave me or cheat on me, just the simple idea that I will have to sit with feelings of jealousy and discomfort and crazy thoughts throughout the duration of our hangout is unbelievably uncomfortable. I typically avoid situations where I don't know who will be present because of this stupid worry I have. This get together will be the first time I'm pushing myself outside my comfort zone and trying to work through it.

By the way, I don't act on my feelings when this happens, I simply communicate about it with my SO, but I don't want to have this feeling of dread and worry hanging over me. I hate it so much. It overtakes any ability I have to just relax and have a good time.

I have been making a big effort every single day to overcome my insecurity and to develop my self-worth. I've been attending counseling for about 2 years and that has helped very much! Also, my SO is very supportive, we talk through everything regularly, and I have no reason at all to question his intentions with me nor question his feelings for me. We are both very happy together, aside from my struggles in this area.

That's the reason I'm reaching out today- I would so appreciate some support with this struggle I'm having. How can I let go of these negative thoughts and worries about my SO potentially finding someone else attractive and, instead, try to enjoy my time with my SO and friends? 


Tl;dr: I struggle with insecurity, especially surrounding my SO interacting with other people of the opposite sex.

That’s how I got the job — he said he would train me, but never really did and trained them Male that had been hired three months after I had already been working there. I have worked there since May 2019. About 9-ish months. Business has been down for them and I’ve been on call but they haven’t called me in three weeks but have called in the male coworker everyday and another female who was there before me who is in her late 60s-early 70s. I know I should have quit awhile ago because the boss has made me cry and it ticked my parents off he did that. Now I am not sure what I want to do. I do not have much money in my bank, around $11 soon to be more around $100 . I earned about $100-200 every two weeks but now nothing since I’m not working. My anxiety is through the roof and I’ve been worrying about EVERYTHING. My mom suggested that I try and find a job at another vet clinic before I decide that’s what I don’t want to do because it could just be the vet treatment towards me halting me from that field. I’ve been looking  around and no part time jobs available and I need that because I take care of my grandma too. Everything is falling apart and I’m having anxiety attacks. I need help/tips on saving money. I also support my animals. A beardie, a leopard gecko and two guinea pigs. It’s not that much but I just need some basic help. And advice. My mom also said that if I didn’t like the new clinic that I would go to community. I’m afraid I won’t be able to provide for myself.",13Mar2020,1

557,"Hi, Reddit. I have another account, one of selfies of myself, and I posted on a draw me sub, and this guy asked if I'd be a model for a project he's working on. I said, alright. I was cool with it for the most part, until he mentioned, ""you lost a bet and you're forced to do a sexy cam show"", and I was a little scared.

When I was younger, I was tempted into playing a game online which involved me getting sexy for the camera, and the man who organized the game said he was going to put the sexy video online if I didn't send him nudes. 

I noped out, then some time later, I explained why I couldn't do that prompt. He encouraged me not to give up, but I'm not sure.

Should I back out of the art project entirely?",13Mar2020,1
558,"I've read a lot of these posts and I usually wonder why they didn't edit them. Now, I see why. We want to squeeze in all the elements we consider important. Thank you for being patient in reading mine. I'm in a rut and very much would appreciate constructive advice.

My girlfriend is in her late 20's and I am in my mid-thirties. I live in the United States; she's in Canada. We see each other for about a week once a month. There are a significant amount of clear signs that we have a maturity difference between us, as well as several examples of character differences. We enjoy many of the same things (exercise, outdoors, reading, music), but the ability for her to vocally communicate is incredibly strained. I connect to someone romantically, energetically, and intellectually through vocal expression and she is intensely introverted to the point to where we will have multiple minutes of quiet if I don't fill the silence during conversations. When we hang out, it's a lot of physical affection, sharing activities/adventures that I set up, and enjoying something external together. We both enjoy quality time and physical touch, but my primary Love Language is through verbal communication. I'm extroverted and definitely connect with people through talking about ideas and being silly. When we talk, there is virtually nothing that she offers that stimulates me. There are no stories that interest me, no fascinating insights into life, no fun-facts, no excitement to share something she read or experienced, no jokes that I laugh at, and no silliness. I make it important to share things throughout my day like memes, funny videos, and saying jokes. I've tried to help her vocalize and get creative and unfortunately her responses to my conversation questions are always predictable (""I dunno""), never funny or playful, and they are just the facts. I've talked with her about my concerns, but despite her attempts to talk more, the vocal chemistry just isn't there at all.
Growing up as the youngest in her family, she never had encouragement to share her personality and was always shushed and disregarded. As a result of that, I believe she never learned how to communicate in a way that she was comfortable with and never learned how to come out of her shell or explore herself or learn to let go socially. We've been together for a little over a year and my hopes of her expanding her ability to vocalize internal thoughts just isn't there. I have come to the conclusion that she either doesn't have anything to share that I connect with or she lacks the verbal capability and confidence to express them to where I rarely ever see it. In each of our conversations every night there may be, within 1 hours time, one or two things she says that I consider it to be stimulating in some way. The rest of the conversation, without my talking, is generally silence. When I've talked to her about this, she says that's just the way she is and she likes listening, instead.

One of the strongest areas that we differ is that I know what I want out of my career, my relationship, and I'm always thinking of what I may want for myself. I know that I want children and a family, I know that there are several things in my life that I would love to have that require investment. When we first met, she didn't know if she wanted monogamy (she never had a relationship before), but since being together she strongly desires it and marriage. This is one example of many where she didn't know if she wanted something I would consider Important in my life.
She has a full time professional job, but still lives with her parents, and still doesn't know what career she would like to switch to after expressing dissatisfaction for her current profession. It's exceptionally difficult for her to make decisions in her life and she's expressed that.
When I have asked her if she wants kids, plans to move out soon from her parents' house, or if she's leaning towards a particular career, she will just tell me ""I dunno yet"" and it's been that way for the better part of our year together. It's always that she doesn't know. I asked her 6 months ago whether she would like to have kids or not and recently asked if she had any further clarity since that time. She said she still doesn't know what she wants, even as a hypothetical (""I'd love to have a kid with you if that happened unexpectedly, but I don't know if it's what I actively want. I just know I want to be with you""). 

The pain I'm experiencing currently is due to the fact that I simply don't want to let her go, but feel it might be best. I know that we are incompatible in many ways, but I've never had someone who is so incredibly feminine and puts me in my masculine in such a passionate way. Even after sex we get along incredibly well, it's comfortable, affectionate, and we get along. She's always up for any activity, responds very well to my personality, and enjoys my playfulness. I love the experience of sharing things together. 

I would love so badly for this to work out, but I can't help but feel that we are trying to force compatibility and that a breakup might be best. After all, you have to love someone for who they are now, right? I also selfishly hate the idea of her being with other people (I know that shouldn't be a deciding factor).
Any thoughts or recommendations, especially personal experiences, would be helpful.

559,"This is so ridiculous I can’t even believe I have to type it out.  I (22F) work part time for a very small company (6 employees including myself) and my bosses are an elderly couple who have a cat that lives in the office.  I adore cats and have had cats my whole life, but this one if different.  She is very aggressively playful and will target and attack me.  I do nothing to prompt this. Sometimes it’s when I’m walking to the bathroom or to get something, other times I’m sitting eating lunch.  She has drawn blood multiple times.  She will hide behind corners, jump out, and latch on to me with her claws and teeth.  It’s extremely painful. 

I’ve told my bosses and other employees about this and it’s brushed off every time.  Others will tell me “she’s just that way with new people” but I’ve been working there for nearly 2 months now and it hasn’t gotten any better.  She’ll sometimes swipe at others, but doesn’t full-on attack them. One of my bosses says she attacks me because I’m scared of her, and if I get over my fear, she’ll stop.  But as I said, I love cats, but I’m scared of her now BECAUSE she attacks me.  I can’t just make that go away.  And most of the time she attacks me I’m just sitting/walking minding my own business.  The other boss joked “maybe you were a dog in a past life. Haha” and walked away.  To be fair, I haven’t had a serious talk with them about it, but I’ve showed them my several bandaids and cuts, and they still don’t do anything about it.  

I carry a spray bottle with me everywhere now, which works sometimes but it mostly makes her just run away and then try to get me again 30 seconds later.  I’m afraid to get up and even use the restroom.  This feels like a very hostile work environment.  I feel bad asking for the cat to be locked in a room while I’m there (I’m there 5 hours per day, 4 days per week), but I don’t know of a better solution.  I have serious cuts all over my arms and legs and I’m worried I may get an infection one day. 

If anyone can help with how I approach this in a serious manner to my boss, I’d appreciate it. 

TL;DR Boss’s aggressive office cat targets and attacks me quite often and draws blood.  I can’t seem to get them to take the situation seriously and now I’m  scared at work.",13Mar2020,1

561,"Hello,

I am finishing my Bachelors in Graphic Design and received a commission for some fliers by my best friend's sister. She owns a professional business that needs these fliers for some upcoming events. The flier examples she sent me via email were made using word templates, so she wants me to redesign them into something more professional. I have the skill to be able to make some great designs, but nothing near expert level. That being said, I don't know how much to charge since I am still in these intermediate stages of my career. Currently, at my hospital job I get paid \~$20/hour, so I figured maybe that would be worth charging per hour since that is what my time is worth on the daily. However, I don't know how to factor in all the details like my intro level and her being my friend's sister. Any advice on how to handle this and what to charge?

562,"Dear Redditors,
I am currently attending a grammar school in Switzerland. In my school there are many intelligent students and as for me I would consider myself in the top 80-90%(Not bc. of the intelligence but gradeswise as of spending a lot of time learning). Now since I haven't been very physically active in the last years I wanted to start a sport and started working out. I was always interested in playing something physical as rugby and decided I want to try it since it looked very cool. Now my question is, will I get dumb through playing such a physical sport? I personally know two rugby players at the school and they seem to be very dedicated. I've read that playing a physical sport will make me lose brain cells and I will eventually get dumb(?) or will it much more affect my grades/intelligence? I sometimes cover this regret with the fact that people in my class play street hockey and soccer and these sports can also be pretty physical but is that also true for rugby? And if you get dumb through rugby why is it offered at Universities like Cambridge?
Thank you for any future answers.",13Mar2020,1

Yesterday she was playing a game and since we were on discord, it says what someone is playing and whatever, and I was messaging her and she wasn't responding. But, then I asked if she was doing good on the game and I guess she realized I knew she wasn't responding because of the game, so she was like ""oh yeah I'm trying to get this ending blalala.""

So she was reading all my texts, but only responded when she knew I knew why she wasn't messaging me back.

571,"A little background on this cat is he is (I think) 8 years old and I've known him for a year and a half and lived with him for almost a year and we've always gotten along. When I moved in he would often sneak into my closet to sleep in my socks and was always very affectionate. 3 days ago I adopted a cat of my own, a 1 year old female, and things have taken a turn. We kept them separate the first day so they could smell one another and get used to it and then introduced them through a baby gate. He was defensive but when she was out of site he calmed down so we decided to keep them separate longer. Yesterday I had been giving my roommates cat and her dog attention as normal and went to check on my cat. I had the baby gate still closed but opened my door to see her and the other cat came to investigate, saw her, hissed and made the dog come investigate which spooked him and had him run under my roommate's bed where he proceeded to his and yell and attack the bed curtain. When  he calmed down he came out and hid under the kitchen table and wasn't outright aggressive so I thought that was it and once my roommate got home he'd be back to himself completely. Instead when my roommate got home he stayed under the table and when I went to go to the kitchen he started hissing and yelling again and when my roommate went to investigate he was aggressive towards her to the point she opened the balcony door for him and let him cool down for half the night because any time he saw either of us he'd start hissing and yelling. When she checked on him at 2am he was very cuddly and thought things were back to normal but when he saw me when I went to give him his usual morning treat he started hissing and yelling  all over again. I absolutely love him and as much as I love my cat this was his house first, although at this point I feel like he thinks *I'm* the problem because he hasn't seen the other cat since yesterday afternoon.

579,"I wouldn’t read this is self harm or suicide is especially triggering to you, I will be going into detail to try and get the best advice possible.

Sorry for the length.

So I’ve been self harming on and off for the past few months, as in I’d do a lot of damage to myself for a few days and then stop for a few weeks before relapsing. Cutting is a really bad addiction, please don’t jump all over me for this, I understand that it’s a crap coping mechanism but even after you realize it doesn’t really help you’re usually too far in to completely stop. The longest I’ve gone since this started without cutting has been sometime over a month, and I was very proud of myself. I’ve made the decision to stop for as long as I can now, hopefully earlier his week was the last time this will happen.

I have suicidal thoughts all the time. It’s always on my mind. Different methods with which I could go about doing it, stuff like that. I was very suicidal about three or four years ago, and then again sometime over a year ago and it never really went away that time, just getting slightly better and slightly worse. I’ve become very good at hiding it. No one knows about my self harming, aside from the three first cuts I did which my Mom saw a few weeks after I did them (I thought I wouldn’t do it again, but then I relapsed a few weeks later). Everyone thinks that I’m getting better, and I am when it comes to a different condition, but it feels like my depression keeps pulling me deeper and deeper and all I want to do is die. Killing myself isn’t exactly my first choice, just not being here is what I want, but I know it doesn’t work like that.

I decided last week that I would tell my therapist how I’ve been feeling. Most of our conversations have been pointless and not helpful, I think it may be because I’m not telling him about being suicidal and cutting. I didn’t want to ruin everything for everyone who thinks that I’m getting better which is why I haven’t told anyone. Also because I don’t want to be sent away. Anyways, I chose to wait until spring break is over to tell my therapist all this stuff because I didn’t want to get sent away and have my parents get told and ruin spring break for everyone.

I’m very scared of being sent to an inpatient facility. I’ve spent like, three months at a treatment center (part in partial hospitalization, which is spending 8 hours at the treatment center on weekdays with other kids and then intensive out-patient, which is three hours at the center three days a week in group therapy with other kids) and I don’t want to have to do it all over again. I did some self harming while I was there, but never told anyone because another girl admitted that she had relapsed and they almost sent her back to the start before she convinced them she wouldn’t do it again. At the center, you didn’t really ask why people were there, instead you just listened to what they had to say and if they wanted you to know something you’d hear it so I never asked anyone who came from inpatient what they’d done (so I’m not sure if self harm gets you out in there or not, or suicidal thoughts) so I’m not sure if I’ll get put in there or not if I tell my therapist.

What I dread most is my parents being upset. I know they’ll be disappointed that I didn’t tell them, and might want to see my cuts but I don’t want to show them. My mom will most likely want to see but I seriously don’t want anyone to see them. Right now, although I’m not getting the help I need, I am in my own house and not spending my time in a bed that isn’t my own. I really don’t want to be sent away.

Has anyone who’ve been in my situation told and been sent away? I’m really curious about what will happen if I tell. I was sure I’d tell this Saturday, when my next appointment is, but spring break has been extended another week because of corona virus so I’m thinking if I do end up telling it won’t be until a week from Saturday when spring break is actually over because I really don’t want to ruin it for my family. 

Will I get sent to a facility if I tell my therapist all this stuff? Should I even tell at all? Thank you so, so much to anyone who reads this far and thanks for any advice. I just don’t know what to do, I feel so stuck.",13Mar2020,1

I get so nervous around them and I’ve never felt this way before even when other strangers have asked for my number and I’ve said no straight away",13Mar2020,1

583,"I recently found out that my brother had an affair back in November and now he's having a baby. He came to visit home while me and my sister were home for spring break from college and we spent the weekend hanging out. Since December, him and his wife have been having trouble and she mentioned an affair but it wasn't confirmed. Now, last night I overheard his wife and my mom on a phone call and she told my mom that he was having a baby.  I'll admit that this wasn't great on my behalf but my mom forgot her phone at home and I ended up going through the messages and found the girl's Instagram where she had a bunch of baby shower/pregnancy pictures posted. My bother wasn't directly in any of the pictures, just his hands or his feet, but I know it's him because he has a scar on his wrist. It makes me feel so sick that he spent the weekend with me and acted like nothing happened. He's having a baby and didn't tell any of his family about it. He hasn't mentioned a single word to us about a baby and the girl hasn't contacted anyone about it. He doesn't know that I know about the affair and the baby. I don't want to believe that my brother is that much of a horrible person but it's literally sitting right in front of me. I know it's both him and that girl's fault but I already can't stand her. I cannot fathom why they think it's a good idea to bring a baby into a situation where it will have resentment pushed at it for just being born. I don't want to have any hatred or resentment at the baby for what it's parents have done but I don't know if I can look at it and act like my brother didn't do something awful. I love my brother but it really hurts me that he didn't say anything. I know that he probably wanted things to feel normal before everyone found out and gets angry with him. I don't know how I'm supposed to feel about him and this baby. I don't know how to talk to him about it without him shutting me out. Sorry this was sloppily written.",13Mar2020,1
584,"Let me start out with some background info: there have been some issues with my best friend (22F) and I (22F). She doesn't have her drivers license (no reason she has just been procrastinating), she lives about 45 min away from me and an hour from my work, I recently switched jobs to a much lower paying job and have been struggling a little financially. She used to really struggle financially but now has an amazing job making a lot of money.

I also want to say I love her so much but I've just been feeling a little used lately and I'm not sure what to do. I don't want to be the person that is always tit for tat but some of her behavior since she got her new job has really shocked me.

Ok so we hang out almost every week at my house (no biggie she still lives with her fam I don't really care about that part) so because she doesn't have a drivers license I drive the 45 min to her house and turn around to go back to mine. I never ask for gas money because I used to have a really good job and she didn't so I never asked (I also don't really want to ask her for gas money, I usually never ask anyone I just don't like doing it). When we hang out my house I always (seriously every time) pay for take out and munchies.

Again this wasn't really a big deal until she got this new job and her behavior changed. We went out to dinner yesterday and got 1 check. She asked me if I would put it on my card and she would Venmo me (which is what we usually do but she doesn't pay me back). I didn't have enough in my account to cover both of us so I asked if she could do it. She actually huffed at me and reluctantly pulled out her card. As soon as the waiter picked it up she started hounding me to pay her back, which I was shocked because I am really good about paying people back right away and I have payed for almost everything since our friendship started. She wouldn't stop until I pulled out my phone and did it right then.

I am super hurt because she's like a sister to me and now that our financial positions are reversed I thought she would be a little more forgiving. I don't want her to pay for everything I just want things to be a little more even especially now that she has a really good job and I'm struggling.

I've also tried to help her get her license, but she just refuses to do it I tried to help her find lessons but they were too expensive, her mom never has time to teach her so I offered to but she never takes me up on it. I feel like she just expects me to driver her everywhere so she doesn't have to get her license.",13Mar2020,1

My school is closed because of Covid-19 and even though I don't like the school I have to admit that I'm a tad sad about it because that means I'm not going to be able to see her. I don't see her often since we both don't share common classes and when I see her she's always with her friends and shit and I have no excuse to introduce myself to her.

590,"So I’m interested in becoming a cosmetic tattoo artist (microblading, lip pigmentation, permanent eyeliner, etc.), and was looking into the courses that a local beauty academy offers. Right now I have about $2k saved towards the class, but the problem is that the full fundamental course that covers all areas of cosmetic tattooing is $5200. 

At the rate I’m able to save (currently have a pretty low paying job in a high rent area), it would probably take me close to the end of the year to save up enough to pay that amount. 

However, there’s a course that focuses solely on microblading (just with the pen, no machine techniques) that is $1,900. I could definitely afford this option.

My question is do I continue saving and working a miserable job until I can do the comprehensive course or do I do the cheaper option, begin making more money than I am now in a better career, but inevitably have to spend more money for the full course later down the road?",13Mar2020,1

592,"I just got pulled over for the first time in 2 years and yet again, as always, the cops was rude and curt. He had no interest in hearing what I had to say and just demanded license and registration. It honestly feels like they've already decided that I'm getting a ticket the moment they see my face and aren't interested in hearing the reason.

Was I going 72 in a 55 because of an emergency? Who knows! Not that cop, because he left no space for me to talk. Within 2 seconds of walking up he was already trying to walk away with my license.

How can I turn this around? This feels like some sort of discrimination based on how I look or talk, and I doubt I can change that. Any advice on how to change myself to get the cop out of that predetermined ""he's gonna get a ticket"" mindset would be fantastic.",13Mar2020,1

597,"So as the title suggest I have really noisy neighbors. this is not the first time or second time that they have been really loud and I have tried confront them about that in a very polite and respectful manner. But nothing seems to help the situation. on Christmas day they are playing their music really loud until about 2:30 or 3 in the morning and at that point I finally went over and knocked on their door and just told them hey I'm trying to go to sleep could you please turn the music down and they turned it down slightly but I can still hear it and end up falling asleep just because of sheer exhaustion that night. And about 2 weeks ago one of their friends was also at the apartment and was outside on the balcony walk way area between our two apartments I had asked if he was there at the apartment and if he could have them turn the music down which they did not. I also work from home for a call center as well and luckily none of my customers or anybody in my company has said anything about the background noise from their music. But I can hear it all day when I'm supposed to be working which distracts me from be able to do my job because I cannot hear what the person on the phone is saying to me all the time because the music is so loud. Today about an hour and a half maybe 2 hours ago I called my apartment management company and told them of the issue and they said that they would take care of it so I assumed they would have a phone call to their apartment and if they have called then they are not listening because I can still hear them. I have just called the non-emergency phone number for my town and asked if they could send somebody out to tell the neighbors to turn it down and that hasn't helped either. it just seems really excessive because today when I called the management company and called the non-emergency number for the police I had my dishwasher and my dryer and TV all playing at the same time in my apartment and I can still hear their music over top of those appliances. And I've already tried to confront them in the past about the music and nothing seems to help. I can't move out of my apartment because my lease is not up until October and I don't have the financial means to be able to break my lease and start a lease with another apartment. I like my apartment because I like the layout and I like the space and I like the location of it I just have really noisy neighbors. I know I can't have it all and that there is normally some give and take in life. But this is affecting my job because I cannot hear the customers and it's also affecting my sleep by having them play music really loud at night and even just having authority figures intervene they are not turning down the music.

TLDR; noisy neighbors that I have tried confronting in the past and that I've called management company and non-emergency police for assistance and neighbors not turning down their music, any suggestions?",13Mar2020,1
598,"My story starts basically all the way in August when me and my longtime friend moved into a place together, two months pass and my roommate starts finally getting close to this girl that he has apparently been chasing for a couple of years and they end becoming a couple and she moves in to get away from her abusive ex.  More time passes and me and my roommates girl find out we are actually super similar, with me being a little more chill, she has helped me and given me advice and I did the same for her, we were basically in this together since my friend just kind of stuck to himself.  Fast forward some more and things blow up, now I'm not one to doubt wether it's true or not but my roommate does have a history of going in for a quick fuck by turning up the charm and then dropping them to find a new person, so basically now his girl is accusing him of cheating, again I neither deny nor defend it because he has done it before such as sleeping with one of his exes mom's and cousins, and so it escalates more and more until the point that they break up and he kicks her out.
Now here we are a couple weeks later and I didn't cut off contact with her like my roommate did because we helped each other out a lot and really bonded, but idk now that my roommate is out of the picture it's like our feelings for each other just came bursting out and I don't know if I should act on it or not, please help.

601,"My parents are both doctors and I come from a privileged family. One of my older relatives has decided to move out to a spiritual retreat area he owns with his close family to isolate himself from the virus, there are 70-100 that are expected to stay there. He has called my parents multiple times about it and my dad has been convinced that this is the only solution we have. However, being in a small isolated location with 100 people will probably increase my chances of getting sick, if not from corona then from something else.

The cases in my whole country have not reached 100. My city has barely 10 cases. I do NOT want to go to an isolated place 5-6 hours away from home for an indefinite period of time. My dad claims that this retreat place has ""all the facilities"". I know the place does not because I have been there. There is no internet, barely any working sewage systems and is overall not designed to sustain life for anything other than a retreat.

They want to shift my 75+ year old grandmother in a car for 5-6 hours on bumpy roads when we all know she gets severe leg pain during the 15 minute drive from her house to ours.

When asked about the possibility of us receiving help if we do get infected, I was told that we have ambulances that this relative has made and the on-call doctors will help us. I said we have the same facilities in the city so there is no need to move out. They responded saying these facilities will be in use. I dont know how that ensures that the facilities will be free when we need them but okay.

I asked about food: when we run out of food what will we do, how will we get more food? They said we can just order fruits and vegetables. I said okay, even if we do order it, how exactly is that cutting off all human contact like you claim we will do. They said it's a gated community so the virus cannot enter as no one will be allowed in and food will be dropped at the entrance. This has not yet been arranged for. I know most of these people have not lived in a house without some kind of assistance and I asked if they will be able to handle making food and looking after 100 people. Since they are privileged, they will have staff present to help instead. This obviously does not make sense.

This has been going on for a week. I dont know what to do. They keep bringing up facts about the virus, like it has killed many people, but I know that already. It does not mean we completely leave the city. Why not start with self-isolation that they have not followed? They claim that some great-great-grandfather of mine did the same during the bubonic plague and the whole family survived, but I dont even know where to begin to respond to that. They read messages from uninformed, panicked relatives and relay the same like it's factual news. They said they want to take a call after seeing what Trump says even though he is the president of an entirely different country with a very different approach.

603,"I'm a 16 year old female, single child (I have 3 adoptive older brothers, but they are all older adults in their late 20s and late 30s  and I currently live with my parents alone. I don't see them often, or feel comfortable asking them what my dad was like to them). A little bit of history first. I've watched videos from when I was a baby, and my dad was always there, always laughing and smiling with my mom, so I think that this is sort of a new thing. We moved from Florida back to New York when I was 3 and everything seemed to change. I don't know if this is anything important, but my dad took a different flight than us (mom and grandma) and came back at a different time for whatever reason. Btw, the grandma i'm talking about is on my mom's side of the family. Between the ages of 4-5, I stayed with my mom and grandma because my dad lived in a different house for space reasons and money issues (my grandma didn't work during that time, my grandpa was in a completely different country, and they were divorced). My mom was studying to get her nursing degree and I was left mostly with my grandma. My dad always came around with mangoes during summer, new clothes, or he took me to the park (he also drove me to school whenever my mom wasn't free). He and my mom occasionally went out together too. During that time we were all very close. It all started when we moved in with him.

At 6 years old (my mom also got her degree) my mom and I left to live with my dad, leaving my grandma the house. During that time we still struggled with money issues and space issues. In both houses we had to sleep in one bed, so we all were together almost 24/7. My dad changed a little. He was still the same personality wise, but we stopped going go the park together, and that was REALLY important for us and I valued that time. Sort of like bonding time, you know? That bothered me, but being 6 years old, I thought he was just tired. Seven years old was kind of a blur, the same old same old, except my dad was getting more distant. Meaning as he wasn't at home as much as he used to be and he wasn't with me and my mom as much as he was when we didn't live together. At 8-9 we moved to a way bigger house and money was all good, yet my dad still didn't want to go anywhere with me unless he absolutely had to (like school). From 10-16 years old it is way worse. When I have to stay home (just with him since he works from home and my mom has to actually go to work), he treats me like a stranger in his own home. He keeps conversations short with me and when I try to hug him he barely acknowledges me. He only interacts with me to call me down for lunch or dinner (my mom makes breakfast). Right now I'm pretty sick with the flu, and he doesn't even care enough to check up on me when he hears me coughing and throwing up. If I'm lucky, maybe I get an ""Are you okay?"" screamed at me from his room. When I cry, he just tells me to stop and doesn't try to console me. He's also always had anger issues. If I show the smallest amount of disobedience, he goes off on a tangent. He's also like this with my mom. They argue a lot now. He is screaming at the top of his lungs while my mom is calmly explaining that he is wrong in whatever he did, not listening to her points at all. He always insists he is right even when he was wrong. I never saw my parents argue like this before and it has been going on for a while now.

606,"Hey guys long post. So I’m currently a GCSE student (year 11) in the UK studying: Art, Geography, DT, and Further Maths (along with English, Maths, and Science). I’m on the verge of choosing my A-level options and have had extensive conversation with my head of Sixth Form and other teachers as well. It could also be important that I don’t have any specific plans for University, I’m not against it but I’m also not for it.

Originally, after much deliberation, I chose: Fine Art, Geography, and Mathematics however, there is a clash between maths and geography meaning that I have to change one of those. My deliberation is about what I’m going to change it to. Changing to a different Sixth Form or College is neither something I want or would be viable for me to do.

My current grades in both subjects are: really high grade 8 (geo), and low-mid grade 8 (maths) so basically the same. For now I think that I’ll chose geography over maths as, even if it might be more useful, I’m not planning to go into a heavily mathematical at all and I also enjoy geography and it’s contents far more.

For the third option I can chose between: History, English literature, English language, and Photography. Everything else is mostly unappealing to me.

History - I had a difficult time choosing between it and geography for my GCSEs as I have a interest in both and still do research it from time to time. However I kind of lost a bit of the love for it over time (still like it though) and don’t know if I would be super interested in the specific topics being taught (I chose Geography because it was more general). Also have literally no close ties or ties in general to the department.

Photography - it seems quite appealing to me and after some discussion I feel like I would enjoy the subject. I like how it’s mostly open ended and taught by my current art teacher (who is great)

Both English's - I grouped these together because these are the main two which I probably want to chose from. Around the beginning of August 2019 I began getting hugely into reading and specifically storytelling. I was always into storytelling in games and other forms of media a lot but then it went onto another level with books and me wanting to make my own stories and stuff like that. I’m still not sure if I want to tell them through writing or art or whatever (probably both) but I waaant it. So I suppose what I’m asking here is which one would be most beneficial in my case? Before this time English was by far my worst subject performance wise (still sort of is) as I had a straight grade 4 for both throughout close to all of years 9 and 10 (set one had a terrible teacher in year 10 so all is sort of behind what we should be) but in 3 months I jumped to grade 6 in language and grade 5 in literature. That was in November (2019) and I just finished my second set of mocks today so I’ll see how I’m doing now soon. I think right now I prefer language slightly just due to the creative language section in it (also barely missed a grade 7 for that section). My Sixth Form leader has also said that they think one of the English's is the best choice for me so there’s that. 

I mainly just want to see what the courses contain and what people think would suit my situation, thanks.

TL:DR - enjoy storytelling and either want to draw or write (something along those lines) in the future, struggling to chose between English literature and language, which one would be better?Why.",13Mar2020,1

608,"Hi guys, Thank ya'll for allowing me to reach out. I'm having a difficult time, and my family is unsupportive and could use some advice.  Recently my partner moved out, and it's been breaking my heart.    


For the last month, she's been really cold and distant while being randomly loving from time to time. Our biggest issue was that we'd get into patterns of arguing with each other, and we've said/done things in the past. I've let go of everything, to me the past is the past and things said out of frustration don't speak to the core of the person.   


Her biggest issue is that she can't let go of anything from the past. Things said 2-3 years ago, she still think about on a regular basis. She believes there's nothing she can do to get rid of her thoughts, and she just sits and focus on it on a daily basis. She firmly believes that she can't do anything and her approach is to put up walls and build distance. Sometimes when we speak or the few times that we spend time, there's moments where her guard goes down and you can see that she loves me. And really that's what keeps her from completely ending everything is her fear of losing me. We've talked about kids and marriage and I was planning on proposing this summer.   


I dont want to lose my life partner or the future that we've planned. Anyone have any advice or insight?

Now, I'm wondering how to proceed. I could ask him to stop using my number (he might think the calls arent going anywhere) OR I could sign him up for every scam on the internet. 

Any thoughts on how to get out of this harrassment?

617," TL;DR: I'm being asked to come in while everyone else works remotely. I said yes but now I realize I'll be risking my health, and doing twice as much work as everyone else for the same pay. How do I broach the subject of compensation now?

I was planning to ask for a raise last month because I just had a work anniversary and I've been steadily asked to take on more and more responsibility during my tenure with very little added compensation. Then growing virus concerns made me feel it would be insensitive to ask and I decided to wait until conditions improved. 

Now I'm being asked to come to the office while everyone else works remotely. I'm happy to do it but there was only some vague mention of compensation and I feel used. How exactly to I bring this up professionally? I don't want to cause a rift but I firmly believe that I deserve compensation.",13Mar2020,1

619,"My cat is lost I’m unsure what to do. My family lost him yesterday, by accidentally letting him outside (they didn’t notice until hours later). He’s an indoor cat and unused to being outside and has never been out this long. When he gets out past them I’m usually the one to find him within an hour or two, but I’m hours away at college and can’t come home because it involves public transport and crossing a border and with the coronavirus crises I’d be putting vulnerable members of my family at risk by doing so. The problem is that they’re not able to search as pro-actively as I could and didn’t even  tell me until 8pm yesterday thinking that they’d find him before now. When I called to check in on the search at 3am they were all asleep, whereas I’d be awake and keeping an eye out. It made me frustrated because I was the only one awake last night but the only one who couldn’t keep watch.

I’m really afraid for him and I don’t know what I can do from here aside from what I’ve already done: I’ve posted him in the local lost and found FB page, on my page and I’ve rang the local shelter and vets in case he gets brought in. Nothing. It’s coming up to over 24hrs. I don’t want my family members talking to neighbours or being in public unnecessarily, so this is the worst time this could possibly have happened. His litter-box and some food has been left out too. He’s very important to me and being able to do nothing is killing me inside.

624,"Several weeks ago, I decided to spend some time with my parents. Initially I planned to stay with them for just one month, but the situation has changed a lot since then.

My parents are adamant that I should not return home until everything regarding COVID-19 blows over. I've already attempted to go back home twice, but they are my only means to get to the airport and always talk me back around into staying. I love my family, and I want to support them when they need me, but being with my parents like this stresses me out and wrecks my confidence.

In addition, I am actively searching for a new job and have job interviews at the final stage for several companies scheduled over the next 3 weeks. I have been planning to take these 5-6 hour video calls from my apartment, because my technical resources are there, my apartment has a much better internet connection for video calls, and one company has even mailed me whiteboard equipment to use during the interview. It would be simple for me to self-isolate in my apartment once I get there, since I already have non-perishable supplies to let me stay fed and healthy for a few weeks.

Both my parents and I live in the US. The area I live in has gone from 0--&gt;100+ confirmed cases of COVID-19 since I left. There are no confirmed cases in the area where my parents live. I do not have health conditions that would put me at greater risk due to the virus, but one of my parents does.

Reasons I should stay with my family:
 * It's just the right thing to do.
 * Air travel presents a higher risk of getting COVID-19, even if I take all possible precautions and self-isolate in my apartment.
 * If I get sick once I am home, I wouldn't be able to do any interviews anyways.
 * If my family gets sick while I am gone, and a domestic travel ban is put in place, I might not get to see them until it is too late.

Reasons I would return home:
 * If I stay with my parents, that increases the possible vectors for them getting the virus (unless I quarantine myself in their home and never leave).
 * I need to return home eventually- I'm hemorrhaging money from monthly bills, there's unemployment/health insurance mail I need to attend to, my relationship with my SO back home is falling apart because of this situation, among just wanting to end my vacation already.
 * I want to give it my best shot for these job interviews. I've spent the last few months working up to this point, and some of these are companies I've only dreamed about working for, and I don't want to lose this chance.

I do have a third option: Stay with family and reschedule/cancel my interviews. I'm just worried this could cause issues for me down the line because I am already 4 months out of work, so this could create an even wider employment gap to explain to future employers.

Should I stay or should I go? Am I valuing myself and my career too much over family? Is my family taking the right approach for this pandemic or are they asking too much of me?",13Mar2020,1

638,"Hello Reddit. First time posting. You've all probably heard this song and dance before, but I could really use some advice here.

I graduated 7 years ago with a bachelor's degree in Environmental Studies with a minor in biology, top honors and all that stuff. When I started looking for a job I learned that alot of funding had been cut from environmental programs and state parks were just cycling employees already in their system into open positions. I volunteered and did internships that lead to dead ends. I decided to go into the vet tech route and stayed in that area for 5 years, finding that emotional and mental abuse were the calling cards of the business. I couldn't do it anymore and left completely. I decided to go back to school for an associate's in business management. I work in my college's computer lab helping students, and at a locally owned pet store that I enjoy while I go to school. I apply for jobs where I can, network, build up my resume, save money, and try to keep my chin up about finding a ""real"" job.

But I feel hopeless.

I'll be 29 this year. I've never moved out of my parents' house (they say they love having me regardless), never been completely financially independent, and felt like I've never had a job that actually wanted me there. I have an amazing boyfriend (soon to be fiance), very supportive parents, and some extra good doggos. I feel happy most of the time, but as soon as someone asks me what I do for a living I feel so trapped and embarrassed. Being a vet tech destroyed my self worth, but at least it was a job I was proud to say I held. I feel no pride anymore. 

So Reddit, why am I such a failure? Because I definitely feel like one. I'm so lucky to have people that support me, but I feel like they encourage me because they love me unconditionally. I just want to feel proud of myself again.",13Mar2020,1

First of all I’d like to thank you for taking time to read my thread. It’s long and frustrating so thank you.

&amp;#x200B;

1hr I got in the car to a rather pissed off mum. She asked me about the ‘detty pig’ meme that had being going around and if it was racist (Eric from sex education). I then explained how it is NOT and how it is totally fine and is merly a \*worldwide\* joke. she then explained that my cousin (16F) has ben sent home from school for putting the meme up. 

&amp;#x200B;

im sure people are aware of the joke and its reference to sex educatuon and the how its used as a joke at the corona virus. we did some digging and even the actor, Nucti Gatwa, has endorsed the meme. 

&amp;#x200B;

we then called her and asked what exactly had been said to her and my jaw just dropped:

&amp;#x200B;

""i know you're a racist and i'll never forget that""

""this one of the most racist things ive come across in school""

""white people's actions toward black people are raicst and that they call black people dirty because of their skin colour, i fail to believe how you dont see this as racist.""

and she said he kept going on about ""how you think this isnt racist""

""this is a direct offence to black culture and they would be offended""

\- white headmaster.

&amp;#x200B;

like what the fuck? how dare he, im so lost to how unbelievable this is. first, how dare he generalise white people and how dare he generalise black people.

&amp;#x200B;

i didnt even know what to say. i knew crazy things like this happened but i never thought i would see it happen to someone close to me. Im mixed race with asian blood in me, my dad is indian and like id never see my cousin being racist or think she would. i wish i could understand why they would think this is ok, i thought how ironic it was that she was being called a racist yet theyre the ones that are racist. by turning something thats IS NOT racially motivated into being racially motivated to fit and agenda is RACIST?! like what??? she has been threatened with full expulsion with it on her record.

&amp;#x200B;

they also stated that hey know about the reference to the show and the scene BUT THE CLEARLY DONT since this would not be happening if they knew the context.

&amp;#x200B;

right now she is deciding whetehr to fight it by:

\- explaining there is no racial meaning behind it

\- it is indorsed by the actor

\- it is worldwide

\- it is a DIRECT quote from a scene about washing hands

\- it is NOT RACIST

\- it was a joke made about the corona virus and to promote healthy habits

&amp;#x200B;

however by doing this she could possibly still be expelled and have that on her record indefinatly as well as be branded a racist.

&amp;#x200B;

OR 

&amp;#x200B;

back down, be remorseful and accept it thereby:

\- having a fake reputation of being racist

\- having that fact potentially coming back to haunt her

\- giving into presure from others to just go with the flow and not stand up for whats right!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

i just find it so disgusting that this could ever happen to someone regardless of the race, how dare they assume she is a racist without any context on the situation.

&amp;#x200B;

i also want to know what exactly we can do about this, like how can we be assured that the school officials are reprimanded and that it is assured they NEVER do this again. please dont just say ""call the police!"" coz then what? what do we say, how do we do it? this is in the UK btw for like references to UK services.

please help, im scared for her.

643,"  

I(21F) have recently started dating the most amazing man who I will refer to as J(29M) about 4 months ago. He is overall very introverted, he enjoys being around me but not a lot of others. He cares about the important things, and poeple but the rest he seems indifferent about. I wouldn’t say I am a huge extrovert, I only have a couple close friends and family who I care deeply for, I have tried to make girl friends but I have become really good platonic friends with Z(19M) over the last year. He is rather feminine (and I kinda think he is gay just isn’t ready to acknowledge it yet but idk). And another platonic friend I rarely see because he(40M) lives three states away (we talk weekly on the phone). Both L and Z are successful, well rounded people and I feed off their positive energy and they have both helped me in some tough times. 

My relationship with J is the most serious one I have had and although we have moved somewhat fast, it has just felt right for us. He moved in with me recently due to some circumstances and its only temporary but it has brought forth a tension concerning my friends and I don’t know what to do. J told me he winds down at the end of the day by being alone or with me, and I could tell he didn’t like it when I invited people over. Lately, even me bringing up my friends I can sense a tension from him concerning them, so I avoid it and tell my friends I am busy more and can’t talk or hang as often. I have told J I bet he would like my friends if he met them but he just smiles and doesn’t respond. I can tell he has no interest in meeting them. I don’t necessarily think he is jealous but I can’t really tell for sure. I don’t think he understands my relationships with these two in particular, and doesn’t show interest in trying. 

I would like to add that I try hard to be respectful of his introverted nature. I don’t expect him to come to my family/friends things, he has come to some family events and my family liked him. He is good at keeping up a conversation and doesn’t act awkward, but afterwards I can tell he is drained. I appreciate the effort when it comes to my family. He doesn't have any good friends in this state and doesn't mind it either, he has two friends he want's me to meet in his home state and we booked a flight in August so I can attend a wedding for his family, we plan to meet his two friends then. I look forward to it.

L called me last week and told me he will be in my city because he is looking for a second house in the area (he has family close by). L wanted to meet my new boyfriend and see me so he asked if we could do dinner on Friday(tonight) after he lands. I told him I can’t promise J will be there(knowing J doesn’t like being around my friends) but I will try to get him to go and either way I will be there. I asked J that night and he said he would think about it. This morning he said he will not be going, instead he will take a long walk on his own. I was disappointed but told him that’s fine. I could sense tension from him all morning after that and he left early for work. 

L called me a few hours later and I was a little embarrassed to tell L that J is busy and can’t come. L was nice about it but I can tell he was a bit offended that J doesn’t want to meet him and L expressed a little concern about it since he is my friend. I told him I will still be at dinner, L said he invited another female and was hoping it could be like a double date so now it will be a bit awkward when my boyfriend doesn’t show. I told him that I would still love to see him and im willing to try another time, his schedule is packed dinner tonight will be out only opportunity. It will be awkward but I will go.

I called Z because we are close and asked for his honest opinion on J (Z is blunt as fuck) Z told me he can’t really have an opinion on someone he hasn’t even met. Now I am sad because these are all people I care for and J hasn’t even acknowledged them. If he didn’t like them or was jealous at leased that is a sign of him caring but I don’t even see that. 

Obviously I need to have a conversation with J, I just wanted to get an idea on what you, the people of Reddit, think. I don’t like going in without solutions so any advice on how to proceed a serious relationship with an introvert would be very helpful….

Because I feel like it will be brought up…I know my relationship with L is odd because of his age. Its hard to explain. I consider him a role model in a way and he is very successful emotionally, mentally and financially so I go to him for advice. He has only proven to have my best interests in mind. My dad left me when I was a kid so I guess… he fills that role? Open to hearing people out if they find it concerning. I wish J would show enough interest to ask.

Thanks.",13Mar2020,1

For starters, I am 21 years old and I live with my parents, and 2 brothers (17 and 8) we live in a 2 bedroom apartment so I share with my 17 year old brother. My brother does not believe in showers, personal space, or manners. He refuses to shower for days on end and he smells absolutely disgusting, leaves his things everywhere and always uses AND breaks my things. I have asked him multiple times to be considerate of other people sharing his space, this always results in a violent and verbally abusive fight.

It is horrible to not have your own space, not be able to change, talk on the phone, do personal things and to share a small room with a teenage boy. I am ashamed to have people over and often find myself going for hour long walks or bus rides for no reason to avoid being at home.

My parents on the other hand, are very traditional middle eastern parents. They are strict with my curfew and where I go and whom I go with. I do not really get up to much as I work 6 days a week and will soon be back in school to complete my degree, so it is really annoying to not be able to go out on the rare occasion I can since I have a 10pm curfew. I am 21 and that is kind of ridiculous. Whenever I come home past 10 I get constant text messages and calls from my dad that make me drop everything and run home and when I do, he verbally abuses me to the point I wish i had just stayed in

This has had a huge toll on my mental health as I am personally struggling with other issues such as work, school, personal relationships etc and I feel as I don't have a safe escape to go to and be alone.

In my house I can never be alone, when I take a shower somebody is banging on the door every 5 minutes.

I have recently saved up some money and have made arrangements to move into a place with my bestfriend. It has taken me a while to get the courage to even search for places or to get this plan in action, my whole life I have dreamed of leaving this house.

I don't know how to tell my parents. They will flip. They will call me names. They will tell me I am never welcome home. They will be scary. I also have incredibly bad anxiety and am not confrontational at all. Every time I have ever tried to stand up to my parents I would end up crying and not being able to speak after 5 seconds. So I am not sure how to tell them I am leaving. Having somebody with me to speak to them is not an option because I want to do this myself.

I am thinking of speaking to my mom first as I have explained to her before how i feel and she seemed semi supportive in the past of me moving out but that was also because she knew it would never be possible.

Basically I've managed to piss off all of my ex-friends. I'll admit I was quite the ass to them in the past- but it's all been solved and all that jazz. Hell, even one of them admitted that I'm better now. 

And here comes the juicy stuff. You see, one of them won't stop going on and on about how I'm narcissistic, I like Gacha Life, and that I'm ""edgy"" (I have a history of depression). This all stemmed from the texts I sent them, with vents, jokes about me liking Gacha. I have no idea what sparked the supposed narcissism since they won't tell me.

And I just felt so infuriated, because it's just so annoying that he was downplaying my mental health and that he kept implying that I'm a shitty person (which I WAS, not am. Hopefully.) and the fact that he kept saying I liked that stupid game. It really wasn't that bad, frankly, but I was really overwhelmed.

646,"There is some background information and additional details that can be shared but to keep it generally to the point, how can I encourage my partner and father of my children to take hygiene more seriously? 

I have tried to talk and encourage him for a while now and have gotten him to make some improvements during flu season. Some of his worse offenses: He does not wash his hands after using the bathroom, has nail biting and skin picking habits, will blow his nose into his hand at times, and often does not cover a cough or sneeze. He is sick OFTEN, as you can imagine...I know this is exceptionally gross and shows he is lazy and generally careless. I have been able to get him to use hand sanitizer before changing the kids and wash his hands after, sometimes wash his hands after using the bathroom, not kiss or touch the babies face. Sometimes I need to prompt or ask though. He generally feels I am a nag (a whole other issue) and gets an attitude/upset about this.

We have avoided the flu so far but have been sick 3-5 times in the past 6 months. Think..sore throat, runny nose, cough, headache, sometimes stomach issues. For my toddler, it is usually mild luckily. Sickness generally bounces between my partner and myself as I have a weak immune system. We have a newborn right now though. My partner is clearing up, I am ill and my newborn is in the beginning stages of illness. COVID-19 is in our state and county right now. And while I am not paranoid of it, I recognize there will be an increase of others being ill in some way. 

I want my partner to care more. Because of COVID-19 and on a general basis. I am the stay at home and default parent. It is hard to be that and be sick/have sick kids. As an adult and parent, I wash my hands frequently and use sanitizer if needed. I also use tissues, cough/sneeze into a tissue or my sleeve. I take the time to Lysol or wipe areas up when I am sick (bathroom, kitchen, toys). I want to convey to him that I expect him to always do the same and do not want to have to prompt this.",13Mar2020,1

649,"If you're a shy, awkward guy you have no chance of finding a girlfriend. It's ironic because men will often find shyness endearing in women, whereas women prefer a suave, hypermasculine, socially dominant guy. The only way guys can get away with some social awkwardness is if they're model-tier goodlooking. I know some women will settle for a high-tier normie with money when they're getting older and want a stable provider but I'm not sure how else you're supposed to find a girlfriend without insane looks (genetics) or superficial charm (personality fluke).",13Mar2020,1
650,"  

I(21F) have recently started dating the most amazing man who I will refer to as J(29M) about 4 months ago. He is overall very introverted, he enjoys being around me but not a lot of others. I wouldn’t say I am a huge extrovert, I only have a couple close friends and family who I care deeply for, I have tried to make girlfriends but I have become really good friends with Z(19M) over the last year. He is rather feminine (and I kinda think he is gay just isn’t ready to acknowledge it yet but idk). And another platonic friend I rarely see because he(40M) lives three states away (we talk weekly on the phone). Both L and Z are successful, well rounded people and I feed off their positive energy and they have both helped me in some tough times. 

My relationship with J is the most serious one I have had and although we have moved somewhat fast, it has just felt right for us. He moved in with me recently due to some circumstances and its only temporary but it has brought forth a tension concerning my friends and I don’t know what to do. J told me he winds down at the end of the day by being alone or with me, and I could tell he didn’t like it when I invited people over. Lately, even me bringing up my friends I can sense a tension from him concerning them, so I avoid it and tell my friends I am busy more and can’t talk or hang as often. I have told J I bet he would like my friends if he met them but he just smiles and doesn’t respond. I can tell he has no interest in meeting them. I don’t necessarily think he is jealous but I can’t really tell for sure. I don’t think he understands my relationships with these two in particular, and doesn’t show interest in trying. 

I would like to add that I try hard to be respectful of his introverted nature. I don’t expect him to come to my family/friends things, he has come to some family events and my family liked him. He is good at keeping up a conversation and doesn’t act awkward, but afterwards I can tell he is drained. I appreciate the effort when it comes to my family.

L called me last week and told me he will be in my city because he is looking for a second house in the area (he has family close by). L wanted to meet my new boyfriend and see me so he asked if we could do dinner on Friday(tonight) after he lands. I told him I can’t promise J will be there(knowing J doesn’t like being around my friends) but I will try to get him to go and either way I will be there. I asked J that night and he said he would think about it. This morning he said he will not be going, instead he will take a long walk on his own. I was disappointed but told him that’s fine. I could sense tension from him all morning after that and he left early for work. 

L called me a few hours after that and I was a little embarrassed to tell L that J is busy and can’t come. L was nice about it but I can tell he was a bit offended that J doesn’t want to meet him and L expressed a little concern about it since he is my friend. I told him I will still be at dinner, L said he invited another female and was hoping it could be like a double date so now it will be a bit awkward when my boyfriend doesn’t show. I told him that I would still love to see him and im willing to try another time, his schedule is packed dinner tonight will be out only opportunity.

I called Z because we are close and asked for his honest opinion on J (Z is blunt as fuck) Z told me he can’t really have an opinion on someone he hasn’t even met. Now I am sad because these are all people I care for and J hasn’t even acknowledged them. If he didn’t like them or was jealous at leased that is a sign of him caring but I don’t even see that. 

Obviously I need to have a conversation with J, I just wanted to get an idea on what you, the people of Reddit, think. I don’t like going in without solutions so any advice on how to proceed a serious relationship with an introvert would be very helpful….

Because I feel like it will be brought up…I know my relationship with L is odd because of his age. Its hard to explain. I consider him a role model in a way and he is very successful emotionally, mentally and financially so I go to him for advice. He has only proven to have my best interests in mind. My dad left me when I was a kid so I guess… he fills that role. Open to hearing people out if they find it concerning. I wish J would show enough interest to ask.

Thanks.",13Mar2020,1

Basically, most of the time, like 90% of the time I think I'm a perfectly competent human being. The rest of the time I feel like the ultimate derp. I'll get peanut butter on my hair and not notice until I go to shower. I'll have clothes inside out. Or I'll leave my phone at the flight counter when getting on a plane. Or I'll do something completely ridiculous and terrible and non-strategic playing a video game such that my friends go ""welp, that's a u/throwme1623 moment"" (and they say it to each other, too). Spill tea all over my keyboard. Drop my phone constantly. Not notice a robbery in progress in the store I'm in. Like half of it is clumsy oblivious stuff. A lot of it is also terrible verbal vomit though. Like, I'll just use the completely wrong word for something... mispronounce stuff (I'm a native English speaker).

So I don't THINK it's social anxiety, because I also notice it when I do it by myself. Sometimes I'll be having a conversation in my head thinking about a topic and everything's smooth sailing, and as soon as I try to say it out loud it's just terrible, things that made sense in my head don't out loud. Starting to feel a little nuts. Most of the time it's fine, for some reason this rarely happens at work - I'll still 'uh' a lot but that's a normal person thing - but when I'm trying to talk about something I'm passionate with friends, or have an argument, my brain-to-mouth connection just gets mega messed up.",13Mar2020,1

658,"I know, it sounds pathetic to even word my title like that. But I literally have no other way to describe how I feel and think about my situation. I would try my best to compartmentalize my thoughts as best as I can, and I'm sorry if any of you find my explanations confusing; I'll clarify further if need be.

I'm a 23-year old, Asian woman who desperately wants to move somewhere else. First, my country cannot offer me the opportunities to reach my ambition to become a psychologist. Even if I start from the bottom of jobs and work my way up, it will literally not improve over the years I'd be slaving myself over my work. And second, I am living with my mentally and emotionally abusive mother because she needs my assistance due to her numerous bodily complaints that even doctors don't know what to do with her anymore. She would get highly strung about her bodily pains and would jump to self-diagnosis; via Dr. Google. She would then proceed to use me (and the rest of the family) as her emotional punching bag by making me do a lot of things for her, and accompanying her to the hospital even though it's pretty obvious she's just exaggerating her pains. There was a time when the ER doctors paged the in-house psychiatrist because they believe my mother's health issues are all psychosomatic. 

Now, on the other hand... when it comes to seeking better pastures, I've been eyeing Canada for two years now. Why Canada? Well, if my research is correct, there are provinces there that would allow a psychology masters' graduate to become a licensed psychologist. It's seems very difficult to seek opportunities in the US because you'd only get to become a licensed psychologist if you have a Ph.D or Psy.D! I'm afraid my budget is only limited to cater my graduate studies. :(

So, when I just graduated college, I went to an international graduate school convention. Long story short, all schools won't be able to enroll me under an MA or MS in Psychology because I didn't graduate with a psychology undergraduate degree. However, almost all of them told me to take some of my psychology classes (especially the introductions and prerequisites) here in my country, then transfer to their schools using an MA or MS in Psychology.

And that's what I just did! I enrolled myself to MS in Clinical Psychology, and I'm currently taking my prerequisites. :)

Recently, I had a brief talk with an international education agency that told me my college GPA would matter in my application to Canadian schools. Now, that's *problem number one*. My GPA is low because there was a time three years ago when my mother got very ill, and was hospitalized frequently; I had to take a lot of absences and failed a handful of subjects due to these absences. This, in effect, really pulled my GPA down drastically.

I know it's still too early to judge my decisions since I've literally just started my first semester, first year in this degree program. But I'm getting really, ***really*** anxious about all of this. I feel like... all of this won't even matter because *what if I'm still denied to enroll*? Or *what if after all these hard work, I still won't get accepted*? It's still very much on the discretion of the academic adviser of schools I'd apply to if they can just use my master's GPA instead of my bachelor's. Very self-defeating mindset, I know. But I just want to be as realistic as possible. On top of it all... say, I luckily got accepted, and got my butt to where I want my butt to be. I just feel very much overwhelmed by the thought of going to a place I have no friends or family to help me if need be. Yet, I know that once I get to my destination, I cannot afford to fail and go back home.

I researched and talked to a lot of advisers here with a know-how around and about psychology careers here in my country. They all tell me one thing: no matter how much I study (whether I have a master's degree, or even a Ph.D), my country is still very much prejudiced about mental health. So, in order to cater to a wide population and to encourage people to visit mental health clinics, the fees of therapy is bare minimum. In a year, I'd be making only around $15,000; and that's if I get regular patients! This is why I want to practice elsewhere.

Now, after this long read (and I'm sorry about this), my mind is in shambles. I don't know where to start and what to do anymore. I still want to pursue psychology because deep down, I still want to help people the way people have helped me in the past. I'm just so swamped as of the moment. Any... advice? 😅 Thank you for reading my lengthy post!",13Mar2020,1

I come home late and my partner surprisingly asks me how it was so I say a couple things that are on my mind and they go completely bezerk; accusing me that I was trying to argue with them and etc. I don’t even have the energy to explain how shitty they made me feel.

660,"My friend since 6th (him and I are currently juniors in high school) and I were texting this morning. We were talking about how school got cancelled this Friday and the next few weeks due to the Coronavirus (I know, nothing new with schools shutting down). This isn’t about the coronavirus. I was also talking to him about school issues, but more like he was talking to me and I was trying to reassure him because he was venting to me. I did my best to reassure him (I think he’s reassured from his responses). This was at like 7:30 a.m. and I told him I was going to go back to sleep because I woke up really early at 5:30 to get ready for school, but it’s cancelled so I took off my clothes, took off my backpack, and went back to sleeping in. I told him beforehand I was going to sleep in. It’s like 9:30 when I wake back up and I get some cereal, put a movie in the DVD player, messed with some LEGO until like 10:30 and checked my phone. Holy shit. He blew up my phone this entire time, like 3 missed FaceTime calls, texting me “you still sleeping my dude??”, just overall spamming my phone. He knew I was sleeping, so why the hell is he spamming my phone FaceTiming me. I would’ve woken up several times if my phone wasn’t on silent. Like seriously, why the hell are you spamming my phone with calls when you know that I’m sleeping?! I text him back “yeah Im awake”, and odd timing but my mom pulls into the driveway like just after I texted him back at around 10:45. I help bring in groceries (a lot of fricking groceries lol) and make some lunch. By the time I’m done with that, it’s around 11:10. I eat lunch and check back on my phone at around 10:45. Holy shit, another like 3 missed FaceTime calls. And texts. 
“Then pick up the phone muthfucka” (I know how he is, he wasn’t being serious about the motherfucker bit)
“You back asleep boomer?”
And I message him back “Jeez! No need to blow up my phone, and no, I was helping with groceries and having lunch. Can I text you?”
(Because frankly I’m not the biggest fan of FaceTime unless it’s with my girl friend because I can almost never see her outside of school, very strict parents)
And he keeps asking to FaceTime because he has a story he wants to tell me but he says it’ll be better through FaceTime.
I put my foot down and tell him that I’ll text him, and ask him if he could text it.
He never told me the story and is waiting for me to FaceTime with him to tell it. 


What do I even say, like I don’t wanna be rude and say I don’t like FaceTiming because when we FaceTime, he rambles and cuts me off when I talk about whatever it is I want to say. Like I’d much rather prefer to text him but I don’t wanna make him feel offended. 

Ive tried to tell him before when he spams my phone that I don’t pick up because I’m preoccupied or it’s not a good time, like if I’m in the car or already talking to somebody or doing homework. I’ve asked him to text me before he sends over a call because more times than not, it’s not a good time for me to be on a call, but lo and behold, that evidently doesn’t happen.

What is a good way of going about this? Because I want to tell him that I just straight up don’t like FaceTime, and it’s not just him. I just don’t like phone calls or FaceTime calls, but I can’t do that without offending him, and I don’t want to risk offending him.",13Mar2020,0

662,"Now here is my stance on the coronavirus “PaNdEmIc” the panic caused and will cause more damage than this “PaNdEmIc”. I believe that what the superintendent of our school corporation has done is overreacting and is unnecessary due to the fact my school has no cases and my state only has 13 active cases currently. As well as the fact that if you do the math at the time of posting this https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6 has said there have been 137,445 cases, 69,779 recovered, and 5,088 dead. Now let’s get to the relatively simple math,  69,779 + 5,088 comes out to 74,867 resolved cases. So 137,445-74,867 comes out to 62,578  current cases and if my education from my elementary days are correct I believe 62,578 is less than 74,867. And now if I include the fact that only a single person under the age of 19 has died from it (I am under 19). This seems like a good case for the fact that this is nothing to worry about. Yes I mean quarantine people but quarantine individuals not a school full of healthy young students. Now despite this the superintendent of our school corporation has decided to add a week to our spring break. Normally I would be fine with this, but here’s the thing I have mental issues and breaks or too much time to myself lead to mental breakdowns for me due to me overthinking. Now my mom has already prevented me from going to a friend’s birthday/sleepover due to her being worried about corona and now it’s not even in my city.

I’m afraid for my mental health and I’ve tried talking to her about how it’s not a threat but she just won’t listen.

I let him borrow my truck one night and it came back with half the bumper ripped off. He gave me his word that he’ll fix it. 4 months later still not fixed so he doesn’t keep his word is what I’m getting at. So he got laid off from work and rent came around and he needed $100 so I helped him out. He gave me his word he’d pay me back. He got a job again and was working for 3-4 weeks maybe when electric and WiFi was due. He hasnt payed me back at this point and he was very quick to collect the $70 I owed him so I turned it back and collected my $100. This month he was “barley scrapping by to get rent” and then he showed me the new speakers he bought... the same week he needed to get me the rent by (rents due from 1-6) he gave me his portion of rent late and when I told him about the late fee he was trying to get me to pay half even though I’ve had my rent ready by the middle of the month before because I budget it out. He also agreed to take care of our renters insurance but come to find out he didn’t. The apartment management pressed me about it and told me they weren’t even supposed to give us our keys till that was taken care of. I’ve asked him multiple times to take care of it and it hasnt been taken care of. All he has to do is call the company and have them fax over proof (gotta take less than 10min) which is leading me to believe he never even set it up. Rent is only $380 each so it’s not very expensive. yesterday he went out and bought a 2013 super duty f-250 powerstroke a $25k+ his dream truck.

The manager interviewing me put me down for 18 hours a week - if I was to get the job. I'm not sure I'll be able to cope with this and I haven't been told if the hours would be contracted or not, which I vaguely understand because I just had an interview and it early stages.

I spoke to other people who work there but in different areas and they said that they  had a zero-hours contract and got to work flexible hours. I'm worried that for me, this won't be the case and I might run myself dry.

any advice on what to do if I get the job, and what working in a fast food chain is like?

I'm just quite stressed about it and I don't want to ruin an opportunity that I'm likely to enjoy :)",13Mar2020,1
670,"I resisted facing this and doing something about it for a long time but, I think it's time I stand up for what I believe in. As I said, my previous employer broke laws and eventually I pointed enough things out they aimed to shut me up by getting rid of me.

Is there any blowback by reaching out to the authorities and letting them know what you saw? I'm not really sure how to handle this. I know they were monitoring my computer and very likely have my passwords, I don't trust them at all and could see them maliciously attacking me if they found out I reported them. I also live in a small town and don't want word getting out that I can't be trusted. I stand very firmly on my ethics and it's slowly eating me away knowing this company is getting away with lying to the government, 3rd party agencies, and their customers. These are the very issues most profit driven companies are pushing and as I see it it's the reason so many people are depressed...we need to be able to stand up.

Eventually we started to fall out as a result of our sheer near complete lack of things in common, and k’s  awkward nature.

Her and I immediately clicked and chatted for nearly an hour without noticing how late it was getting even though we just met out of sheer coincidence.

Recently she’s noticed this girl I’ve started hanging out with more and more. And it’s becoming clear I’ve lost interest and only see k as a friend. K and I never actually dated or really talked to each other much in general, but she still likes me and I know I’ll have to break the news to k that her and I can only be friends and nothing more.

Shes a few years older than me and i’ve literally fallen head over heels for her, i’m totally in love but unfortunately it doesn’t go both ways.. Sometimes. 

I mean i feel like she uses me when its only convenient for her, she says she can never think of us two being sexually together and it disgusts her yet we’ve kissed and we’ve even had sex in my bed. Shes always contradicting herself and its driving me crazy. I know shes leading me on and everyone around her thinks we’re in a relationship yet she always denies it rolls her eyes and tells everyone we’re just friends.

After we had sex we never really talked about it and the furthest we got to was ‘ as if we had sex together ‘ and it really frustrated me because i thought we were heading to the next level in our relationship yet she back peddled and started talking about how shes going to start dating other guys again and i’m pretty sure shes seeing someone else right now and i’m sure she wants to introduce me to him but i want no part in that to be honest

I know the smartest thing to do is distance myself from her because we probably spend way too much time together and i’ve done exactly that today and shes already driving me crazy hence why i’ve for some reason turned to reddit with my problems 🥴

Let me give a small breakdown of the people involved not including myself:

Seven- My Boyfriend 

Nine- His Ex Girlfriend

So Seven and I met online in December 2015. It was an anon chat app. We became more than just friends during that span of time. Anyway, we stopped talking in September 2016 because I had family issues happen. We reconnected again March of 2018, met August that same year, and started dating the next month and have been dating ever since. 

So here is where things start to get a little weird to me. I joined Facebook in Oct of last year. I sent Seven a friend request but he didn't accept it because he ""is never on."" I accepted this and forgot about it. About a month later I found Nine's profile. I don't mean to seem stalker-ish but I was just curious about her. 

All that Seven had told about Nine was that the dated for about a year and half and had been broken up before we started talking in 2015. Apparently, she had cheated on him multiple times and was not very nice to him. Anyway, when I looked at her profile I saw pictures of them together, and not in the just friends way, during the time that we had been talking from 2015-2016 and even after. 

There was only one pic in 2017 and she had been tagging him in a few things in 2018, but pretty much stopped about a week before Seven and I started dating.

I am starting to wonder if he has been truthful about their relationship. Was I the ""other woman"" at some point? How do I go about bringing this up to him? He can be dismissive and I don't want him to dismiss my concerns about this matter.

*TL;DR: Is my boyfriend hiding important details about his relationship with his ex from me?*",13Mar2020,1

We did the report but after that i wanted to add the other 3 to my instagram so i started to sent follow but after the firts follow i realised i didnt add the 2 of the 3 by their full name so i could not been able them in instagram. So i take back my follow request on the first one and move on with my day. But that night i started thinking what if she thought i send the request to hit on her. I was never good with girls so i have never tried to talk about relations. Any advise on my next move.

700,"She was my first friend in grade 7 and I loved her handwriting and drawings. I used to talk with her everyday and grew attached to her. Class 8,9,10 came and we were in different  classes. I was crazy after her. I didn't  have any crush other than her the whole time. She changed her bf thrice during the time period.  I helped her with exam stress, bf stress and friendship stress. I was always there for her. She never considered  me a true friend and pretty  much used me. I used to fight with her to change her bfs because  her bfs sucked and one of them called her a slut before SHE proposed to him. She never even showed  up on my bdays. I knew each and every thing about her like fav color, food,movie etc.I gathered up the courage to speak the truth to her in grade 11 to which she replied that she is already in a relationship(to the guy who called her a slut) and she wants to marry him(lol)  and I should forget about this and remain friends with her. I removed her from my contacts  sensing  she is just there to use me but I can't  get her out of my head.

However, I have once again started talking to her because  I am a piece of shit who can't  stay away from her. She still talks to me sometimes and discusses things like chemistry  questions  but again doesn't give me any kind of special attention.  In these 5 years, she has blocked and unblocked me countless times on her own. What does she want from me? Just friendship? Emotional  support? Why is she like this. Either block me completely  or talk to me like a genuine person. I even told her not to act so bad to me to which she said she doesn't know what  to reply and so she ignores my messages. I can't  understand  her. I can't  leave her. She knew I liked her all this time but never confessed about this( I know becuz her friends used to make fun of me drolling all over her). If she liked the attention  I gave to her, she should have messaged me during the time period (months) I  was trying to stay away from her. It is always me who has to send a reply. So does this suggest she doesn't  like the attention  I give to her? I am so confused.",13Mar2020,1

I want to try and bring it up with him, but when I tried previously (about 3 weeks ago), he got very defensive and irritated at me. To me, sex is important in a relationship and I want to continue one with him and there defintely needs to be a conversation about this, but I am hesitant now due to his last reaction. I also realize that his mental health situation is a sensitive thing in regards to this and I 100% understand if he needs time to work on this before we get going sexual again.

I liked this girl. We talked the previous semester for a long time. But, I became very self-conscious about myself and started to believe that she wouldn’t like me because other boys who I believed were better overall (socially, intelligent) were starting to talk to her and because of that I would text her everyday and possibly annoyed her. She then ghosted me. Although she has a boyfriend now, I got word that one time a person whom I don’t have a positive outlook on and him likewise, started to talk crap about me and she was there and started to defend me, she also said she cared about me a lot, and would always want to know what I was doing, she also was nervous talking to me. But according to her, I made it awkward between us, and to be honest I did, I was scared that other boys were gonna get to her while I tried to be myself. Was I wrong in not believing in myself?

I live at home with my parents until I graduate and get a stable job. I my grade have been slipping for about 4 semesters now to the point where my gpa is a 2.0. I recently left my minimum wage job because the place was pretty volatile. I don’t have a drivers license because school eats up my time and I don’t have a car to practice with most of the time. I’m a virgin who uses dating apps to try to date girls since my area isn’t a city of college kids my age or anyone inherently my age. I always see People my age are already in a relationship or have something going for them in life. Try when it comes to dating but what I found in dating apps are a bad idea for me since the people aren’t invested no matter how long you make a connection or invite them out to eat. Generally I feel like women will ignore or devalue me. Also People who don’t know me always assume I’m proper with their life together.

Our school had a 12 hour mini thon the night before, so I was tired, angry, upset and frustrated. I responded with a horrible text, letting every demon I could find in my body out into that text. There was no mercy whatsoever. I sent it, and that’s where it got bad.

Not all of them are actually mad, but the “leaders” of the pact are, and when they get mad, they do anything and everything to turn the life of the person they’re mad at into a living hell. The ones that are mad also say that I’ve “manipulated” or been overly insensitive towards them at some point, and so that was another driving factor. The problem was that at those times, they brought it to my attention, but continued to “laugh” every time I made a joke that could be taken offensively, so it’s like I could never know. None of them will willingly make eye contact with me, let alone talk to me. I’ve apologized to them all individually as best I possibly could, but they just won’t have it.

I want to be friends with them again, but none of them seem to want any contact with me at all for the next weeks and even if they do come back, who knows how long it’ll be before shit hits the fan again? COVID-19 shit down my school today for the next two weeks, so I have some time before I see them again. Another guy friend says they’re being extra and I should stop caring, but I don’t know.

715,"This past weekend me, my girlfriend (Jen) her friend (Teressa) and her boyfriend (Jake) were all out this past weekend. We are all 22-27 years of age. While we were out, we got pretty drunk and eventually made our way back to my place, where we drank even more. We began to play the game ""never have I ever"". At first, it was pretty innocent then it turned dirty. My girlfriend said ""never I ever done anything with a girl"". I asked her if she ever would, and she said it would depend on the person. I pulled Jake aside and told him to convince Teressa to fool around with Jen, which she actually agreed to. But they didn't want us to watch. So they went into the bedroom and began to fool around. A few minutes later, we hear a mixture of giggling and moaning. Me and Jake were like we have to see this, so we yelled if we could just watch, which they agreed to. We went into the bedroom and Teressa was going down on Jen, the hottest thing I've seen. Eventually Jake said we should just join and they will go with the flow. Jake got naked and began to fuck Teressa while she was eating out Jen. I went in and received a bj from Jen. It was one big foursome. Eventually Teressa asked  if she could give me a bj along with Jen in which she agreed. I didn't want Jake to get jealous so I told them to do the same to Jake. At first it was hard to not get jealous, then I realized how hot this all was. After a few minutes I decided I needed another drink and a smoke. Everyone stopped fooling around and I thought that was the end of it. Teressa went outside with me to smoke and when we came back in, I heard the sound of moaning. It was Jen and Jake..fucking. I felt instant rage until Teressa said we can do the same thing on the couch. So we began to fuck as well. This all went on for 20 minutes or so. Finally we all met in the bedroom and just passed out in the same bed. The next morning I woke up to some weird movement. I looked over and Jake was spoon fucking Jen. When they realized I was awake, they stopped. A few hours later, Jake and Jen had to leave for work and Teressa was still asleep next me. When she woke up I told her Jen and Jake probably fucked all night. Teressa said we should return the favor and fuck all morning, which we did. 


Should I tell my GF that me and Teressa had sex alone?

Except for that he's really nice to me.

I would earn well from that, and I could do more work after that too when she's back (with a little bit less paid per hour). The work is mostly taking care of animals. Letting them out in the morning, check the water and the food three times a day and put them back in the evening. Basic stuff.

However, just today, my girlfriend's mother invited me to go with their family to Denmark because they got an extra place for free. They planned to go to Legoland, and she would pay all my expenses (hotel, foods, etc.) if I would help babysitting the younger children.

And the thing is, both of these are scheduled at the same time.

I'm having a really hard decision. I probably need extra money because I'm moving out this autumn. But also, I'd really want to go to Denmark. I feel a little bit bad for trying to take advantage of my girlfriend's family, but her mother said that it's all fine if I'd help with the babysitting.

While campus is remaining open, it means that a lot of students from the area will not be coming back. I talked to him about it today and found out that not only is he not coming back for the rest of the semester, but he's actually graduating in May, something that he never mentioned to me before.

733,"A little bit ago I asked for advice on losing feelings in the relationship and I got some good advice and planned to stay in the relationship at least till I went on to basic, and to break things off a few days before I left.

After my last post, the relationship got better but my feelings are honestly getting more and more empty. I've had to fake excitement and other emotions several times and.... its hard.

I've been best friends with a girl for a half year now and shes been some of my go to for just talking and some venting as of recently, a week ago I realized I was catching real feelings but I brushed it off cause they'll go away and I'd fake myself through the remainder of school and prom..... but last night the girl confessed she had feelings for me (and she did it respectfully, she didnt mean to get in the way of my current relationship). To take that was very hard and I kept my mouth shut about my feelings but around 2 am when I was half awake I confessed too over text, and that's when things went to hell. It was awkward at first, cause neither of us knew what the feelings meant with the current situation, but eventually things became simple.

1. I've lost almost all feelings for my current relationship and have been faking for a couple weeks now.

2. I really like my best friend more than a friend. And want to have a chance with her.

3. My best friend likes me more than a friend and wants a chance with me.


I've come to terms that I'm the bad guy here in my head. I never cheated on my girlfriend, but I stayed up till 4 am texting a girl with emotions that make me feel like I cheated. I've come to the truth that due to the confession of feelings, I cant fake myself for the next 2 months, I wont be able to make it happen. 


So now I need to break up with my amazing girlfriend who did nothing wrong a month and a half before prom and somehow reduce damage so she doesn't feel like she did anything wrong or that she let herself get used.

740,"Earlier today I was at the gym. I've been working more on toning, but I was feeling lazy today so I was on the treadmill. I had noise cancelling headphones in and was watching a show on my phone. I probably wouldn't of even registered what was happening, but I felt someone staring at me. I paused my show and looked over to where it was coming from and there was this older white lady who wasn't just staring at me, she was looking around at everyone. I could see from the look on her face that she was upset, so I slowed down and took my headphones off to go to her, when I heard what was making her so distressed. 

I couldn't really understand what they were saying. It sounded like some made up language to me, but from the context, I'm guessing they were racial slurs, just none that I was familiar with. I looked back to where they were coming from and there was a young Asian woman maybe early 20's who was still on her treadmill, tears pouring down her face, but looking straight ahead. Maybe twenty feet away from her there were two guys, leaning on another one telling her to go back to her country and that she's a bio terrorist there to kill Americans. 

The guys were a decent size and pretty young, so my first thought was to get some of the workers involved. I went to the older woman and told her I was going to the front desk. She told me she already had, but the man at the desk basically told her that if she didn't want to called out she should of stayed home or go back to China. Basically it seemed like they were going to be useless and the older woman was obviously mid 50's to early 60's, I wasn't going to make her go in.

 It makes me feel terrible, but I was honestly tempted to just go to the locker room and pretend I didn't see anything. If they're willing to ignore that, they'll ignore anything that happens to me and this is a pretty conservative area, the consequences could reach farther than the walls of the gym. They were just calling her names, it's not like they were actually doing anything. They answered that for me, when I heard a loud squeak and a bang. I turned around to see that the guys were now standing on either side of her treadmill and one of them was holding the emergency stop cord. I can only imagine he pulled it out because she was on the ground. I didn't know what to do, but I felt like I had to do something. All I could think of is what I would do if it was my baby was in her place.

 I jogged over to her and knelt down, grabbing her by the arm and helping her up. I heard one of the guys say something and grab at me, but I tugged my arm away from him and told him to fuck off in a voice I hope was more steady than it sounded to me. It was like all the blood in my head was rushing through my ears and all I could think about was running. I started speed walking toward the woman's locker room, telling the woman next to me to hurry up. She didn't resist, so I assume she knew what my plan was without saying anything. I heard them use one of those words behind me that they had been calling her or and they said they hoped I died first, but they didn't follow. 

We got to the locker rooms and we both sat down on the bench. She was openly sobbing at this point and, obviously she wasn't, but all I could think to ask was if she was okay. I found out she was a college student who actually was from China and this sort of thing is happening to her all the time. She's been begging her parents to let her go back home, but they still think it's safer in America and she just needs to focus on her education. I had no idea what to say or even what to do.

It happened this morning, so it's still fresh in my mind, but all I can think about is her crying and leaning on me saying over and over ""I'm a person. I deserve to live."" After what felt like forever, but was probably only a half an hour or so, the older woman came in and told us that the guys had been kicked out for causing a scene. There was no telling if they were waiting for us in the parking lot, though. She didn't have a car, she had walked there from campus, so as nonchalantly as I could, I left and got into my car, pulled up in front of the gym and she got into the passenger seat. Luckily, there was no sign of the guys and no one followed us. All I can assume is they were only interested in making her upset and didn't actually intend further harm, except for a few bruises she got from falling on the treadmill. 

She started crying all over again when we got to her dorm parking lot and she hugged me, thanking me for everything that I'd done and I went home after making sure she got inside her building. The thing that really bothers me if that I really didn't do anything. I didn't call out the guys, I didn't do anything that'll make them leave her alone in the future if she ran into them again. If it wasn't for them actually hurting her and letting my mama bear instincts take over, I might not have stepped in at all. I had no idea what to do. I could of called the cops, but what would they have done? The guys were being assholes, but that's not illegal, plus they probably would of been long gone by the time anyone got there. I could of went to the guy at the desk and went up the line, until I found someone who cares, but what could they do to stop that happening again?

It's getting worse here. It's already an extremely rare occurrence to see a black person, if we do, they're usually in college. My baby is bi racial and I intend to move as soon as possible, but I can't justify just running away and leaving it as it is. Everyone seemed to be going after the Muslims and now the Asians. I'm just some broke twenty something white girl, but there has to be something that I can do. I'm going to be leaving here before the end of the year, but what's happening here, shouldn't be allowed. It's not the 50's. A community being anti everything but white shouldn't be allowed to exist anymore. I can't except that anyone here has to go about their lives, waiting for the next person to attack them.

 If there's any suggestions, please let me know. I don't want my baby to grow up in a world where this isn't even being addressed and isn't seen as a problem. I have to help change things or at least try.",13Mar2020,1

I don't know remember his name as at the time I thought it could only possibly be my anxiety running off, so I didn't make note of it. I mainly just want to know if there is a way for me to check this? I live in the UK and I don't seem to able to find a way without a name. I'm worried he could potentially be attempting to go after the girl on his lock screen, or that it's some fantasy or whatever. It feels like too much of a coincidence.

746," TLDR: Am I cut out for college?

So I've taken about five college classes before, but this is my first semester going full time. I'm taking all general ed classes that I'm just not interested in which can make it a little hard to find motivation.

The Facts:

1. A. I'm positive that I'll get an A in my Guidance class. It's got a lot of homework but it's really easy homework.
2. B/C. I should get a B or C in Spanish depending on how the next test goes. But I think I'll pass no matter what.
3. C. I got a D on my midterm in History but the prof said I could make up some points bringing it to a C. I have an overall grade of a C. I think I'll get a C in the class. I might be able to get it up to a B but I'd have to turn in a perfect final essay. Also I hate the prof so much.
4. ?. My poli sci class only had two assignments. The midterm in class essay exam, and the final essay exam. I have the midterm on Monday and the only studying I'm doing for it is going to be tonight. The outlook isn't great. The professor said people typically get either an A or an F in his class. I haven't done most of the reading, but I pay a lot of attention during in class lectures.

I definitely am doing better now than at the beginning because I know how to manahe my time a lot better, but I only recently figured that out. Should I drop out and either kill myself or become a life-long cashier because I'm just not smart enough for college, or should I take a couple shitty grades my first semester and try to do better in the future?",13Mar2020,1

That’s when I said “It’s a joke, learn to take it” and he raised his voice and started actually screaming at me full on. At this point I was laughing and telling him not to raise his voice at me. He then continued to get in my face saying numerous insults none that really got me going, I was just staring at my mom to tell him to stop but she was just watching because as I said nothing he does is wrong even though he’s been to court for numerous things I won’t go into. He was standing in front of me testing me to do something just calling me a pussy or a faggot or anything he could think of. And than he brought up my past depression which I had gone to therapy for and took pills for because I was having serious dark thoughts and made fun of it just trying to get me to come for him. Which eventually worked to his success. (He’s 25 I just turned 19) So I than took him outside and threw an elbow above his eye where he than started bleeding, he then locked arms with me to wear I went under his arm got behind him and picked him up and slammed him into the earth. I than to stop the whole thing put him in a sleeper hold until I felt him lose the fight left in him and pushed him in the mud. He than got up and said “Your lucky I didn’t knock you out!” Which is ridiculous cause he landed nothing so I then walked away laughing and continued eating my Lasagna. After that he just said “go fuck yourself” to me when he left the house. I didn’t feel bad for him until my mom had started crying because she feels bad for him being a bit of a failure thus far in his life. She went on to say “great job, you didn’t have to do that now he’s going to feel like even more of a loser because his little brother beat him up. At this point I stopped laughing and apologized and admitted to my wrongs, but she still came for me only putting me in the wrong and not him. My half brother never came to my games, awards, birthday celebrations. He’s went on to say how he’s gonna “do shit” with all my girl friend (in like a really dark sexual type of way). I feel bad for my mom a lot and have already reached out apologizing to my half brother more so to take the stress off my mom. I’m not sure if I should go back to talk to my therapist or if this is normal. Thanks for reading any advice, comments, or anything to cheer me up a little is appreciated. Ps I’m really not trying to play victim here if it seems like it.",13Mar2020,1

755,"I’m insecure about my appearance. It’s not that I care about being “hot” or “attractive,” I just want to be thin. It’s a combination of wanting to be *told* I’m thin and petite and wanting to *feel* that way.

In spite of my thin desires, I’m incredibly confused about my feelings around thinness. Firstly, for some reason I equate being thin with being a girl? I have daydreams about being a a thin girl— specifically a short, petite girl.

I purposely post pictures of just my stomach or just my legs to hide the fact that I am a guy. I LOVE getting comments that think I’m a girl. My new favorite comment described my body exactly as a “petite little girl.”

Secondly, I really enjoy when I get sexualized by guys when I’m mistaken for a girl. It’s just SO validating and it makes me feel cute and thin. There are also guys with “eating disorder fetishes” (lol I know) that I legit fantasize about talking with. I desperately want someone to tell me to starve myself for them while demanding I send body check pics to for progress.

Unfortunately, I am nowhere near a “petite little girl” irl. I’m very much a tall boy that will never look like that no matter how thin I get. No one fetishizes guys not eating and even rational people don’t really care beyond a “that’s kind of sad” level.

I’ll probably never be as thin as I’d like to be. My BMI is in the low 17’s but I feel just as fat as when I was a ““““healthy weight.”””” Meanwhile, at least I can live out my fantasies of being a thin girl getting pressured not to eat online!

How would I approach maybe wanting help? I’m not interested in gaining weight, but like help talking through things. I’m not sure if I actually have gender issues too or if I just want to be thin. I’m just really confused. I’m open to chat too if you want.",13Mar2020,1

760,"

This all happened last night I'm (17F) going to prom with my 7 of friends in April, and since none of us felt comfortable to rent and drive a car, we decided that we were just going to let our parents drive us. So unexpectedly, yesterday morning one of my friend's mom decided that she would pay for the full price of the limo, All of us being excited teenagers were very grateful because the limo was expensive for us to pay for even though it was split with eight people. The names of the people involved are Susan, Eva, Rachel, Monica, Chris, Alaina.

Out of the eight of us Eva, Rachel, and I are the closest. We talk every day, and this is our main friend group. So, the issue lies with Rachel and Monica. So a month ago when we were talking about renting a car, we talked about who we were gonna invite and Alaina was included in that conversation. So fast forward to yesterday, when we were all talking about the limo. Rachel and Monicadecided that Alaina won't come. That was shocking considering a couple of months ago at homecoming Rachel, Monica  Alaina, and I went together, and we are all had fun. At one point, Monica and Alaina went off laughing and conversating with each other. 

They said they wouldn't feel comfortable with her coming and felt that she would ruin the *""vibe""* of the group. We went back and forth over this on facetime and Rachel and Monica decided that they would leave it to a majority vote. So, that is what we did. I asked Susan (her mom is paying for the limo) and she said she doesn't care she likes to meet new people. I asked everyone else, and they were fine with it.

So, after doing all that, I told Rachel and Monica everyone else didn't mind and they were still ADAMANT on her not coming. They told me if she came to limo the only thing, they would say to her is hi and bye and will not ignore her for the rest of the night which is incredibly disrespectful towards someone who did nothing to you. They told me to make up something, and I told them no, but felt backed up into the corner, so I gave in and lied to Alaina that the limo was too expensive, and we couldn't get it. I also didn't want to put her in that situation. So, I decided that I would try to get an Uber so she won't go alone. A couple of hours later Alaina called me and said her mom would pay for a limo for all eight of us, even though she doesn't know everyone (She is so sweet).

As I mentioned, my main friend group is Eva, Chris, Rachel, and I, so the kicker is Chris, Eva, and I don't always feel comfortable around Monica, but we deal with it because that's Rachel's friend and wouldn't want her to feel excluded. 

They are saying they want the perfect prom, like what even is the perfect prom?!? I just feel the way they are acting is completely uncalled for and immature.

So, now I don't know what to tell Alaina (if anyone has advice) and I feel crappy about it.",13Mar2020,1

He's quiet, who I'd consider weird and unwelcoming; well she goes on to tell me about how they talked for about a week or so last year, and he cut it off. Well she moved on and found a boyfriend, well recently he has been staring at her, which she notices and when she meets his gaze he looks away. But not like an accidental, ""scan the room"" or ""lost in thought"" stare, it's intentional and happens often. Well I found this weird and kept an eye on him, and sure enough, under 5 minutes everytime he breaks away from looking at her, he looks at her again, it's creepy to watch, he'll look at her, she'll look at him then turn away, then like clockwork he'll stare at her until the process repeats. This it super weird and creepy already, but he has now started following her around whenever he gets the chance, she lives close to the end of the neighborhood and he lives close to the beginning, but he'll follow her halfway or until someone approaches her.

769,"Hey fellow web-surfers. I usually don't ask you guys for advice on many things but lately I've not had many people to turn to.

But, as always, there are helpful strangers waiting for a post they can comment on, and that's what I need right now. So, In advance, I thank you all for any advice given. That being said...

&amp;#x200B;

About 8 or 9 months ago I met my SO. At first, things were great and we spent a lot of time hanging out. About a month and a half in, and we are madly in love. So many things we love about one another, too many to mention. We can't get enough of each other. Fast forward a few months, we decide to move in together. I leave my apartment in my rinky-dink hometown and start living with her an hour from where I was originally. Things are going great at this point. We love sleeping together, even though we can both hog the bed sometimes. We love to cook together, even though I cook ass-backwards from the way she does. Things are going great, really.

After another month or two passes, my (And I will be referring to my GF's Mother this way from here on out) MIL, who lives with my GF due to a major disability, starts to notably become more outspoken about how much time my partner and I spend together compared to MIL. She would tell me, after spending some time out with her mother, that she'll say things like ""I'm Glad Shrlck didn't come with us today,"" and ""he gets you ALL the time."" At first, my SO would laugh and just say her mother was jealous and was just afraid she would never get to see her daughter. Understandable. But then, it got worse.

My SO would start to mention things my MIL would say that seemed more derogatory. She complained to my SO about how I did things or how much I eat (Not overweight, I just eat a lot, I'm a 20 M). She had even become more hostile in the way she said the aforementioned comments. Like there was a REAL disdain for me behind her words. My SO would keep saying that it isn't a big deal, but I took notice right away. I have been with a manipulative partner before, so the phrases and words used sounded familiar, and I know the ways parents work their ideas into their children's heads, even as they become adults. I feel like she has been leaning on her mom's shoulder and my MIL has been feeding her with pessimistic ideas. Lately, my SO and I have had serious issues in our relationship.

Over time, we have stopped having sex, (to be fair, it's not easy for either of us with her mom in the house) but we used to not care as much. I have lost a lot of my sex drive and I naturally have a low libido, but it's taken such a toll on my SO's insecurities that she has become essentially ""un-attracted"" to me. I have been told I am quite annoying with my dry humor, but what used to make her laugh just makes her cringe now. She even feels exhausted with me some days. She will hardly ever let me help around the house (she is very independent and doesn't like to rely on others) but I know she appreciates when I help around the house. Lately, I've been so depressed about this, I haven't been doing as much as I can to improve as a partner and it is causing a bad cycle. I know where I fail as a partner, and I try to talk to her but it just doesn't get anywhere. I feel like I can't tell her how I feel about when she takes her insecurities out on me. Criticism has become a forbidden art in our relationship and it is ruining us slowly.

I gotta tell you guys, I want to spend the rest of my life with this woman, but I don't think she wants to spend it with me. I can't figure out if my MIL is sabotaging it, I am just a failure of a man or if it's both, but she used to be so transparent with me that it has become like night and day in less than a year. I feel like once we move away without her mom (which is the current plan) things might start becoming more manageable, but if I'm wrong... I really don't want to be wrong. I am in such a rut right now, I can't think straight.

If anyone has any advice, I could really use it. If not, then at least some comforting words before we end up putting the bullet in the chamber for our relationship would be nice. Thanks fellow web-surfers.",13Mar2020,1

775,"Hi everyone! Hope all is well during this stressful time. 

So, before the corona emergency started to take off I found an amazing apartment in NYC with a fellow gal my age and we really get along great. I am currently in Florida. I have saved up a couple months worth of rent (like $7000) and I felt confident. I have an online business that usually is enough to cover rent, but I would be getting a job in New York additionally. So, smooth sailing I thought. 

I put a deposit down, but haven’t signed the lease papers. I’m thinking maybe I should talk to the landlord and have maybe some peace of mind of what to do in an emergency, but don’t really wanna turn anyone off by saying “hey, I might not be able to pay rent if this gets bad”. My father is co-signing, and I don’t want to put him in the position to pay when who knows how his paycheck will be affected. He’s financially secure enough, but I just don’t want him to because this is my responsibility. 

So it’s either sign the papers right before leaving to ensure I can get to the city and speak to the landlord, or just completely back out and hopefully get my deposit back (it’s okay if I don’t, I accept the mistake / responsibility and can recover just fine) and wait things out. I kind of would feel like a douche for backing out during all of this, but a state of emergency is just that, so....

It’s really tough. I don’t want to complain at all because this is a serious matter and health concerns and anxiety are involved for many. I just want some advice on what to do, because it’s truly tough finding a great place for a good cost and finding a nice roommate. I would be near my sister, and ..... agh. 

I also do get heat from people saying “you’d move to the city without a set career in place?!” .... I feel many people do look for jobs when they move. I think this is fairly common? So please don’t grill me on this. I have a cushion that is reasonable at least for right now, and have back up ideas on if things go sour. 

So! What would y’all do in this situation? I am very conflicted since there’s no one really knows what’s going on.",13Mar2020,1

I didn't do anything romantic apart from kiss one dude on the cheek in first grade and made out with a kid on the bus in second grade because it was such a ""bad"" thing to do. I never felt any attraction of any kind towards them, everything was regular child experimentation of what romantic relationships were.

But now that I'm older, I'm trying to find my actual footing in the world.

In 6th grade, I dated this dude for a year. The most we did was a brief kiss on the lips. At some point in 7th grade, I found my feelings had vanished for him. After a bit of anxiously looking over the options, I ended the relationship. A year later, my friend confessed he had a crush on me. I psyched myself into believing I did have a crush on him when it was really my doubts and worries getting the best of me. Only an hour after getting into the relationship, I realized I felt nothing for him. We dated for 6 months, broke up.

In freshman years I found myself favoring women more in media and generally thinking they were more attractive. So, if I never loved any of my bfs in the first place and I'm starting to favor women more, I must be lesbian, right? It seemed like the next logical step to me back then, but now I look back and think I was grasping any straws I could to avoid saying I simply can't love anyone at all.

I'm now a junior and haven't dated anyone since. I've had a good handful of people confess to me, but I rejected them all. I just can't bring myself to love anyone and when I think I do, I'm only worrying myself. I know I may be aromantic with everything I've stated, but I don't want to be and I feel as though I won't be a desirable partner, especially in highschool.

I know I'm asexual (for me, meaning I don't experience sexual attraction to anyone at all) and I also don't like doing romantic things, like kissing. I'll cuddle and hold hands for a bit, but that's pretty much the extent. I don't like doing anything else, I feel no desire to and honestly kind of grossed out. With these, I feel like no one will want to date me since it's no different than being friends with me, except with a different title.

I also feel that, if I do say I'm something other than lesbian, people will accuse me of faking. I know I should have trust in my friends, but I'm scared. I don't even know where to start.

Any and all advice is appreciated. Thank you for taking the time to read my post. :\]",13Mar2020,1

Trigger Warning 

So I was 13 years old and walking home from school. It was October and dark outside so I was cautious if my surroundings.

I was 5 minutes away from home when I was taken from the road and raped in the back of a car by a woman.

It ruined me for years until I was 15 and met this amazing guy who was the son of my dad's best friend. My dad's friend just got custody of his son after not seeing him for the first 15 years of his life. 

After a few weeks of getting to know each other, we started dating and a year later we found out I was pregnant just after my 16th birthday.

After the birth of our son we got engaged.

Then at 17 we found out we were pregnant again. This time since he was working his dream job and I was living the dream as a stay at home mum, we decided to get married.

Flash forward to now... we are happily married and have been for 4 years. We have an adorable 5 year old boy and a beautiful 4 year old daughter.

But his mother came back into his life. We had never factored her into our life or really spoke about her since she gave him up for adoption when he stopped letting her do sexual things with him without letting his dad know hence why his dad got full custody. But now she needs money and came into our life with a crash.

I married the son of my rapist. It has opened up so much pain that I don't know how to deal with and I am terrified that it has ruined my relationship and life.

We have discussed everything but I just don't know how to feel. A monster like her couldn't possibly make a great man like him.",13Mar2020,1
787,"I (20F) have been talking to this guy for nearly six months now.

 We met once, on the last day of February, it was wonderful, following which he asked to meet again in a few days. On the day off he cancelled, however, citing work as a reason. Cool, I understand that, no worries. He's working in a corporate setting and I'm still in college (a one year age gap).

Following that, it's been two weeks now. I understand work is hard and hellish and busy but we do live fifteen minutes apart. He gets weekends off. I tend to believe people, if they want to, make time for things. His texts have also dwindled in addition.

I reached out first to him last week, frustrated, directly telling him I was attracted to him and that he should let me know if he wasn't. He said he definitely was, but hasn't made any effort since then either.

Here's the thing, I know he's not what you'd call a fuckboy, by any stretch. I used to chalk it up to him just being shy and nervous because I really relate to that, but I also feel there's a limit to shyness and beyond that it's just unwillingness to put in effort.

It's also been six months and I'm so tired of pining over him. The only thing keeping me going is him telling me he likes me, but I feel I'm giving way too much importance to that statement. I should just quit, right? Do I simply stop responding to his texts?",13Mar2020,1

790,"I’m a 21 yo female. Engaged and expecting a baby in a few short months. I’m in need of advice before I make a huge mistake. 
My relationship started about two years ago and it was very turbulent. On and off the whole time until we both found out I was expecting around 5 months ago. Throughout the relationship I had very many trust issues because of how much attention he’d pay his female friends on social media. Keeping exes and old fuck buddies online through fb, insta, and Snapchat. That caused a lot of arguments as I had been very hurt by exes in the past. Some days things would be good, other times things would be bad. I kept finding it more and more difficult to trust him and stay happy and once we’d fight or take a break from eachother he’d go and hurt me worse by continuing the things he was doing or paying 300+ dollars worth of nudes off of female friends. (He says it was just a mistake because he figured we were really done)

After going back and forth for so long, me ending up in jail for fighting and other personal struggles, I decided I was finally done with the back and forth. I wasn’t just gonna day it anymore. I was done. 

Period is late by 2 weeks. Has happened before so I wasn’t super worried but decided to do a test. Pregnant. Great. I had originally decided if I was pregnant to abort but finding out that day was just different. I couldn’t even think of it. Since that was off the table for me, I decided I’d hide it from him and leave the state and raise the child alone. But my conscience wouldn’t let me sit right with that option either. 

I told him I was expecting and he was so happy. It was a relief for sure. We decided to fix things and I laid rules down. Take me seriously, stop playing with my emotions, stop flirting with people, etc. 
Things have been great since we found out. And I couldn’t have been happier. Even if it’s only been a handful on months. I’m happy we finally have what we both have been wanting. Eachother, a family, and peace. That’s all I wanted and worked for since the beginning and I was happy he finally got himself together. In my head the baby was a wake up call for the both of us. (Yes I know babies do not fix relationships)

That’s just a bit of messy backstory. Take it to two weeks ago. We are in the plans of moving in together. Getting married in less than a month. And expecting the baby in about 3 or so. 
I still struggle with trusting him as some thing are just hard to recover from. I’ve gotten so much better and he agrees. The trust is building. But I have my moments. He hasn’t been distant but for a short while I felt as if his excitement for everything died down. Understandable since he’s a guy and just wants the baby here already. But that got to me. 
I was worried maybe the same fidelity problems were starting again. Talk myself out of it because that’s the first thing my mind always goes to. 

Currently at our soon to be home/apartment (I don’t live here yet and come and go from my hometown to here) and I’ve been here a week with my mind in worried shambles. My first night back I’m ashamed to admit I went through his phone while he was asleep. Nothing on social media. Decided to check the search history even tho I never do. Porn. Okay understandable. I don’t hold out or shy away from sex but I was gone for a week so it’s whatever. Goes through more searches. And some shady searches come up. Like hentai with fathers fucking daughters. Hentai is weird so I was only a little weirded out. But I kept scrolling and Lolita searches came up. And he also typed “baby” in a porn sites search engine. 
There was more but those were the most concerning to me. 

He has also tried to do sexual things to me while two of his young nephews were in a room with us. Their parents were in other parts in the house. This was a few weeks before I found out I was pregnant. He didn’t try to touch them. But he tried to rub on my butt and get me in the mood and I was like what the fuck. No there’s kids here. And he’s like you’re right and stopped. (That alone had me feeling a bit strange) 

Now I’m afraid he’s not who I think he is. I’m worried he’s hiding something sinister and I’m afraid to marry him and find out later. I’m trying not to stress so I don’t hurt my baby. Internally struggling with myself and as much as I love my baby I’m wishing I did get an abortion so I wouldn’t have to maybe later on get a divorce or something like that. This might all sound very selfish but I’m so lost. He’ll fight tooth and nail to take or keep contact with her. And I don’t wanna risk losing her through divorce because I have arrests on my record. And there’s nothing wrong with him wanting to see her, As a father he has a right to see her but if he ends up a pervert or hurts her what do I do? It’ll be too late. 
At this point I could care less if this was me finding out he was cheating. I’m concerned for my babies life now. 

Excuse me being all over the place I’ve never done this before and just really need someone opinion on this. My grandparents are pressuring me to go through with marriage bc it’s the right thing to do and don’t really listen when I say this might not be what I want. I haven’t mentioned what I saw. I’m hoping to speak to my mother about this soon. We don’t talk often but I need her advice as well.",13Mar2020,1
791,My boyfriend told me he wanted to propose to me with his grandmothers ring and I don’t like the setting and I told him that when she first gave it to him. Now he’s upset because he said the ring is very sentimental to him and he thought it shouldn’t matter as long as we love each other. so now I feel bad that it’s not what I had always envisioned as my ring. He said later on we can upgrade the ring. Am I in the wrong for being upset?,13Mar2020,1
792,"I am a 27 year old Pharmacy graduate living at home. I do not pay any bills or rent as I'm trying to get myself out of a hole and am paying back student loan overpayments, car, phone etc. I work part time as a I failed my board exam and am studying again for it in June. 

I have an Asian family so it isn't unheard of to stay at home. However, I am greatly struggling as my parents are quite difficult. I am close to my mum but she is kind of an enabler. My Father has always been very violent, volatile and I guess abusive. He has a big thing about control and cleanliness. For example I have curfew at 10pm, I have bathroom privileges I can lose and am not allowed to use the toilet when on periods. He is very particular so for example can completely flip and scream abuse if there is a drop of water on the floor. I am often called an ungrateful parasite, fat, ugly, stupid. I am constantly cornered for ""interventions"" with him and my Mother under the guise of trying to understand. The latest one was because I was lying about having a boyfriend. I am not supposed to have one until I pass my board exam end of June. In reality they want me to be with someone of their choosing. 

He does not know why I lie but everyone in the family lies to him because he is always so angry. He always says things like how I make everything seem like his fault. How he sacrificed everything to give me an education but I'm too stupid to finish it. How I was supposed to be his retirement plan but I'm just a failure. He bursts through my room to check I'm studying, screams when I have a break so I end up locked in a room for hours on end constantly on edge. He goes through my possessions and throws things away, goes through my mail. My mum and I have become good at hiding things like money or sweet wrappers. I have a separate account that I put what little I can manage so that my mum can occasionally buy something for herself or a present for a family members birthday because he controls all the money.

I get upset when people think I am privileged or a princess. I would do anything to get out of here. I am constantly on edge and paranoid. I have done everything from working nights in a factory to cleaning up vomit for a living. I understand what hard work is. During my placement year I had a horrid tutor but still managed to get signed off. I worked 50 hours while trying to study and constantly jumping through hoops at home and at work. I failed my exam and lost a lot of my hair during that year so have big patches. He also mocks me calling me a disgusting balding fatass. This is hard because I was mocked throughout my childhood about my weight and so I starved. Food is also my comfort so I constantly yo yoed through the years. I tried to cut my stomach off with a knife, I have issues with self harm that I battle with still. In addition I've begun to dissociate so feeling as if I do not exist in the moment. I have to snap rubber bands. I am constantly exhausted and foggy brained. I am struggling again to focus on my studying but desperately dont want to fail.

Despite this I am working part time in a Pharmacy and have turned the place around. It's the first time the branch has been hitting all their targets and I have trained up a small team, I have been there a month and only make minimum wage. The regional manager has offered me the Pharmacy Manager role if I pass and wants to fast track me to a higher position. So I think I must not be completely useless. I started my own business because I love art but was never allowed to draw outside or primary school. It did okay at 100 orders a month and helped me through university but my tutor made me close it. I'm trying to reopen it now. But I feel exhausted because I smile all day at work and smile outside but inside I feel like ending it. I don't enjoy playing the victim, I have always tried to tough out everything. But I know thinking about dying all the time probably is not that healthy.

I do not know what my options are. They will not put me on the housing waiting list and I don't exactly have a baby or a black and blue face anymore. I can't seem to get counselling on the NHS I have been on the waitlist for over a year. I was referred to online therapy but they said I was too severe. I don't have any friends because I'm socially retarded. I have a lovely boyfriend but we are only a couple months in and he feels like crap having to hide all the time. I think this pressure is yet again going to ruin another relationship of mine. I understand that I am not getting beaten up so it is not as big a deal but I just feel so sad as so many years of my life have been wasted. I'm not sure what the point even is anymore.",13Mar2020,1
793,"I know the post sounds a little weird but hear me out. I don't have have a engagement or wedding ring. My husband and I plan on getting a set soon. One day we were discussing rings when he said, out of nowhere, ""why don't I just ask my grandpa for my grandmother's rings?"" I initially said no. But now that I think of it, I feel like it might be a good idea. 

Some background on the rings:

My husband's grandmother passed away almost 30 years ago and her rings have been sitting in a drawer since. My husband is particularly close to his grandfather, and I have a great relationship with him as well ( I've been apart of the family since 2006. His grandfather has no daughters and my husband is the oldest grandson. So I'm thinking of asking my husband to ask his grandfather if he would be receptive to the idea of giving him the rings so I could use them as my wedding ring set. Would that be ok, or should I not even have him bring it up?

801,"For 8 years,  5/6 managers and the owner in my company all worked together in a boardroom because our office was too small. There was reception area and the other manager that had his own office but that was because it was also our interview room.

Well, January was a great month for all of us. I received a promotion as head of HR and we upgraded offices to where all managers have our own offices, 2 huge storage rooms and a huge boardroom. I was absolutely thrilled to have my own office because I keep my door closed so I don't see and hear anyone and I have music playing which helps even more not hear anyone talking. This has made me even more productive which I have told my boss about.

3 weeks ago, we promoted one of our employees to basically do a lot of the work which stops us from doing our tasks such as doing interviews and will help out with scheduling when it starts getting busy for us. She's been doing all of her work and interviews in the boardroom which is 2 rooms next to me.

On Tuesday, my boss told her to bring a table in my office so I can train her and we can schedule together which I was fine with but that's all he told me. It definitely was a little bit difficult for me because I had to keep my door open since I can't have my door closed with a female so I was getting distracted by everyone walking back and forth and it seems like she is not able to sit still for over 30 seconds. She also does not like having music playing because it distracts her which is fine because I just plugged in my earphones.

Well yesterday I was moving the desk out of my office because I was supposed to go pickup a table and 2 chairs to fill up the empty space in my office. My boss asked me what I was doing so I told him it was an eyesore and I was getting chairs and a table for my office. He then tells me no and to keep it there because I was going to start permanently sharing my office with her which really pissed me off. I asked him when did we discuss this because this is news to me. He told me that when she moved the table in my office the today day, he said that. I then told him that he never told me I was sharing my office with her, he simply said to bring a table in so we can work on the schedule together.

With her being in my office, I'm forced to leave my door open which is going to distract me, plus I need to share my office with someone who can't stand still for 30 seconds, who will be going in and out throughout the day to do interviews and I'll have to ask her to stop what she's  whenever I will have to have meetings with staff or have to speak to someone on the phone regarding something serious, I'll have to ask her to leave the room. Whenever she goes and does her interviews, she'll be back in the boardroom anyways so why should she work in my office when she'll be in the boardroom most of her day anyways?

I'm going to speak to my boss about it tonight or on Monday but I've got a strong feeling he's just going to give me an answer of something along the lines of ""This is an office setting and these kind of things happen so suck it up.""

Am I in the wrong for being pissed off and basically refuse to permanently share my office or am I overreacting and should just deal with it?",13Mar2020,1

I don’t hold out or shy away from sex but I was gone for a week so it’s whatever. Goes through more searches. And some shady searches come up. Like hentai with fathers fucking daughters. Hentai is weird so I was only a little weirded out. But I kept scrolling and Lolita searches came up. And he also typed “baby” in a porn sites search engine. 
There was more but those were the most concerning to me. 

He has also tried to do sexual things to me while two of his young nephews were in a room with us. Their parents were in other parts in the house. This was a few weeks before I found out I was pregnant. He didn’t try to touch them. But he tried to rub on my butt and get me in the mood and I was like what the fuck. No there’s kids here. And he’s like you’re right and stopped. (That alone had me feeling a bit strange) 

Now I’m afraid he’s not who I think he is. I’m worried he’s hiding something sinister and I’m afraid to marry him and find out later. I’m trying not to stress so I don’t hurt my baby. Internally struggling with myself and as much as I love my baby I’m wishing I did get an abortion so I wouldn’t have to maybe later on get a divorce or something like that. This might all sound very selfish but I’m so lost. He’ll fight tooth and nail to take or keep contact with her. And I don’t wanna risk losing her through divorce because I have arrests on my record. And there’s nothing wrong with him wanting to see her, As a father he has a right to see her but if he ends up a pervert or hurts her what do I do? It’ll be too late. 
At this point I could care less if this was me finding out he was cheating. I’m concerned for my babies life now. 

Excuse me being all over the place I’ve never done this before and just really need someone opinion on this. My grandparents are pressuring me to go through with marriage bc it’s the right thing to do and don’t really listen when I say this might not be what I want. I haven’t mentioned what I saw. I’m hoping to speak to my mother about this soon. We don’t talk often but I need her advice as well.",13Mar2020,1
807,"Alright, bit of context.  
I have a sweet girlfriend of about 1,5 years. Things are pretty serious, eventually marrying is not out of the question. She has a younger sister, who is 17. She has a boyfriend of about as long as me (well call him John) and my GF, but when she was just with him, she made out with a friend of hers (we'll call him Paul), because he liked her and she thought about leaving John. Eventually she wasn't sure anymore and now she's a year and some change with John. John is a great guy. Funny, sweet, really good for everyone. Paul is a bit of a weird guy, but alright.  
My problem is that her mother seems to know, and my GF knows too, but none of them have really done anything. I just feel incredibly bad (and partially hate my GF for telling me this) that John doesn't know anything. I hardly see him, so it hasn't been awkward, but i just can't rest my mind.   
My GF told me she doesn't have  'the right relationship' with her sister to speak with her about it.  
What advice would you give me? Telling him would harm the relationship with my inlaws severely, and i don't think John would appreciate ME telling him.",13Mar2020,1
808,"I recently began dieting in a major way. I had been struggling to stay at my highest weight but I didn't want to struggle anymore I wanted to no longer be at my highest weight( I've lost 30lbs so far woo). I realized I had an unhealthy relationship with food. I was not only an emotional eater but eating was also more like a hobby. I got really good at cooking. Money was always tight but you have to eat, might as well be able to make every meal taste amazing. Also I love pasta and potatoes and they're cheap.

We're very happy and I know that going to be with him I'll be safe and won't have to worry about financial situations or a home or anything. The problem lies with my mom. To make a long story short our life hasn't been easy, her childhood she was badly abused and neglected and never had anyone, so when she had me she thought of me as the only one that would truly love her, growing up I see that's pretty much true. She married my stepfather and for 13 years he physically and mentally abused her and I until he was arrested. He got out last year and has since then been just as mentally abusive, if not more so, than before. So my mom is very unstable. We're in a pretty poor financial situation and I had to drop out of high school right after I turned 16 to help with bills. Last year she was so bad off mentally I took care of every bill and making sure we were all fed (I have a younger sister as well). I love my mom, but I'm tired of my life being put on hold and revolving around protecting her. I have the option for a better life now and I wouldn't be leaving to never contact her again, I want to maintain regular contact and visits. I'm just so afraid because I worry she'll either never forgive me or kill herself. I just want her to realize I'm perfectly capable of being an adult and I want to move on while I have the chance. I can't tell her until I'm already gone either or she'll stop me and cut off contact to my boyfriend. I'd also like to state that my boyfriend moving here isnt an option due to immigration issues and I want him to be able to finish his last year in college!

819,"Hello Reddit,

I have a problem that I'm not sure how to go about.
I live in a flat share with 2 other people. I have lived here for a year with no big problems.
However a long running problem since I moved in has been the smell of smoke. This flat is owned by our landlord who strictly says it is a smokers free flat. So obviously it would make sense that if you do smoke, to not smoke in the flat right?
Well one of my flat mates (and I know which one it is) does smoke in the flat. They only do it in their room, most likely out the window, however, the smell seeps into the hallway and I smell it often. Not only is this pretty gross (other people have pointed it out on entry) but I'm extremely asthmatic and it often causes me to cough or wheeze.
I am 100% sure which flatmate it is. I have seen them smoking outside their work and seen them rolling cigarettes and also they just got back from a holiday and now they have returned the flat had started smelling of cigarettes again.
The problem is that we aren't really that close as flatmates, like at all. We have a chat to update on important flat messages but apart from that we aren't really close. I don't know how to bring it up and I don't want to be rude. I also don't want to tell my landlord because I don't want to be a snitch.
I feel like I should also mention our building does have a smoking area so they are able to go there and smoke instead of fully leaving the building.
I'm not sure what to do and I feel like it's super gross to have to deal with the smell all the time and it also is affecting me physically.
Any advice on how I can handle this? :/",13Mar2020,1

821,"To give some context— I used to be really close with her last year but cause of our schedules we’ve slowly drifted apart (we’re in college). Part of that was because she lived in a desperate place on campus and became close with her roommates and even got a boyfriend. I tried to keep in contact for a semester but it felt like too much effort and I was already becoming depressed (for other reasons) so I started to isolate myself. I feel like this has had a negative impact on our relationship. We are still on good terms, it’s just we rarely ever hang out.

Just three weeks ago, however, I asked her to come to this event and she agreed. It was during a Friday night, and we ended up not going cause it turned out to be religious and she was worried they’d try to convert us (jokingly of course). She said her boyfriend was having a party of about 15 people or so and I should come. I did, and it was really fun. She promised to stay with me the entire time cause I was worried since I don’t know her friends and she understood that. 

Anyway, just recently, I got an invite from one of her boyfriends friends since he recognized me from the party. He saw me on campus and said I should go to this Saint Patrick’s day party they were having Friday. I agreed, and told my friend. She said it’d be awesome if I came. However, with the whole Coronavirus thing going on, I asked her just a few days before about the party and she said it was cancelled. A bit bummed but whatever.

Then she posts a picture of her and her friends after the party dressed up. Normally I wouldn’t mind, but for some reason... it made me upset. I think it just set in that I’m not important to her at all, and that she has a life of her own now. Throughout the year I really wanted to connect with her again, but I think It’s setting in that she’d living her own life now. I don’t hate her, I’ll never hate her, but I’ve come to a realization that I think I should probably just let her go.

By this, I’m thinking of just meeting with her and telling her this. I just want to affirm that we have drifted apart, and that we should focus on living our own lives. I feel like that kind of closure would help me, but I’m not sure if I should. I feel like such an asshole in this situation, and I’m just really worried I’m doing the wrong thing. Should I just let her go without saying anything? Or should I tell her how I feel? I don’t know anymore. I think I’m just overreacting.

TL;DR: I don’t know if I should let go of a friend who I’ve been growing more distant from, even though we have history.",13Mar2020,1

824,"Hi, I'm (F) 21 years old and currently living with my boyfriend (22) at his mom's house. I moved out of my parents house a year ago for a lot of reasons but mostly due to constant argues with my sisters/hearing them argue with each other and seeing how they disrespect my parents. I could only bring so many things with me to my boyfriend's mom's house so most of my clothes and belongings are still at my parents house. 

Lately, my mom has been asking me to move my things out of my room so she could make space for my niece. For the past few years, my 3 sisters have all been living at my parents house alone their children and my sisters husband. There's 12 people total in their 6 bedrooms house. My parents (60 &amp; 60), my 3 sisters, (29, 36, 40) 5 nephews (10, 12, 14, 14, 16), my sisters husband (40) and my niece (3). One of my sisters (36) has her own bedroom downstairs and shares that with my 10 year old nephew. Another sister (29) has her own bedroom. Two nephews (12 &amp; 14) share a bedroom. And my other two nephews (14 &amp; 16) share a bedroom. This leaves my 40 year old sister and her 40 year old husband to sleep on a mattress in the living room with my 3 year old niece. My mom wants me to move my things out so she can give the room to my niece and her mom (40 year old sister). 

I understand I might seem like an asshole for not moving my things out, but I don't know where to put most of my things AND none of my sisters pay my parents rent. They are all extremely comfortable living at home despite argues with each other and my parents. 

Overall, this is not a healthy living situation for anyone there but none of them are making any efforts to leave. My mom is sort of like the mediator and just wants everyone to be content so she allows them to stay for free despite constant stress. They don't appreciate what my parents do for them and don't do their part in cleaning up after themselves or their children. My poor mom is 60 years old and still having to clean up after these grown adults as if they were children. She still makes dinner everyday for the house and no one else puts in any effort. I told my mom I don't feel comfortable making my room available for my sister and niece because if I do they'll get even more comfortable and have even less motivation to leave. Am I just being a jerk?? Should I just woman up and donate/throw out most of my things? I don't want to create more stress for my mom especially since she's not in the best health, but I also don't want my sisters to just have everything handed to them.",13Mar2020,1
825,"So basically I ignored what my coach said after track practice and did these finisher thingies on a workout app that our school uses even after he told us not to.

828,"Hello. I am a young girl, not even 15 yet. I come here to seek advice on how to prevent at least myself from contracting the Coronavirus. As the title says, I am scared my parents do not take the Coronavirus seriously. Why? I'll tell you.

When the Coronavirus hit, I told my mother and her boyfriend, who is living with us. They laughed it off and I didn't really think much of it at first either, I will admit. Then it got to the US. It was on the news and my mother's boyfriend was watching it. I can't remember what was said, but they weren't fazed by it, really. If they were, they would take higher measures. Now, onto today. I read somewhere that people were stocking up on toilet paper and other such things. I suggested we do the same, and it was spoken a bit about later, like a sentence or so, but nothing too serious. After all this, I fear they aren't taking this seriously. The worst part? The Coronavirus is in my State, Ohio. This scares me, and I know that if I contract it, my mother wont listen to me. She never takes me to get tested for anything. Even if I have a horrible fever, cough, and trouble breathing, she still probably won't listen to me. And that's what scares me as-well. I don't have any money, and have no way of going to the store. 

For those wondering, I have no friends to stay with and my mother is a nurse, which somehow makes this more horrifying. I do not go out a lot, but I still do not want to take the risk. I'm in online school, so that helps, I guess.

It’s all rooted from repeated trauma.  I get the whole 9 yards, nightmares, insomnia, irritability, flashbacks, you name it.

837,"So basically I am in $8000 debt. When I was working I had a credit card because I was told using one boosts your credit raiting when you pay it back. I did that.

So the place I worked closed and I had no job to go to. I was looking but just had no luck. I moved back home with my mum. I had $1000 in savings as I was an apprentice and have very little of an income. Mum wanted me to pay $175 for a fortnight. I explained I had no income at the moment and she still wanted me to pay it. Plus I had to pay a bill to get services back. 

So I paid it. Obviously $175 is cheap however that money didn't last. When it ran out I tried to say I have no income. I had applied to centerlink by this stage. It took 6 months of a process because they were flooded with uni students apparently. In those 6 months I was forced to pay rent on my credit card. I had to transfer money out of the card and back in to do the monthly repayments because I simply had no money. I got backpay but it was only $900ish. They claimed it was due to the form being submitting on their side.

 It sucks because I am in a stage of floating while actively looking for a job. I am luckily vegan but I am putting money into the card and fees eat it all. I called the company and they convinced me that if I swap it to a different type of card the fees will be cheaper but that has not been the case. They have been the same. I am pretty angry because I feel as though I have been tricked into paying higher fees and blatently lied to. They said I  would pay a higher annual but the monthlies would be lower. This has not been the case. In face it's been the oppisite. 

Fee's are;

1th feb: $140.75

16th jan: $131.03

17th dec: $140.32

Now the old system was:

15th nov: $126.81

17th oct: $129.43

I am feeling scammed to be honest. What would you guys do in this situation other then getting a job. I am literally living off potatoes and lentils as it is. I am putting $250-$300 a fortnight in as I get a little over $500 a fortnight. I have to pay bills which are coming out of the card.

Net for houshold: from $70 month

Rent: $175 ($25 goes into the net bill) fortnight ($350 a month)

Phone: $55 Month

Groceries: $40-60 a fortnight ($120 a month)

This changed when I found myself liking L. My friend told me I was rebounding and advised me not to go further with it, but when L confessed to me that she liked me, I was over the moon and confessed too.

We have been happy for some time and I love her a lot. But recently I’ve been wondering if I really love her in a romantic way. I just don’t feel the same way I did at the start of our relationship.

There is also a new girl, we’ll call her K. She’s amazing. We hit it off quickly and have lots in common. I can feel myself falling for her. She has told me she has feelings for me, but that she would never act on them because I’m currently in a relationship.

I’m starting to think my friend was right. I think L might have been a rebound, and now I feel something real for K. Especially because I’ve now made amends with that old ex of mine and I feel like I have no troubles with that relationship anymore.

The thing is, L really loves me. I know she does. She’s so much more enthusiastic than me about our relationship. She also has abandonment issues because of her past, and I don’t want to fuel them even more.

She responded cordially, but asked me not to say anything to anyone as rumors will start to fly. I respect her for asking me to not say anything. Also, I understand that office rumors are inevitable, but this life event should not warrant rumors. Yet, the more I think about it the more it makes sense given her position. 

So, my question is this: are there any admin assistants out there that can give me advice to navigate this brand new world? I just want to be successful.",13Mar2020,1

845,"So my friends and I were hanging out at the mall having a good time. We walked pass a women’s clothing store which I can’t remember the name of. That’s when one of my friends dared me to try on a red sparkly dress that he saw on a mannequin. I instantly refused. That’s when all my friends started ganging up on me. “Don’t be a p**** bro”. “You never wanna do anything fun”. “I’m not giving you a ride home if you don’t put it on”. I knew he was kidding about not giving me a ride home, but I decided to have some fun and give them a good laugh. They found the dress on a rack and gave it to me. They followed me to the change rooms. The worker was wondering what we were doing and my friends explained. She laughed and then took me to a changing room. I started to strip down to my underwear leaving my clothes on the floor. As I’m putting on the dress, I see a hand pull my clothes from under the door followed by a bunch of laughter. I peeked my head out the change room and noticed none of them were there. I called one of them asking where they went. I could hear laughter in the background. “We’re going to the car. You’re going to have to come get your clothes in the next 10 minutes or we’re leaving.” I had a good feeling they weren’t really going to leave me but it still made me panic a little bit. I walked out of the change room all embarrassed. “Awww you look so pretty” the worker teased. I asked her if I could go get my clothes quickly since my friends took my clothes. She told me I would have to buy the dress and explained that I could return it once I got my clothes. I walked passed a group of girls on my way to pay and they all pulled out their phones and started taking pictures. I quickly walked to the other side of the mall where my friends were parked while people continued to laugh and take pictures. I tried my best to hide my face. People continued to catcall and tease me until I left the mall. I walked up to the car where all my friends were laughing their a**** off. I told them to give me my f****** clothes before I punched one of them. They eventually gave me my clothes after messing with me for a good 2 minutes. I changed behind the car and all I could think about was all the people who got pictures of me in the mall. I’m scared people from school are going to see them.

847,"Hello, 

So today I emailed my dealership and asked if there was a way to transfer the lease into my spouse’s name. Summarized, they said no, so I asked if my spouse and I happened to separate (we aren’t separating I was just curious that if we did what could happen) would there be a way where they could keep the car. They basically said no. 

I then switched the subject and asked if the car was no longer repairable then what would happen. And she replied, “Were you in an accident? That’s a hard question until I speak to the insurance company and they tell me what their settlement amount is. Because they might pay off the vehicle. But if they don’t then you owe a balance.” Which was fine but that wasn’t the question I was asking so I said, “I wasn’t in an accident, I am going off of the assumption that the car will not make it through it’s entire leased term. It has many electronic issues since I got it.” She replied in a snippy way saying, “That has nothing to do with an accident. you were asking about if it was an accident or totaled.” I said, “Yes in the sense that a car being totaled as in it is not repairable or costs more than the cars worth. A car can be totaled without an accident. The mechanics said that this car shouldn’t have been sold in this condition and it will not last due to the many electrical issues.” And then she rudely responded, “I’m sorry but that is pretty hard to believe considering how long you used it for a loaner car before you transferred into it voluntarily and happily. Nothing I can do for you in that regard. Sorry your marriage isn’t working out.” Like what??? I replied “that is completely unprofessional for you to say” and she rudely said, “That’s not unprofessional at all to offer condolences. Sorry you see it that way. Obviously you misinterpret emails and should no longer email me questions if you do not like the response. Try the phone.” 

I WAS LIVID. But I refrained from responding. Later on I deleted my positive review and changed it to a negative one commenting on the rude comment she made/the unprofessionalism/how I received two overpriced lemon vehicles. She then commented on it and said that I “came to her about my relationship problems and wanted out of the lease.” Which is not true, and said that I am defaming/libel and they will be formally contacting me soon with a legal response. 

Of all their negative reviews there are so many saying that this woman is rude/unprofessional/shady and that they sell overpriced/lemon vehicles. So the only thing different about my comment is what she rudely said about my marriage which is a truth.

853,"I was offered a position at a company making more than I currently work for, however they called today to tell me they’ve placed all their employees on a paid leave for a period of up to 3 weeks using their cash reserves to finance the the time off and if it goes beyond that his department is instructed not to return to the office and instead work from home. As a result they won’t be able for me to start on Monday or up to 2 months from now. They further advised employees not to travel since they may call them back within a 24 hour notice they offered to pay for my current housing cost during that period (up to 2 months) but they cannot pay me the salary since I haven’t actually “worked” but all my details of the offer are with HR and payroll and it is secure since they are in need of my skills. They stated the it was a precaution since two employees have been in contact with someone who has the Coronavirus. 

Background 

I work in a “at Will” state, I told my manager two weeks ago I was offered the position and the last day I expect to be at work so I was telling her as my official notice, I submitted the letter to her for completeness on Monday that my last day will be today. I called my now former manager and told her what was happening and she said she hasn’t submitted the letter to HR as yet and offered to let me continue to work and to write a new letter to submit to her when I’m leaving since it’s an at will state I have the right to leave at any time for any reason and I can continue to work on my tasks I left unfinished. 

Advice needed 

What should I do? It’s a sticky situation for me morally since I wouldn’t feel right taking my new employer’s money for housing while still working for my old employer, while at the same time the anxiety of being back at work with my manager thinking I will leave at any time and she wouldn’t have the time to prepare, which would obviously mean she can’t assign me anymore tasks since our tasks take months to complete.

I however have the funds to stay at home for the two months since they will be paying my housing. Which frees up a substantial amount of money.

No crime has taken place, no prison sentence received.  What happened though is terrible and my involvement is intrinsic. A tragedy in the truest of senses. For years since I've had work colleagues inevitably google me, and this is then a topic of conversation. I lost a job I loved because of it, not because I have committed a crime, but how it has been portrayed. I started a new job, and once again I was googled and everyone was talking about it. I didn't lose that job, but I resigned because my position was pretty much untenable. 

I do have the option to change my name. I can get a new passport, driving licence etc. With this, when people search for me they won't see what has happened. However, a part of me thinks do I deserve to change my name? Should I face this judgement as a penance for my involvement and do the best I can or with self preservation change my name and do what I can do escape this part of my life? 

I have to admit, it's a horrible feeling knowing that if somebody googles me my heart sinks into my stomach as I know what they will see. It's truly terrible, but a part of me thinks should I just accept this as part of my life, or should I change my name and start fresh?

TL:DR A past tragedy I am a part of has been in the press, my name is connected to this and causes loss of employment and friendships. Should I change my name to escape this or accept that this judgement is part and parcel of what I was involved in?",13Mar2020,1

864,"For the last five years, I’ve had this amazing best friend (We can call her Z). We feel like sisters. Z, used to be in a split class in our elementary school, so she became friends with one of the older kids.

They graduated, and then we did.

Once we got into high school, she was distant for a bit, but came back, and then left.

We were both in this big friend group, who eventually came to dislike her because she made them uncomfortable.

To give context, her and another friend (A) were in an unofficial relationship. Z had done some things that made A uncomfortable and their relationship fell apart.

I found this out from A, who at the time wasn’t as close to me as Z.

Z never told me anything about this, which I get is something that maybe she doesn’t want to share. That’s perfectly fine.

It was just the fact that she’s made it clear to me that she really trusts me that made me a little iffy about the whole thing. I just think I was being too entitled to the best friend thing. I know I’m not her only close friend, and I get that. 

Since then, Z stopped hanging out with us and started hanging out with her friends from an older grade.

Because we didn’t have any classes together, and barely passed each other in the hall, Z and I spoke less.

It then came to my attention that Z might be losing interest in being my friend, or maybe she already has.

At some point I was thinking about how our relationship is.

1. I’m always the one who asks to go out (which I get, maybe she doesn’t want to annoy me by asking so much)

2. Every time I want to go to a concert with her, she says she can’t come (I’ll elaborate later)

3. I’m usually the one who says hi first if we meet in the halls.

4. Overtime, she seems to care less when I tell her about my problems. She used to try to solve them, but now she just puts “:(“

Going back to the concert thing, I’ve invited her to a concert three times. Each time, she can’t accept the offer.

She first couldn’t come because she wanted to go to a different concert and didn’t want to spend so much money on both concerts (my concert was about $280
Then she couldn’t come because her mom said she was using too much money (the ticket price was $53 CAD each)
And for context in the third time, we both bought tickets for the same concert (different days), both were for about the same price. (About $120 per ticket)
She didn’t want to come to the day I had, because apparently my seats weren’t as good 🤷🏻‍♀️ it was off to the left a bit, but closer. Her’s was more to the middle, but at the very back. 

One thing that I noticed, was that she’d invite me to concerts, but she won’t come to mine. We enjoy the same artists too...

She invited me to this one concert, which was about $75 CAD per ticket. This was just before the second time she said she couldn’t come. I was going to go, but all of a sudden her brother wanted to go, which I understood because they don’t see each other very often.

She went this Tuesday and it wasn’t with her brother. It kinda peeked my attention because I remember she told me she was going with her brother. But, it wasn’t really my business.

The third time, was around January. These tickets went for just under twice the amount she paid for her last concert. I asked to go to the $53 maybe about a few weeks before this one.

I thought this was odd because she says she can’t come to a $53 concert, but can go to a $120 concert.

I feel like I’m just thinking too much about the concert thing. I still want to be her friend but I have the feeling she doesn’t want to be mine.

my abusive ex is living with me currently and will be leaving at the end of the month. when she moved out of her mother’s house (who she claimed was abusive) she stole from her. since she keeps claiming i’m ruining her life, i had a sort of hunch she might be stealing from me. i checked her packed suitcase in my paranoia, and i found my only dice set, two of my wigs, and one of my old jackets, as well as a dvd i had since i was a kid.

the catch is... i have adhd and cannot remember if i said she could have them. i know she’ll say i did, for a fact. but if i did say that, which i don’t think i did, i said that under the impression that she was going to be with me for the rest of my life and use them alongside me, not get kicked out for making me cry every single day and take my shit with her.

i am terrified of her coming home and seeing i took them back out of her suitcase. if i did say she could have them, i know all i have to do is say i don’t remember it and say i was under the impression the use was going to be shared and that i changed my mind. but she’ll say i said that no matter what. even if i didn’t.

871,"About a month ago, I left a popular food chain because the stress of school and work got to me. I decided to just focus on school as I believe that getting a degree is more important at the moment. I left right after Super Bowl Sunday and I felt a huge weight off of my shoulders. I applied to other places but for the time being, I decided to take care of myself. 

As time went on, I started to go to therapy and finally started to focus on myself. In that time span, I realized that working there was one of the best things to happen to me as it helped me with my social skills and just helped me out of my shell. I wasn’t done growing with that company. 

However, with what’s going on in the news and considering how I left on semi bad grounds with some managers (there was miscommunication on my part for which I apologized), I am scared to go and ask for my job back.

872,"Recently I have been having some concerns over the decisions a fairly good friend of mine has been making.
To give some context, over the past year I have developed a better rapport with this friend, we talk and text relatively frequently and I feel like we have gotten to know each other better and hang out, especially over the past few days.
I like this friend a lot (platonically speaking), and I value their friendship highly.
However, he has been making some, in my opinion, irresponsible and potentially damaging decisions, and this has caused me to have some private concerns.
In particular, this friend has been vaping considerably (in class and at home when his parents are not there), consuming alcohol without his parents' permission, etc.
He has said he is trying to get off vaping, but based on the amount of times he does it when not supervised I'd say he has at least a minor dependency and is not as committed as he claims to quitting. Not to mention that when his parents are not at the house, he drinks at least a few shots of whatever hard drink is available. I am unaware of the consistency of this behavior but based on how casually he does it I would not be surprised if it has become a bit of a habit.
(It may be pertinent to mention that his parents are both working full-time, so he has plenty of ""free time."")
There are a few other behaviors that I have concerns about, but as it would be inappropriate for me to address anyway I won't.
I understand that I have no authority to arbitrate what my friend does (he is a legal adult, after all,) though I am more concerned about the reasons behind the behaviors than the actions themselves.
These actions seem indicative of some sort of either subconscious  approval-seeking by peers, or is going through a subconscious rebellious phase. I am not a psychologist, but those seem the most likely reasons why he does that.
My advice question is this: Are my concerns valid, and of they are, should I discuss them with him or his parents? I have no immediate plans to say anything, but I am unsure. It should be noted that I have somewhat more conservative views on recreational substance use, among other casual ""activities,"" so there is an element of bias.

 TL;DR: My friend has been vaping and drinking, should I talk to him or his parents about it?",13Mar2020,1
874,"Hello, everyone. I’d like to present a story/situation that I’m going through. I figured a place to vent would be good therapy, and I definitely need advice. Thank you.

I am a 22-year old male that is in college, sophomore year. I started college late, but am enjoying the ride. I’m currently working at a local supermarket, having been working there for almost two years now. From my experience, I admit that I feel like a veteran. I’ve seen plenty of people come and go, for better or worse. I’m a nice person and love helping our customers and fellow coworkers, but I feel for the longest time, my stick has been short. I am a part-time worker, even though I mostly work full time hours. I have been getting by my first university semester since I’ve transferred, but I feel as if I have not much time to really dig into my studies. I have worked through hurricanes, you name it, seen it all. However, due to the Coronavirus panic, today was quite a busy day. I was doing both my part in keeping water stocked, as well as my coworker’s part since he decided to keep dodging what he needed to do as per usual. I was dead tired, but still wired and trying to get past the horde of people. On my way of moving through the crowds, I politely asked to get past and my other coworker stopped me and warned that I was “not being polite enough, and that my boss was being wary”. I told my coworker to leave me alone and that I did nothing wrong. I then proceeded to fill the milk gallons when a lady stopped me and politely asked for a few gallons, in which I replied that I was going to remove a few boxes to get to them, it would be just a minute. She politely accepted and my other coworker from another department came to me and told me to stop being rude, he’s a manager. I told him my situation and this and that, nothing came of it. However, he stepped back on his phone and watched me fill the milk alone, the lady asked if he could help, which he flipped his lid and replied with “who the f##k do you think you’re talking to?” She immediately couldn’t believe and so couldn’t I, she asked for my other manager or boss. Eventually after a fiasco of ridiculous events, my boss was called and discussion pursued. My boss in the end took up for my coworker shockingly and I couldn’t believe it. I ended up hugging the woman and apologizing for everything, I couldn’t imagine treating a customer that way for no reason. Afterwards, I was called into discussion about my “rude behavior” and witnessed my coworker spin words and lies into the mix to try to throw me under the bus, and I admitted everything and told the truth, not holding back. I was then told by my boss to stop being rude, and just to get back to work. From now on, I’ve decided to just stay by myself and continue the frantic job search.

I’m just asking to whoever, what do you recommend I do about this? I’m afraid of leaving my job without another lined up, but I’m just so tired of the lying and manipulating. I’m an honest soul and give my 110% into everything I do, but I feel like I’m just surrounded by negativity and hatred. This has hurt my feelings and mental health, I feel like I’ve been more depressed by this job than it is even worth. Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you.",13Mar2020,1

883,"I dated a guy in high school for 9 months. I lost my virginity to this guy. We broke up and I was recasted never really got over him. I started dating someone else soon after and used him as a sort of rebound (well that’s what I thought) I ended up marrying the guy. Anyways I left my husband. a couple of months after being single I met up with the guy from high school and slept with him after having dinner. I kept my distance at first but eventually ended up liking him. I  felt like he was just using me for sex. So I kept my feelings at bay. Eventually I decided to invite him out to a friends gathering since he was acting like he liked me, he tells me he’s busy. I go ahead and do this a couple of more times but it’s always the same always on his terms. So I confront him and tell him I like him and would like for things to be serious eventually, he proceeds to tell. E  that he is not interested in a serious relationship as he Had just ended one not too long ago. So at this point I kept my distance. I went about my life, dated,partied, flirted. out of nowhere he came back and attacked acting like he wanted something serious. taking me to dinners, staying over , breakfast , vacation with the family the whole deal. this went on for a couple of months. as I was “dating him” which I always thought it the back of my mind it was never going to be serious but always hoped it would i was still sleeping around. Mainly with one guy. now while on family vacation he kissed another girl while he thought I wasn’t looking and I was furious, I walked away and never spoke to him again. Am I hypocrite for being mad at him for kissing a girl? Even though he told me he didn’t want anything serious and I was sleeping with someone else at the same time?   Or is ”it’s not cheating unless it’s official“ true ?",13Mar2020,1
884,"I've been really conflicted on what to do about this situation and was wondering if I could get some advice? TW for mentions of abuse.

So my friend has this habit of oversharing and idk what to do. She'll go into explicit detail about stuff that happened to her as a child like being threatened with a knife by her mother and hit by a rolling pin. Now, you may be wondering why I'm writing this here. She laughs about it. She announces it to people out of nowhere, even people she barely knows and it makes people uncomfortable. I know it's just her (very unhealthy) way of coping, but she triggers me all the time without realising it. Every time she mentions it and laughs about it, and other stuff that happened to her as a kid, it gives me flashbacks of stuff that happened to me during my childhood that I have never ever spoken about and won't be doing so here for obvious reasons. I can't help but feel like she may be triggering others too with her comments. I genuinely want to help her, and I want to talk to her about going back to therapy but I think she's lost faith in the system. And sometimes, and I feel bad for saying this but I really think it's true, it's like she's trying to compete with who had a shittier childhood and I know it's probably an insecurity on her part, but it isn't a competition and I feel angry and anxious whenever she does it. I don't know how to confront her about it because I don't want to tell her that she's been triggering me all this time, bc she'll feel really bad and probably try to get me to tell her about it and I really don't want her to know. Does anyone have any ideas on how to approach this?",13Mar2020,1
885,"My ex and I decided to mutually break up yesterday, he was the one who brought it up first but he said he wouldn't leave unless it was mutually done because he didn't want to end in bad terms and he didn't want to hurt me by him being the one to end our relationship so he told me to think about it for the better of us. I'm not the one to beg and I'm an extremely stubborn person but I didn't hesitate to fight for the relationship because I truly loved him with all of my heart. We've been together for 2 years and I've known him since high school so getting back together seemed like fate. We had a good relationship although when we would fight it would be very bad. He had an issue of being very harsh when he's upset but I knew that everything he was saying was purely out of anger because thats exactly how I am.

During one fight I said something extremely rude and it broke his heart. I gave him space because I knew at that moment he wouldn't believe my explanation so after I told him that what I said was purely out of anger and it was me just trying to fight back. He said I took it too far and I agreed because this issue is something I need to take care of. He told me we need to break up for the better of us because we were becoming toxic, I just don't get it because I've been through hell and back with him and I've done everything with him and he was truly happy with me and wanted to marry me. I planned an entire future with him and now I'm in so much pain because the future I planned doesn't exist anymore. I don't want to meet anyone new and I really don't want to move on (as in dating again). I know time will heal because I've gone through a bad breakup before but God I am in so much pain and I literally do not know how to cope with this feeling its eating me alive. I thought I was finally with my person - he IS my person. I was so happy that I finally had the relationship I always wanted and I could stop looking, he was the one for me. He said he wants to be good friends and keep in touch.

I have a procedure getting done and I asked him if he could take me - he said he would but he wouldn't come inside. Is this fine? I know he needs his space and time and I appreciate that he's even thinking of taking me I just want to know if I'm overreacting. I really want him back and I will continue to work on myself to be a better me for me and for him as well. He is my whole heart and it feels like I've grown limb while being with him and now that limb doesn't want to be a part of me and I don't know how to function without it. I am not trying to be over dramatic I am simply just heartbroken and I needed someone to listen. He said there was no saving us as of right now but he hopes one day in the future we could be together again, I really want to believe that and I don't want to think its bullshit.

He is still in love with me and he said he'll love me forever and that I'm no monster, but that he needs to prioritize his mental health as of now. I was his peace and I made the pain go away and I helped him so much and he helped me. I miss him so much and I know its only been a day but its so fucking hard to know you're both in love but can't be together. We had sex the night before we broke up so all I can remember is us making love and its truly killing me. I don't know if I need someone to tell me what to do or to simply just listen but any advice is greatly appreciated.",13Mar2020,1
886,"So a couple days ago my boyfriend broke up with me. And his group of friends, they’re like a clique. And to stay in that clique, he had to date his ex, which was his best friends sister. That’s the one he chose. I said that was ok because I didn’t want to make him forget his friends over me. I didn’t want to be that type of person because I have never been the type of person to make someone choose between me and someone else.

Then they broke up with me saying that they saw me as only a friend. So my question is, did I walk myself into that? I really did like him and I’m not sure what to think. Thank you.",13Mar2020,1
