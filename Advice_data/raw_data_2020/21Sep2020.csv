0,"TLDR: love triangle.  the rejected girl then became suicidal

tw: suicidal ideation, no attempt.

&amp;#x200B;

So my friend had a crush on a guy who is her neighbor.  But he was 20ish years older than her and only 14 years older than me.  Before he asked me out I asked if it was okay with her if I saw him.  She said ""Yes its okay, and I may be hurt some."" When he asked  me out, I said yes and later asked her again if it was okay with her and to please be direct.    I want to reiterate that I genuinely liked the guy.   She freaked out and was crying nonstop.  She said I betrayed her and chose him over her.

Mind you, she lived by him for a whole year and never pursued him.  Even prior to this situation I even tried to set them up and give them free time to talk when trying to set them up.  Since she gave me the go ahead, although it was guilt trip filled- I said yes to that date. She also had several panic attacks after we spoke about him asking me out.  So I was like okay ""its fine I can call off the date, you can go for him if you want to."" But she didn't even want to date him.  So its like one of those if she can't have him no one can situations.  

Throughout the week; she had more intense crying/anxiety reactions(I have anxiety too but was collected, although I understand symptoms can be uncontrollable at times).  I apologized for having caused any pain, and then she gave a half baked apology and was like ""I meant no.""  And I was like when you give someone an option, then the choice is in their hands.

And then she had another panic attack and expressed being suicidal.  We go to the same college and I hold a leadership position in a mental health advocacy student group.  At this point she blocked me too right after saying she was suicidal.  So I was stuck between her maybe attempting and it possibly being my responsibility if I said nothing vs. doing my obligation to tell health services.  So I contacted the school and said that she was suicidal.  Her roommate said the girl would resent me, but at that point I was already in a position of having to do something.  I also reiterated \*no ambulance please\*.  But clearly her emotionally stability is not in a good place.

In the past when I said nothing about someone's ideation; two people have died, and another attempted and is pretty badly brain damaged now.  So I don't take suicidal ideation and threats lightly anymore.  I feel bad for being a part of this situation and part of how it transpired and hope I did the right thing.  At the same time; what would you have done?  I sincerely liked him.  Oh and now that he knows everything, minus her suicidal thoughts that is- he is no longer interested.  Who can blame him.  Also; I have no interest in communicating with her ever again and vice versa.",21Sep2020,1
1,"So I‚Äôm having a really difficult time with this girl that I really like, and I kinda have no idea what to do. I‚Äôve never really had a girlfriend. That‚Äôs not to say I haven‚Äôt hung out with girls or had ‚Äúfirst dates‚Äù but I haven‚Äôt really found anyone I‚Äôve had enough chemistry with to want to continue into a relationship. Up until a couple months ago I met a really great girl from a neighboring town. We both ran in a local track club together so we ended up seeing each other a lot. About 2 months ago our club ended and we both wanted to keep in contact so we continued to text until she told me how much she liked me and wanted a relationship!

¬†

I was totally happy with that.  she was the first girl I genuinely liked for her personality and I just felt like she was worth pursuing. So that weekend we went out and I literally had the time of my life. We stayed out for about 5hrs just talking and I even had my first kissü•≥. She was so happy for the next couple days and we were in that beginning of a relationship high where everything is perfect... Now here‚Äôs where it gets a little shaky. So we had planned on going out next weekend as she invited me over to meet her parents. Well when the day comes she pulls the ‚Äúyour gonna hate me‚Äù and canceled. So I was like that‚Äôs ok not a big deal but then after that she starts acting a little off.

¬†

I try to talk to her ab it but nothing changes until finally I tell her that I‚Äôm worried ab her and that she is making me feel like this relationship isn‚Äôt going to work. She preceded to send me a paragraph ab how I‚Äôm ‚Äúeverything she wants in a bf‚Äù and ‚Äúshe isn‚Äôt gonna let me down‚Äù. Another week of not awk but just off texting goes by and things are really just stagnate. The excitement I used to get from receiving a message or thinking ab my first kiss has passed and she is genuinely doing nothing but stressing me out. So about 3 weeks ago I tell her I need a break.

¬†

She‚Äôs says that sounds good, she is having personal issues she needs to figure out, and so I think I‚Äôm in the clear. The next day she hits me with the ‚Äúimyü•∫‚Äù... ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èso I respond and we started talking again. This stuff continues on until ab a week ago I tell her to either explain what‚Äôs happening and be transparent with me or I‚Äôm not gonna do this. She sends me a message about how much she really missed me irl and how sorry she was and then ghosts me... so I do the only thing ik and delete everything ab her from my life and start another self confidence/improvement month where I‚Äôm half way between depressed and feeling ready to win a novel peace prize or something.

¬†

So Feeling a bit lonely I decided to get Snapchat for the first time in my life and within 20 min of me downloading it you‚Äôll never guess who adds meü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. So Idk if this is her way of saying she wants to talk or if I should just not risk it and continue to move on. I really don‚Äôt know what to do. It was only one date so I can move past it but I don‚Äôt talk to many girls so this is kinda my one and done for the year. If this doesn‚Äôt work out I have no intention of Pursuing a relationship so this is kinda my last chance for a while and I want to do the right thing.

¬†

So should I snap her and try to repair things or pretend like she never added me?? If you read all that haha wow thanks ü§†and please give me some adviceüôè",21Sep2020,1
2,"A little backstory.

I (25M) have always been the type of person who is generally liked but people don't go out of there way to talk to or ask me how I am day to day. Typical guy in the 21st century type of deal.

I have 5 or 6 good friends that I can talk with but it's usually nothing intellectually stimulating,  
they're friendly people but don't really make an effort to have conversions with much weight.

To compensate, I've found in the last few years that I put a lot of energy into relationships.

To clarify: I love being in a relationship, I enjoy having someone to talk to and do activities with but conversely I get sucked up into comfort and find myself relying on that person for social happiness.

A lot of my friends are in relationships and that only makes the problem worse, especially now when people are in their own sort of bubble due to COVID, it's difficult to meet new friends etc.

Does anyone have any ideas or things that have helped put themselves first and develop stronger relationships (of all kinds) with those around them?

I want to be the type of guy who doesn't let others control his emotions or happiness and start to develop a strong community of people who all enjoy actually being friends with one another.

Thoughts or similar stories welcome.",21Sep2020,1
3,"Hello, so I've (15F) been constantly having small fights with my friend (15M). We've had one really big fight because he did not respect my interests in March and things never became the same after that.My friends told me that he should initiate the makeup after that big fight because he was the first one to be aggressive. So I waited for a week. Nothing happened so I ended up starting it after having to pursue him to makeup (he blames me for the whole fight) and we became ""okay"". Then we have another fight because he was being homophobic (but he saw later it was wrong). We stopped being friends after that but later became friends again because we had mutual friends.

However, we started bickering again. This was mainly because he never lets things go in general, like if I were to joke about having a bf, he would go to great lengths to try to prove me wrong even though he knew that I was joking. He didn't speak to me for a week because he got upset over it. I talked to him about it, he said that he was a terrible person and started talking about how he was worthless, useless, etc. He always did this whenever we fought. I also talked to him about it. 

I always initiated the makeup after any fight. I would always have to pursue him to join in a call. And it's getting frustrating.

Now, it's started again where he just doesn't let things go. And it's taking a mental toll on our mutual friend and I don't want to hurt them more. What do I do?",21Sep2020,1
4,"As a member of the LGBT, as well as of an ethnic group, a professional group and a socioeconomic that Trump has insulted, and says should be attacked, and the things that he supports and has put into action I am not a supporter. 

However, close friends of mine are and I don‚Äôt want to be the kind of person who can only be friends with people that have my views, but how can they not see that Trump is a fascist that:

-Hates black people, Hispanic people, women, the real media, the LGBT, people with special needs, people in the military
-Locks immigrant children in cages
-Lies to the country‚Äôs face
-Co-signs and supports racism and sexism
-Has removed us from so many world organizations like UNESCO and the UN Human Rights Council
-There are so many people dead because he hasn‚Äôt handled this virus correctly at all

I can‚Äôt keep my peace with my friends voting for him. I don‚Äôt want to talk to them about it because they‚Äôll disagree and dig in their heels and spout nonsense and it hurts so bad because I‚Äôm so non confrontational anyway. I never ever talk about politics to anyone but it‚Äôs really weighing on me heavy that the people I love and trust the most are voting against our own interests and against morals in general. Please help me with what should I do: educate them, reconcile that we just have differing views, or not talk to them anymore/distance myself from them since apparently morals and human rights aren‚Äôt important enough to them.",21Sep2020,1

6,"A little back story, I completed my 2 years of college majoring in marketing. I then went to university right after college and I couldn‚Äôt even get through a semester.. I was so overwhelmed and figured where I just finished college, a break wouldn‚Äôt be too bad. I dropped out of uni and thought within a year I would probably go back to uni. I didn‚Äôt have a job for a couple months, until I found a job that pays higher then minimum wage at a call centre. I enjoy it there and not even 6 months of working there got promoted as a coach so a bit of a higher wage while I coach, then a year and a bit I‚Äôm working towards being what they call an assistant team lead, which I am doing currently 2 days of the week right now, just not permanent. 

It‚Äôs now been a total of a year and 6 months I have been there, I was not expecting to stay at my work for this long as my plan was always to go back to university but I seem to be stuck in this stand still, I currently live alone and have rent, insurance, phone bill, gas, groceries bills and student loans I have to pay for and like that I have some income that I‚Äôm not used to particularly having. 

At the same time my boyfriend is currently in his last year at uni and all I hear with him and his family is school this, success that and I‚Äôm so happy for my boyfriend as he‚Äôs going to continue to get his masters. It‚Äôs just that everytime I hear talk about these high standards and having a high paying job and success and an education I feel like such a loser and that I should be in school right now I just know it‚Äôs easier said then done. 

If I went back to school I know I would have to seriously focus and put all my time and effort into it, perhaps move back in with my mom as I would not be able to afford a place of my own I currently have and just truly struggle like I know I would and I don‚Äôt even know what I want to do right regarding what I would want to major in or study in school. 

I just turned 22 and my relative has been talking about perhaps helping me get into the government which would be a good job so again I‚Äôm very overwhelmed at this point of what I should do. I want to be successful and be happy with the money I make and feel good about my life and the choices I made, is school and an education the meaning of success?

Sometimes I feel I‚Äôm truly wasting my time and not working towards anything... do I continue to work, see where that takes me and hopefully get into the government and see where that goes or make steps to go to university as I‚Äôm far from an academic and not exactly what I want to do... any advice would be greatly appreciated as I have no one to talk about this with. Thank you.",21Sep2020,1
7,"Hypothetically, if you were to have been caught outside masturbating late last night by a neighbor, if they contacted the sheriff would you know by now or would they wait until the weekend is over to follow up? 

P.S. this was the sign I needed but wish didn't happen to realize my needs were a problem. No idea if I was even caught or not or if I'm just being paranoid. I never thought it was an issue until this happened and I'm absolutely terrified I just fucked my life up.

9,"Sorry, this may end up being long but here it goes. In 2017, I got into a relationship I was not ready for. My friend circle pressured us to be together though I was not ready. I am terrible at saying no, and though he is a nice guy so why not give him a chance. The first year was a honeymoon but since 2019 things have been difficult. My best friend, who is a guy, has been friends with me since 2015. He had a girlfriend when I met him and was with her until this year. We became close friends very quickly, and I always thought we would be just friends. Fast forward to the end of 2019. My relationship with my boyfriend is not going well, and my best friend is suddenly talking to me way more than normal and always being around me and following me wherever I am. He finally tells me he wants to leave his girlfriend. I was surprised as I thought he would marry her. As you can tell, I and him were not in good places in our relationship. 

&amp;#x200B;

From then on, I and my best friend grew incredibly close to the point where we would start and end our day always talking to each other. We opened up to each other about things very deeply. Once corona hit, we did not see each other for 6 months. But we grew incredibly close at that time. When we finally met, by then he had broken up with his girlfriend. We had a good time. I had told him how much I valued his friendship and he told me the same. I did not sense anything wrong between us.  A few days ago, we were chatting as usual nothing out of the usual. He then tells me he randomly decided to get bumble and even matched with someone. He started bragging about this girl, how nice it is, and when I would try to ask about her, he wouldn't speak. I found this odd, as he told me everything about any girl he had an interest with or was with. I felt he was bragging. He then suddenly cut me off the conversation. The next day he responded but I felt so upset with him I ignored him and didn't reach out to him for a while. But he is not responding. It has been a few days and I am feeling depressed and I felt I have lost a good friend. I respect that he has every right to go and meet new people, but I feel sad as I guess I am going to be replaced. The sadness has caused deep anxiety for me and I am unable to focus. Do you guys have advice on how I can handle this situation, and what he might be thinking? I just don't see why he would throw me away.",21Sep2020,1
10,"hi, idk how to start this so i‚Äôm just going to get right into it. basically, i‚Äôm sitting an a-level exam this october to get into uni. i finished school 3 years ago so i‚Äôm taking online classes for this subject. however, things have been ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù around me and i haven‚Äôt been able to keep up with my work and i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôm ready for the exam this october. i could postpone the exam to next may, and apply with predicted results but i feel like that‚Äôs just delaying the inevitable. so anyway, i‚Äôve been having classes since last october but i‚Äôve procrastinated right from the start, and i have the tendency to cancel classes at the last minute, mostly because i couldn‚Äôt complete my homework and didn‚Äôt want to face my tutor. i‚Äôve tried a lot to make sure i stay on top of my work but i always end up procrastinating.

i did, however, tell myself, in july, that i wouldn‚Äôt cancel class unless it was really important and i stuck to that mostly. until a week ago, when i cancelled class because i was having a bad day and then just did not reply to my tutor after that. my tutor messaged me twice but idk what to tell them. so instead, i‚Äôve been ignoring my own reality. 

i‚Äôve got a lot of issues on my mind, but right now, i just want to know how to fix this because i know this is really disrespectful to my tutor. 

i don‚Äôt want to lie but i don‚Äôt know how to tell them the truth, which is that i haven‚Äôt studied or completed my homework. 

i feel like this problem is way bigger in my head than it actually is irl. 

but i also don‚Äôt want to apologise for something that i know will happen again because i don‚Äôt know how to stop it. it‚Äôs not that i don‚Äôt want to study - i love studying and i love this subject. i just can‚Äôt. 

idk how to explain it but i can‚Äôt do anything. and maybe i should just ‚Äúdeal‚Äù with it and do it anyway and i wish i could, but i really really don‚Äôt know how when i don‚Äôt even have the energy to get up some days. 

i know i sound like a lazy, ungrateful person but i‚Äôm really REALLY lost and if i knew what to do to change myself, i would in a heartbeat. 

so yeah. i‚Äôm sorry i went off on a tangent, but basically, what do i tell my tutor?

12,"I graduated in May and my grace period was 60 days after graduation.

13,"Hi guys. Bit of context I'm 23yo male and been working for this very small company as a web developer for almost a year. We've been pretty close friends with the owner before I started working here so he surely helped me alot through my life regarding encouraging me to push through university, sometimes financelly and we often have honest talks. In other words he sees me like his little bro and I really appreciate that, respect goes both ways.

As this shitty virus became the cockblock for every project and opportunity we have had planned, there wasn't much work these months, so he started to give me projects for his other company(which is not related at all with anything digital). I created an app which eases the work process for the employees there so after it's done, here comes the unexpected token on line 49.

He called me two weeks ago announcing that he will need my help regarding food delivery for his other company. I said that he can count on me by default but as I hang up I started to feel like a wreck. I've been coding for 4 years, planning and investing in this career and all that time gone for becomming a delivery boy?

I mean I honestly don't have the balls to confront him because I feel like I owe him alot more and I like to help with anything he asks for but...
... The sideffects of the shock and my inabillity to talk this out with him affected my mental health. I became hopeless and started drinking heavily everyday. My friends quickly noticed a heavy shift in my behaviour and advised that I need to be alone for some time.

I'm lost and I can't get my mind straight to how should I view and resolve this situation peacefully.
Have you ever been in this kind of situation? Do any of you also tend to go deep in self destruction because you feel powerless over your own career? How do you derive business and friendship without someone getting hurt?

14,"I (28F) recently spent a long weekend with a group of girlfriends at an Airbnb in upstate New York celebrating a bachelorette party. The house we rented was a beautiful property with lovely amenities and the host was really awesome at first. The first two nights we all hung out together, drank a little bit and genuinely had a good time. The last night (saturday) we returned home and set up disco lights and a bunch of fun decorations for kareoke. We played some music from a small portable speaker and were of course singing along when we got a complaint from the host about the noise and lights. We thought it was a little odd since it wasn‚Äôt even 9pm yet but we shut it down. But then the host mentioned that her property manager had stopped by to close the cover of the hot tub (which we were planning to do). She however had not given us any warning and we were all a bit unsettled by this as the house has tons of gigantic windows with no curtains and since it‚Äôs a bachelorette we were being silly and flashing our boobs and ass to each other. So you can see how this started to make us very uncomfortable. We started getting very strange texts that made it clear that the host could see exactly what we were doing at the moment it happened. For example our friend was outside on the balcony and she got spooked because she thought she saw someone in the woods and screamed. We got a text moments later about the loud screaming. 

This of course made us unsettled and as a group we all kind of had this feeling that we were being watched so we started to investigate. At first we were just joking about being bugged. But then I was taking a look at the fire detectors in each room (there was one in almost every single room of a 7 bedroom house including additional ones in common areas). There were two different models of fire detectors throughout the house and both exactly matched models of spy cam smoke detectors that i found on the internet. I did download Fing and check for any devices but unfortunately the two WiFi networks I was able to access only listed our own phones as far as I could tell. However there was an additional locked network that we did not have access too. I do not believe that the house next door was close enough for us to pick up their WiFi.

Does anyone have any advice? All the girls are feeling very unsettled as the fire detectors were in our bedrooms and we got changed in there and are feeling like our privacy has been violated. We were unable to take the fire alarms apart before we left but I did take a lot of pictures and videos including some with the lights off. I didn‚Äôt see anything that looked clearly like a camera but I‚Äôm not an expert either.  Do we confront the host? We will feel a bit stupid if it turns out we were wrong. Including links to some of the pictures I took and screenshots of the spy cam models I found. Sorry the pictures aren‚Äôt the best.

In addition, we went back and looked at the original listing and a lot of the pictures of the rooms are taken from weird angles and high ceilings (obviously not a person) so wondering if it they might have been taken from the fire detector cameras if our hunch is right. Those pictures are wide eye fish lens so it‚Äôs also possible she took them with a GoPro or something similar.

Let us know what you think. Are we being ridiculous and paranoid or is there some merit to this? TIA!

TLDR: We think our Airbnb host has hidden cameras inside fire detectors and was filming us during our stay.

I also do not watch the videos cause they are boring. There's a test today and I'm worrying about failing."".... What do she mean she's worried about failing? Of course she would fail with that attitude. And yet, I do not know how to help her, if she is not willing to help herself. So...I thought to make my disappointment known by telling her I'll offer the notes for this weeks lecture, as she did not do any, and told her that she needs to make notes in the future. I was implying that I will do this this time, but I wont in the future. And you know what? She declined. Saying that ""I would not ask that of you."" I responded, but did not respond back.

I'm not annoyed that she has other people to hang out with but we used to talk every single day and hang out once or twice a week so it's weird that she has just stopped that all of a sudden.

After some time talking we opened more to me. Until this day he doesn't talk a lot but it's fun. I started to have a crush on him 1 year ago I think he is pretty cute.

My mother is also very religious, as such, she believes that what I feel is wholly caused by ""demons"", who wish to ""destroy the family"". She has also belittled me by using my mental problems. She attempts to make me feel like whatever I say is false, with the pretense that I'm ""completely insane"". And thus, incapable of thinking rationally. 

I've tried opening up to them about all of these issues, however, it always devolves into chaos. My father has told me every insult in the book; ""faggot"", ""autist"", and ""fat bitch"" are his favorites. My mother also insults me, in a similar manner. As a result, I suffer from frequent panic attacks. Yes, both my parents react with anger whenever they witness them. At first, they try to ignore me. If I continue, my father will personally come to attack me with the above mentioned insults. He has also threatened to forcefully take me out of my house on many occasions. All while my mother sits back and does nothing to stop him. She is incredibly frigid, and never attempts to help me. I'm at my wits end, and willing to listen to any advice you have for me.",21Sep2020,1
23,"this is probably a stupid question, but, okay then ...

since covid started, i switched to another college. they held full online classes. of course, it was easy for me to make friends since i‚Äôm kind of a social butterfly. i like making new friends. but then, this one classmate of mine happened. i must admit, he doesn‚Äôt look that attractive nor is he tall (compared to women‚Äôs general type). in fact, he looks average but dear, his personality is everything. he has great sense of humor, is kind and sweet, and stuff like that. he also treats me differently (not to assume that he likes me or anything, i wish), unlike when he‚Äôs talking to his friends. i started to like him but i said to myself that i shouldn‚Äôt be feeling this way over someone i only met over the internet. is it okay to like him? and how do i confess?",21Sep2020,1
24,"went to a furniture store with my mom and 10y/o sister. It was a big store and contained furniture for sale, it was an outlet and I think it is run by the man and woman who were there. 

My sister sat on a couch, woman told her not to, so she got up. Later, we went to take a look at the furniture upstairs. Again, my sisters went to sit on a couch. She did not jump or do anything crazy, she just sat there. This old dude came to to us yelling. He was furious and yelling at us and my sister. My sister is extremely shy and I can tell she is going to be socially anxious, as I was like this too (Still am). I try to get her to gain confidence and support her cause i dont want her to end up like me. This guy ruined it for both of us. My entire self esteem was already crushed but now im even more scared of people. I got so mad on the way back, I kept thinking of what I could have said, but in that moment I was very scared he was going to hit us. I know its not normal to be hit in a store by the worker in a western country, but I swear he was about to do it.

This happened in the morning, its midnight and i cant stop thinking about it. 

I even called the store when i arrived back home, he picked up. I asked for the name of the worker but he literally said 'we make our own rules, we can do whatever we want whenever we want''. I said its unacceptable to yell at a kid and there are other ways to give a warning. He cut off and hung up before I was even done.  Then I sent an email and Im not sure they will reply, even tho im so scared when i open my emails. i am terrified of their reply, but they cant harm me through mail?

How do i deal with this? How do i stop worrying about things like this? I know this will not matter in a year even less, but i cant let go of it. I am terrified of people, always have been, The little confidence i gained is now crushed and I am afraid so is my sister's. I cant leave a facebook review as i dont have facebook but i know even if i did, it wouldnt change a thing. what can i do to feel better/ forget about this? i dont want other people going around yelling at my sister, scaring her. i know this is one of those things she will remember and harm her self esteem, as i too have many things from my childhood that  are partly the reason for the way i am now.",21Sep2020,1
25,"Hi,

I know the title sounds funny, I guess it kind of is.

I am really desperate for any kind of advice, I really don't know what to do. I'm sorry for this being long winded but if you could read it, It'd make me happy.

For a visual context, I'm a 20 yo guy, with black hair, big black eyes, barely tanned skin and you're stereotypical college guy body type. 

I'd never admit this with my face connected to this, but I really haven't had an amazing life so far. In highschool, I got bullied and shunned for the entirety of it, so I kind of always have a bad image of myself and because I'm a devout extrovert, it left me with a constant feeling of loneliness. 

At one point in highschool, two of the jocks pinned me into the corner and grabbed onto my fat and squeezed to hear me scream. Needless to say, their laughter haunts me to this day, and I gained an eating disorder, which is why I have the slim body I do.

My experience with girls had not been too much better. The looks I used to get from the girls from my school were just cruel, I had talked to a few of them after the fact and they told me they didn't want to take a step down hierarchically and potentially get a share of the abuse I got on a daily basis. 

The way I copped with my pain was by writing love songs. I did this everytime I felt sad I'd write one, and needless to say I have alot üòÇ
I had been having a reoccurring dream of this brown haired shy girl with freckles my whole life, so id often take my life experiences, think of her and boom I have a song.

All that said, when I was 17 I had my first girlfriend and I cannot describe how happy I was. But that's when I realized that the group of ""friends"" I had at the time didn't want to be happy for me. At that point, they started to drink more, and with it came their true character. To put it short, they were incels, to the point where one broke his hand punching a wall in a blind rage because the girl he liked was with someone. 

It's worthwhile to say that they pressured me to drink too, and eventually drugs got involved. I only smoked weed once with them, and I am sure it was laced with something because I cannot describe the agony that ensued. My vision was rotating, going in and out and I felt like I was going to die if I closed my eyes. I immediately got up and started walking out, they didn't care (as a matter of fact they blamed me the next day for this). So all of a sudden there is a drugged up scared teen walking through the city in horrible agony trying to make it home. Luckily I did, and to this day I can't even have a sip of alcohol without having a panic attack, a trait that was not popular among this group nor the people I met in college afterwards. What kind of guy can't even drink alcohol? üòÖ

They went on to poke holes in my relationship with her, constantly insinuating she was cheating on me with someone in the group. I became so miserable, I cut ties from all of them, I met up with my gf to tell her the story but... And I know it was stupid... I didn't want to make her sad knowing that I was severely depressed... so I decided to break it off with her.
 
The last I heard from those guys was them saying ""someone would have to be dumb, ugly and stupid to even look at you"" and ""you deserve everything you got"".

The last I heard from her... She ended up dating the exact guy they said she was cheating on me with. 

You'd probably expect me to hate her, but I hated them. Love for me means that I want to see that person happy, even if that means I get the short end of the stick or even have to leave their life.

Flash forward 3 whole years, I had dated a few girls, but I never felt love again and honestly thought I was broken, that I would never feel that way again.

At this point, feeling free from people bullying me nonstop about making YouTube videos, I had made alot. Of course thematically relevant, I still never got anything from that but I still love it nontheless. 

As I was going through and opening all the available accounts for my channel, I happen upon Reddit. I decided to browse a little bit, when suddenly I saw r/needafriend on the front page. I clicked the subreddit and happened upon a post that essentially went ""I really want friends, I lost mine recently""... And I actually dmed, who ended up being a, her.

We became good friends very quickly and I was really honestly surprised. I immediately found out she wasnt single, I didn't have a problem with it at all, it just meant we could be friends.

Getting to know this girl, I found out she had one boyfriend before the current one, a guy she had ""went on a break with"", to which he had sex with another girl very soon after... You see when she said a break, she meant she wanted like a week to herself. He didn't understand that. She also had really low self-esteem and was kind of submissive, which was a polar opposite to my confident and extroverted personality (noone knows my life story except for my best friend). 

Its at this point that I realized my fatal flaw, I like to helping people with their confidence issues, it is my favorite thing in the world, and tbh I just wanted her to see herself as I was starting to see her.

Then I popped the question, do you wanna do a Minecraft Let's Play together? I know I'm too slick üòé
This was notable because I have always been extremely protective of my YouTube channel, I didn't want a good relationship turned sour to destroy one of the last things I had left... But I thought she was such amazing comedic foil for me, I couldn't resist. She agreed extremely enthusiastically.

I was so proud of the finished product, I bought a Minecraft realms for us, had my sister make us an amazing thumbnail as us as cartoon characters, it was so great :))

As one of the jokes from the video, I joked that I'd need a vid of her dabbing on cam to be sure I wasn't being playing with an old man. She immediately did it, and it this sounds crazy... But she was the girl from my dream. My heart skipped a beat. I know it sounds so cringy, but her dabbing while we messed around on Mc was the moment I kinda fell in love with her...

I was so excited for summer to start, we said we'd be making so much fun content, I was really starting to get happy. Then summer came... And silence. Its not that I didn't try, I really was so worried, I knew she was going through something, I just so desperately wanted her to let me help her. Then summer went...

I didn't waste this time, I wanted to be perfect for her, I wanted to be the guy that every girl dreams about. I got a job at a grocery store, hard labor, like that I could get abs for her while also getting paid üòã I used the money I earned to invest in medical companies, to which it paid off pretty handsomely (I wanted to be rich enough to make music videos of the love songs I wrote for her as well as be well-off cuz that's always cool). I took a nice course load in my uni (I'm in medical sciences) because I was fueled by my passion for the success of the future. I even learned to play guitar because my sister said girls like it.

... Then right before school starts she comes back, like she hadn't ghosted me for 4 months. She tells me that she has a new boyfriend (meaning she had been single) that was long distance (meaning that I maybe had a chance since we're in different countries). I was supportive, of course, and just was happy to have her message me again.

I then thought to myself ""well if she can do it, maybe I can too"" and instantly proceeded to get catfished... badly...

At this point I was really starting to spiral and everything I had lived started coming back... and then I asked her why she ghosted me (because tbh that was the real thing that hurt the most out of all of this).

She said she had been depressed and that she pushed away everyone as a result. I told her that Id be happy to have things go back the way they were and that I forgive her... She didn't answer...

The next day, I send her this message:

""I understand.

 I know I'm an idiot for even thinking this, but I keep running the question in my mind that if you would have let me confess my feelings for you when you were single, if you would have let me love you. Or maybe you knew that I did, and that's why you never even told me.

But since now you know that I was just a stupid idiot who wanted to love you. Love for me means that I am willing to put my own feelings aside to make sure you're happy. Even if that includes never hearing from you again.

You are happy with him, you happily came back to tell me that, so I refuse to get in the way. 

There will always be that part of me that hopes you will someday answer me and at least let me continue being friends with you... So if for any reason you feel like messaging me, it would make me the happiest idiot in the world.

I love you [her name],
Your friend forever,
[My name].""

... It's been three weeks of silence and I still can't get over it. A reoccurring theme in my life is I get knocked down harder and harder again and again but I always get up and smile at the pain. But not now...

I know she doesn't owe me a response, I know I was never guaranteed her love but I can't help but hate how cruel my life keeps going, it's like this was a tortuous representation of the love I don't receive. I love her, so I'm okay with her choice to never answer me.

I just want to love someone, I want to make someone smile and laugh and feel amazing. I'd give anything and everything for that. 

I stand here tortured, I can't sleep because my dreams show me her. I don't want to die, so please give me some advice, anything, even a simple recognition that its okay cry about this is enough.

I'm sorry if this upset you,
It's not as memeworthy as the title foretells...
... But thanks for reading it üòÖ",21Sep2020,1

33,"Heya! So, I'm a teacher and Children's Day is coming up, so us teachers are expected to give gifts to our students. One of my students loves rabbits and I have a pretty big rabbit plush that is super cute and has the floppy ears that my student loves. However, it was originally a gift to me years ago from my grandfather who passed away four years ago.

When I first got it, it sat on my bed every day and every night until I got new stuffed toys and started putting the old ones away. Currently, my bed is occupied by my four newest plush toys and all my old ones are in my closet/boxes. The rabbit has been in my cupboard for years and hasn't really been taken out until now. 

If I don't give it away, it'll probably go back into the closet for years and years. It kind of feels right to me that something that meant a lot to me before should now go to someone I care very much about. My mom is reluctant and says that I should keep it because my grandfather is no longer around and didn't really give a lot of things to me that I could keep (he mostly bought me and my brother food and not material things).

Looking at it in my hands now, I realise I'm going to miss it if it goes to my student, but I know she'll love it. I already talked to her mom and asked if she was okay if her daughter received a rabbit plush toy and she told me she would be so excited and would love it.

I could buy a new one, but I also feel like it wouldn't have the same value as giving away the one my grandfather gave me. I also don't make a lot and they're expensive, but if I do buy a new one I could get the pink version, since my student says she loves pink rabbits.

I'm not really sure what I should do? Any advice?",21Sep2020,1

35,"I am trying to figure out if my job itself is just bad or if I have chosen the wrong career by picking Student Affairs.

I work in a Resident Director type position. Going on my second year. I run the full residential life department for a small college, with a lower job title than being called the director of that department for some odd reason... I make around 30k. No partners allowed to live with me in my university provided apartment. (And now no partners allowed to visit because of covid guest policy). No pets allowed/pet policy. 

We are very understaffed. I am on call every other week, while also being a grad student. Being on call is for emergency response for the students, and is 24/7 on top of my regular 9 to 5. I am the only staff member fully in residence life. My coworker in the on call rotation doesnt work in res life during her 9 to 5, and works in a different area of the college.

Rather than tell me I'm doing well, my boss recently told me he feels too involved in res life and that he needs to ""get out of the trenches"" of my department. Essentially that I need to do more/take more responsibility in my department. This was disheartening to hear, because I already felt like I was doing all I could and that I was spread very very thin between this job and my grad school work. I thought my boss just had to be involved because we truly are that under staffed. But I guess it's all up to me.

I am doing the best I can. But this job has really taken such a bad toll on my mental health. I had a minor anxiety disorder that has taken a more severe turn in the past few years working here. I've been applying to new jobs for a year, and though all this responsibility has given me some amazing skills, I have yet to get an offer. Some days I feel ok about my job, but there are some days lately where I feel so stuck and unvalued here that I consider quitting, even without something lined up.

I want to say: I am normally such a positive person. And I know that Student Addairs or working at a college isnt a field where you can make a ton of money or always have a perfect work life balance. But I feel like this job has been extreme. I have no work life balance, and when I start to have work life balance, I'm made to feel like I'm not doing enough :/ am I just not cut out for this field?",21Sep2020,1
36,"Throwaway because this very friend found my reddit. Also, if you read this all the way through, I genuinely will appreciate that so much.

My (18M) friend Mark (17M) is amazing. He's super funny and kind and I love being around him. We've been good friends for about 3 years now. However, one thing about him that I and another one of my friends Sasha (17F) (we are a best friend trio) have noticed is that he hates affection. 

Like, he's never hugged us or told us he loves us. Even if we're resting our arm or hand on him he jerks it away. He hates being touched. He has never been with anyone or been in a relationship (which I absolutely do not judge him for, just mentioning it as I think its relevant). He's super unaffectionate. Yet he makes us laugh, and we love spending time with him.

The problem is that a few days ago, Mark texts me asking if I knew any good subreddits for ranting. I suggested to him r/ offmychest as it is quite well known. 

Then I opened reddit to see if there were any better subreddits I could recommend, and I see I have a new message. (Context, me Mark and Sasha have all explicitly talked about how we will never show each other our Reddits because reddit is essentially a diary). The message simply said ""guess who lol"". I knew it was him. I texted him sort of flustered but also laughing that he found my account. 

He explained that since I had mentioned that I had posted on r/ AITA to him a few weeks prior he looked up the keywords of the post and found my account. He sleuthed his way into finding it. I was surprised he put that much effort but he ended the conversation with ""don't look at my posts and I won't look at yours"", and that was it.

However, since I knew he was going to rant on r/ offmychest I began frequenting the subreddit, half hoping I'd stumble onto his. (I regret this immensely as it was a huge invasion of privacy and I swore on my mother's life I'd never do something like that again).

In it he described not having any emotional attachment to any of his friends and not feeling anything for them. He described hating himself and not understanding why he can't be affectionate or say I love you or why he can't cry. I stopped reading after the first paragraph because I knew it was wrong but... now I am stumped.

I want to help him. It sounds like he rejects any intimacy or affection because it disgusts him, but the thing is, he does care about us. He is thoughtful, you can see it in his actions and words, the gifts he gives us on our birthdays or the way he defends us when we aren't there. He does feel care and feel affection, just when he realises that he's being loving he recoils and shuts down.

I can't obviously tell anyone. No one can know that he posted that OR that I read a bit of it. The thing is, part of me thinks he wanted me to see it. He texts me about something reddit related so I check my reddit and see his account. Then he takes the subreddit I recommend to him and posts about it right after? I feel like it's his way of crying for help. But I can't bring it up with him because if I'm wrong he'll cut me out of his life forever. I am also the only person who knows his reddit now (and vice versa).

Reddit, I have no idea how to help him. I can't speak to anyone, not even Sasha. I could never betray his trust more than I already have. What do I do? He's crying for help on the internet, and now so am I.",21Sep2020,1

41,"I work far away from home. Every worker has to take the plane to get there. I stay 20 days at work and then come back home for around 8 days. Last year, at work, I made a friend. We would travel together every day and talk about everything and became really close. He told me he never had a friend like me in all his life. I eventually learned that he was a really big drug dealer. Had been for 20-30 years. 
He also made a girlfriend around his age at work. 

Last march he lost his job mostly due to covid but his girlfriend kept her job and he became extremely anxious at the idea that his girlfriend (being so far away, at work) was having sex with other men during her time there. He was already using cocaine but started using a lot more. Even smoking it. His relationship with his girlfriend kept getting worse. We talked every day on the phone. He admitted that he was using insane amounts of cocaine, barely sleeping and thinking about suicide. I tried to help him cope with the idea that his couple might be breaking for real (I also believed his gf was cheating on him) and tried to convince him that stopping using cocaine and sleeping more and going into therapy could really help him become happy again. And I really believe I succeeded a little, he even told me so. He stopped using for a couple of days and sleeping more.. 

Then his girlfriend, tired of the way he was behaving, broke up with him. And then he found pictures and text messages that confirmed she had been cheating. Then he started using again. Then he sent me a really weird text message in the middle of the night, he seemed drunk. He was basically thanking me for trying so hard to help him and that my friends are lucky to be my friends.

I really like my job but there is no moving up in the  position I am in, and the pay is not great. I am 2 semesters in to a 2.5 year program (this includes summer semesters).  I have not enjoyed these two semesters of course work. I am uninterested in the material, and have no motivation. I started this program so that I would have better job opportunities. I know that I can move up with experience in the health care  industry (administrative side) it just will take a lot longer without an advanced degree.  Between the two I feel like I have no free time to do anything.  I have thought about quitting the program, but that leaves me with sub-optimal future job options, and I financially can not quit my job.  Any advice? 

TL;DR: Full time grad student working full time job. No interest in course work, but need advanced degree to advance in industry unless I want to advance over  a long period of time . Any advice?",21Sep2020,1
43,"Adults raised by crappy dads: how did you eventually build a good relationship with your father after he failed  you as a kid? I grew up with a dad who paid the bills, maintained the house and yard, but was emotionally unavailable and a bully. He showed no interest in our interests, opinions or ideas. He was physically abusive when I was very small and verbally abusive from ages 10-18. 14 years after starting my own life I‚Äôm still unpacking everything- low self-worth and difficulty trusting myself and others and struggling with the idea that I could try to have a different relationship with him now. I‚Äôve met a couple people with similar dad stories who now can shoot the shit with their old man... and I am baffled! My father apologized a decade ago for ‚Äúbeing hard on you guys‚Äù and now seems to want a friendship with his kids. Did you have a dad who just wasn‚Äôt good at being a parent that one day you were able to know and love?",21Sep2020,1

46,"Earlier today I went to a popular theme park with my husband and was dismayed by a lack of social distancing being enforced and staff not wearing their masks correctly.

I wound up taking a photo of one particular employee and posting it in a review on google maps where everybody will see it. In the photo he has a name tag on and everything. 

Now I‚Äôm feeling a bit guilty because I don‚Äôt want him to lose his job, but I also feel like he was putting everybody at risk considering he comes in contact with so many people.

Should I remove the review?",21Sep2020,1
47,"I have been working at my current employer for a year and a half now. I got hired on as a lone IT manager. My direct supervisor is the COO and I don't manage anyone other than myself. The company has multiple locations and a few sister companies that pay to have me service their IT needs.

&amp;#x200B;

When I got hired on, I sat down with the COO and reviewed the contract details with him before signing. I would receive $xx,xxx, but $x,xxx would be paid out quarterly. The quarterly bonus in total equals 7% of my salary. They titled this bonus as a ""quarterly performance bonus"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Since I started mid February, they decided to not start giving me a bonus until the end of June. I received that bonus as expected and also received my 2nd bonus at the end of September.

&amp;#x200B;

\--------------------- Here is where things started to change -----------------------

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of December, I asked payroll when they would be printing my bonus. I didn't receive a response. I asked a couple weeks later and payroll said that she asked the COO about it and haven't heard back. I pressed the issue at the beginning of February and copied the COO in the email. I didn't hear anything back aside from payroll telling me in person that her hands are tied and that its in the COO's hands now. 

&amp;#x200B;

All of the sudden, a bunch of weird stuff starts happening. I begin getting calls from EVERYWHERE. Its as if an announcement was made to report any IT issues you have to me immediately, no matter how small. This resulted in A LOT of calls that ended with either the user apologizing for wasting my time or the issue getting fixed immediately. This weird incident happened over the course of two days. Everything got quiet for a little while until I get a frustrated/immediate text from the COO saying ""did you miss a meeting with Susan? I need to see you in my office ASAP. When are you available?"" I told him I would be right there and went to his location. I sat down and he asked me about the meeting I had with Susan. I had genuinely forgot I had one because she had only mentioned it to me casually and it was not IT related. She just wanted to see if I could maybe help her out. I apologized to both Susan and the COO and rescheduled the appointment. 

&amp;#x200B;

After I explained the situation to him and told him that I rescheduled with her, he then tells me that a ton of people have been having issues with me not helping them. I was honestly taken by surprise. I asked him to elaborate and he said that I was sweeping IT issues under the rug and not helping people out between October and November. I asked him if he could give me an example or let me know who it was so that I could help them out, he refused to tell me. I asked him if he could describe the issue or anything else that I was neglecting and he wouldn't tell me that either. I then asked if they opened a ticket in our ticketing system and he said they hadn't since it was fairly new and most people don't know how to. I reassured him that I would make sure that everyone is taken care of and that I had no idea some people were feeling neglected, but reiterated that I would ensure the ticketing system was fully functional and that I would check up on everyone from time to time just in case someone was too busy to open a ticket. He seemed satisfied by this and that was that.

&amp;#x200B;

It was implied in the meeting that due to my alleged lack of performance, that I would not be getting a bonus check for October-December. Fair enough, I should have put out more information on the ticketing system and I am biased when it comes to my performance. I accepted the loss, despite the lack of evidence, and moved forward. A few weeks later, March rolls around. At the end of March, I dont receive a bonus check. I would have asked but due to COVID, I was worried about the company since we are a medical clinic. Business had slowed down tremendously between April and June. So what about my June Bonus? I was still doing my job every day and taking care of computers, computer upgrades, printers, servers, etc. No bonus.

&amp;#x200B;

Now here we are. 10 days before the next ""bonus"". I have been busting my ass this year and have finished major projects months ahead of schedule. The COO knows about these projects and I have really shown my worth. Business has picked back up for the clinics and I am as busy as ever. I am afraid to ask about my bonus though. Why am I afraid? Because of what happened last time I asked. It seemed like they were either trying to catch me slipping up and fire me or catch me slipping up and just not pay me my bonus. I just finished upgrading all of their computers at every site they have. This was a major job that saved them tens of thousands of dollars because of a method of upgrading that I went with. I am worried that if I ask for my bonus, they will fire me and just find someone new while handling internal IT issues on their own. I dont want to lose my job, but I feel like they are taking advantage of me. I dont know whats going on and I get anxiety just thinking about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Can someone please help me with some advice?",21Sep2020,1
48,"So, basically my mother just puts in her own card in a scam that says she will get hundreds of thousands of cash. What do I do? My mom does not know what to do as well.",21Sep2020,1
49,"Unlike everyone else in the family, my dad is extremely wasteful. For example, we have a water purifier, as well as that thing on our fridge that dispenses water. However, my dad always insists on drinking milk. Every time he walks into the kitchen, he takes out the milk jug from the fridge, drinks straight from it, and then he lets out a huge, nasty fart. He does it all the time, and he isn't even ashamed about it. He even does it when guests come over, and it's so embarrassing. Once we had another family come over and my dad did that, and those kids laughed their head off. I was so embarrassed, and I didn't even know what to do.

Also, he uses a ton of toilet paper. He uses the bathroom around 100 times a day, and he goes through roughly 80 rolls a toilet paper each day. My mom is so angry at him when he does that, and she yells at him and lectures him. However, he says that it's unfair of her to blame him for his body functions, and then he just walks away. When he goes in the bathroom, he makes a lot of gross fart noises, and he also sings really loud in the bathroom. He uses way too much toilet paper, and he doesn't even bother to flush the toilet after he uses it. The toilet is always full of his waste products, and someone will have to plumb the toilet and spray air freshener inside. It always smells terrible after he uses it.

He makes a mess everywhere he goes, and he doesn't even clean it up. For example, when he eats snacks, he leaves crumbs everywhere, and he leaves stains on the couch. Sometimes when he drinks milk, he drinks too aggressively and spills some of it on the floor or on his clothes. He leaves his dirty underwear in the shower, and he also leaves his dirty clothes on the bathroom floor. It's so gross when he does that.

When my dad eats, he pours like a whole bottle of dressing on his vegetables, and he puts way too much cheese on his food. When my mom cooks a soup, he usually takes the pot and drinks straight from it, while spilling the soup on his clothes and on the floor.",21Sep2020,1
50,"Okay, so this sounds harsh, but I honestly love my boyfriend a lot. We have been through a lot together. He struggles with a drinking problem and he just came to terms with it. He has been sober for a couple of months and doing well. My issue with him is I don't fully trust him. He has lied to me many times in the past and it stresses me out. He also does a lot of little things that drive me nuts such as swearing ALL THE TIME, not being understanding of other people's problems (not sensitive), and he doesn't seem to listen to me. I know he loves me, I do so much for him and care for him. I just don't know if this relationship is worth it anymore. I just need any sort of advice! Thank you.",21Sep2020,1

52,"Happened like a week ago where I suddenly started to question my sexuality. Friend came out gay and yea, I was so shocked but didn't pay much mind untill I started to have these intrusive unwanted homosexual thoughts out of the blue. And little by little it starts to take up more of my day. Prior to having these random sudden thoughts, I was 100% heterosexual, never had a gay thought in my life. I could see good looking guys and pay no mind, it wouldn't even phase me, it even made me jealous that I wasn't that good looking. Now after these thoughts, if I see a good looking guy, my heart sinks because if I notice a slight sensation I start to go down a rabbit hole, like oh when I saw that guy my heart felt weird oh my god I must be gay deep deep down and I am just in denial. Like it is so weird. I will forget about it for a bit and not have a single homosexual thought, then when I remember I am questioning my sexuality, all I can think about are these intrusive thoughts. I don't think people just switch sexualities that suddenly, like either they know deep down they are gay but never want to face it or they know they are gay and accept it, but for me, the moment I had that seed of doubt planted in my head is when I started to question my sexuality, I didn't question it because I caught my self fantasizing about the same gender but because of this random irrational thought of doubt I had which then led me to be more aware of guys and my reaction when I see them I guess if that makes sense, and that whenever I do react I really notice my reaction and then again my thoughts spiral out of control. I don't think I am gay, nor do I want to be gay. It is as if my mind wants to fight itself and make me feel like sh%$. Do you guys think I am gay? I posted before on this topic and led me to the conclusion that I might have HOCD, I do think I have mild OCD and I definitely have anxiety. Can someone help me out here? It really leaves me feeling lost and confused, like I think a straight man would never have these thoughts so I must be gay. I think I might've been homophobic, like I disliked those people who acted overly gay if that makes sense so I don't know if the fear and the doubt fuels it even more or what. I am just so confused. I don't want to be gay nor do I think I am but why do I doubt it???",21Sep2020,1

Im 20f Ive been with my bf for 2 years now. Since we've met hes been rather self conscious about his hairloss. I didnt know he had this when we first started dating he would wear a beanie or a hat everwhere we went. I never thought much of it until one day we were at his house for the first time and he would wear his beanie around the house. We would be intimate and he would keep it on. I didnt ask why.
Fast forward a couple months of dating
I ended up staying over a week at his place and he was playing video games in his room, I went to the bathroom I guess he got comfortable and took off his beanie. But when I came back he scrambles over to the bed and puts the beanie on. I was confused, he then looked at me and said ""Whatever if you like me you wouldn't care"" and took it off again. I didn't say anything since I didn't care. I like him and hes the first genuine partner Ive had. He didnt try hard to impress me or pretend to be something or change anything about him. 
But now we've been together for 2 years. He's self conscious about letting me touch his hair. Which for 1 I LOVE bc its long and honestly alive compared to mine.(ive dyed mine so many times)
Ive tried making comments to boost to confidence about it about how attractive he is and how Hot I think he is (because hes total eye candy) but it doesn't change.

60,"I liked my job, and I liked my coworkers. I work in a fairly small warehouse that employed three people to handle shipping, receiving, and general operations respectively. I was in charge of shipping and managing a few drivers. At the start of Covid (April) the receiver and I were laid off. 

I was called back to work in mid August, and later found out it was because the other warehouse employee (who had been covering all three positions due to budget cuts) had put in her two weeks notice. While the overall volume of product moving through the warehouse had decreased, my workload had easily doubled. Before leaving, my coworker warned me that things were bad and expectations were unrealistic.

It has been a month and a half and I have been running myself ragged. I have managed to stay on top of the vital things, and even fixed some of the messes that I inherited, however there are still times that things pile up due to sheer volume. I have been trying to negotiate a raise, and hoped my efforts would be noticed. Instead my borderline absentee general manager saw fit to blame me and question my work ethic due to the backlog of nonessential tasks. 

At this point my morale is all but gone, I feel like I don't owe this company anything, and I'd love to leave my manager scrambling to replace me; however jobs aren't exactly easy to come by in the age of COVID.

63,"i just turned 21 and i have severe PTSD, like my therapist told me honestly that he couldn't treat me. lifetime of abuse, neglect, violence, bullying, ostracization, etc. won't get into everything but i watched my mom slowly die a drug addict and watched her overdose and die at 16, was severely physically and psychologically abused at home (3 broken phones, 2 attempted murders, 100+ head strikes absorbed etc.), bullied at school to the point of having my first $uicidal thoughts at 11, spent 4.5 years in a physically, psychologically, and mildly $exually abusive relationship, falsely accused of r*pe, psychological damage from abusive principal who would suspend me for literally no reason (even when my mom passed away - she couldn't attend our graduation bc she called some kid the n word) 

i could go on and on and on. i really hate to say this type of shit but I've had a Joker upbringing and although i've never hurt anyone, i'm the perfect recipe for a person that would Columbine. i've just been fumbled, stepped on, picked over and traumatized by everyone my entire fucking life. it's horrifying and i HATE revisiting these thoughts but they're always there. i'm depressed and have severe anxiety and choose not to socialize bc i'm just so disconnected from reality and don't know what it's like to be a normal person

anyway, i snapped this summer. COVID exacerbated my mental illness but a traumatic event just pushed me over the edge. i was $exually assaulted by a drunk female in early June when i was 20. i spoke up and everyone took her side and i was harrassed and told things like ""you weren't assaulted, drop your victim mentality, you're starting drama for no reason"", this entire social circle excommunicated me &amp; they gossip so fucking much that even my ex who doesn't talk to the ringleader of this B.S knows about. had to delete FB bc i was getting messaged by strangers, one in particular said ""I don't care about your traumatic titty experience"".

i cracked. the above is enough to drive anyone crazy, but this event just killed me. i was done with life. i made plans to end things &amp; began a path of self-destruction. constant drinking - blacked out for the first time that night out of stress, and blacked out 8 times in between then and sometime last night. did and said a lot of stupid regrettable shit. pushed my best friend away because i was in such a bad state. started seriously hating people and ""got back"" at society by being a dickhead, for example i messaged a co-worker's boyfriend and told her that she had been cheating on him with a server (which is true). i ended up attempting for the second time in my life.

basically i've stopped these ridiculous behaviors (which included driving drunk) after my attempt because it mortified me and changed my outlook on life. i realize i am an extremely damaged human being, probably more damaged than 99% of people. i will always have these problems and mental scars and i need to learn to navigate them. you can only take so much... i couldn't take it anymore, i just don't know what i did to deserve it and i couldn't cope and just went crazy.

i am ashamed of my actions and i want to live a different life and be happy and ""normal"" and i don't know how but i want to forget this chapter of my life and MOVE ON. i have so much guilt and remorse and i wish none of this ever happened and i don't want to think about any of it ever again. i feel like shit every day, i was given one life and i fucked it all up because i am weak and it doesn't leave my mind. i don't know what to do i just want it all to go away and to move on and forget about all the days i spent laying in bed motionless and all the blackouts and days spent in tears.

i just want to know how to forget and move on and not let this define me because right now it feels like my life is over. i have no one and i feel even worse than when i attempted. i don't know what to do",21Sep2020,1
65,"Alright guys, long time lurker- every now and then commenter, but now advice seeker.

I work in a grocery store that to the public, is well regarded. But once you get in there it‚Äôs way different. I transferred from my starting store, which was extremely toxic and a bad environment all together, and am at a store that‚Äôs so much better, and that I can move up in.

The issues I face now are the fact that I don‚Äôt know if I want to stay in a grocery store and move up in management. A VP came into the store and said it took him 43 years to move to where he is, and that‚Äôs considered fast. He was a store manager by age 23 (unheard of), and has kept moving. Granted, he‚Äôs the VP of our region, but still. And it got me thinking, do I want to spend 40+ years at this store? Something I know is once your full time (no, you are not hired at FT, you gotta earn it which is sometimes impossible depending on your management), you basically don‚Äôt get to have a life outside of work. The hours and days off are never set either. If you work at this chain you probably have figured out which chain I‚Äôm at. (Bleed Green üíö my peeps)

But I do want to move ahead in the world. School and I didn‚Äôt get along very well, so college is unlikely, but trade is much more my route. I‚Äôm hands on, so it would be better. But a issue I face is that I don‚Äôt know what trade to go to. My dad was a plumber for 40+ years, but he‚Äôs crippled from it. Electrical stuff scares me and I definitely just can‚Äôt handle outside work.

I heard a thud, but I just recently got my license and haven‚Äôt had too much experience driving because of my age and I thought someone just threw something at my car maybe (I sound really stupid right now, I know). I drove down a couple blocks and realized someone was trying to get me to pull over, and that‚Äôs when I realized I definitely screwed up and got into an accident. I pulled over, rushed to say sorry and I had no idea what to do and was basically asking him what happens from here. He mentioned something about insurance but the thing is my car is my brother‚Äôs. He spent some time searching it up and I waited and asked him questions since I seriously didn‚Äôt know what happens next or how I could repair my mistake. English wasn‚Äôt his first language, so I ended up helping him search up how much the part costed and I ran to an ATM and gave him cash for the mirror and repair fees.
I‚Äôm just really panicked right now and disappointed in myself for messing up like that, but I really need someone to tell me if this still means insurance will be involved if I ended up paying out of pocket (since I saw a woman in the driver‚Äôs seat take a picture of my plate) and anything else about how I handled the situation because I‚Äôm actually really panicked and freaked out but I really want to know how to handle this in the future if god forbid I get into another accident and what this means for my car and my insurance. help :(",21Sep2020,1

I grew up on a farm, oldest of several kids. When we were young, half of us got really sick. Prolonged hospital stays for a few of us, etc. The doctors said it was due to contaminated wellwater, but we all lived, and thought that was the end of it.

When I was in my late teens, I started to get sore. Really sore. Can't stand, can't sit, etc. All the symptoms of arthritis, but I was 18. I am diagnosed with ""reactive arthritis"", which progressed through the years to a diagnosis of Ankylosing Spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis.

68,"
I have had sex with This girl for 2 month ish, i know her very Well and known her for 6 years ish. She broke up with her bf like 4+ months ago, they were together for 2 years. The reason was that she came out as bi and wanted to experience a bit...

So, she might like me, i‚Äôm not sure. She‚Äôve done tons of things that would indicate that fwb is not enough for her, and she might be into me more romantically. 

- A year ago while she had a bf, i‚Äôm quite sure she went for a kiss but i truly thought it was nothing as i knew she had a bf

- She have tried make me eat with her parents once 

- She didn‚Äôt want sex immidiatly (which i have seen girls do often when they want something serious) 

- Get jealous when she see snaps with other girls

- Got mad when i first told her we should just stay friends... and she constantly tell me that i‚Äôm still the second guy (after bf) she have been with and she won‚Äôt have sex with someone else.

- When i talk to other girls, she sometimes go over to me and show them i‚Äôm kinda taken, like hug and kiss snd does not let go.

- The thing that really made me question her intentions (happened last sunday): Last time i Saw her, she kissed me goodbye. I hugged her and Said bye, but then i went through the door she took my arm, pulled me against her and kissed me really passionately.

We enjoy each others company a lot, share same hobby and stuff.

I (don‚Äôt Think) haven‚Äôt been interested in her more than a friend, but suddenly after having sex with her etc., i just think she‚Äôve changed for the worse. She‚Äôs so weird around me now and is always way to sweet to me. I used to think she was so much fun and pretty badass, but not anymore.

72,"So I'm a twenty year old man and I work for a senior non medical caregiving company. We essentially go to our clients homes and help these debilitated elders with their daily living activities. 

I cannot divulge much, as there is a level of confidentiality with my clients, but I told my client I'd post this and they agreed, so I'll simply keep this discreet. 

One of my clients has an issue they've been complaining about. They have this thing where whenever they speak something in what I assume is their sinuses causes them to hear an echo overlay of their voice and it is only fixed when they inhale sharply, or sniffle. 

This client is very old and disabled, nearing death, and wears a DNR bracelet indicating they are ready for it to some extent. This issue bothers them quite a bit and I want to make their last months of life as comfortable and uninhibited as I can. They already suffer so much and take high blows to their self esteem with the level of care they require. 

If anyone can identify what this issue may be and how to resolve it if possible, I'd greatly appreciate it. Thank you for your time :)",21Sep2020,1

76,"I had my first child on May 22, 2020. She's the most precious and adorable thing in my life. She's perfect, and as cliche as this may be... She is my reason to do well. I suffer from depression, sometimes to the point where I can not get out of bed for what feels like weeks. Since she was born I realized I NEED to be better.

My daughter was born substance exposed. Her mother (whom I will call M) and I were not in touch too often during her pregnancy. We dated for about two months before she realized she was pregnant. During the time before she got pregnant, I decided to quit my job, went to detox for a benzodiazepine I was prescribed way too much of by a Dr that recently lost his license to practice. I am not blaming the Dr for my dependency on that substance, I should've been smarter and never got involved. Suffice it to say, the post-acute withdrawals amplified my depression exponentially and I was not too emotionally available during that time. Shortly after that M and I separated.

A few months after that, the COVID-19 pandemic began. M and I decided that it would be best for her to lay low during this pandemic and continue to stay at her parents, where she'd been staying. We did not see much of each other in an attempt to reinforce our self-imposed quarantine. Looking back, I now know she had been avoiding me as much as possible because she was using fentanyl. From what I've gathered she had been using quite a bit, at least 5 pills up to 10 pills a day, since nearly the beginning of her pregnancy. When we met she was ""sober"" and going to NA meetings etcetera. It turns out she had been using at my home when I was at work.

Fast forward to May 21, 2020. We went in for an ultrasound. It was the first time I had seen M in a couple of months. We had been on better terms lately and things were looking up. What was supposed to be a routine ultrasound turned into the technician alerting a Dr, and the Dr alerting us that M was going to be induced and the baby was going to be coming now. During the next few hours of induced labor is when M told me about her drug use. She knew things were going to come to light so she wanted to come clean.

Fortunately, my daughter was born healthy. We proceeded to stay in the NICU for 14 days to ween her off of opioids with a morphine taper. It was exhausting. She hardly ever stopped crying except to eat or sleep. But I made absolutely sure that there would not be one second my daughter was left alone in the NICU. M was busy recouping from giving birth and her withdrawals, and I believe she was dealing with a lot of grief over the baby being substance exposed. There were many long nights, but she was never left alone. Not once.

M and I decided we would try to live together so I rented us a condo a few weeks before our daughter was born and got things ready. Before she was released to go home with us, M and I both had to meet with a Department of Child Servies (DCS) representatives and answer any questions they had. Eventually, my daughter was released once her taper was complete on the condition that M was drug tested twice a week by the state and stayed on a treatment program. All of that went without a hitch for a week or two, then M missed a test. Missing a test in their eyes is a failed test. She even lied and got a fake Dr's note, trying to claim she contracted COVID (she did not). That did not work. Another couple of weeks later she had minor dental surgery in which they prescribed opioids to take home. Instead of saying no or searching for alternatives like I hoped she would considering she has years of history of opioid abuse, she took them. For the next few days, she proceeded to nod off around the house, and I even found some of her prescription Xanax laying on the ground as well as a couple of plastic cards with powder on them, used for crushing pills. A couple of weeks after that she had a test pop up positive for fentanyl. One week later, a second positive for fentanyl.

Our DCS case manager called and told me about the second test on a Thursday at about 3 pm. DCS then proceeded to show up to our home at 5 pm and because I was still in the home with M and our daughter, they got a warrant and took the baby. I am at fault for this too. I failed to enact a plan to keep her safe as soon as I heard M had failed yet another test. I failed my daughter... She was placed in foster care. Fortunately, she was released to my father after 25 hours until the following Monday. On that Monday we had a meeting including M, myself, a few family members for support, and the DCS representatives involved. Ultimately they decided to release my daughter into my custody, with very limited visitation for M. M is required to keep up her testing and was strongly encouraged to find treatment. I was also required to drug test twice a week and I was prescribed 120 days of intensive Family Preservation. Meaning they come to my home 3 times a week for 1 to 1.5 hours to check on the baby and conduct therapy sessions with me. My Family Preservation program was almost immediately dropped to a much more lenient 1 in-home visit and 1 virtual visit a week because they saw no immediate threats, fortunately. They also said it will most likely conclude by 60 days instead of 120.

A week after that, M decided to check herself into rehab. Personally, I think that was a great thing for her to do as long as she took it seriously for herself and her children. M has 3 children in total, one with myself, a 2-year-old daughter, and a 7-year-old son. She has lost custody of all of her children at this point. She lost the other 2 about 1.5 years ago from abusing fentanyl. Originally she was going to stay in rehab for 90 days. Now she is coming home in a few days, after only 30. She is claiming she will continue her treatment via an IOP (intensive outpatient program), and I truly hope she does. Her leaving early still has me nervous though because she has an issue with discipline and seeing things through to the end. 

At the end of the day, I am veryyy torn about being in a relationship with her. I know that's what she wants. I am just so worried because one misstep and they WILL take my daughter away. I watched them do it. That said, I really do love M. She's a wonderful woman, and she really is a great mother. Addiction is an absolute demon. It destroys many things daily in nearly all of our lives. Our relationship has always been rocky, she's very confrontational and I am extremely passive. I think if we could find a way to make it work it would be a great relationship. And I love all of her children. I would be honored to help raise them. I love M as well, but I am finding it really tough to get over her abusing fentanyl while pregnant, and it's very hard not to blame her for having our daughter pulled from our home and put in foster care.

I know this is an entirely vague post, and if you've read this far, I appreciate you more than you know. Sincerely. I have no one but family right now in my life, so thank you for letting me vent to you. Since my daughter was born I have not gone out much at all. I'm too scared to go anywhere because of the pandemic, it's just not worth it. I had to move out of my home and back into my parent's apartment so I could get some help with the baby since it's just me and her. She's a very hard baby, being born substance exposed. She is extremely colicky and needs someone around 24/7. I don't have a job, and really the only thing good I've recently found, aside from my daughter, is finally getting myself to workout again. With M coming home soon, DCS constantly being in my life (which is extremely nerve-racking even though I know I'm not doing anything wrong), no income coming in, I'm scared... I'm scared for my daughter. I'm scared I won't be able to provide for her the way she deserves. I'm truly scared for maybe the first time in my life. I'm scared I will fail her again... I know I am much luckier than most having a place to stay with my folks, but my savings is burning up quickly and unemployment in my state is an absolute joke. It's not nearly enough to feed my baby and me.

Thank you to anyone that took the time to read this. I sincerely mean that. I have never posted anything even remotely close to this, but I am open to any and all advice. I just feel lost, scared, and crushingly alone in all of this. If anyone has been in a similar situation or has any advice at all, I am all ears. Please... Thank you again everyone.",21Sep2020,1

79,"TW: kicking.sexiest?Transphobia? Pretty religious Mother.Racism?

For some context,I won‚Äôt be revealing my age due to privacy reasons,but I can tell you that I‚Äôm a minor.My Mom is 31 and had temporary custody of me when I moved to America.And I was four at a time when I moved to America. My parents are divorced and I never really knew my dad.(also sorry for any grammar errors English isn‚Äôt my first language.

First let‚Äôs start when I was really young (since that‚Äôs the shortest). My mom had a family friend who had a child who was incredibly toxic friend, but that‚Äôs for another story. Whenever I told my mom that she was picking on me or calling me fat or ugly, her response was and I quote ‚Äú she‚Äôs not my child so I can‚Äôt do anything.‚Äù. So for most of my life I was just helpless no one was there for me I had hard times making friends I was problematic when I was younger so I have to do everything on my own, defend myself because I know nobody‚Äôs going to help me. And the only reason why I stop seeing her (toxic friend),Because I got in fist fight with her in third grade, and you know what she still act like this.

And another thing that happens is whenever we get into arguments (argument wasn‚Äôt that bad it was usually small things) One time we got into an argument about her not closing the door on our way out, she told me that I was being too sensitive and that is my fault basically. One time she kicked me when we got into an argument. She took my phone away when I started arguing with her.Whenever I showed her a video about parenting she blamed the video and said that it was teaching me to argue with her. Then she put screen time on my phone because she thought it was a ‚Äúbad influence‚Äù since it ‚Äútaught‚Äù me to argue with her.

And I try talking with her but she never listens she‚Äôs always on her phone she never looks at me one time she told me that I acted more like an adult which she use that as an excuse to not feed me any breakfast dinner and lunch because she thought I could take care myself, which is one of the major reasons why I learned to cook,so I didn‚Äôt stave myself waiting for breakfast.

Oh and she told me that she told all of my secrets everything that I told her to her friends and now she‚Äôs wondering why I don‚Äôt talk to her that much,and yes she used the excuse of ‚ÄúI am your mother‚Äù and ‚ÄúI need to protect you‚Äùtype of excuseOne time she told me to shut up after she spilled coffee all over my stuff.

Plus some of her family friends are kind of sexist saying ‚Äúyou have to be close to your family so you can do things for them because you‚Äôre a woman or guys wouldn‚Äôt like you wearing that because that‚Äôs not women like or guys don‚Äôt need to cook cuz women can do that.‚Äù And my mom suspects that I would take care of my brother once I turn 18 it‚Äôs not like I have a life or anything.

And my Mom say kinda Trans phobic things like ‚Äútrans people is a mistake‚Äù or ‚Äú God doesn‚Äôt make mistakes‚Äù or ‚Äútrans people shouldn‚Äôt exist because they‚Äôre made the gender they should be when they were born‚Äùor ‚Äútrans people die early‚Äù and the only evidence she has is by her friends being friends with trans people dying. I‚Äôm glad I have the Internet because now I know that all she says is BS.

She also blames other people whenever she makes a mistake

And she also told me that if I wanted to be in an all white school because white people are better than colored (To mind you she isn‚Äôt even white) or ‚Äúsafer‚Äù. I think we can all agree that not all races are good or bad.

I don‚Äôt know what to do,I tried talking to her but it doesn‚Äôt work,what should I do?

81,"TRIGGER WARNING

Without too much backstory here, I met my girlfriend in May on a Discord server. We were friends at first before we both slowly fell in love with each other. We started dating about a month ago. We said that we want to move in with each other in November/December. We just need to find jobs so that she can come to my state and live in an apartment together. 

She herself has lived a lonely life. In addition, her family yells at her for literally everything. It doesn't even matter if it's not her fault. Her mother misplaced a USB for her computer? ""HEY! WHERE DID YOU PUT MY THUMBDRIVE?"". Her mother also yelled at her the other day for just living in her house. ""YOU LIVE IN MY HOUSE, SHIT IN MY TOILET, AND EAT MY FOOD. I EXPECT YOU TO DO AS YOU'RE TOLD."" Her father is no better. He's extremely lazy and expects her to do everything in the house. If she does even the slightest thing wrong, such as not knowing what specific item he wants for her to get, he yells at her telling her she should just get out of his house already. As for evil younger brother, he's the worst of them. So far, he has groped her butt, whines and complains at literally everything she does for no reason, hit her in the back and told her he doesn't give a shit if he gives her a bruise because she ""pissed him off"" (all she did was hand him food that he said he wanted but changed his mind), has said ""if this was the 1800s, I'd whip you"", has said he ""hopes a German ghost comes to your room and shoves you into a gas chamber"" to her and that she deserves to be in a deathcamp. 

Her family has no idea about both of us as they believe everyone online are Russian spies, but they are aware that she goes on the computer a lot. Before college started, they took away her computer as they believed she was developing ""internet obsessiveness disorder"". They gave it back to her for her online classes two weeks later. That was the hardest two weeks for the both of us. Her brother threatened to destroy her computer today because he thinks it's making her ""into an asshole"". 

I have tried to reach out to my family. They are supportive of us. They want to help bring her to my state so that she can be free and safe with me, but they have no means of doing so. Whether that be money or a place to stay. I and her have tried looking all over for jobs for the past month so that we can get an apartment, but we are still unsuccessful... I feel so fucking powerless to do anything. I have no money right now to even try to bring her to me *now*. I have no idea what to even do. She doesn't want to call the police. Even if she did, where would she go? But that's not the issue... 

Neither of us have the money or jobs to get her out of there right now, let alone for an apartment or a place to even stay. What should I do Reddit...? I feel so broken and powerless to help the one I love...",21Sep2020,1

Now with that out of the way, I should explain. Whenever people cry, I either feel frustrated or think they‚Äôre cute. I don‚Äôt know why. I‚Äôve always had trouble comforting people, which is where the frustration comes in, but then I also wanna go ‚Äúawww‚Äù. 
Once, my friend was crying and I knew it was because she was insecure. I did my best to comfort her and I thought it went over well but my first thought upon seeing her? I wanted to pat her head and hug her because she looked so damn cute in tears.
Then I was watching anime this afternoon and one of the characters was bleeding/crying but he was also drawn really cute... so now I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm becoming a sociopath.
This is unhealthy thinking, right? So how do I stop it? And am I the only one who thinks crying people are cute? I would very much like to save my future self from becoming a sociopath.

93,"Hi I‚Äôm new to Reddit so please bare with me if I‚Äôm doing this all wrong. I would like some advice and have been scared to reach out. So, I‚Äôll start with some information about myself. I‚Äôm a 20 years old female with two elder sisters, one of them 21 and the other 23. My mum is registered blind but is still able to do some things by herself. Ive never had a good relationship with my dad. He cheated on my mum and fathered a child behind her back but she decided to stay with him. 

I suffer with anxiety and depression alongside IBS/endometriosis. It‚Äôs draining but I‚Äôm  learning to deal with it every day. Support system isn‚Äôt that great as since we‚Äôre Asian my parents don‚Äôt understand anxiety/ depression. My siblings are engrossed with their own lives which is good, I‚Äôm happy for them and always pray for their success. We‚Äôre not very close but we do get along well. 

I like putting others first and if I don‚Äôt I feel guilty. The other day I woke up late by accident and found my mum had already cooked. I normally cut all the ingredients for her since her eyesight is not great. I went to the bathroom and cried with guilt.  So yeah... I think that scenario describes me. 

So, in regards to the dilemma, let me begin. My eldest sister and my mum have a very close relationship. My sister is doing training this year and I am studying from home. So, I have being doing  her chores and mine mon-fri. It takes me at least 3 hours every day. ( I have compulsive behaviour so takes me long). I do other chores when I have time when I can. 

The responsibilities of bills and such has always been for my elder sister. She recently told my mum all the household responsibility is given to her and that it‚Äôs not fair. My mum told me this. I do understand that, regarding bills and such but majority of cooking/cleaning is not done by her. How should I approach this? Even if we don‚Äôt have a great relationship, I don‚Äôt want her to feel stressed. 

Recently I haven‚Äôt had a great relationship with any of my family members- my mum, dad and sisters.  My parents fixed an arranged marriage for me from Pakistan. I‚Äôm not happy with it, but they have all convinced me it is. Because of my physical and mental illnesses, my elder sister used to say you won‚Äôt be able to handle household duties in the future, or that men in UK wouldn‚Äôt marry you or marriage wouldn‚Äôt last. If you are deemed ‚Äòdamaged property‚Äô by society, you‚Äôre getting married in Pakistan. All Pakistanis just want a British passport, I know that. It‚Äôs so stupid and an outdated mindset and I‚Äôm glad the uk has stricter rules regarding this anyway, people are taking full advantage of the system. 


So, do you think I should be helping my sister with the whole household responsibility issue. I have to walk on eggshells around her( and my dad- I just don‚Äôt like him). I always feel like I am second best around her even if I do help around a lot. I feel like running away from all of them and always dream of having my own place. I‚Äôm always stuck in my room and my depression is getting worse so long as I‚Äôm in this house. 

Its easy for anyone to make themselves a victim  I can make mistakes too. I need to know if I‚Äôm doing anything wrong. 

Please try to be non- judgemental. My family are very good people.  

I would very much appreciate some advice. 

Thank you for reading this. I know it was a VERY long ramble lol.",21Sep2020,1
94,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. 

I‚Äôve been with my husband for nearly 9 years, and I feel like I would never, ever cheat on him. 

Our relationship happened very fast; within 6 months of meeting him I moved several thousand miles away to his state and in with him. The first friends of his that I met were a couple with two kids, and we spent a good amount of time together; we traded dinner nights at each other‚Äôs homes and spent holidays together. I never even gave him a second thought as I really liked the wife. After 3 years, they separated and while I‚Äôm still friends with the (now ex) wife on social media, we haven‚Äôt spoken in ages. 

The man (let‚Äôs call him Logan) moved on with his life, has dated and even came close to marriage a couple of times but has mostly been (and currently is) single. The weird thing is, he‚Äôs absolutely not my type (I like big teddy bears of men and he is lean and compact. He‚Äôs only about 1-2 inches taller than me, and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù. He also likes hunting and fishing and I‚Äôm not super outdoorsy). I recently lost a lot of weight and have gained a lot of confidence in myself. 

I have no clue exactly when this attraction started; it seemed like one day he popped into my head and I was instantly aroused in a way I haven‚Äôt been in ages. We recently crossed paths during a friend‚Äôs event and I had to fight the thoughts pouring through my brain....I spent 3 hours trying to ignore the torrid things my brain was showing me. He has really pretty crystal clear blue eyes, and anytime he would look at me, my knees went weak. Even wearing face masks, I could see the outline of his lips and it ignited me inside. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I feel guilty about these thoughts; as I said I don‚Äôt think I could ever cheat on the wonderful man I‚Äôm married to, but feeling that fire again is a heady, addictive feeling. I‚Äôm just....lost.",21Sep2020,1
95,"me and my friend weren't on good terms last year, and it was a literal nightmare getting back to a good place with her. We however did manage to do this, given a lot of time. 

She has always had bad trust issues, even during the times me and her have been friends.  I asked her how I could earn her trust, and she told me bluntly that it ""wasn't possible for her to trust anyone""

this time last week, me and my friend were fine, and we were on good terms with eachother.

however, a few days ago she messaged me and asked me if I had sent her a message the previous night, I responded no (because, I hadn't), and she told me that she had received a death threat from someone pretending to be me. 

I obviously attempted to explain the fact that this wasn't me that had sent this, and it was crazy for her to believe that I ever would (given the fact that we're on good terms, things are fine, etc etc) however, she didn't believe this, due to her trust issues, and she said that it was necessary to end the friendship.

Not only have I lost my friend (which has sent me into a deep depression in itself) but now I am dealing with a situation where someone is pretending to be me, has sent a death threats to my now ex-friend outwith my control, and may be able to do so again? 

What am I realistically able to do about this?",21Sep2020,1
96,"So a few month ago my best friend told me out of the blue that he doesn‚Äôt like me anymore and that he‚Äôs trying to change his personality and I didn‚Äôt fit with it.

98,"First time posting here. Honestly, I'm kind of embarrassed to be mentioning this due to how bad I am with taking care of myself. But I cannot stop worrying about my teeth, and it ramped up today when I felt the state of my back tooth.  
I'm honestly not too sure about what to do. I'm *super* bad at taking care of my teeth, and just.. hygiene in general, due to depression and mental strain. I also have a **really bad** addiction to soda.

I have some pretty bad cavities but the backside of one of my very back teeth is **super bad**. Like I can feel it's just completely mangled. It's gnarly. My other teeth are bad, but not nearly as bad as this one tooth, at least to my knowledge. The tooth in question has now decayed enough that the edges of the massive infected area are starting to get sharp and rub against my cheek. The tooth itself, and none of my other teeth, hurt, but it's a major cause of concern. 

I'm unsure on how to proceed forward with this. I'm a 22-yo (about to be 23) young adult, still trying to get a job and not having one previously before covid, while also still living with my family who lives paycheck to paycheck and barely scrapes by.

99,"TL;DR: Torn between staying at or straight up quitting my job for the sake of public health after vomiting at work because I am not comfortable with how management is handling the pandemic. 

I'll try to keep it short. Throwaway because my main profile could identify me. Anyways I work at a gas station that also serves made-to-order food and have been here for about two months. I graduated from university last May, but have struggled with finding jobs in my field because of covid. 

Generally, I don't mind my job. Not much to learn or grow but it gets me a comfortable paycheck. No coworker drama, great deals on their food, and days go by fast. 

Today I threw up at work and had a temperature of 99.3 degrees (they checked). I let my managers know of the vomiting and their response was ""It's okay, we'll just have you on register instead of making food tomorrow"". This particular place I work at is part of a local gas station chain and does not enforce mask wearing for anyone that is not an employee. We see a lot of out-of-state customers. 

One of their policies is that if you take a sick day, you need a doctor's note or you are penalized if corporate were to review your attendance. I've taken off once for my period (I have been diagnosed with dysmenorrhea) and two other days that I was able to get a note from the hospital from. 

Another thing worth noting is that my coworker threw up four times in one day, and three days after that happened I was told she was not allowed in the employee section of the store. They did not mention whether or not she had covid, but this came up during a conversation about getting covid tested. 

The store gets a scheduled sanitization every four hours, but sometimes we go past 8 hours without any sanitization. 

My roommate has also been feeling unwell. Normally I would just say ""oh, it's just a seasonal cold"", but I do not vomit during my colds, especially while taking prescription anti-nausea medication (Zofran). 

I cannot afford to get doctors notes every time I am sick and am close to a corporate review, what should I do? I do not want any bad references if I were to apply for other jobs. I've already suggested to my manager that she might want to find coverage for my shift tomorrow, she said that was my responsibility but refused to give me any of my coworkers contact information so I could reach out to them. 

I'm just wondering what I should do. I'm worried I'm being paranoid or over-thinking things. 

Sorry this is post is all over the place, I'm on mobile.",21Sep2020,1
100,"Without going into too much detail because I do not know if she uses this subreddit: my friend admitted to me that she tried a very hard drug for the first time. I was taken back because she never came across as someone who would do something like that. I have known her for years, and we practically grew up together. She told me she would only do it once and would never touch it again. I know other people who have done this drug, and it's not exactly something you can easily do once and forget about. She recently got a new boyfriend, and she had told me that he has used it before. I do not think he is a good influence on her at all, but she ensures me that he is a nice guy. She told me she only did it once, but she has been pretty distant since then. I am really worried about her, but I do not know how to approach the situation or what to say to her. I love her to death, however she is making a really bad decision. It doesn't help the situation that i am the only one who knows about this, so I can't really go to any of her other friends or anything and see what they think. She is an adult so I don't want to tell her what to do, but I can't just sit back and watch her throw her life away for a drug.

TL:DR my best friend of many years that I have been through a lot with is betraying me and being a dick because he has some superiority complex on me and my friends and I don‚Äôt know what to do

For context I have had a group of friends sense 5th grade and we have been inseparable even when i moved then moved back. We lost a friend because he was extremely toxic and bullied me into quitting everything and into depression and we all agreed it was for the better and we got really close after that. We have been best friends for 3 years and I really encouraged and helped him through weight loss and other things and he stopped me from contemplating suicide. So in other words, we are best friends.

I was talking to him over PlayStation with our other 3 friends and then he drops a bomb that took a piece of me off with it. He said he is talking to the friend and is probably hanging out with him. I was shocked and immediately wanted to know why and when. He said a couple weeks ago they started talking and that he would have started hanging out with him if it weren‚Äôt from being busy with football. I was dumbfounded he is talking to the person that fucking bullied everyone including him for 2 years. I then say ‚Äúwell can we hang out with him too‚Äù because I am willing to forgive and he tells me that we probably won‚Äôt be allowed to hang out with him because we aren‚Äôt up to his standards but or something. I almost immediately got off and have been thinking and connecting the dots. Even sense he got some tik tok fuck boy haircut, some girls called him hot, and he joined football he acts like hot stuff and has a superiority complex over my friends. He has been showing off that he is talking to multiple girls and that he is stronger than my other friends and been generally show off ish. I am absolutely broken that my best friend is betraying me like that and that I am just simply being thrown away after being through so much shit with him and I honestly don‚Äôt know what to do.

107,"I hooked up with my best friend‚Äôs crush and the guilt is killing me

This is awful I know. 

I (17f) recently got out of a long term relationship and was heart broken. During this time my best friend (17f), (we‚Äôll call her Grace) was so supportive and constantly there for me for days until I was feeling better. She had been talking to  for a couple of months (and had sent nudes a couple of times) one of my good friends (17m) (I‚Äôll call him mark) who i had known for a few years.  

A couple weeks ago grace told mark that she had feelings for him, he told her that he wasn‚Äôt interested in a relationship but he would hookup with her. She was upset but within the next couple of days she was back to talking and flirting with other guys. I felt like there had always been so type of attraction/flirtation between the two of us. We both told each other that we weren‚Äôt interested in a relationship and that we just wanted casual hook ups with no strings, he even asked me if I wanted to be friends with benefits but I told him it was too soon, he later on apologized. 

A week or so later I changed my mind, I was feeling like I needed that kind of attention and intimacy so I asked him if he wanted to hook up. I knew that it was wrong because of grace‚Äôs feelings for him but I pushed it to the back of my head cause I just wanted an escape. So we hooked up.  We promised we wouldn‚Äôt tell anyone. But a day after there was a party where I got blackout drunk and completely out of it and apparently I was all over Mark (I don‚Äôt even remember it) which hurt Grace. Other people at the party hinted that something was wrong so I confronted her and she told me that she was upset that I would to that to her especially after how much She was there for me after my break up.

111,"I feel a bit, I'm not sure, silly, seeking advice through here and that is no judgement of anyone else because we obviously come here for a reason and mine is that I feel helpless and stressed. I have a friend who I met a few years ago, we were not close straight away but I liked her thus, I introduced her and her partner at the time to my friends and invited her places. She is very smart, funny and has a great creative flair and style. However, I noticed a mean streak beginning to appear, for example, she would exclude me and engage with others gossiping about me. She once indirectly accused me of stealing from her and when I would try to engage in a conversation to resolve the issues she had with me she would say everything is fine or that she feels anxious having those kind of conversations and didn't want to talk about it. Therefore, I created distance. She came back into my life when she fell out with her then best friend and broke up with her boyfriend. I felt for her but was indifferent regarding my role as a support person for her due to her past behaviours. I then ended up breaking up with my boyfriend and we then became very close. She was a support person for me at the time but in hindsight our relationship became very co-dependant and I was not in a good place in regards to my mental health. She would often get angry at me for things such as this: saying her and the boy she was seeing were unable to sleep in my bed while I was away or asking her to return with my car that she would use for our shared employment situation. I let all of these things slide as I could not be bothered with the conflict. However, fast forward to now. I am in a much better place in my life. I am back with my partner, working, studying engaging in other activities and seeing a therapist. I had felt fine in our friendship regardless of a few times she lashed out or excluded me but there has been one particular time that shifted my feelings towards her making me realise I am in a bit of a toxic friendship. We had hung out together and she had made some comments regarding future plans. I said that I would be spending time with my partner and she was neutral. We decided to walk together her back to her place mine to my partners. She then changed her mind and said she would be leaving. Later in the day I asked if she wanted to hang out. She didn't reply and I messaged another good friend and went around to see them. My other friend, let's call her Amy for ease, messaged the friend I was with to hang out and they mentioned I was there. I then received a text along the lines of ""what the fuck? you said you were going to your partners but you are with so and so. you always overlook my emotions and I am fucking sick of it. you made me feel weird mentioning you were going to see your partner and asking me what I was doing."" I was taken aback but replied and apologised in order to diffuse the situation (in hindsight I should not have done this). They replied eventually thanking me and apologising for the impulsive text. After this, I felt emotionally drained and decided I wanted space. She messaged me saying she cares about me and I said me too but kept it very brief. We are in a circle of friends and I was in a situation where we were all hanging out, I was anxious and nervous but entered the situation trying to make a conscious effort to keep my energy friendly and light. She avoided eye contact and ignored me so I reached out and said ""Hi, how are you?"" She instantly became passive aggressive and didn't engage with me until later on in the day. We had plans to find a flat together and I had an upcoming viewing. I reached out to her to see if she was still interested in flatting with me and she said she was. We ended up getting this place wherein she mentioned it was expensive and asked if my partner would move in to make it more affordable. I wasn't sure if I was ready for that but he wanted too and on reflection we have been in a good place and I wanted to make it work. So we went ahead with it. We agreed upon a rent price and then she decided it was too expensive for her and continued to ask us to increase our payment saying that she would expect a random couple to pay way more. I was confused how she expected to be able to afford rent if my partner hadn't moved in but didn't mention this. To avoid drama, I said okay. We all moved in and I have been making an effort to carve out my own space as an individual. Today, she worked for me in the morning and will be covering for me this afternoon as she asked to work for me if I couldn't work. She is quite a loud person in general and loud to live with, again, no one is perfect so I generally don't mention anything plus I am rarely home. I did once however ask if her and our other friends could not be too loud too late one particular evening as I was very tired, she snapped at me and stormed out of my room. I mentioned last night to wake me up when she returns from her shift this morning but changed my mind as I felt like a sleep in. Perhaps I should have mentioned this but I didn't. In the morning she was talking, almost yelling, very loudly outside my bedroom and half asleep I said ""shhh"" she instantly became aggressive sighing and muttering. I started my day and left the house then received a text saying that it was rude to shhh aggressively at her, that she was doing me a favour and did not like being told to be quiet like a child. I personally thought this was an over reaction and despite being pissed off didn't engage. I returned home to grab a few things and upon entering the house she slammed the door to her bedroom very loudly. I couldn't help but laugh, grabbed my stuff and left. I later received a text message that said she felt like she was living in mine and my partners house despite it being ""our"" plan and ""our"" space. She said she feels a disconnect from me and like she is a burden to my energy and my relationship with my partner, she said it is hard for her to be happy, feels alone, often thinks of death, has mental health and chronic health issues that she believes I have forgotten about and said I have not once asked her to hang out even though I am her best friend. She said that she has very clearly been substituted for my partner and said that it is like when we first became friends. She said she is unhappy in this space and insinuated that it is because of me. She said she doesn't want to talk in person because she gets too heated. I didn't reply and she followed up with saying ""we can talk about it if you want"". I am hesitant because when I have tried to speak up in the past it has been shut down before the conversation has been started or she has become defensive and aggressive. I am not sure what to regarding this and then beyond this? I'm sorry for the long paragraph. I understand that from her view I may be totally in the wrong and I am open to my involvement but ultimately, I feel used, manipulated and as though I am her punching bag because she doesn't behave this way with other friends from what I have seen.

On Friday after work, I was hanging out with friends. I  had a bad week and needed people to talk about whats been bothering me, including her. We golfed, did laser tag, other random activities and then dinner.  Some of my friends posted pictures and videos on various social medias. So she found out I was hanging out with my friends and then messaged me ""Thanks for the Invite :("", I messages back to her ""I thought you told me you were hanging out with your sister (her sister's husband is in the military and they were moving soon), plus I just needed people to talk to for a bit"" .

I just needed people to talk to, who understand  why I'm frustrated and people who won't tell others people stuff I want to keep to myself"".

It wasn't until like 10 minutes later I realized I probably came off like a dick. So I tried to apologize ""Hey I'm sorry if that was rude, it truly wasn't my intention"" . Then nothing.

118,"For context: I live near a large university where I am a grad student. 

Back in late March after students were sent home for COVID, I came across a stray cat that was running through a busy street near campus. It looked underfed but was very friendly, he followed me to my car and hopped in so I took him to a vet who confirmed he was an unchipped ‚Äúcommunity feral‚Äù based on his TNR‚Äôd ear (tag/neuter/release). They told me he had no owner and I was free to keep him.

I learned today that this cat is a local celebrity on campus, with articles written about him and an instagram page with thousands of followers. The comments are full of students who‚Äôve since returned wondering where the local campus cat is, and I‚Äôm very conflicted. 

On one hand, we live in a rural-ish area, and bears, foxes, hawks, and other dangerous wildlife are seen on campus. The cat is extremely acclimated to home life and loves me and my friends, so I don‚Äôt doubt he‚Äôs happy. I‚Äôve also spent hundreds on his vaccines, microchip, etc. On the other hand, the comments on the page imply that he has an owner who ‚Äúlet him hang around campus‚Äù and that he is missed by many students. 

I made sure to put up posts when I found him, called multiple vets, and checked the lost pet listings for weeks. Absolutely nothing. At the very least I want to alert the owners that he is safe, well-fed, and happy, but I‚Äôm afraid of losing him as he‚Äôs been my best source of comfort during quarantine and we are very happy together.

Any advice for what to do next?",21Sep2020,1

122,"Hello, I am 20 years old, and lately I've been caught up in a desire for adventure. Sounds a little awkward but this is the best way I can put it. I hope you guys know what I mean, English isn't my native language.

Adventure can be defined as ""an exciting or remarkable experience"". I guess I just want to do interesting things, meet interesting people, learn new things, and have stories to tell. Maybe it's immature of me, I don't know. And I don't really think it's just a fantasy to get away from my problems either, as one might assume at first glance. I'm quite pleased with where I'm at right now, working on many facets of my life.

131,"Hi, I am 19m and trying to decide on a career path to take and have no idea what the hell I want to do.

Sorry in advance for the length of this post.

I am looking into college options and ways to improve myself during this pandemic. I have always been told I should pursue architecture since I was 6 to 7 years old. I used to make maps ""blueprints"" of family member's houses and draw perspective drawings for ""add-ons"" or furniture. In high school, I did take a few interior design classes. I have even had a few realtors say I should pursue either architecture or interior design. (Moved 9 times in the past 15 years). 

I don't know anyone in either of those fields but from what I have read architecture is a fairly boring job and nothing like how people ""advertise"" it. I know nothing about the Interior design field but that I have always kinda had a knack for it.

(Next paragraph is a rant)

Now you always hear people saying ""never grow up enjoy your youth while you have it"" or something along those lines. I have this philosophy "" If you enjoy something don't let other people say you can't enjoy whatever that is."" I enjoy video games and that is one thing I promised myself I would never stop enjoying. I will be a gamer until the day I die. Video games have taught me so much more than I ever thought possible and had a greater impact on my life then I thought a piece of art could. So on that note.

I also want to look into video game careers. I have had the pleasure of playing hundreds of video games and a handful stand out. That handful of games I have always turned to for advice on many occasions and expect to turn to them many more times down the road. The opportunity to work on something that has the chance to affect someone on the level that that handful has effected me sounds amazing.

I don't know much about the game industry. A lot of the job descriptions are vague and overlap. I know at least in the United States crunch culture is very much a thing and has high turnover rates due to that. 

Both Architecture and Game Design have many sub-categories of jobs and it isn't exactly clear what the difference between each is. I have thought of e-mailing some people in that career but have no idea exactly how to proceed with that. Also, feel like people get a lot of those kinda e-mails at least in the game industry.

Any advice on how I can make a decision would be greatly appreciated.",21Sep2020,1
132,"I really love the game. It‚Äôs top 3 in my opinion.

It‚Äôs really fun just having a lot of stuff in the game. 

I don‚Äôt want to cut out spending money entirely on the game. But I need to seriously tone it down. It‚Äôs preventing me from saving up for the gaming set up that I want to get in the future.

133,"I work for a small language center in East Asia and I teach English to young learners.

For each class that I teach, there is a local staff assigned to the class to help out with administrative tasks, communication with parents and students, and general support. 

One of the local staff routinely makes my job difficult. Let‚Äôs call her Karen. She interrupts me while I‚Äôm teaching, is very anal about petty matters, and tends to micromanage me (even though she‚Äôs not my manager).

One time, during class, I was having a coughing fit and told her that I needed to grab some water. I thought it‚Äôd be fine since there was another teacher in room leading the lesson. But she said ‚Äúno. It‚Äôs not break time.‚Äù I told my boss about this and Karen‚Äôs behaviour improved for about a week.

But now I feel she‚Äôs become passive aggressive. She tells me crucial information at the very last minute, and then acts frustrated when I seem overwhelmed. 

As an example, last Wednesday, less than ONE HOUR before the beginning of my hectic kindergarten class, she told me that the pickup and drop off system would completely change. She sent me a two page document entailing the new system and it was very complicated for me to understand. So when I struggled with organizing the kids that day, she snapped at me.

Even worse, that very same day, with only one hour notice, Karen told me that upper management would be coming to observe my classes without clarifying why.

I‚Äôm pretty sure she arranged for upper management to observe my classes, as some of the kids can be challenging. Either way, I feel it‚Äôs common courtesy to at least notify me a day before. 

And in a way it felt like a setup. She knows I struggle with this class, and she knew I would also struggle with the new pickup/drop off system, whereas she would look put together as she‚Äôs known about this system a few days in advance. All this happened while management was watching me.

I wish we could all work as a team and discuss strategies for improving challenging behaviours in the classroom. But it seems like such an us. vs them mentality between local staff and foreign teachers. 

I feel so stressed on a daily basis. I even lost 8 pounds in the last four months. Should I just give up and find a new job?",21Sep2020,1

and little did i know that i would be watching other anime that has this concept. *a few years past* and now here in the present i‚Äôve sadly developed a sister complex before i knew it. yes i never thought i would get it because i was grossed out by it at first. and no i‚Äôm not blaming anime, because this complexity is my fault.  so now i see my sister and my heart races for the taboo. but not in a nasty way, like i just can‚Äôt help myself get lost in her dark night sky eyes, get stunned by the scent of strawberry from her hair, and imagining the softness of her pinkish white skin. i feel so ashamed, and i tried to distance myself from her in any way i could, yet she keeps on getting closer to me. i just want to hold her and kiss her on her forehead. i‚Äôm also sad by the thought of her ending up with someone else. yet i no i have no place to be with her. i want to end this before it‚Äôs too late, before i make any damage. please help me out guys, i searched on google about how to cure a sister complex, and nothing came up except nasty stuff. i guess people who have a sister complex doesn‚Äôt want to get out, but not me. oh i almost forgot to mention,

158,"My late grandfather traveled all over the world and was an avid collector of souvenirs from foreign countries. Paintings, statuettes, and the like. However, as we were sorting through his belongings, we also discovered a large book weathered with age and written in some archaic European script.

The consensus from r/language was that the text is in ""Old Church Slavonic,"" used by the Byzantines from the 9th to 11th centuries. That would place this book at roughly 1000 years old. God knows when or how my grandfather got his hands on it, but it's much too late to ask him now.

160,"For context, we‚Äôve been in a long-distance monogamous relationship for a while, but there‚Äôs been a lot hesitance on their part (because of previous trauma) to make it ‚Äúofficial.‚Äù

This last week I‚Äôve been busy, and they‚Äôve been making me feel guilty for not being around for the two days I couldn‚Äôt text them (only two, and I still texted in between the times I was doing things, I was not completely ignoring them in any way). I had been out with friends, but they were still upset with me and even asked if they could seek something with someone else (implying that we would be still be together despite them talking with and also probably being physically intimate with other people). Now this may be no problem for people who are polyamorous, but I‚Äôm by nature a very jealous person in a relationship (and so are they, so it threw me off that they would even ask). I apologized for being distant, but it still felt off. 

This isn‚Äôt the first time this has happened, either. They struggle with their mental health and there have been a lot of threats to our relationship throughout, but when I bring it up with them, they turn the situation into another pity party or shift the blame to mental illness (which isn‚Äôt to negate their experience, I also have a history of mental illness and I know firsthand what it can be like, so please don‚Äôt take this as me criticizing them for it. I love them and want what‚Äôs best for them, I just can‚Äôt get a say in these conversations anymore). 

It just hurts to love someone whose love for you feels as if it‚Äôs constantly fluctuating but when you confront them about it they treat it like you‚Äôre going to leave or completely shut down and respond with short, dry texts or don‚Äôt even respond at all.

They‚Äôre also constantly talking to people of the opposite gender (just friends), but consistently get mad at me or tell me they‚Äôre sad that I do the same. I respect that the people they‚Äôre talking to are just their friends, that‚Äôs not a problem for me. The problem lies in the fact that they get jealous and don‚Äôt want me talking to other people (my friends again mind you), but when I bring up the hypocrisy of it all, they bring up trauma from their previous relationships, and it just makes me feel worse because A) the last person to be with them treated them awfully and B) they don‚Äôt trust me enough to know I don‚Äôt cheat and won‚Äôt cheat, because I‚Äôve been in that bubble and it SUCKS.

There‚Äôs so much more that I could get into, but I need to know what to do. It would tear them apart if I left, and I would hate to leave, but it also feels like for my own mental well-being I have to. 

TL;DR: my partner asked to see other people (and remain in a relationship despite my being apparent I was a monogamous person) and ultimately questions our relationship regularly despite my constant effort to be the best for them.

Any advice?

When I was young I had imaginary friends. I think we've all been there, I just never grew out of it. I mamaged to create an entire universe inside my own head that's been going on since I was 10 and, while I'm fine with it just staying in my head, I have issues with talking to myself. 

I used to do it a lot when no one was around, but now I do it more whether I'm venting or I'm genuinely answering my own thoughts. I'm not seeing things or anything like that, my brain does simulate an image when I want to so I can keep a face to the blank space I'm talking to, as well as a relative position in the room, but I don't actually see or hear things.

Now I don't think it's a lonliness thing, as I do have friends I talk to quite often (real ones) and we play games together. However I just never got rid of the imaginary friend concept from my head. This may be an outlet my brain created for creativity and to help me cope with bullying I've gone through as I've dedinitely used it to get anger out in a non-violent and/or self-destructive way, but sometimes I just go on tangents to myself because I've been telling myself that someone is listening, and it's probably contributing to my anxiety.

176,"\- English is not my native language, sorry for any grammatical mistakes.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 16 year old girl and have had my parents separated since I was 2 years old. My father was extremely controlling and abusive towards my mother, he complained about her weight, etc. All of this happened because he was manipulated by his sisters, they are people that I can't like at all, I don't like them because they are manipulative and lying people, because EVERYTHING they say, my father will blindly agree (they take his money just to buy branded clothes for them and leaves him full of debt, for example). I can't stand this. I can't stand to see all this alienation from him. My aunts never liked me, they never insisted on getting closer and I do the same (which, by the way, is something that makes my father uncomfortable).

Anyway, because I have separate parents, I always went to my father's house on a certain day of the week (the day he was off work), but every time I went there it was terrible. I never had a good relationship with him. However, my father never did anything directly to me, he never hurt me, but he did it with someone I love. I can't get in touch with him, I can't connect with him (he's an extremely secretive and mysterious person and I'm the same, so things get more complicated). And even though he hasn't done anything to me, I can't help feeling anxious around him and afraid, I'm afraid to say anything and he'll be super angry or whatever. And when I was at his house (remembering that I haven't been since we were quarantined) we never said anything, he stayed in one room and I in another, in complete silence (sometimes he said some things, we laughed, etc. But it wasn't at all times) and when I say something, he always tries to put me against my mother (even if indirectly).

&amp;#x200B;

OK, this is just a context.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was younger, I always called my dad, but it was just to ask me what time he was going to pick me up to go to his house, I never called him to say anything else and that remains today. He always complains saying ""wow, my friend he is divorced and his son always calls him"", ""your cousin always calls her father"" and I never say anything.

When the quarantine arrived, I called him a few times, this time talking about current affairs and so on. But I only did it a few times, and often because my mom insisted so much on me doing it. I liked calling him and it was cool, but I still feel weird.

My father lives alone and lost his job, I really can't help feeling bad about his situation, I sometimes send a message and even asked him to come over here when it was my birthday, so he wouldn't be alone ( for a moment I thought he wouldn't accept to come), but to make a call or do more than that I can't. I still can't help but feel uncomfortable around him and feel super small and insecure. I can't explain enough, I just know that I still don't have the courage to call him or connect with him in any way.

It's been a long time since the last call and my mom keeps saying things like ""he is your dad, call him"" or ""your dad was really bad with me, but he is amazing with you"", but I just don't want to and I can't even get in contact. My father also threatens to leave the state, because he is not getting the attention he wants.

I was already planning to send this, especially on the day he called my mother saying several things about me and how I treated him badly and said he would come here at home, I sent it to a sub and had the post banned. However earlier today I had a little argument with my mother, because once again she wanted me to call him and not leave him, but I said no and I didn't want to do that. She talked to me and said that she didn't want me to be selfish and think only of myself and that I should recognize all the good parts that my father did for me (gifts, walks, etc.). 

I have a huge problem with not being able to open up to anyone (it's been a relief to write all this down), so I couldn't say anything I wanted to her. I heard everything she said and kept my mouth shut. And it gives me so much agony, it's like your screaming at the void, screaming internally and I couldn't show it in any way. And I would like you to give me some advice, you can tell if I'm being wrong or not, I'm open to change and I want it to be a change that will do my family good. 

The truth is that I acknowledge everything he did for me (even more when I was younger), but do you know when you have the feeling that nothing was real or that it was not true? IDK

NOTE: He also never calls me, and when he does it is to demand something.

177,"I have a little sister who is 8 years old, soon to be 9. We‚Äôre almost exactly 10 years apart (my bday is 2 weeks before hers). I‚Äôm the eldest of 4. Between the two of us we have 2 brothers, she‚Äôs the youngest. Her behavior is so outrageous. My parents never had to deal with any of that with us older three. Sure we caused trouble here and there because we‚Äôre close in age but that was about it. She causes trouble constantly. She picks fights and bickers with us older ones for literally no reason. She‚Äôd say the meanest and most uncalled for things just like that and get away with it. She refuses to accept help or advice and insists that she is the right one and we‚Äôre wrong, then when crap happens she‚Äôs quick to throw the blame on us and make us out to be the bad guys, especially me since I‚Äôm her only sister. When our mother isn‚Äôt around ( at work or just somewhere else in the house) she‚Äôd come looking for us and talk nonstop even though we tell her that she‚Äôs talking too much and we‚Äôre focusing on something. She complains for everything and accuses of of stuff we didn‚Äôt do or say, and our parents always believe her and won‚Äôt hear it when we try to explain ourselves. They‚Äôre so tired of her running to complain for literally nothing and they‚Äôve just gotten to a point where they just dismiss whatever problem she causes after a short quarrel. She‚Äôd do mean things to us and when asked why, she‚Äôd say ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my body, I could do/say whatever I want.‚Äù  Another thing she does... she shrieks like a freaking pig in a slaughterhouse for the stupidest thing if we don‚Äôt give her her way or listen to her rudely put demands. Especially at night. It‚Äôs like some demon possesses her or something. Her screams echo through the street and it would be for something petty like we won‚Äôt let her watch tv because it‚Äôs her bedtime, or I won‚Äôt pick up the stuff she threw on the floor and wants again. Obviously I wouldn‚Äôt pick it up if she threw it at me and demands it back. 


That kinda sums up how she almost always is. Now to my situation. I was sitting calmly twisting my hair and watching some YouTube when she comes into our room for bedtime. This is a time where she‚Äôd come and talk talk talk but I‚Äôd still listen and respond because she‚Äôd eventually fall asleep. She did just that. Asking questions, I responded kindly and explained (I was watching a video about blind people so she was very curious). Then the conversation switches as she tries to bribe and threaten me to use her tablet for just a few minutes. Of course I said no. She started a little tantrum and made ignorant comments, refused to listen when I tried to correct her, she threw my stuff on the floor and didn‚Äôt want to put them back where they belonged. Then I snapped. 

I told her about all the annoying things she did and how terrible she was. I told her about how hard our mother works just for us to be happy and how she ruins that by being a brat every hour she‚Äôs awake. I told her that she‚Äôs worse than a 3 year old we knew and that he was more mature than her. I told her that for the amount of bragging she does about almost being a teenager makes no sense because she‚Äôs so immature with her whining and crying and thumb sucking. I commented on her stuck out teeth and said that only babies sucked their thumb. I pointed out all the wrong things she did. I told her about how our parents lies to her with the things she does or they‚Äôd pretend to listen because that‚Äôs what parents are supposed to do. I told her about how much she‚Äôs stressing them out and that we never go anywhere because of her horrible behavior. After I blew my fuse I threw her pillow at her (gently, she wasn‚Äôt far from me so it just fell on her) and she surprisingly stayed under it. Usually when I did that she‚Äôd shoot up and make some snarky comeback, laugh or just scream even though it never hurt her in any way. But not this time. She lay still and pulled her teddy bear close and was scarily quiet. After a few moments of silence I made out quiet sobs. She never did that before, she always cries in the most dramatic ways. Throwing herself to the floor, sticking her tongue out to enhance the sound, the full works.  She stayed like that for about 20 minutes. I just sat quietly and listened to see if she would come back up with a silly  grin to say that she was  because she fake cries a lot. But she didn‚Äôt. Eventually her body stopped its occasional shakes and she was still. She cried herself to sleep. I feel like absolute trash. I just spoke my mind in that moment after she pulled the last straw. I‚Äôm looking at her now hugging her pillow and sucking her thumb and I feel so awful. I can‚Äôt imagine what she must‚Äôve thought before falling asleep. How will my words affect her?

182,"I've had fairly bad anxiety as long as I remember and possible OCD (intrusive and unavoidable thoughts). I'm just going to add that I have not been properly diagnosed for either of these as I have never felt the need to go to a physician (I'm against taking any meds for them if I have them) but I have been to a therapist for a short period of time which I felt was a waste of money. Before going to college, I had never had any sort of relationship with a woman and I hadn't even held hands with a girl before. When I came to college, I met an amazing girl, let's call her H, who has accepted me for who I am and I am extremely grateful for that. The few first months of the relationship were great, but as the honeymoon phase started to come to a close, I felt lost. At the time, I had no idea what the honeymoon phase was and, because of the shift in emotions that I felt (from infatuation from companionship), my anxiety caused me to assume the worst and, to this day, I am obsessed and anxious about the possibility that I have lost feelings with her. Deep down I do not believe this to be true but I just can't determine what my emotions are with my brain interfering with everything. I've had ""obsessions"" (this has to do with me possibly having OCD) before in which my brain had worked to convince me of something that was not true. I don't really want to go into it but you can trust me when I say it was quite absurd and was completely against what I actually was feeling. I'm still in a relationship with H and we are over half a year strong. Me and her click extremely well but this cloud of anxiety that just follows me around is really halting the progression of my feelings for her and I feel helpless. I don't know what to do. I don't want my anxiety to be the thing that ruins the relationship I have with H as I believe she is one of the best things to ever happen to me and I do care deeply for her. I know this is really long-winded and probably extremely confusing at times, but I'm just so lost on what to do and how to proceed.",21Sep2020,1
183,"(Tl;dr at bottom)

My sister's fiance found a new job on indeed, fire safety sales. Alarms and whatnot. He came home from the interview and was talking about how easy it was to get hired. I already had a job but this one sounded better.



I applied and got an interview shortly after. Here's how the interview worked: ""nice to meet you,"" ""tell me about yourself,"" and, ""this is how much you'll be making, plus 8% commission."" I put my two weeks in at my old job and started this Wednesday.


Wednesday-Friday were training days, and there are some red flags I picked up on. 1) Day one had 9 training people, day two had 6 and day three had 5. 2) I have yet to sign any paperwork saying that I'm employed there. 3) They haven't required me to purchase a product, but have heavily suggested it. 4) I can't find any reviews for them online and they claim to be around since 1971. And 5) they exclusively use Facebook to advertise and it's done by the employees.


I do however, have one piece of info that contradicts my gut feeling. Its ranked A+ on better business bureau. 


Tl;dr: I found a job that feels too good to be true, and I have sensed a few red flags. Has an A+ on bbb though.

For the first month after our breakup we were no contact until he started messaging to check up on me (I found this odd since we had both agreed that we would go no contact after the breakup) but I had also recently injured myself and figured him checking up on me would be a one time thing. However, I noticed he started making this a biweekly thing. 

A couple of days ago he tried calling me and I hadn‚Äôt answered but instead texted asking why he was calling. Again he replied with ‚Äújust making sure you‚Äôre good‚Äù.

189,"So, just as a disclaimer there is nothing wrong with finding other people attractive in side a relationship. It is much more about how you act while In that relationship. 

My partner and I have been together coming up on 3 years. We have a very healthy relationship where we can openly say to one another ‚Äúthat person is attractive.‚Äù This may involve TV actors, porn stars or even people we see in public. Most of our relationship I‚Äôve been unknowing of what his ex looks like (not like it‚Äôs any of my business anyways.) but recently we were out to our local mall, and his ex was working in one of the stores. He then tells me that‚Äôs his ex girlfriend and he doesn‚Äôt want to be near said store. As we walk away I got to see what she looked like. She has shorter, dark hair. Dark eyes and a very sculpted facial structure &amp; quite thin.  But... I wouldn‚Äôt call her the most attractive women I‚Äôve seen. Brushing it off, we watch a tv series together. Where he mentions another women with short dark hair, dark eyes and a sculpted face and also very thin lady is attractive. I‚Äôve begun to notice a pattern in the women he finds attractive. But I have long blonde hair, light eyes and a fairly defined face structure. I am not thin.. I have more of what the stereotypical attraction of a  ‚Äòhour glass‚Äô figure.  I am beginning to wonder if I am even an attractive person because very rarely do I hear ‚Äúyou‚Äôre beautiful‚Äù I‚Äôve brought this to his attention and he said the reason he doesn‚Äôt call me pretty all the time is to not sound like a broken record, and so I feel he genuinely means it the times he does call me attractive. But.. I‚Äôve heard more times that I hv a nice body in the bedroom then I think he‚Äôs randomly said ‚Äúbaby you look beautiful.‚Äù I am unsure how to bring this up where he can understand how I feel. I dont want him to think I am looking for reasons to be upset but it genuinely does hurt being in a long term relationship not hearing that you are attractive all that often outside of intercourse.. only to then realize all the women he‚Äôs been with previously, and find attractive on TV don‚Äôt have anything in common with you.",21Sep2020,1

I am a pretty confident person when it comes to the things I like and I don't feel shy or afraid to speak up about it just because other people might think ""it's not cool"" or might stereotype me.

But, sometimes, this pressure gets to me because I overthink A LOT. Like nowadays. I know there is nothing wrong with expressing what I like and I keep reminding myself of it everytime, but it is just not helping. It has made a web in my mind of 'what ifs'.  

Some of my thoughts that I can't get out of my head are like- ""its completely okay to not like something, but to hate on it or calling someone uncool because of it is so uncalled for, will there be people who would understand this? What if I never find like minded people?"" ""What if they judge me and think low of me for liking something or having this opinion?"" 

Being someone who's always respecting of other's opinions and likes, I feel I won't get the same treatment because, let's be honest, the world isn't nice. 

I've faced this a couple of times and usually I get better with time. But I want to know if there is something I can do whenever I get these bouts and not just leave it to time. 

How do you usually reassure yourself when it comes to things like these? Or how to not give in to the general opinion of things?

A little background, so growing up generally didn‚Äôt have the best childhood (alcoholic dad and everything that comes wit that) but I managed through it. I have an older brother who‚Äôs BPD living in the house too, so that causes a lot of stress too. Im also dealing with recovering from overuse injuries in both knees and elbows which has stopped me from lifting and running for about a year now, two things I loved greatly. 

I‚Äôm living at home again due to dorms closing due to Covid.  From the time I got sent home till august I was just smoking all day everyday to cope and realized that wasn‚Äôt sustainable , and I‚Äôm getting a job in EMS, so I had to stop. I got a therapist the day I quit, and he‚Äôs pretty cool, but idk I haven‚Äôt seen that much progress and it‚Äôs been a month and a half (he had me read a book, asks me how schools going etc).  

On the weekdays I bury myself in my school work and I feel pretty good, but on weekends after I finish my schoolwork for the day I get to thinking and shit just hits and I start to depress myself greatly. 

Since I quit smoking I‚Äôve been trying to distance myself from my friends at home since the most of them are stoners and I don‚Äôt see a lot in common with them anymore. I don‚Äôt know how to feel about my girlfriend of almost two years anymore either. I have so much love for her, but I feel like as if it‚Äôs a friendship and not a relationship if that makes sense.

201,"I joined this community not too long ago, at the beginning of August, to be exact. I'm not going into any detail on what the community is based around but it's sort of like a forum based RPG with its own lore and followers who are always active into the lore.

 I joined primarily to entertain myself since I've always wanted to communicate with others in a sort of fashion like this, and since I have basically nothing else to do online other than laugh at videos all day.

When I first joined the community I was pretty thrilled with how I interacted with everyone, I hoped to make a good impression. The community even had a Discord server which I reluctently joined.

The people into the lore were also in the server, and they were pretty hardcore about it. I, myself, being antisocial, hesitated to join even though they mentioned at one point they would let anyone join the lore. In short, the story lore itself is hella confusing yet I wanned to interact with the people there.

I spectated them for awhile whenever they held events or just hand out, and I attempted small and short conversations for awhile.

About two weeks into the community someone quicky joins the lore, and their own fictional persona is something very related to mine, which quickly triggered me. I didn't want to lash out to make the user feel bad, but I felt jealous of how they got in as well as having a similar persona as me. The community seemed to include them like they were always there and they instantly interacted with each other, already understanding the lore. I was so stressed out that I made a small fool of myself in the Discord server, not sorta lashing out but I was showing signs of jealously.

At the end of the day I left the community and the Discord, hoping to not pain myself more than I needed to. It's been a month since I left the community but I keep yearning to return to it, even though it pains me because of what happened.

I noticed that the person who had the similar persona as me has made other OCs as well, and hell, has not even posted the OC that I raged about yet, and they are always active with posting it on a website they're on.  I don't know if they leftout that character or they continue to use it without my notice (since im not in the server or community, so I have no idea). 

I really want to go back, because I met a few friends who I want to meetup again but at the same time I'm so stressed that I embarassed myself in front of the lore people, and I have no idea if the person is still using the OC that made me upset is still in lore or actively used. I sound kind of forceful which is part of the reason I left since I hate doing that, but I don't want to harm myself and anyone else if I continue to watch the person do what I once intended to do before they joined.

I'm attempting to join the community and Discord again, but I'm afraid of the embarassment I put myself a month ago and what will happen if the person continues using that OC. I just want to enjoy my time on here and make friends but I don't want to ruin anything at the same time.

219,"I understand no one can probably give me a clear answer, but I was hoping others who‚Äôve had conflicting thoughts could tell me how they figured their sexuality out. 

So this might be a TMI, but hopefully if I give everything someone can help me see what I‚Äôm not seeing. So I am a female, and I get turned on my other females. The Instagram models do turn me on, while the guys do not. I don‚Äôt ever really look at a real life guy and think about him in a sexual way. Very rarely do I imagine kissing them, but never sex. However, I get turned on by yaoi (mlm manga), which is two men. I also can‚Äôt really imagine myself in a relationship with a woman. Every time I imagine my future, I default my spouse into a man. It could be because I‚Äôve never seen a good lesbian relationship, as I have read and seen so many shows with heterosexual couples, and I‚Äôve never seen a healthy lesbian one, but other gay kids know from a young age. Also, I don‚Äôt watch porn because I think it‚Äôs weird, but when I imagine scenarios in my head, the straight sex works better than lesbian sex. HOWEVER, if I imagine any detail into the guy, I get turned off. Add a face, body, or even skin color and I get turned off. In these scenarios, I focus on the woman in great detail, and it is not me. Every detail about the way she looks and acts is thought out by me. 

I guess at a first glance it would just be bi, but that doesn‚Äôt seem right to me because I think about men and women completely differently. Its been suggested that I‚Äôm a heteromantic homosexual, but that just seems like I‚Äôm faking one of them. Has anyone else had contradicting thoughts like these before? How did you figure out once and for all what your sexual orientation was?",21Sep2020,1
220,"Hiya. I'm currently 16F and for the past few years I've kinda struggled with talking to people naturally. 

Since about 13, I started becoming self-conscious and socially awkward. I don't quite know how to explain it, but here goes.

For example, I was at my aunty's and uncle's wedding a few weeks ago. They were letting people come up and speak and I wanted to so I stood up and walked over. I hadn't really thought through what I was gonna say aha.

I stood up there, heart racing and said my name, then took a breather and started to talk. As I was talking, I could hear my shaky voice, and I kept trying to hide. I noticed this and lifted my head up, and tried to speak more clearly. Still mortified, but I felt alive.

I finished (very awkwardly) and walked back to my seat. I could feel the redness of my face.

I pushed myself, and I'm proud I did it. Younger me would have never dared. In the end, I'm energetic, talkative, and I don't mind too much, but I struggle to talk sometimes.

I could talk to strangers, walk around alone without worry, but I just can't seem to talk to people infront of a crowd. Is there anyway I could change this? 

P.s, I don't like my voice, so it could play a role in it. I want to get a vocal coach or something, but I'm in a pickle with that right now.. (my mom offered me singing lessons (she isnt a licensed coach) but hasnt had any time/I've been waiting months for it,,)",21Sep2020,1

224,"I know it's a wall of text, but it's all important. Please read as I feel helpless.

I don't know who to call for help on this. My Mother and Step-Father who I love very much live out of state (Oregon) with my four siblings. My two younger sisters and two younger brothers. I was taken from their home when I was around 7 and have visited here and there, but because of this, I'm only close with my oldest sibling who I grew up with. 

A couple years ago my mother had an affair with an old friend of hers. He was married and had kids, but now he is divorced and has no custody of his child. This broke my step-dads heart and they have since ""separated"". Nothing legal, just split up. My dad is a disabled veteran. As far as I am aware, he has mild schizophrenia and without his medication he has many seizures. Once even while driving. He has an income based on family size because of his service. Well ever since the affair I feel like his mental health is deteriorating. He picked up a very frequent marijuana habit which in itself isn't that bad, but it seems like it's all the time. He hasn't said it before, but I'm certain he would take harder drugs if the opportunity came. The house has become a mess. I visited last Christmas and the smell was awful. Carpets were destroyed. Laundry, toys, trash, food just everywhere. I won't lie it brought me to tears. What was once my clean, childhood home filled with summer joy has become dump. I think he's given up.

I keep up with my brother via discord all the time but as of late things have been getting worse. My mother has always been a social leech. She hasn't had a job since at least 2009. I confidently can say she is abusing social services. She claims she's disabled, but she''s never been diagnosed, and she's been rejected for disability a plethora of times. She's just fat. Either way she somehow has some income from the government. She has a government provided apartment, that she doesn't even use. The house is filled with cats, but otherwise usually empty. She is always at my step-fathers house. She has a government provided cell phone with internet, but also pays for her own plan and cell phone. 

My siblings are not doing good though. It's crazy to me that to them, this is normal life. They only eat fast food and microwavable food. My brother is 15 and obese. My sister is overweight at 12 and my youngest sister is 8 and starting to put on weight too. I'm concerned for their health. 

Their education is also being affected by poor parenting. There is no urgency to get to school. Before this whole COVID mess they would show up to school halfway through the day because my parents wanted to sleep or they just wouldn't go. The latter being the most common. 

My oldest sibling dropped out of high-school half-way through senior year. He's very naive. He is the one who discovered the affair. I think this messed him up a little bit. He's expressed to me how he felt and how his perception of our mom changed after that. After he turned 18 he started to butt heads with my mom, calling her out on her BS and not taking her shit anymore. She does NOT like this. She constantly belittles him and when they fight she even scares my siblings with high-pitched mocking and occasionally just screeching. Seeing your mom do this can't be healthy for your mind. 

Anyways I kind of feel helpless here. I love every member of my family but I worry for the future of my siblings.

Is there anything I can do? Anyone I can call? What would you do in this situation? Just watch and hope for the best.",21Sep2020,1
225,"I'm 37. I've no job, no hobbies, no friends, no social life...I've no idea how to address this and change my life. 

At the moment I can't really apply for work, even if I could I've no idea what work to try to apply for and long-term unemployment means I'm not employable anyway (I need support back into work due to disability, but that support doesn't exist). Financially I'm okay but little money means even less chance of getting to socialise, although I'd not be better off in work it would allow me to move in with my partner in the future. 

I've tried to find hobbies but nothing really appeals, I try different things but it's either too expensive to keep up for long or it's simply no fun to do without friends. I volunteer but I've been at the same place two years and it feels pathetic, they won't hire me for a paid role so I feel unhappy there (although it's still closed due to the pandemic and likely won't reopen until next year). It's almost as hard for me to find volunteer work as it is to find paid work. 

I spend all day every day at the moment doing absolutely nothing, I literally sit in the sofa playing a pathetic farm game in my phone. There's not even anywhere to walk locally, I used to try to get to free events but there's not much going at the best of times and now there's just nothing to do due to lockdown and the weather getting colder.

228,"Btw this is a repost. I got advice about 2weeks ago, but I just want more options I guess. I'm sorry thank you. 

Most of the time I just straight up forget I have a physical form it really weird. I'll walk by a mirror and just get really confused, like oh yeah thats what I'm in this is my vessel can't don't know how I got in it but here I am.

Then I basically just tell myself some things about me (my name, favorite color, my crush) so I can convince myself that I'm a actual human being. It used to be really strong and I would slap my face or cut myself so I could feel real again. 
Also the **whip lash** I get from remembering the I'm alive is so weird, it's uncomfortable and almost scary at times.

So umm how do I stop doing that, or what even is ""That""
Bc not only does this affect my work in social life, its just really uncomfortable I'm afraid that I'll do something like relapse with selfharm bc my impulse control is significantly lower when I'm like this.

Stuff I didn't add last time:
I'm a female, I'm also 14. 
Another thing that I do that's apart of *That*.  time just started to slip by me, it either goes really fast or just slower. I try to get up but when I do I kinda go ""oh fuck"" when I look at my hands, bc I just feels so weird. 

Also memory has been being weird as well. The time line of events during the day or even week are all jumbled up. I can straighten them out with effort but its still weird. It gets mildly concerning when I can't remember if I ate or did my daily routines that day. I end up eating to much, or eating to little, neglecting my poor chickens by not letting them out as early as they need to be. 

I can't even remember/bother to shower or brush my teeth when I'm like this. This is basic self care. I don't even feel the need to do it when I remember. I would rather just space out for a while instead of ***Take care of myself*** Idk what is wrongggg with meeee",21Sep2020,1
229,"I completed my my master degree at the age of 24. Now I am 27. For the last 3 years after graduation, I did not do a single thing that improved myself, made me happy or prepare myself for my upcoming 30s.

Still renting of course. Unstable income, you could say that my income is lower than people my age with a master degree.

I worked out since 20 years old, and was so determined in uni that I am gonna get jacked. Now 27 with a big belly. Acne skin. Don't even bother to trim beard. My hair started thin. For real, I look like a misarable 45 year-old man lurking in dumpsters.

This was not always the case. I got admited to a really good university for my bachelor degree (top 10 national). During my uni time, I was very extrovert. I made lots of friends, tried many new things. I was always a top student as well, lecturers knew me well. I even was the student who gave the good bye speech at the last formal dinner with staff and faculties. Life was just great back then.

Somehow, I lost my way. Graduated with lots of ambitions, I am now stuck with reality that I did not accomplish anything worthwhile. My friends who got a much later start than me are doing better now. And it seems that I am getting passed by by every one I know.

I am now the one who got left behind. The pain of regret kills me. Regret of not trying hard enough. Regret of being lazy. Regret of being arrogant. Regret of thinking that I got life under control while it is not.

I wonder who I was, who I am now and where I am heading. If I continue to be like this, a horrible 30 is waiting for me.

Not just financial issues, but also health. I lost all my muscles and cholesterol is high. Belly is popping out of pants. Long hand nails, toe nails, brushy but thinning hair, ... you name it.

I hate listening to people's success. Since when I become like this? I was the one leading. And I have panic attack when someone asks how I am doing.

The problem is myself. It is inside me. I need help.

230,"Hi reddit! My boyfriend (21M) and I (21 F)are currently in the process of possibly purchasing a home. I am nervous, scared and excited because this is the first time I make such a big step! At first I was nervous about my parents not being supportive because we both still live with our parents but they are supportive. Only thing is my dad is scared i‚Äôm going to mess up, purchase a home and then regret it. 

My partner and I are currently looking into a one bed one bath. My father says this is a waste of money because its too little and too much money. I honestly think that it is perfect for us since we are still currently studying. Currently everyone has been saying that this is the perfect time to purchase a home due to interest rates being so low. 

Another thing that my father mentioned to me is that we should rent for 6 months first to see how we live together since we have never lived together to see if it is worth doing such a big move with each other. We have been together for 3 years, have gone on long trips before, sleepovers at house, etc. It‚Äôs not like i‚Äôm uncomfortable with the fact that we are going to be living together. In addition, he says that house prices are going to continue to drop. 

My boyfriend says that we will be purchasing this home, continue working and studying so that when we have higher paying jobs with our degrees, we rent it and buy a bigger property and can finally start a family which I agree as that is the plan.

Does this sound like a good idea? I‚Äôm very excited for this move but what my father is telling me is pushing me back. Not the fact about us living together, but the fact that we are going to waste money? I was trying to calculate the amount of money we will be spending monthly and have a good amount to save for trips, or for saving in general.

I actually feel exceptionally depressed. I didnt earn it. I lost my job because i fucked up got a huge unemployment check went on the road did it and now what. 


My only career goal was to travel. The only reason i went to college was because itd get me a job so i could travel, i only would workout and lose weight so id look good in pics when i traveled. But now ive done it. Im overweight by a lot and cant force myself into the gym because i dont have a cause. It was crystal clear on the trip i thought i figured it all out while driving. I put myself to three simple goals. Get an education degree, workout, learn to invest in stocks. I opted out of school this semester, havent been to the gym since i got back, and i lost 500 in stocks. Granted ive gained some of it back but i havent fully committed. I wanted to travel for me but i was mildly surprised how little everyone gave a fuck about it. Ive actually been judged for it by my family. I knew it was the right call but im about to be 25 no where in a career and havent really progressed my life.

For the start im 21yo(F) and since when i was a kid i always suffered a lot of bullying, like a lot and i would always come back home crying and because of other families issues i had a terrible anxiety and panick attacks, i couldn't feel safe when i was in some kind of ""new territory"" or when experiencing new things, because of that i as really close to my family since they always supported me, especially my older brother, he's always been my best friend, so me being so young( bullying and family issues started when i was 4yo) i placed my brother as my ideal figure of how i wanted to be, and them i started to act like a boy (im talking about behavior, even tho i would still have my girl toys and liked to play with them), i would rather play with boys than girls, i wanted to be like the boys since they usually wouldn't treat me bad like the other girls did, and also i used to play a lot with my brother and his friends, they never treated me bad and with that everything was perfect, the problem begins between the 6th and 9th elementary, since i never had the worry to care about my looks and appearance, it turned to be a problem to me when the boys would start to chase after pretty girls and the datings begin, i didn't care about that, but everyone started to say i was weird and ugly and all that bullying shit, i couldn't hang out wih the boys and pretend that i was one of them since they realized that i was i girl, but i didn't, so i would stay the same and i would only really realize that i was a girl and that my body was changing when i entered the high school, but i think it was too late for me.
I had my first kiss when i was 15yo and i was perplexed by the thought that someone would want to kiss me, because i knew everyone said i was ugly, back them also like the boys i would talk about sex in a open way,like it was nothing, while all the girls would act the opposite, because of the way i used to talk and me never realized that i could attract some attention, people would think of me as a slut.
I started to take care of my appearance when i was 15 but i didn't think of me as a pretty or attractive girl, it never came to my mind that someone could have interest in me, and years later when i was about 17 to 18 i realized that i was a girl, that i should pay attention to what i say because people might get the wrong idea, but it was too late for me, everyone had made up their minds about me, and i know now that the way i used to talk back then was very bad, i used to say a lot of shit and it is understandable that people think i used to had sex with a lot of people, even tho i was a virgin. Nowadays is still hard to hold back some words that can come out wrong, im trying to get used with the thought that im a woman and i might attract some bad or good attention, that caused me a lot of trouble handling my sexuality since i was afraid to do something wrong and get called a slut again, i only had sex one time and im afraid to do it again, also i don't like to go to parties and go out a lot so its hard for me to get to know new people, my friends always says i look cute but im just afraid and i know that a lot of people that i know think that im a slut and i don't know how to even try to get in a serious relationship with someone, i don't know how to ""act right""

The first day I worked, I made a medication error because the medications were organized in the wrong spot. Patient was aware and OK. I haven‚Äôt gotten over it and have been hard on myself since it happened. 
It‚Äôs been only a week.
I don‚Äôt feel happy. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs the anxiety working in a new environment or if it‚Äôs working as a bedside nurse that is catching up to me. 
What would you do? I feel so lost.",21Sep2020,1

240,"Hey i‚Äôm gonna try to not sound like a piece of shit when i do this but i just want some help or advice on what to do, im lost.

 I recently just moved into college as i‚Äôm a freshman, been here about 2 months, and i hate it. At one point it was my dream school, I was so excited and could not be happier to come. I‚Äôm currently playing a college sport that i‚Äôm not even sure I love enough to continue to play, and it‚Äôs not even the sport that is making me leave, it‚Äôs more than likely the only reason i‚Äôm still here. I go to a small school in kentucky and there just is NOTHING to do, even without covid. 

 I‚Äôm not wanting to just drop out and move home and do nothing with my life, I want to transfer to online classes and move back home, while working so I can get an apartment with my bestfriend. My home life was pretty toxic so i‚Äôm really not wanting to stay there long, but it‚Äôs just so lonely here, and yes i‚Äôve tried clubs, study groups, the whole 9 yards. I‚Äôm also pretty stubborn so once i make my mind up, it‚Äôs made. But i feel like if i go back, i‚Äôm just letting myself down because i worked so hard to get here. Even my roommate has already put in his transfer papers and is leaving after this semester, then it‚Äôll just get worse for me. 

I just want help, the counselors are shit, and my parents don‚Äôt really support me coming back home. I‚Äôve had a past with depression and I would really like to not go back down the path, but it almost feels as if i‚Äôm going to anyways.. The only thing that really keeps me going, and i hate to say it, is alcohol. Without it i feel like i‚Äôm nothing and it‚Äôs just gives me a reason to look forward to the day. 

As i said, I‚Äôm not wanting to drop out and do nothing. I want to move back home and work, coach, and do online classes so i can still finish my degrees. Any help from people with good advice or experience will be sincerely appreciated on what to do.",21Sep2020,1

245,"I‚Äôm having a difficult time with my family and need some advice. I live in a rural part of Vermont, I have never been too good with money when I was younger my parents would split a can of Campbell soup for dinner and lunch. Some days we would share bowls of chicken and beef broths with dinner rolls. I‚Äôd get called names and slapped by my mom until CPS got involved and took me out of the house for a period of time. I‚Äôd get home and shed put me in the stair well closet for a days at a time and say I‚Äôm Unholy and a disappointment of a child. This was during the weird economy problems in 2008 or 2009 though so even though this has nothing to do with my current situation, it played a roll in why my parents are the way they are today. I thought a backstory to my life would be good to explain why my family is they why they are. 

So current day, my family has gotten to be better. They don‚Äôt ever harm me. My mom is less religious, but still practicing. Everything is overall better sort of. Until today. I‚Äôve been really broke and hard of cash and wanting to go out with my friends and buy a car and such so I can move on with my life, but they don‚Äôt want me too. I went to job interviews at McDonald‚Äôs and Wendy‚Äôs a few days ago and I got denied the job because I don‚Äôt have transportation or a way to get there. All I‚Äôm trying to do is save for a cheap little Honda Civic all I‚Äôd have to do is work for a few months and save up $1500 or so. But no. I‚Äôm out of luck. 

I get home and my parents laugh and say I don‚Äôt need money, I‚Äôm their child and I‚Äôm going to live with them until they‚Äôre old and dead they say to me. I get mad obviously and say I‚Äôm not staying in this house and I hate them. My dad goes to the bathroom and throws the toilet plunger against the wall and breaks all of our fucking family photos and heirlooms. My mom says look what you‚Äôve done look what you‚Äôve caused why didn‚Äôt I abort you. At this point I‚Äôm furious so I just leave the house and sit at a bus stop for a while, a long while. Like 2 days while. And today I tried coming home and they don‚Äôt want to talk to me and said when I turn 18 they‚Äôre evicting me. Said that I am insane and they‚Äôre turning me over to a mental institution. Yet again I leave and I‚Äôm hanging out at a gas station as I type this. 

Am I the bad person here?? Or are my parents right and I‚Äôm being ungrateful, and should respect them more and help them until they‚Äôre old age like a ‚Äúchild should do‚Äù. I‚Äôm so confused and don‚Äôt know anymore. My depression medication doesn‚Äôt work and they‚Äôre banter isn‚Äôt helping so now My mind is racing.

Basically, I recently went out of my house for a run. Where I live, it‚Äôs mandatory for everyone older than 11 to wear a mask, unless you are going for a run or cycling. I got approached by this lady, who I may say WAS NOT WEARING ONE, and she said ‚ÄúWhy are you not wearing a mask?‚Äù

me: I‚Äôm running.

her: well, you still have to wear a mask!

me: uh- no I don‚Äôt. You‚Äôre not wearing one either!

her: I have a medical condition!

me: okay, chill! I get you may have one, but why are you getting mad at me?

her: because you‚Äôre meant to be wearing one!

and basically, that conversation went on for almost 5 minutes. Eventually, she let me go but she said before I ran off: ‚ÄúI know your mother! I‚Äôll be calling her!‚Äù

247,"So back in July I helped out a friend who was getting kicked out of her ‚Äúapartment‚Äù; when I say apartment this room was literally that just a room. It was nearly half the size of a walk in closet. It wasn‚Äôt just her in that room but her and her two cats. I was able to help get her out and have her start living with me. We managed to get her on the lease as a occupant. She‚Äôs a recovering alcoholic, and has been doing good on watching her drinking. The roomate also smokes weed, but just a one hitter and she‚Äôs hardly out there for less a few minutes. This was something she picked up from her last bf yet does it nearly all the time now. Before it was once or twice over the weekend.

I‚Äôm going to preface this, the roomate in question does have fibromyalgia. A few weeks past she drank nearly a full big bottle of Vodka. I was away for the holiday and she had a panic attack. Due to the panic attack and drinking that much all in one go, she stared to get alcohol withdraw. That Wednesday I took her to the hospital. Ever since she has not been right. She complains about her Fibro pain; she cries a lot; and lately she‚Äôs been smoking weed more. Just today she went out to car five times. When I approached her about this she said it was for medicinal purposes. But I‚Äôm not sure... not even sure what to do or how to approve this with her. She has one of those negative personalities where her pain is the words in the world and no others; or no one could understand. I have no idea what to do with my roomate.....",21Sep2020,1

252,"Okay this is a long story, (I will put a tldr below)

I know this sounds unreal but I swear it is true and I need advice

So, I have a friend, lets call him Micheal (not his real name.) Micheal and I met when we were in 8th grade. Micheal and I were a part of a trio. Our trio consisted of me, Micheal, and our friend, lets call him Noah. So the three of us were best friends. We were really close with each other. And one day my friends and his friends started to ""ship"" me and Micheal. They would push me into Micheal, and everything else teenagers would do. At the time, I didn't like Micheal, I liked Noah. As time passed, me and Noah would get closer. And eventually, at exactly 12 on New Years, both Noah and Micheal would tell me they like me. Keep in mind that I am like 14 and have not had any type of relationship with a boy. So of course, I accepted Noah's confession. After like 2 weeks, the three of us are in a library. Micheal tells me and Noah that he is moving away to a different city. I was really shocked that he was moving, even after what had just happened to the three of us. 

Fast forward three years, and me and Noah had broke up. Honestly, I was quite happy that we had broken up. It was quite a toxic relationship. We both had our problems. Fast forward again to the end of my senior year, and I'm suddenly messaging Micheal again. I can't really remember why I started messaging him, but I did. And we would talk, but not everyday. Fast forward again, (present time) and one day in august, Micheal told me that he would be visiting our city. I asked him if he wanted to meet up, and he agreed. Now I asked my friends, ""Is it okay for me to start liking Micheal now?"" They all gave me answers like, ""Oh yeah it's fine"" and ""I don't know, won't it be awkward?"" I wasn't sure if I liked Micheal at that point.

So when I met up with Micheal, I thought it would be just the two of us. But when I walked up to Micheal, Noah was there too. Luckily, me and Noah are on good terms, but I kind of wished it was just me and Micheal. We didn't do much. We just walked around and talked. And honestly, at that moment I think I realised that I did like Micheal. He would make sure I wasn't walking on the side near the cars. He would ask me if I was okay. And the way he would look at me, I couldn't help myself but like him. 

After he left, we would still talk. But not everyday. Right now, I am contemplating whether I should tell him I like him or not. Like I want to get it off my chest but I don't know how he feels. Some days we could talk for hours on end, some days we don't talk at all. Sometimes we would play games together all day, and not at all other days. The day we met, I felt sparks, but I have no idea if he did too. He's also very unique. I know it's cliche to say he's not like others, but he really is unlike anyone I've ever met. I've taken so many online tarot readings and they all point to me telling him. But I just can't bring myself to say it. I guess it's the factor that I have no idea what he feels or what he thinks. What do you think I should do?

TLDR: My old best friend who used to like me moved away, and after my senior year we started talking again. He came back to visit my city, we met up with one other friend, and I felt sparks but I'm not sure if he did too. We continue to talk to this day, but not everyday. Some times I feel like he does like me, some days I'm confused. He's not like others, cliche I know. I want to tell him I like him, but I am hesitant. What should I do?",21Sep2020,1
253,"So over the past week I‚Äôve been visiting family and had hired someone to watch our dogs/house sit. She‚Äôs a nice lady who has done this for us multiple times, she‚Äôs young (early 20‚Äôs). Before I left, I told her that her and her husband could stay at my house while she watches the dogs. I was watching the recorded videos from the last week to make sure they were let out enough and ate good, these videos were actually mainly just her husband letting my dogs out. Based on the footage I could tell he was staying there with her besides the first night we left. She got home around 6pm but then a totally different guy showed up at 10:30 pm and left an hour later. (Which seems like a total booty call??) I know I shouldn‚Äôt be this concerned but I tried to make sure I wasn‚Äôt crazy and tried to prove this situation. My evidence: I compared this guy to her husband and they‚Äôre completely different in height/weight/facial hair, her husband showed up in a truck all week and this guy showed up in a small car, her husband knows the door code and could unlock the door every time he came while this guy knocked on the door, and the fact that he didn‚Äôt sleep over when her husband spent the night every other night. I know that I seem crazy but I have always vowed to be the person that tells someone they‚Äôre getting cheated on so I really don‚Äôt want him stuck in a relationship like that if this is true. This could also be totally wrong and it could have been like her brother visiting or something. So that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm stuck, what do I do?? I feel terrible for him if this is true :(",21Sep2020,1
254,"Hello y'all , I have had a long history with my parents over quarantine and long story short we had a scuffle about my independance and my feelings towards them as a new 18yr old adult one thing led to another my mom shouted at me get your ass out of my house by January 1st at first I thought she was bluffing as she tends to do that when she is mad but I was dead wrong as I realized I delivered my message wrong by saying I hate her instead of just saying the same message again of back off I need my space to grow as am adult.

Tldr I got into it with my folks and I might have fucked up by saying I hated them but they really have been nothing but nonces for reasons I won't get into but my dad is childish and loud and never takes anything serious until he has too my mom holds grudges and get hurt to easily and my dad also likes to think he knows everything and he is influcing my mom to kick me out potentially.

But what really sealed the deal was when my uncle told me that my mom is the type to hold a grudge it didn't shock me badly but it made me feel like a fool so I changed my approaches for my mom and dad as I been going about in my own house to care free now I may or may not get kicked out of my own home i have to pay for my own phone bill and internet in the house.

So here's a question I have a phone plan and cellphone covered what's a good cheap internet plan to get in my house as they already have internet covering the house but my dad insisted I get my own because come next month hes kicking me of the wifi. My budget has to be 30-40 bucks for internet as I am working a part time job cleaning in my parents business its a twice a week gig that I work two hours for two days in a week tops and I get paid bi weekly.my final check is either 80-85 dollars max.

I have multiple bank accounts for groceries($25) monthly bills($25) room fees and deposits($25) and an emergency account($25) this was money from my dwindling savings which is below $100 now. And my current savings account will be my hobbies account but right now I am going to community college and I am taking one English class.

How much food can I get for $65 dollars that can feed me for 2-3 weeks breakfast and lunch only for now. I also have tech certs from CompTIA Security+ Network+ and A+ so I am wondering what jobs can I get with 5 months experience in the it and cybersecurity field respectfully I tried the air force but I have asthma and they won't let me join unless I take a pft test which is the last thing I want to do as I really need a good government job working in IT or infosec (cybersecurity)so I can get my TS clearance.

Second question would it be wise to rent a room or rent with a roommate if I do end up getting kicked out. I have a therapist who gives me ideas and is a life coach but I feel like i can't utilize him well due to the nature of my situation.

I also don't have a driver's license I drove a little bit but it's a been a while so I will need to practice when I can. But my main goal is to move from michigan to washington dc but I need some way to make more money than I am now as tried fiverr and it was too slow for me and I work on wednesdays and Fridays. if you have ways to make money online that have a flexible schedule let me know I am willing to learn it most likely.

I will come up with more questions later on but I need your help to get all this stuff figured out in 4 months before I get potentially kicked out. If you read this all the way your a g and I await to hear your advice.

Yeah that's the tldr of my situation it's a mess but so is life if you have more questions about my life just dm or ask in the comments and I will see what I can do. Or I will just tell you myself.",21Sep2020,1
255,"I feel stupid. 

My dream is to be an actress, and in my country that is really hard to achieve. Specially since we need this government permit/license to act professionally (you need a certificate from a 1-2 years government-approved course, OR a nice resume of acting work that you did in order to get it).

The thing is, I‚Äôm stuck in college, I can‚Äôt pursue acting right now (I‚Äôm currently finishing a degree that I hate, because my family is MAKING me pursue it. I literally have no choice but to continue, otherwise they would take everything away from me.) 

Next year I‚Äôll get my college degree, and I‚Äôll try my best to juggle that with the acting course that will get me my license. Both, at the same time. That‚Äôs because I really want to act once I‚Äôm free from what my family is making me do. It will be hard, but I don‚Äôt care. It‚Äôs all I want.

BUT... I have this friend (M), who recently has been doing some minor gigs (he has contacts, his friends work in the industry) that, I‚Äôm sure, will get him his license early. He is actually very talented, and I can see his career taking off very soon. We talked about his gig once and he said he would invite me for a part in it, which made me SO EXCITED, it would be really helpful to me... But he never did. Never mentioned it again. I don‚Äôt want to ask him about it anymore, because I don‚Äôt want to be that friend that is always asking for that kind of stuff. He probably doesn‚Äôt want me to participate in that gig, even though he admitted they were also looking for a girl and asked him to find someone. Maybe he thinks I suck or something. 

And as much as I‚Äôm proud of him, I‚Äôm being consumed by this envy... I can‚Äôt control it. I wish that was me, I want it so bad. It‚Äôs so frustrating that he is doing what I have been dreaming about ever since I was a little kid. There he is, living my dream right in front of me, everyday. 

And in order to do something about it myself, I‚Äôll have to wait for a whole year. It seems like a decade, honestly. How can I be more patient? My college takes away all my hope, time and energy... 

Also... How can I stop feeling like this? He‚Äôs a good friend and I love him as much as I love my other friends, I want to just be proud of him... But I keep having this urge to ask him to help my career with hsi contacts too, which doesn‚Äôt feel polite/correct (so I never ask). I keep thinking ‚Äúthat should be me, this isn‚Äôt fair‚Äù... Just like a child would. ):

Any tips to control ugly feelings like this? I feel hopeless, as if good things are never gonna happen to me. As if I‚Äôm bound to fail at pursuing my dreams. Please help...

I'm a 22-year-old guy, I live with my mom and my grandma, small house, bad neighborhood. been here since I was in elementary school. I was a loser in my school days, not like a nerd but I wasn't popular so I got mistaken for a nerd. had a group of friends that stayed with me after high school.  
truth is...I've been living my life on autopilot up to 21 (last year).  i don't have any career goals. nothing I want to be in or take interest in doing that's productive. I have just been floating in the wind. I had jobs, 3 to count but due to recent coronavirus events, I got laid off, been 7 months without a job. I've had 2 relationships and it was with woman a lot older than me. I was unprepared and far inexperienced for that mental battle. i was dating, hanging out with friends, and just living in the moment but i never took the time to figure out myself. I usually tried to figure myself out through others...this is hard to type but I need to express this. I got out of that hell of a relationship and started to journey down the path of ""Self-improvement.""  
i cast away all my friends and fake friends at that (only had a hand full) I wanted to take the time to figure myself out, to learn how my brain works and who I am.  
I've tried to self improve, I tried to eat healthily. I'm overweight, obese, I have so many bad habits it's taking a toll on my health, I get a surge of motivation and try to eat healthy for a couple of days, I try to work out for a couple of days, on and off on and off repeat... I find myself downloading the games I just uninstalled I find myself ordering food with money I cant afford to spend. I find myself taking 1 step forward and 2 steps backward's. and it destroys me because I know what I want to do, I know my faults and I truly want to just snap a finger and fix them but it's like...I'm stuck in a maze...  
so yeah.. everything's ok but it's not really ok. I can afford to survive thanks to the government and my mom but that won't last forever. I don't even have my driver's license. I'm numbing my pain on these video games, porn, and tv. I manage to quit smoking weed and cigarettes somehow... I feel tormented every day just by knowing I didn't do a damn thing I wanted to do the day before. I'm losing my mind and now I just discovered I have really bad social anxiety due to my insecurities... It is messed up because I know why, I know why I feel like this, I want to change, but it's like where do I start? what is the right step?  now my ex'es are starting to call me back (i know right) and all I can do is just stare at the phone ring until it goes silent. i have not changed anything. this whole time I've been a snowball gaining bad habits of momentum.  
I decided to become an introvert on purpose to figure myself out more and I found so many errors in me that I don't know what to fix first. I want to move out and be on my own. I can at least cook for myself I taught myself how. I feel so cramped in this little box, I love my mom so much but it's hard to even have privacy when she eavesdrops on every sound that comes out of my room. life hit me like a truck and i can't ignore it anymore. I want to fix myself, I want to be so much better. I'm slowly losing my sanity, hell I can't even count the days anymore, 3 days feel like a week, and 2 weeks is really 4 days in this box of a room...sorry for the long post... but I need help. thank you...",21Sep2020,1
260,"  Posting this on r/advice, r/dating_advice and r/askreddit. 
  My bf and I (no specific age because we‚Äôre minors), have been in a relationship for about 8 months now. We‚Äôve had big plans for the future, and we both think about our future home with our gaming basement and my bf‚Äôs recording studio, which is super surprising considering our age. 
  
  For some background information, he dmed me on discord in September about a girl he liked, we didn‚Äôt talk a lot before and he needed advice. He didn‚Äôt have anyone close he could talk to, and i seemed open enough to be approachable. We took to each other naturally and I was essentially his wingwoman until January rolled around. Throughout those months we stayed up until the wee hours of the mornings just talking. The first night we spent together lasted until 5am on a school night. We talked every single night, and it took a while for him to get comfortable. We‚Äôve both had shitty pasts, but his developed more trust issues for himself, but for some reason I was the only one to be able to get through to him. A quote from his ex, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre his soft spot.‚Äù Even his crush that the friendship formed around, wasn‚Äôt in the same boat as I was, I was the only one who knew what this guy was thinking. Around december I realized I was in love with him, this was the first relationship i‚Äôve ever felt so connected to. We were so in sync before, that it got to the point where we‚Äôd know what the other was thinking, and we‚Äôd both look at each other and laugh because we both just *knew*.  I‚Äôve always seen him as attractive, and He‚Äôs always seen me as attractive too. All in all, it feels like a perfect relationship. 
  
  However, after a confession from me, and us getting together In january a couple days before my birthday, then about a month rolled by. (The girl he liked previously is out of the picture, as he realized he didn‚Äôt like her.) After this month, he started saying things like, ‚ÄúMy body isn‚Äôt important to you, you could easily date a girl instead.‚Äù Previously I identified as bisexual, because I assumed I liked girls and didn‚Äôt think of it as a big deal. I dated an internet friend, which I deeply regret because I could tell I didn‚Äôt actually like her that way, but I still played the part I guess. Throughout the months of me thinking I was bi, I talked about liking girls which I also deeply regret. I‚Äôm a strong believer of LGBTQ rights, but I know that I am not bisexual, I was confused. I broke up with her a few months before meeting my bf. Throughout our friendship with my bf, I talked about How i missed my ex-gf, because I was simply missing the comfort of having someone close like that. I was romanticizing something that I wasn‚Äôt into. And so my current boyfriend thinks that I only like women, or that I am actually bisexual, which neither is correct. I love him with all my heart and my heart breaks every time he thinks I don‚Äôt want to touch him because he‚Äôs a boy, or that I would be happier with a girl, and that him being a boy isn‚Äôt special. He wants his body to be validated, which is normal, and what i‚Äôm trying to do. I‚Äôve noticed and told him about his self destructive tendencies, and he knows he doesn‚Äôt love himself or respect himself. He thinks a lot and comes to the conclusion that I don‚Äôt want his body, which is sad and makes me upset. When we hang out, which we try to do every weekend, I hug him, kiss him, and cuddle him and be lovey dovey. But it never seems like enough, because no matter what I do, he doesn‚Äôt accept that he matters, that he‚Äôs handsome and a good person, funny and talented. What do I do, because it‚Äôs gotten to the point of him saying he can‚Äôt do this anymore, and that he feels unwanted in this relationship. I still love him deeply, and I think he loves me too, but how can we get through this together? I really think our relationship can be amazing, we just need to get past this hurtle. I‚Äôm also aware that his self esteem is his issue, and that ultimately, he‚Äôs the only one who can solve it, but I want to do everything I can to be supportive. He doesn‚Äôt know what to do, and I don‚Äôt know what to do either. 

I know that this self esteem issue runs deeper than our relationship, because he‚Äôs always struggled with this. From friendships, to relationships, to daily activities such as him participating in track or trying to write stories. 

Things We Have Tried Already
-Him repeating validating sentences, such as ‚ÄúI am the one who knocks!‚Äù (He loves Breaking Bad, and in addition, is charismatic and would make an excellent voice actor.) I‚Äôm currently encouraging him to continue doing this, but he feels insecure about doing it.) 
-We always talk about him feeling this way, but he feels hopeless as no matter how much we talk about it , ‚Äúnothing gets fixed.‚Äù I encourage us to continue talking though, as that‚Äôs our only hope I suppose.
-I also encouraged him to read self help articles, but once again he feels embarrassed about that too.
-I‚Äôve stepped up my game in giving him physical affection, which i‚Äôm happy about, but eh still feels this way.

269,"I've browsed Reddit anonymously for a long time, but I made an account specifically so I can post this story &amp; made get some help. Please excuse any spelling/grammar mistakes, I'm an idiot who also types too fast-

For context: My mother is 55 years old &amp; bipolar, my father is 65 years old, with a whole list of different mental disabilities &amp; breathing problems, &amp; I am 22F, with bipolar, ADHD &amp; some minor anxiety issues. Specifically I struggle with being social, especially with strangers or doing important things, &amp; I'm not as mentally mature as people my age so I can't deal with stressful situations like a normal person(I guess that's why I'm here for advice in the first place). I still live under my parent's roof, as I don't make enough money working part-time to find a place of my own(plus COVID is a thing).

It all starts about 2 months ago, when a distant family member's(on my mother's side) wife died. I didn't know this family member at all, but he the ceremony at my grandfather's funeral. For that reason, my mother really wanted to be there for her family member. This required her to travel out of state, which she &amp; my father ended up doing. They were gone only for about 2 days, but when they came back, my father had ticks(still don't understand how he got ticks yet my mother didn't :/). The took a trip to a local doctor, got an anti-tick cream &amp; that was the last I had heard of this. As far as I was concerned the ticks had been taken care of.

Jump then to the beginning of this month. I remember being in my room, hearing my dad walking into the bathroom &amp; starting running the bathtub. No big deal, right? Old man is probably just wants to clean up. That's what I thought, till I start hearing him yell my name. Naturally, I got up, &amp; the second I take one step out of my room, I step into something wet. I look down &amp; their is BLOOD EVERYWHERE. 

FREAKING. EVERYWHERE. IT LOOKED LIKE A MURDER SCENE.

My dad is holding his leg in the bathtub with water running over it, trying to clean the blood off the floor around him &amp; on him with toilet paper. Turns out, my dad had been picking at the scabs that the ticks had made, &amp; digging into his wound because he thought he still had those ticks. And he had been doing that for TWO MONTHS. I start flipping the fuck out, because OF COURSE I WOULD. My dad was literally BLEEDING TO DEATH right in front of me. So, the first thing I think to do is, rush to wake up my mother &amp; have her call 911 while I help dad keep his wound closed.

Ya'll, for real, I ran into her room yelling ""GET UP. GET UP. CALL 911. DAD IS BLEEDING ALL OVER THE FKING PLACE."" &amp; you know what she did? *She went back to sleep.* I had to run back in there asking how long the ambulance was gonna be, only to she her with her blanket pulled up over her head, fully trying to go back to sleep. Like, da fuck? I'm still not over this. How does your child running into your room screaming your husband is bleeding to death make for a good bedtime story? Thankfully, I did actually get her outta bed the second time &amp; we called for an ambulance, which came &amp; took dad to the hospital.

I only learned about my dad digging the non-existent ticks out of his wounds over the past two months, from listening to him &amp; my mother speak to the EMTs that arrived to take him. Apparently, my mother knew he was doing that too, &amp; she kept trying to tell him to stop, or that if he really thinks he still has ticks, then they should go to the doctor/hospital, because at that point those ticks would have been nesting &amp; laying eggs, but he kept refusing. Saying he'll get them out on his own. Which led to him opening his wound so much that it didn't stop bleeding that day(&amp; it was infected may I add). He ended up needing surgery to close to wound, as well as remove the infected skin &amp; muscle.

Here is where the less-bloody weirdness starts. Since going to the hospital, dad has had seemingly endless problems with the staff there &amp; claims they've been mistreating him. Some of the things I can remember off the top of my head are: Not giving dad a bath(was still covered in his own blood 3 days later), not letting him have his personal belongings with him(which apparently includes clothes), not getting him outta bed(enough so that bed sores formed on his lower back &amp; rear), putting him on a psych-patient hold despite him not being suicidal or homicidal, &amp; trying to ship him away to a psych-ward that is over 100 miles away from home.

While I'm not going to deny that most of these things are abusive, my mother's treatment of my father, &amp; the hospital staff has not help our case to bring him home. The day he was brought to the hospital, all my mother did was laugh &amp; taunt him, while he yelled at her. I wasn't there, so I didn't know what was said, but I know my parents when they fight, so there must have been plenty of nasty name-calling &amp; promises to beat the hell outta each other. This alone was out of line, since there's no need to be throwing 'I told you so's at a man bleeding to death in a hospital. She also shared with the staff my father's history of mental problems, &amp; recommended they get him someone to talk too. I think this is what lead to the psych-patient hold &amp; later on trying to move him to that far away psych-ward. From then onward, everytime she goes to the hospital, she's been screaming &amp; yelling her head off at him for their mistreatment of dad. Not a single day went by, that when she came back from visiting him, she was in a rage from being pissed off at the staff. She's been so angry &amp; so stressed, that she hasn't been sleeping, everything she eats she throws up, sometimes she'll just throw up nothing but straight spit &amp; water, &amp; every now-&amp;-then she tells me she can't feel on of her arms. Like she's having a heart attack or stroke.

I, in all of this, have not been able to do much. I've pretty much been on the sidelines, waiting for the day dad is able to come home. I haven't even been able to visit my dad, I want to &amp; made plans too on Monday, but was told on to come by my mother, cause she said 'I don't know how long I'll be there &amp; you have work at 7'. When mom started telling me about her condition, I told her she needs to see a doctor, but she told me 'Fuck that. All doctors are bullshitters who want your money'. Obviously a result of the hospital's treatment of dad. I want to be able to do more, but now, I don't have any power to do anything, I can't even help my mom cause I can't magically make her better, &amp; calling 911 for her won't work since she can refuse medical aid. It's become such a clusterfuck, the only good thing to come out of this is, my dad's health is actually alright now. He's feeling better, &amp; moving &amp; walking alright(after enough of my mother's bitching, the staff has been getting him outta bed to get him to walk now).

After all this drama, we fast forward to today. 3 days ago, my father was put in an 'no-visit' hold. I can bet it's mostly because the hospital staff don't want my mother coming around anymore then anything. She's tried calling me dad, but that doesn't work either. She asked me to try calling, I refused at first, cause phone calls are one of those things that make my anxiety flare, but I did end up doing it a few times, but I didn't have any luck either. The phone just rings &amp; rings &amp; rings, until the phone stops ringing, but the call keeps going. My mother thinks that this is someone picking up the phone, but then not saying anything to make her hang up. I don't know about that, but it is weird that the phone stops ringing. So we basically have no contact with my father, either he doesn't want to talk to us, or the hospital staff is keeping him from talking too us. I have no idea which one.

My mother has also spun into full melt down mode. So much so, that my elder brother(27) felt inclined to come over from his fathers(we have different dads) to stay with us &amp; try to help us out(he's been driving me to &amp; from work since I have no licence). He's been here for over a week, &amp; at first, my mother was singing his praises, on how he 'really stepped up for us'. She even gave him a key to our house &amp; the spare key to her truck, which he repeatedly asked, 'are you sure this is okay'? I actually liked having him over too, since I don't get to see him much, not to mention he is a better driver then my mother &amp; father are. Remember all this, cause it will be relevant soon.

Just the otherday I was begging her to forget about dad for a little while &amp; please see a doctor. She told me no, &amp; that if I tried to call 911 to help her, she was gonna get in her truck, drive out into the middle of nowhere &amp; just wait to die. All the while she's telling me to call the hospital &amp; try talking to dad(which I already did with no success). I ended up giving up the argument &amp; taking her keys to keep her from possibly fulfilling her threat(I take suicidal threats very seriously since I have been suicidal myself in the past). This turned into a whole new screaming match, of her screaming at me to 'GET ME BACK MY KEYS', along with her getting literal nose-touching close to my face. She tried pushing past me, using her body to push me to the ground, I didn't move from where I was, but ended up putting my arms around her &amp; throwing her away from me.(i'm really skinny &amp; she could have pushed me over if I let her keep trying, so I kind felt I had too). All of this happening only hours after my brother left for work too, so I had no backup &amp; had to deal with the front of this all myself. She followed up with some nice threats of leaving &amp; never coming back. I asked her if she'd really leave me here alone with the two cats, &amp; she responded with 'Oh, you won't be alone, you'll have your dad, if you can ever get him out of the fucking hospital'. So basically, yes, she's ready to abandonment me, her useless excuse of a daughter. I probably spent the rest of the day crying my eyes out, &amp; feeling worthless. I know it's not my fault that I can't get dad to answer his room phone, because that's all mom wants, though I also know that if he somehow did answer, that it's in no way going to cure this situation. That was the climax of yesterday, now for today.

I slept though most of the day today, probably because all the crying from yesterday drained the shit outta me. I woke up at around 3-4pm, to my mom opening my bedroom door. She asked if I was okay. I mumbled out a half-assed 'yes', which was a total lie, I was still feeling like utter trash. But seeing her ask me if I was okay did make me feel slightly better, like maybe she had calmed down.

I was so wrong.

While I was asleep, my brother had apparently invited a friend over &amp; they had spent the day smoking or vaping(I don't know if there is a difference or not so :P). I didn't think this was a big deal, since my mom smokes weed herself to help her deal with her back pain. I guess at some point, my brother &amp; his friend went out of my mom's truck, I don't know what they were doing in there, but whatever it was, my mom caught them &amp; completely flipped shit on them. She yelled at him, told him to get the fuck outta her house, &amp; give her back her keys. Literally two days after she gave him that key, she wanted it back. She was pissed at him about everything he did. How he eats all our food(he's always eaten a lot so she knows he's like that), how he smokes(even though she does too?), how he invites his friends over to party(they're not partying, just sitting around smoking And if you don't want them here then say something?), how he drives her truck around while he's high(?), just really made at everything he does. Not just that, but she didn't even drive him home either, she took off in her truck, driving around who-knows-where &amp; made him WALK home. She just pulled a full 180 on him, backhanded him across the face, &amp; then left him out in the cold without a care.

While he was walking home, she was also spam texting me while she was out wherever, enough to the point where I had to block her phone since she wasn't even listening to me, just sending me bullshit threats &amp; repeating the same things to me. Repeatedly telling me to call the hospital dad is at, even though I've told her already, no one answers for me either, &amp; threatening to never come home like putting me in turmoil will somehow make them answer? She vented to me that she had enough of all the bullshit, that's she's at her breaking point &amp; she can't deal with this anymore, but then when I bring up 'that's why i keep saying you need to chill out &amp; not think about dad, but think about yourself', she goes right back to telling me that I need to call the hospital.

Which leads to now. Mom came back home, she probably realized that someone with her level of back problems can't stand a single night sleeping in a truck. First thing she did was start chewing out everything wrong my brother does to me, honestly, I was half expecting for her to tell me to get the fuck out too, but that didn't come about. Since that happening, I've been here typing, in that time, she's done more yelling, banging on things, pretty sure she threw something too. A one point she started playing music, &amp; singing really loudly, it was fucking creepy as fuck, I was half expecting her to come into my room &amp; try killing me with how fucking crazy she was being. It's quiet now at least, I don't know if she's asleep or what, but I'm too scared to leave &amp; check.

I really don't know what to do. I'm freaked out to my core, I feel like I'm eight years old again, &amp; can't do anything while I watch my parents self-destruct, while one of them is taking their anger out on me. I don't have any family that can take me in, as my brother lives with his father &amp; that guy hates me, my one uncle works two jobs &amp; has two dogs so he doesn't have the time or space for a worthless kid like me, my other uncle is kind of an asshole so that's outta the question, my sister is completely checked out of this family not to mention has a baby of her own to take care of. Friends aren't an option either since they are all online &amp; live whole other states or countries away. The only people I've really had in my court about all this is my brother, who just got sent away, &amp; my boyfriend, who has been a kind &amp; caring ear hole for me to vent to, but he lives in England so he can't do much more then just listen &amp; maybe give some advice.

So Reddit. Here is my clusterfuck of a situation. I'm sorry, I know this is all over the place, but given what just happened, I'm still kinda freaking out &amp; can't think on how to say this all properly, I just NEED to get it out. If you have any advice, please share. I'm at my ropes end, &amp; I'm scared of what tomorrow will be like. I am scared of what will happen when my dad comes home. I don't want to be here anymore, but I have no where to go. What do I do? What do I do about my mom? About my dad? Just anything... I need help.",21Sep2020,1

276,"[NSFW, Trigger Warning I guess for sexual abuse/trauma]

Okay, so I was just hanging about my house this weekend when a memory from when I was young, about 8-9 years old, just popped up in my brain and I haven‚Äôt been able to stop thinking about it. 

I remembered being at some sort of party or BBQ at my aunts one spring. I spent most of the day playing and whatnot with my cousins. It was later in during the party when me and younger cousin, about [F5] at the time, we‚Äôre alone under the stairs. I‚Äôve always had uneasy feelings about her, she‚Äôs always been ‚Äúperverted‚Äù you could say since a young age. Even now that she‚Äôs in middle school, has been caught sexting with older men. I‚Äôve always felt bad for her since it‚Äôs most likely my aunts fault for neglecting her, but even so I‚Äôve always tried to kept my distance from her.

Anyway, we‚Äôre there under the stairs and she places her hand on the crotch and very slightly rubs me while looking up at me. I remember it so vividly it makes me want to cry: the mixture of pure shock, terror, but yet some pleasure still haunts me. I move her hand away quite quickly and told her either ‚ÄúNo, we can‚Äôt do that.‚Äù or ‚ÄúNo, that‚Äôs not okay.‚Äù I just sat there for what felt like minutes but was actually seconds as she tired to rationalize it somehow (saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay‚Äù or something I can‚Äôt quite remember). And I was just so confused and scared about what I was feeling, I- I knew it was wrong but I had never been touched that way before and it really fucking pains me to admit it but a little part of me liked it. And I know, I know it was just because of the stimulation I‚Äôd never felt before and DEFINITELY NOT because I was attracted to her in anyway. 

I also have another memory but I‚Äôm not sure if it was that same party or another (most likely another party after the first one though). So, we were they‚Äôre under the stairs again just having coming inside from playing so I didn‚Äôt have my guard up. She leads me to the room saying she wants to show me something and innocently I followed thinking it was going to be a toy or something. We go up the stairs and enter what I think was my aunts room at the time. I‚Äôm still in a trance-like state from playing when she leads me to the bed. At first, I think we're gonna have a pillow fight or something (which makes me scoff thinking about it) when she makes me lay down beside her. I forgot exactly why happened, but she started complimenting me and then ran her hand across my bare leg up to my crotch and leaned in to try to kiss me. And I just really didn't know what to do, I got scared and pushed her away and made up an excuse to go downstairs. 

I've avoided this cousin my whole life now after this, and I'm not sure if she even remembers it, but sometimes on the occasion I do see her she‚Äôll give me random compliments. I really don't know what to do with this information. I can't stop thinking about how it most likely affected me. Ever since those incidents I've been overly sexually you could say I guess, I don‚Äôt know how to put it. Like I've wanted to feel that feeling again so I started touching myself very young and made my barbies have ‚Äùsex‚Äù with each other. I even had a slight porn addiction last year. I don‚Äôt know if it was because of those incidents or just an effect of growing up and ‚Äùdiscovering yourself.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know, I don‚Äôt know man.

I did tell my mom about it like a week after it happened but all she told me was that my cousin was young and didn't know what she was doing, but it always seemed like she did. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do with this now, I- I'm just kinda numb to the whole situation, maybe I'm in shock or something, I really don't know. 

Any advice on anything (how to proceed from here) would be helpful.

279,"This may not be the right subreddit to post this too but im not sure if there's a subreddit for these types of problems. Its currently 2am and me and my brother started smelling a strange smell throughout the house, like a burning hairdryer, But I know its not that. 

We've checked all the vents and things that could possibly be burning and nothing was creating the smell. My brother checked outside, the garage, under the house, ect. And found nothing.

We don't use gas in our house so it shouldn't be that. I also want to mention I smelled something weird a few hours ago aswell but it wasn't a burning smell, its hard to describe.  The smell is gone now and I'm very concerned. You could especially smell it in my room.

280,"(Obligatory I'm on mobile)

  So I'm 14, moving into 15 soon, with great grades and I've always been considered mature and high achieving academically. I only say that because I want to show that I'm capable of making my own decisions, and more importantly, the right ones. This however, has always been breaking me.

  When I was 5 my parents got divorced. Dad was an abusive, narcissistic, dry drunk asshole to my Mom, who showed his true colors after they got married. After kicking my Mom out, Dad was suddenly my brother's (6 years older than me) and my ""perfect parent."" Everything we wanted we got. Fun days at the park? You got it. Snacks we wanted after school? Check. To see Mom? ... Nada. See, we didn't know it, but she was living in her car, barely scraping by. Property was nearly impossible to get because Dad was just friends with everyone in our small area and had everyone (including parts of Mom's own family) that he was the victim, so nobody would help her. Eventually, she ended up renting a place about a year and a half later,  and she was able to get an official divorce, and a chance to argue for custody over us. While normally the mother is favored in my state when it comes to custody, dad fought and fought for it to be equal. Of course, when we were asked what we wanted, we preferred dad because we were impressional kids that couldn't see the real him. So we were in his favor, along with most other people that were in the court. Even custody it was.

  We got it worked out after a few years that every Monday after school, we would ride the bus to the other parent's house. Custody is really complicated with specific holidays and all, but details don't matter right now. Dad started being more and more of, well himself, to my brother. Never listening to him, taking his anger out on him, etc. Etc. Etc. They never got along, and it didn't help that neither can hold a temper particularly well. However, I was still too young to see beyond what I was being told for the most part. But dad was violating the custody agreement and divorce decree left and right. Constantly. He would always play games, blaming everything on mom, saying how he was sorry we have to ""deal"" with mom, whatever. On top of never paying child support, and fighting tooth and nail to be as controlling over everyone as he could be, it was just so much. 

  After my bro and I got counseling and stuff (I was about 11 at this point) my bro had had enough. Through so much pressure and countless arguments he got Dad to agree to only get custody of him on weekends. He was of the age that he was considered to be able to make decisions like that for himself of he wanted to separate from a parent, and he did. A little while after that, he stopped going to see dad. Then it was my turn to deal with him. Everything was fine for a while with him, but without my bro to take most of the attention, I started having issues with him like my bro did. It got bad around 13.

  Dad accused Mom of ""brainwashing"" my bro into believing he was the bad guy constantly, more so recently. He's always wanted to go through my phone and my texts with family (constantly had to change my password, no matter how much he insisted that I had no reason to) and stuff like that. He's tried to control every aspect of my life, from my friends and family to school field trips, and, especially recently, been accusing me of giving into Mom's ""tricks and lies"" despite me being ""the smart one.""

Let me paint you a picture. It's the day before Father's Day, and I'm at Mom's with the family we have over to celebrate the day since I won't be there on actual Father's Day because I'll be with my Dad. About 13 other family members changed schedules to align with my rotation with him so I couldbe involved too. And he still shows up on the driveway because we didn't show up where we usually meet for me to swap houses when school is out, despite us supposed to be meeting the next day on actual Father's Day. He's not allowed on our property, and he knows that well. But he does stay in the car, I'll give him that much. However, he calls the sheriff's dept. to sort this out, despite this being a civil issue, not criminal, so technically there's very little he could do anyway. I'm called out and asked where I'd like to be, Mom's I say, and then dad yells that I won't tell the truth when I'm with mom, so I should come to him to talk about this. He goes on a tirade worthy of fascism about how Mom is always pulling stunts and forcing our hands. (Luckily it was all recorded for use in court :P .) But that's just an example of what happens constantly.

  I'm happy with Mom. It's healthy, it's loving, I love it there. We're financially secured and she's married to a good guy, it's awesome. But I get panic attacks that nobody knows about. I'm constantly stressed, I'm so nervous and anxious to be free. Panic attacks are becoming more and more frequent, along with times dad is making my life and my time over there as stressful and painful as possible. I want a way out so badly. Removing him from my life entirely would be preferable. But the problem is, as great as she is, Mom isn't going to do anything soon enough unless I push her and/or do something to break my relationship with dad, which I could have done several times by now, but I don't want to hurt him. I can't do something like that to him. He's already lost a son to him deserting, but dad doesn't see himself as the reason why he left. If I leave too, I'll break him. I want to leave, but I love the dickhead somehow through all the lies he's fed to me since I was 5.

281,"Hey friends!

(M21)
My best friend is turning 22 on 10/29, and his girlfriend and I are planning a surprise birthday party on Halloween. (He‚Äôs also my roommate.) 

He knows we are hosting a Halloween party at our house, but he has no idea that it‚Äôs actually a birthday party. We have the party all planned out, decorations, music, activities, guests, everything. Now I just need to keep him out of the house while everything is set up and prepared. 

I need to plan fun activities for me and him to do, that will keep us occupied and out of the house for 3-4 hours. Any ideas for a fun, busy, distracting day for 2 guys? 

I‚Äôve got a short budget, as I‚Äôve been getting reduced salary due to the current COVID-19 pandemic. It doesn‚Äôt have to be free, but I can‚Äôt afford a lot.

282,"I‚Äôll be honest and say this is a character in my fanfiction.

I‚Äôve primarily only put struggles that I personally have dealt with or the people close to me have dealt with where I have an understanding of the illness. Luckily I don‚Äôt know anyone struggling with an ED but I still want to give my side character one. There‚Äôs a purpose to it, and I want to give my characters a bit more depth.

So I gave him anorexia but I never say it directly. It‚Äôs sort of hidden in between the lines. Would it be realistic that he also got cravings while he was high and ate junk food because of it?

My brain would like to ""chew it"" but I know that isn't even possible. Whenever I notice it on my hand all I can think about is swallowing it.

284,"Hello,

I am a disabled vet. Life has been a rollercoaster for me since leaving the military. I‚Äôm on this emotional endeavor where I just can‚Äôt find my peace. Even alone, in the most quiet... my heart constantly pumps. I can remember when anxiety was healthy, and un-ruling of my life. The anxiety as driven me to points of severe instability in many aspects of my life. I can get so paranoid to the point where I am receiving auditory and visual hallucinations. How in the world did I find myself in this situation? I don‚Äôt like to say I‚Äôm broken at all. I‚Äôm sure there are men and women who‚Äôve actually been to hell and back on the front lines, so I discredit the traumatic events I saw and experienced myself. I‚Äôve worked with the VA many many occasions. I continue to use them since I have received my 100% disability. At one point I neglected to get healthcare, since it‚Äôs so expensive here in the US. Now that I‚Äôve had access, I‚Äôve been pretty adamant to ‚Äúget myself right‚Äù. This has to be the toughest thing I‚Äôve ever had to do. I‚Äôm 26, I‚Äôm extremely terrified of being by myself (autophobia), my anxiety prevents me from social gatherings... going to the store.. leaving the house. My dreams are full of terror, and repeated memories. I‚Äôve already been homeless, I moved 6 times in one year. Nothing in my history says ‚Äústable‚Äù. I‚Äôve been on the VA cocktails only to say that most medications only make me sick to my stomach or drive me into a more crazy catatonic state. I am greeted by anxiety the moment I wake to the moment I need to sleep. I spend all my time and money on reducing the stress that‚Äôs constantly and consistently there. 
It‚Äôs ruling my life. I can‚Äôt find peace. I feel so alone and afraid.

287,"So my bf (21) and I (20F) went on a electric skateboard and bike ride. I tried the electric board for my first time ever and was doing pretty well, he wanted to race me on the bike and we raced to a stop sign in our underdeveloped neighborhood. 

Basically I didn‚Äôt know how to stop and reached out to him and he reached out to me, the board slowed down but my body kept going and he says I ‚Äúthrew myself off the board‚Äù. His first response? ‚ÄúWhy would you do that?‚Äù 

Now I was in pain, but I immediately turned my pain from physical to emotional, I am about to get my period so maybe I‚Äôm just being emotional but who asks that right away? He told me it was my fault because I threw myself off the board and I said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre such an asshole, you‚Äôre not even worried about if I‚Äôm ok?‚Äù To which he said ‚ÄúI am! I‚Äôm upset because you got hurt and this could‚Äôve been avoided‚Äù 

Like I said this was my first time and he didn‚Äôt teach me how to stop or properly get off the board, I‚Äôm NOT blaming him, I can get hurt and this‚Äôll be a learning experience and I‚Äôll move on and laugh about it, but what I DO mind is when you question me when I‚Äôm HURT instead of being genuinely concerned. 

He tried to make up for it by cleaning my wound and asking if I sprained anything, but I‚Äôm really really hurt over this, to the point I almost cried and usually I‚Äôd be more angry than hurt, but again my period. 


TLDR: I fell off a electric board and it was my first time ever, my bf first response was ‚Äúwhy would you do that‚Äù (‚Äúthrow myself off the board‚Äù)  instead of ‚Äúare you ok‚Äù. How should I feel about this?",21Sep2020,1

289,"Ok I'm currently an exchange student living under a host family with my friend and since my host parents are really strict and are not really relatable in any way I kinda stick with my roommate whom I've not made friends with but enjoy his company. At least he is someone to talk with. I don't have any friends of similar age that I can meet frequently in town or are friend with and so he really is my only option. He also wakes me up in the morning which is neat.
However, due to circumstances he's going to leave to another town within weeks. Which means I'll have no one to talk with, no one to share the chores with and I'll be lonely. Also it feels very weird to have an empty bed in the same room. Now I have to worry about having more chores and waking up.
He's probably one of the few people that I'll miss in my life. How do I go through this? How do I wake myself up?

- we are willing to pack food, camp, drive long days, whatever it takes if that‚Äôs safer

If anything, I started this job a few weeks before our lockdown started (lockdown started at the end of March). I also can't post this on the reddit page too because I need more than 10 karma. 

Ever since the lockdown, I have never felt the same. My emotions are just out of control. I feel useless. I feel suicidal and I just don't want to even work anymore.

294,"I don‚Äôt want to break up with my current boyfriend, but I feel like I‚Äôm wasting my time. There are certain aspects of his behavior that I can‚Äôt deal with and I think it‚Äôs a toxic relationship. I also want to say that it seems like we almost break up every week. 

I have dated this guy for three months now and I already see signs that I can‚Äôt marry this. I don‚Äôt necessarily date to marry, I date to see the potential. When we first met, he was sweet and kind. We were kind of similar and he was just enjoyable to be around. However, all of this was a rouse to get into my pants. The true colors came about after a month or so. About 50% of the time, he is mean, degrading, toxic and just emotionally abusive. The other 50%, he fine and fun to be around. 

These are the list of things that have led me to wanting to break up with him: 1. He‚Äôs always comparing me to his exes. He states that I‚Äôm immature and needs someone more mature like them. Or I‚Äôm unpredictable and every time we have an argument, thinks I‚Äôm going to do something crazy like throw something at his house because past girls have (though emotionally, I have problems and can be a cry baby, I would never do anything that would cause me to get arrested.) When he does this, it feels like a jab at me. 

2. He‚Äôs older than me and consistently attacks me for graduating from college, but not doing anything for the last few months. Though he‚Äôs never even gone to college and has only worked at minimum wage jobs and is poor.

3. He seems to have no future and drags me down. I‚Äôm taking a break from further schooling after getting my bachelors, but I plan to pursue further education to have a stable career like being a doctor or lawyer. He has no further goals in life except to fish. I feel for that reason, he will be like leech.

4. He is the type to use me for financial stability. I already pay for a lot of things in our relationship. I give him gas money, I pay for the hotels we stay in, our food etc. The only times, he has paid for my food is when I have gotten hotels when we‚Äôve gone to the beach and in situations where I have forgotten my wallet. I think that I‚Äôve paid for more meals for him than me. In fact, he often asks me to pay for his meals. Except for my birthday, I pay for 90% of the things we do together or he won‚Äôt go, such as movie tickets, renting movies, carnival games etc. We always have to either 50/50 or I pay for everything. He does not offer to pay for anything except for when we go on vacation and have already agreed on me paying for rooms and him paying for food. I dated a guy overseas in the past and my ex paid for everything. I even offered to pay for things, but he always took care of it. I don‚Äôt want to take care of someone else.

5. Every time we argue, he always talks about how he wishes that he was single and this is why he doesn‚Äôt do relationships. However, when things are good, he does want to be in a relationship. He acts as if I‚Äôm the only one that wants to be in a relationship and I‚Äôm forcing him to be in one, but unless some sort of abuse is involved; no one can force you to be in a relationship. I can have fights with ppl without wanting to end things, but it seems like he cannot. 

6. I can‚Äôt talk to him about my problems often. I used to be able to discuss the things that bother me with him and I do this often, so I understand that it can be exhausting for other ppl, but it‚Äôs gotten to the point that he doesn‚Äôt care. When I share how I feel, he says that he already has a lot to deal with and doesn‚Äôt care. Anytime, he has a hard time, I‚Äôm always there for him. 

7. He doesn‚Äôt appreciate the things I do for him. I often get him gifts and stuff. I go out and get things because I think of him. Whenever I give him gifts unless it‚Äôs something he really wants, he says he doesn‚Äôt care that I got them because he didn‚Äôt ask for it and doesn‚Äôt appreciate it. I‚Äôm no longer going to get him things because of this.

8. He is obsessed with fishing to the point that he ditched me to go. He ditched me to go fishing when I went with him to the beach. He goes to the beach every week. Two times, I have gotten a hotel for a few nights and gone with him. The last time I went, he informed he was going to go fishing with his buddies and would be gone all day, but would come back in the evening. I got upset because he was essentially going to ditch me to do something he does every week. I don‚Äôt go to the beach often, so I thought it was selfish that he was leaving me alone all day until the evening when we were on a small vacation especially since I spent hundreds of dollars on these rooms that he did not pitch in for at all. He said that I was being selfish and immature about this. 

9. He is overly jealous and does not want me to have guy friends which caused me to be attached to him since I have no female friends. I essentially cut off my guy friends to be with him. He says he doesn‚Äôt trust me with other dudes even though he‚Äôs the one with the cheating past in prior relationships. Again, even in this, he comparing me to people he dated prior. 

10. I have to ask him to sleep with me and he complains about my high sex drive. Before, he wanted to sleep with me, but it seems like now, I‚Äôm always the one that is asking to be intimate. We have great sex, but in terms of our drives, we aren‚Äôt the most compatible. However, this is the least annoying thing he does. 

11. I always ask to hang out and do things now. He never asks me if I want to do anything and it seems like we always do things that he wants to do with the exception of having sex. Early on, he used to call and ask me if I want to do things, but he doesn‚Äôt anymore.

12. I don‚Äôt see him as often as I‚Äôd like to. I really care about him and would like to see him nearly every day, but there are often times where he wants to be alone. I‚Äôm the type that needs a lot of attention and I don‚Äôt get as much as I want from him. 

There are things that I do like about him like our sex, play fighting, hanging out that doesn‚Äôt involve spending money, him having his own place, letting me spend the night etc. but I feel that this relationship has more cons than pros and it stresses me out. I understand that not everyone is perfect, but a lot of things I listed are deal breakers and I don‚Äôt see a future with this guy. I want to remain friends with him and have him there as a cuddle buddy, but I want to see other ppl and I can‚Äôt exclusively date him. I‚Äôm afraid of the pain of detaching myself and breaking up though. I don‚Äôt know what to do, but if I remain in this, I doubt things will change with him. I could never marry someone that I feel that I‚Äôm essentially taking care of, especially a grown man that is older than me.",21Sep2020,1
295,"A month ago I came across a photo I didn't feel comfortable looking at because of how young the woman looked. It wasn't of nudity but it was explicit. The post even had her name in it. The site linked with the image was dedicated to porn of teens. I looked that up on whois. The site the image is originally from was a website dedicated to fitness modeling. At the time I didn't know how to handle this situation I searched up the url using Duckduckgo and no info was provided in the description and on Google the site didn't pop up at all. I started freaky out so then I went to [https://whois.domaintools.com/](https://whois.domaintools.com/) to look up the site and all that popped up for the screenshot was a ""Legal Info"" Box in front of the screen. All the other images were censored with gray boxes. I did report the site but now I'm worried. (I didn't report the fitness modeling site only the porn site but I just assume that'll lead the authorities to the modeling site because the link was provided at the bottom of the photo. That's if the sites are illegal.)

I worry because what if the sites I reported were illegal and I searched it up in whois. What if I get reported for searching them up in the first place? I should've handled the situation a lot better but I did not want to click on the websites. I'm not sure if I made the right decisions.

But recently I've become kinda stressed over it. It isn't because I'm nervous about going to college, but it's because my original plan and backup plan are being almost dismissed I guess you could say? My best friend (of 7+ years) wants to go to college with me. And I'm totally fine with that. But she's been kind of pushing her plan onto me. I listened to her plan, but I feel that it isn't well thought out and more of a fantasy to put it bluntly. I've ran it through over an over for months and I haven't found a way that would work. She hasn't considered the cost of everything or what we have to do to make this plan work. Neither of us have the money to pay for college and neither do our families. Plus she wants to go to school in southern california where the price of living is really high (Plus she has never lived in the city). It would be one thing if she was trying to get scholarships but she hasnt even done that. I just worry that she's going to move to a place that is unfamiliar with little to no plan. And then be stuck struggling. And then she wants me to go along with it! I've tried telling her easier options like going to our community college where we would get 2 years for free, plus we could get a job, get an apartment if we wanted, and ease into being adults. But she didn't like that I brought up any other option and is stuck on what she wants to do. I feel at a loss.

304,"Next week University is starting and I'm an incoming freshman. Even though it's going to be all online and I'm going to have the comfort of my own home, for some reason I still feel this weird nervous sensation. 
I think part of it is because I'm an incoming computer science student and I have no experience at all with computer science in the past and the university I'm going to is fairly competitive with a strong computer science program so I think a part of me might just be insecure to have to compete against students who did all four years of computer science in high school versus me starting as the beginner.
But for some reason I'm also starting to feel nervous about other courses that I excelled in in high school such as calculus. Just opening up canvas and seeing my classes already in there is giving me this weird feeling. It's almost like a combination of anxiousness, scared and uncertainty. Maybe even sprinkle in some insecurity which is weird because despite my personal circumstances, I did well in high school. Why am I feeling nervous and scared?
What feeling is this and how do I overcome it?

TLDR: how do I overcome nervous jitters as an incoming college freshman in a competitive computer science program which I have no experience in.",21Sep2020,1
305,"(tw for self harm, suicide, and ed‚Äôs) this may sound super super dumb, because i am young. i‚Äôm a 14 year old girl and i started talking to a boy from australia around two months ago. (yes i am 100% sure he was real). i‚Äôll call him max. max and i talked everyday for about two months (except for when he had no service while he was at a camp. because i live in the us, the time zone difference was about 17 hours. we changed our sleep schedules to talk more, so us talking was a constant thing. we got very close and both knew about each other‚Äôs mental health issues. he had past issues with anorexia, which is how we met (i began to stop eating around the same time i started to talk to him) and he had gotten past his ed so he was trying to help me through it. we both have had experiences with self harm and suicidal thoughts. it was something that we became closer over, as we were both helping each other through it. it was very obvious that he cared about me and i had developed feelings for him. he then went to a camp through his school and had no service for a week. around the time he left, he had gotten super distant and conversations had gotten awkward, but i still had feelings. when he got back he was on the bus and he had snapped me. what he said was pretty simple (‚Äúi just had the best week of my life‚Äù). i had been super excited for him to come back so i could update him on my progress as i had managed to eat two meals in one day for the first time in months while he was gone and i had been clean for about a week or two. in the first snap he had sent me of him riding home on the bus, there was a girl sleeping on him. because we weren‚Äôt together or anything, i didn‚Äôt say anything, but in my head it was obvious we were kinda talking. when i told him about the progress i had made he only really said something simple like ‚Äúoh cool‚Äù so it was obvious he didn‚Äôt care. so i just moved on, because i didn‚Äôt want to annoy him. he kept snapping pictures of the girl, and it hurt my heart a little bit because that was about the same time that i realized i had fallen in love with him. he was on my mind constantly. and i might sound dumb saying i fell in my love at 14 but i had. and so eventually he made it home and we kept awkwardly talking for about 2-3 days. he posted a few pictures on instagram from the camp, and in nearly every one, he was holding the girl, or something of the sort with her. about a day after that, he texted me and was like ‚Äúwe need to talk‚Äù and with that sentence, it‚Äôs pretty obvious what‚Äôs going to happen, but i just asked what was up. he said that he thinks we should stop talking, and obviously i was respectful for that. i forgot to mention that this boy had saved my life so that was really all very hard on me. so i was going to thank him for doing so, and when i had sent it, the message didn‚Äôt go through, which really hurt my heart. and so it‚Äôs been a few weeks now and i‚Äôve cried over that boy daily (which i hate to admit) he‚Äôs the only thing that‚Äôs ever on my mind and i‚Äôm still in love with him and idk what to do.",21Sep2020,1

308,"I‚Äôm now 18. Both of us are female. She is however 3-4 years older than me.

Her family is very strict, aggressively religious, and blatantly homophobic, so the fact that any of this even happened is somewhat ironic. I‚Äôm also not sure if my cousin remembers this, but I suppose she probably wouldn‚Äôt mention it if she did.

I don‚Äôt want to get into the specifics of the ‚Äúgame‚Äù she came up with because I‚Äôm not here trying to bait pedos, but I was probably between the ages of 5-9 when this happened, so she would‚Äôve been 9-12. I believe it started when I was 5, maybe younger (??) and ended when I was 9. But long story short, we had to share a bed every time we visited each other‚Äôs families (6-7 times a year, sometimes more) and she came up with a game that involved a lot of inappropriate hand contact and movements, and I‚Äôll leave it at that, but she pretty much pressured me into it and told me not to tell anyone.

The things I know for sure is she knew at least vaguely what sex was by the time she was 9. She was aware of what she was doing being inappropriate, hence her making me promise to keep it a secret. But one day she stopped, because apparently her parents told her she‚Äôd go to hell if she felt any lust or watched porn etc, and I remember her freaking out about not wanting to go to hell and that was the end of that, much to my relief. But she also mentioned being attracted to her younger brothers and that‚Äôs what made her realize she needed to ‚Äústop having sinful thoughts and stuff‚Äù. That was the end of it and it was never mentioned again.

This however caused a lot of sexual dysfunction for me from an extremely young age. I have a lot of anger towards her and her family. Her for what she did to me and her family for how they‚Äôve basically turned all their children into little ‚Äúanti sin‚Äù robots, claiming they‚Äôre all perfect, when one of them literally fucking molested me when I was five.

At that age I didn‚Äôt know anything about sex or porn or anything. Her and my other cousins did know this stuff, and always used it against me in jokes, and she obviously took it further and used it against me for her own enjoyment. I‚Äôm angry about it for a lot of reasons frankly, but the biggest ones are how absolutely warped my perception of sexuality was, and the fact that I developed a genuine fear of women.. which makes life kinda hard, me being female myself, and the biggest one is I don‚Äôt know if my anger is VALID.

She was a child. I know. I also know that behavior like that can be caused by molestation or sexual trauma from other people when kids display that behavior. But I can‚Äôt stop being angry, and I can‚Äôt stop wanting to tell her how angry it makes me, how hypocritical she is, and how she ruined a good portion of my life.

I don‚Äôt know where to go from here. I‚Äôve been in therapy but I can‚Äôt bring myself to admit this to another human face to face. At the same time I want to tell my mom and dad, I want to confront my cousin, I want to scream to her parents that what she did to me means she‚Äôs not the perfect little angel they‚Äôre convinced she is.

Would bringing this up a decade later be a huge mistake? Do I even have the right to be angry at her, since she was so young?",21Sep2020,1
309,"This is a long read but if you want to hear screwed up, here it is. Dated her for 4 years was a bad relationship. She lied all the time. Would constantly block me after a couple of good weeks suddenly without explaination. Then ghost me and come back and be ‚Äúin love again‚Äù. It conditioned me to freak out every time she did it and call text chase her. I was dumb but I fell into this pattern of conditioning, it was torture.

We broke up a year and half ago. She dated someone else. We still stayed in contact but it was still the same screwy game, I just couldn‚Äôt let go.

Eventually her and that guy break up and she asks if she can stay with me for a bit before she gets her own place. I say yes, being the fool in love still. We move her in and things are great. Exciting we hook up.  Tell each other we love each other all the time etc. Both agree she should be single awhile but talk about maybe dating again.

After the first week the nightmare begins.

On my birthday she starts setting up her own bedroom in my spare room. This immediately makes me feel weird because we didn‚Äôt talk about that. It also makes me feel rejected in some way that after the romance she doesn‚Äôt want to sleep with me but take over another room. I told her that it made me feel weird. Which turned into an argument and I said she had to move out soon because this is already throwing me off because of my feelings for her.

The argument ended with her breaking a bunch of plates, calling the old guy asking to move back, in which he declined. Ruined my birthday, she obvs didn‚Äôt get me a gift.

The next day she‚Äôs flying back to our home town for a week. Things are fine. She comes back we are about to hook up and she says she can‚Äôt. Because she hooked up with someone and the condom broke and didn‚Äôt want to confuse things. We weren‚Äôt exclusive but that was just too much for me. 

I went down to play guitar out of my frustration. It was 11pm on a Saturday and we usually stay up late. She demanded I stopped and I said no it‚Äôs my house I want to play guitar for a bit. So she starts slamming doors over and over and screaming at the top of her lungs over and over again. I ask her to stop and she finally does.

20 mins later cops show up. Neighbor called because of her screams. Had to explain the situation and fortunately no one was arrested.

At this point I feel like such shit in my own house I can‚Äôt even sleep anymore. 

We try to be amicable and focus on having a connection still. I didn‚Äôt suddenly stop loving her after this even though I wish I could.

The next weekend she asks me to plan a date so I do. She ghosts me the ENTIRE weekend. I‚Äôm so mad because of the ghosting but also because I can‚Äôt do anything because if she randomly comes back I ya e to let her in the building.

I sent her a bunch of angry texts saying I‚Äôve had it and she‚Äôs got to move out. She comes home and apologized said she stayed with a girlfriend. Which the next day I found out was a lie because she left a journal open saying she met some guy that weekend and they are exclusive already. 

This gave me a legit anxiety attack, felt like I was going to have a heart attack which she calms me down and acts nice. Later that night she starts packing her luggage. I asked her if she‚Äôs leaving.

She says yes. I pry a bit more and she said some guy was supposed to give her 2k for nudes but he didn‚Äôt pay her so now she ‚Äòhas to go fuck guys for money‚Äô and goes on this psychotic rant about men. 

I assume this guy she‚Äôs seeing is paying her money some kind of sugar daddy thing because no one pays 2k for nudes.

A few days later she asks me for a loan because she can‚Äôt afford her apt move in cost as she just started a job (she has a good career). I was so stressed and wanted her out so I said yes but made her sign a promissory note. She said she was also going to get out of the relationship ship with this guy. 

I give her the loan (1500). Over the next week things seem alright but occasionally she‚Äôd just be fuckkng mean to me for no reason. Told me she didn‚Äôt want to talk, to leave her alone whenever I just said hey how‚Äôs it going etc.

She acts so mean to me one night that I did something to be a dick. I texted some guy she‚Äôs been also banging off and on for years she was talking to that she had herpes and was just going to use him also (this is actually true). I felt bad for doing that it was petty, she flipped out but obviously they smoothed it over.

Then the weekend before she moves out she ghosts me again to hang out with that guy. I‚Äôm so angry at this point I sent a bunch of angry texts and said get your shit in a few days I don‚Äôt care anymore.

So her new guy is a lawyer and threatens me. So I said fuck it get your things now. She BRINGS this dude to move her out. I asked her not to or bring anyone else but she still does it. I leave because I don‚Äôt want to be there for that. Whole situation sucked gave me a ton of anxiety.

After they finally finish she texts me because the dude wants to meet me because I told her that dude coming over was fucked up. I said no twice. Then he texted me from her number and I‚Äôm just like dude leave.

The next day she gets her last things alone she‚Äôs being super friendly. So I thought alright cool at least this can end without pure resentment.

The next day I‚Äôm blocked everywhere the day before she‚Äôs supposed to pay the loan back. I lose my shit because I know she‚Äôs not paying me back now. I texted her like 30 times from another number about the loan and she needs to pay me back or I‚Äôll go to small claims. So she tells me to fuck off a certain amount of times so she can claim I‚Äôm harassing her.

At this point I try to reach out a few more times and then I just say screw it you can keep it im tired.

She finally talks to me in the phone saying how grateful she is and she loves me and I‚Äôm a good person. But then tells me how the boyfriend was going to file lawsuits against my business and drain me in lawyer fees but she is going to talk him out of it.

Over the next day I lose my shit try texting her a million times from different numbers because I was seriously freaked out about this dude filing lawsuits against my business. I just wanted her to give me closure on that plus everyone else that happened. It seriously destroyed my mental health and I have several alcohol induced text message breakdowns.

It‚Äôs been two weeks and she hasn‚Äôt given me a single response. I‚Äôm trying to move on from this but mentally I‚Äôm just ruined. This relationship over the years has seriously given me PTSD. How do I come to terms with this and move on? 

Tl;dr: ex destroyed me psychologically over the years and recently. Need help letting go and feeling better / moving forward.",21Sep2020,1
310,"Sorry for the manifesto, I am a wreck. Here‚Äôs tldr 


TLDR I lost the love of my life. I don‚Äôt know if I can go on. I‚Äôm scared they think I‚Äôm a monster and my future is in jeopardy. All I ever cared about was their happiness and making a life together. I want to relapse on opiates. I want to quit school. I want to reach out to them so badly but I need to go no contact. I‚Äôm such a mess, and I want nothing more than to opt out of this world. I‚Äôve already considered suicide if my life isn‚Äôt where I want it to be five years from now. I don‚Äôt know if I can wait. 

I just lost my best friend and life partner and girlfriend of 3 years and I‚Äôm completely beside myself. The one person I could depend on. The one person who meant anything. I was going to marry her. It wasn‚Äôt so much that it‚Äôs over but it‚Äôs the way that it ended. Out of the blue things go from great to horrible. She starts treating me very badly for no apparent reason. I ask if she wants to break up, she says she needs a break, I react emotionally because I felt like a break should be sort of a last resort after we try to work on some things, like the decision was made without me. I get emotional and she thought my response was bad enough that she was leaning toward ending things for good. It all made no sense to me, everything has been going great. 

I put my all into this girl, she is my entire world. She gives me the strength to do what I need to do everyday. Her smile makes me think I can do anything. Her smell makes any bad day better. She is my home. Sex is great, we are great, we have fun every day. No exceptions. We do everything as a team. I basically have no life outside of her because I don‚Äôt like my friends, I don‚Äôt like people. But she‚Äôs different. She‚Äôs my fucking baby. She means the world to me. I‚Äôd never do anything to hurt her. 

At first it was the way I reacted to the break, but then it turned into how she thinks I manipulated her because she was sexually inexperienced and I was a little kinky, and she was younger than me. For the first year we had a little bit of a power dynamic in the bedroom but eventually we stopped and went somewhat vanilla. She looked through old texts she had saved (because she loved them) of dirty talk, and in this heightened emotional state she claimed our relationship‚Äôs foundation was built on this disgusting filth. Back then, she had such a high libido, she was so enthusiastic and she loved it. She loved the aspect of me teaching her. We haven‚Äôt done any of that stuff in years, and now suddenly she has some epiphany that I abused or manipulated her all this time. I never once crossed any boundary or harmed her in any way, I never once pressured her into doing anything, I‚Äôve never cheated on her or even yelled at her. I‚Äôve never tried to control her or coerce her, I‚Äôve never insulted her. I always had faith that as long as I treated her with unconditional love and compassion, attended to her wants and needs and desires, and satisfied her, things would be okay. And if things didn‚Äôt work out, we‚Äôd end amicably as best friends. 

I‚Äôve tried to give her everything. Because our partnership was actually a partnership. Anything that is mine is hers. I‚Äôd help her with her homework, make sure she‚Äôs taken care of. Always make sure she‚Äôs comfortable and happy and never feels alone. Support her even if I disagree with something. Encourage her hobbies, buy her clothes and food and sometimes drive 120 miles just to spend time with her. 

I‚Äôve never felt so lost and alone. Rejected. Tossed aside. And she‚Äôs probably telling people I abused her. I finally talked to her and she said she won‚Äôt name me, but I‚Äôm so scared. There was no abuse. Maybe I was too adventurous and established it too quickly, but there was no abuse. I feel like this could haunt me even years down the line. 

I saw her today and it was good. We talked and we cried and we hugged and we came to terms. We hung out one last time. She told me she loved me multiple times. I just want my best friend back. I don‚Äôt know why we couldn‚Äôt have tried to fix the problem, if there was one. I fear that the more removed we get from each other, the more she will believe that I abused and hurt and took advantage of her. If I did take advantage of her, she obviously feels that way now, then I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm fucking sorry. But I never hurt her or made her do anything. And since then we‚Äôve had the best years of our life, together. Now it‚Äôs gone, and I‚Äôm alone, and I don‚Äôt have the inclination to keep going. 

I‚Äôm scared for my future. I‚Äôm scared someone will accuse me of being some creepy abuser. I don‚Äôt have a malevolent bone in my body. In fact with women I can be a doormat sometimes. Im devastated that she will cast me aside like some piece of shit, who wasn‚Äôt even deserving of a break up in person. She did it over text and then turned off her phone when I tried to respond. How could she think I‚Äôm deserving of that after giving her all these years? It was so cruel. I know she was feeling horrible, but why be so cruel. 

They deleted me on Instagram. Not sure why. I always knew that even if we broke up, we would always be there for each other. We would always have this bond. I would always have my best friend in the world. 

How do I get out of this hell that I am in. How do I make myself eat, sleep, drink water, shower, go pee. How do I do my work? It‚Äôs piling up. I‚Äôm going to blow up my life yet again if I don‚Äôt solve this now. How do I not be suicidal? How do I not go back to opiates and other drugs? I‚Äôve already lost everything and it‚Äôs only going to get worse, and I‚Äôm all alone. I need solutions. 

**How do I stop myself from contacting them and making it worse?** I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. 

I have things I want to get off my chest to her, things not even related to this. Deeply personal things I should have confided to them years ago. So many things unsaid. I want to tell them one last time how beautiful they are. I want to be their best friend, because I am their best friend. They know that. They are family. I‚Äôve lost something so precious. Obviously it wasn‚Äôt as precious to her, when it comes down to it. We could have tried something to make it work. We were literally just having a bad week. Her emotional instability created a lot of good or bad weeks for us. All this was was a bad week. Two weeks ago she said she had never been happier with us, never been more in love with me. I can‚Äôt understand this. 

I have to not talk to her for the next few weeks at least. I have to give her that space. Maybe she‚Äôll come down from that space and realize this was a mistake. Even then, this is so traumatic, it will be hard to pick up the pieces. But i want to. I‚Äôll put in the work. Or maybe she‚Äôll realize she misses her best friend, and that we aren‚Äôt replaceable to each other. How do I even get through the next month without blowing up my life or myself?",21Sep2020,1

We try to see eachother in person every 4 to 6 months but because of covid we haven't seen eachother since Christmas. Honestly we both have been very busy lately so we aren't talking as much and recently we've been arguing more than usual. This leads up to last night, which is why I need advice.

Last night my roommates and I had a small gathering with our closer friends and one of my roommates brought her boyfriend and one of his friends. I drank way way way to much and dont really remember much of the gathering after a certain point in the night but this morning when I woke up, my roommates told me, that me and that guy kissed.

From what I was told about last night, I was super wasted and I called my boyfriend and we had a fight. Then when I rejoined the party that guy was hitting on me pretty heavily and when he went in for the kiss I didn't stop him. My roommate broke it up and sent me to bed. 

I've told my boyfriend and obviously hes upset, he said it's ok because I don't remember doing it, but I can tell hes not ok. 

I'm 100% in the wrong here, I'm just not sure what to do next. Our relationship has always been really strong and we've never really had any major problems, because we are pretty good at being talking things out. But now hes kinda shut down contact, and I'm not sure how to fix this?",21Sep2020,1

318,"We were riding in the Skyline pass on this past Saturday and she went down hard. We were riding separate bikes and went on a large group ride with other more advanced riders like myself. My gf has been riding for 2 years and recently purchased a 600cc Supersport that I approved of and made sure was mechanically sound. I encouraged her to ride with us to gain more exp riding aggressive and to watch faster riders. She has good technique and was ready for a bigger bike. At first she was a little shaky, but after a smoke break with the group and some technique pointers from me and other experienced riders, it encouraged her to go faster and she greatly improved her lean and corner attack. She was in a really good groove and wasn't doing unwise speeds. But shortly after a section of continuous and consistent radius corners, a new one approached and was a different radius. She blew the corner and put the bike in the guardrail. She has a shattered forearm, right hip and fractured shin, along with damage to her liver, spleen and lungs. I held her body in the rock Gulley she landed in until EMS arrived and had to lifeflite her out back to our home hospital.

319,"So I hooked up with this guy who I had feelings for on April fool's and haven't spoken with him since. I had sort of hooked up with him before but on Valentine's day. He had kind of ignored me after that and I did too because I expected him to be the one that communicated first, like he used to:/ Anyways, in between Valentine's day and April fools he hit on my best friend at the time who turned him down and who didn't know what had happened between us (and still doesn't know). The worst part was she would show me all the text messages, which sucked, but I didn't want to tell her because sometimes it seemed like she liked him and I didn't want her to hate me (like I deserved for lying). Some back story is that I had had a crush on him for some time and he had thought I was ""attractive"" apparently... After he hit on her is when I invited him over. I know this sounds bad, but I did it because I figured he was only talking to her because he wanted sex, which I hadn't given him, and not because he liked her (which I honestly don't know). And my friend was known to hook up with people from time to time and was attractive herself. So... I thought if I put out that he would take me more seriously, as I felt like he didn't see me enough that way even though we had come close to having sex. Plus, he had texted me before he hit on her, and I sort of shot him down in a way. He would never text me the way he texted her and that's what bothered me. It was almost like he was afraid to text me anything sexual, but he did so with her. The whole situation was kind of a mess, looking back it. But, as dumb as this sounds, I still have feelings for him and wonder why he didn't reach out first. I also wondered if he had expected me to be the one to reach out first since I invited him. I want to add that he really isn't as much as a jerk as I may have made him sound. There were times when he was really, really sweet and I think what ultimately got in the way, sort of, was him not wanting to get distracted from school. I think this because shortly after we first hooked up, we had an exam, which he didn't get what he wanted on and after that everything changed:/ Anyway, how strange would it be to text him after all this time and what would I even say? I don't plan on doing so, because I don't want to get distracted from school either (I'm an undergrad) and I don't want him to know how desperate I am. Plus, I don't want to bother him since he's at a school for his profession right now, although in the same city. I want to focus on myself and move on from my mistakes. But I feel like I never got complete closure (which causes me to think about texting him), even though him not reaching out should  be enough. Is he even worth communicating with? If there are any guys here, what would you think if you got a text from a past hookup who acted like myself?",21Sep2020,1

Like I got a job working minimum wage at 18yrs old, barely getting any hours like max 150 dollars for 2 weeks and she would try charging me for gas money n literally a bunch of other shit. When I went to college she never helped me with any of the schooling or getting supplies, my older brother did and he would let me stay at his place. After college I got a good job making quite a bit of money and she was just egging it on, like my dad wanted to kick me out n then they wanted to charge me for living there (even if my 2 older brothers weren't doing shit n literally sitting on their asses all day) then she wanted to kick me out . Anyways I went back to college like a month ago and bc my own laptop stopped working I started using hers bc i have to take online classes bc of covid. And literally like 3 weeks in shes like ""i want my laptop back bc i want to use my cricket"" which is this dumbass fucking machine that she deadass never used before for the past 2 yrs. And so I set up the program on her phone so she could use her phone instead and she stopped getting on my ass about it. Now maybe ljke 15 minutes ago she got mad bc i was at a friends, and when we got back to my house I wouldn't give her a hug (bc she's done really fucked up shit n I don't trust her) so I just sllently went to my room not answering her questions ( bc I know if I opened my mouth I couldn't stop myself from cussing her out) and then she told me she wants her laptop back after I get my shit off it. Idk like I dont want to deal with her, I already have all of my hw n everything on this laptop and I would have to cough up a large sum of money for another laptop. Its honestly so bad living here I just want to leave but ik im not going to finish my degree atleast until the end of 2023. I'm really anxious right now bc i know they'll throw me out on my ass whenever they want. Idek if I need advice or if I just need a friend. If you've been through the same situation tell me what you did plz.",21Sep2020,1
321,"I definitely waste way too much time watching YouTube videos. Often they will be educational, interesting sort of videos and not just pranks or video game kind of videos. Nonetheless I could definitely be spending my better and acislly get stuff done. 

- I have 312 subscriptions so I suppose I could start with removing ones I never watch for less clutter. 

- Maybe I could get or make a script to remove the recommended video section

- maybe I could create or new account or just sign out, or even use newpipe instead as thay doesn't allow account usage.

I have 1700 videos or so in my watch later playlist thay I will never ever empty and more will just keep getting added to it.

322,"I have a roommate of the opposite sex (I'm male btw). So I come home with my headphones on as I always do, go straight into my room and chill out with my headphones on for a bit and I take them off. At this point, I hear someone at the front door ( my room is also by the shoes/ front door). I hear ""It's your place too, it'll be fine"". 

So I'm thinking, oh God, what did I do? Did I leave the toilet seat up? Dirty dishes? Do my shoes stink? What did I do wrong? My brain is going haywire and thinking about things I did to piss her off. But thats not what that conversation was about. It took me a bit to realize what had happened. I decided to tell her what I heard when I REALLY shouldn't have. She shrugs it off as nothing to avoid the situation. 

I asked again because I think it happened a second time, and she was acting super distant, and when we were in the common area together she would be super sassy at me. So I asked again if I was doing anything that's making her mad and the same thing happened. And now it's weird and it's been a month and now I'm only realizing why she has been so distant and quiet around me. 

What should I do? Just avoid her like the black plaque? Actas nothing happened? Try to be a friend? I'm going crazy about this please help.",21Sep2020,1

Hi, I'm a 18M, close to 19. I've gotten out of a ldr which lasted 9 months, and I'm completely broken right now. I've never had an experience with a girl in real life, not even a kiss, which is pressuring myself to try to meet girls. However, right now I have terrible self-steem and social anxiety, plus i'm in the worst shape of my life.

Should I first focus on fixing those issues? Or should I just download Tinder or something and try regardless? I feel like I'm pressuring myself too much.

I also really wanna text her again and try things again next year, but that's probably stupid and I need closure.",21Sep2020,1

328,"So I recently started working in a bakery with absolutely 0 experience in baking. I didn‚Äôt care about what was waiting ahead of me, because i was told i was going to have a proper training. But now that this shit show happened, i can‚Äôt stand being here.

First off, my workmates are incredibly passive aggressive with me whenever i work with them. I don‚Äôt blame them for being upset that they‚Äôre working with a beginner, but I‚Äôm upset because i rarely get any encouragement and i always go home feeling disappointed in myself. Its also getting super consistent and my mental health is falling apart because of it. 

Second, I AM PARANOID. My manager, who also helps in the kitchen, does not wear a mask. At first it didn‚Äôt bother me because she always distanced herself, but then she started doing risky things like shaking hands with her customers, touching her face, patting my back, etc. But.. today, my paranoia has just gotten worse because first: two of my workmates couldn‚Äôt make it to work today because they showed symptoms, and second: my manager coughed on our dough without covering her mouth. I am losing my shit at this point. I do not want to get sick, and i do not want to get involved with customers complaining about getting sick from our food. 

so back to the question, how the hell do i leave this job without disappointing my boss? When I applied, i told her that I plan to stay in this job for a long time, but now that i see how unhygienic my she is, and how my coworkers are to me, i can‚Äôt stand it. This is my first job ever so i don‚Äôt know how I should tell this to my boss without sounding.. i don‚Äôt know. Rude?

331,"Only very few people know this and right know I can't stop thinking about it. I feel no one's gonna read this cause actually I don't know where to start. 

Since I was 16 I've ben running meme accounts on instagram, right now (19) I actually get some money from that and, the acc Im running now it's around 40K, not much but this one is just 5 months old. 

I think I'm a charismatic guy so previus accounts weren't just meme acc, I also upload stories of myself talking shit or whatever, kind of a ""instagrammer"". Well, during that period, when I was 17-18yo I had a couple of meme acc with around 25K. I don't know why flirting with girls through the accounts was easy, and I realised I was kinda good at sexting and that kind of stuff. So at the moment Id hook up with every girl who seemed interested and have cyber sex via texts and videos with them. Untill this point, everything kind of nice, tho I shouldn't send my dick pics to ppl I didnt know, but at that moment I just didn't care. 

One time, I was just chating through DM with a random girl, she looked nice and well, we had cyber sex, the next day when I asked her her age (cause, for the conversations we had the day before it seemed she knew what she was talking about, like a experiencied 18-20yo. But she was 14, (I was 18 at that point). Well, I just told her I was sorry but damn she was too young. That could be the end, but she kinda keep texting me sometime. When I was 15-16 my group of friends were older than me, so sometimes I could be talking to a 18yo girl who seemed interested (Ive always seemed older than I was) but when the girl realises I was just 15 she would lose all the interest. I found that un fair so when this girl keep texting me sometimes, I thought It may be unfair just rejecting her for her age despite of that when I didnt know I wouldnt be able to guess her age and the cyber sex was nice (this could sound like an excuse, but I have no reason to be lying to you, I really thought that we were just having fun, I wasnt doing anything mean and it was kinda unfair rejecting her cause of her age cause I hated when that happened to me). So, we keep having cyber sex (obviously, I shouldn't have done that no matter how ""mature"" she seemed to be) in that moment I was just turned 18 a couple of months ago. 

Well, we kept texting via WhatsApp for a couple months, one day her father took her phone, and he basically saw everything. At first he texted me like mate Imma kill you, then he just was gonna report me to the police (having sex with her would he actually legal cause was just 18 and if u arent 5 years older than your sexual partner, is legal, but the ""cyber sex"" shit isnt relugated at all so the laws applied are the same that for child porn) well, at first I really was calmed down cause I felt I didnt make anything wrong, I even told my dad, and then I realized I actually did wrong, and I was in serius trouble. Luckly, that ended well. I talked to his dad and finally he saw I wasnt a 18yo manipulating his doughter or anything like that so he didnt do anything against me. 

The point is that, to this day, I still feel bad. If you have read this far I hope you don't think I'm an asshole, I don't I am, but I can't stop feeling bad. I think if you read the whole story, clearly I acted wrong, but I wasnt trying to ""seduce"" her taking advantage of my age (thing that usually happens to 14yo girls with 18-20yo males). So, even tho I know I wasn't trying to be mean, I still feel so bad, and I feel that if people that dont know me very well knew this, they'd hated me or think I'm a fucking asshole. I don't know, I'd also love to know what she thinks, Im also scared that when she's 20 she's mad at me for some reason cause I didn't mean to harm her in any way, I just felt rejecting her for her age when she seemed mature was unfair and that we wanst harming any one. 

Im kinda scared about posting this on reddit cause I dont know what are u ppl gonna think, but I really really really to talked about this and get it off my chest. I feel real bad and sometimes I feel I deserve to be punished for that.",21Sep2020,1

Before today, Ive had a software on all my devices which means they shut down at 7pm every night. I'm not allowed to take devices upstairs into my room (not just at night, never). My phone has a 3 hour limit on it. And whenever I get left home alone, she turns the wifi off. I accepted all of this.

But today, The first day of the school holidays, she brought in some new rules: I'm allowed one hour on devices in the morning, and one at night. Then she's gonna take them away. I told her that texting on my phone is the only way I have to stay in touch with my friends, and she said I could keep my phone, but she was going to remotely disable all the other apps on there, other than what I use for texting. After all this she said she still feels like it's too much time to spend. I just feel like crap, cos I know that none of my friends have to deal with this. They don't have all these limits. They don't have their phones shutoff when the clock strikes seven, and they almost definitly didn't wake up to a bunch of random new rules on the first day of holidays.

I don't even use technology that much anyway, before online school and lockdown, I'd spend a couple on my phone and a couple on my iPad, and that was it. My grades were fine, I played sport and music. But I still had these restrictions.

It's not even the loss of technology that annoys me most, it's the loss of control over what I do throughout the day.

I just feel kinda helpless. I know these are massive first world issues, and I hope it doesn't seem like I'm being dramatic or anything, I just wanted to put this out there.

Anyone have any tips for the situation?

333,"I've always been known as the nerdy guy in school because I always had a good surface knowledge in almost everything and could pull out cool facts or information about everything thanks to my good memory. It made me really proud because that was everythinv I had going for me at the time.

In recent years I've been struggling with feeling stupid and basically worthless as I meet more and more people my age (19) that are better at literally everything than I am.

I've been trying to get good at things, picked up art and programming but whatever I try, I can't find the motivation or interest for anything, nothing seems like a fun activity and I just play video games instead.

334,"Long story short, the project I'm working on has been cancelled. I'm being moved onto a different project at the begining of October.

Working at this company has been pretty terrible and after this project was cancelled I decided to find a new job.

The team was given one months notice that the project was ending and I immediately decided to look for new jobs, this was 2 weeks ago. I have a couple interviews but I suspect I wont have an offer until I start working with the new team.

So here's the problem.

I have been told by the new teams project owner, that I will be replacing a contracted coworker, they don't more workers but because I'm a perm employee they can't fire me for ending a project, so instead management are choosing to fire a contractor and have me replace him.

The issue is, I don't want the new job and I'm only sticking around until I find something new.

So if I wait to quit then my coworker is going to be fired for no reason, I'll replace him for a month then immediately leave.

But if I quit now, there's no guarantee I'll get a job in the next few months.

so a year ago this month, my ex was put on probation and i was granted a criminal stay away order (basically a restraining order but with harsher punishment if broken) for three years to protect myself from him. any form of contact, physical or digital, and even attempted contact through a mutual person, is not allowed or he will go back to jail. i live on the west coast u.s., and he lives on the east coast, so he definitely will not be making physical contact with me. a few months back, i noticed a weird account on instagram looking at my stories. the username was something along the lines ‚Äúohnoisitme‚Äù or something like that, and it had no followers/following, no posts, no bio, nothing. i had a weird gut feeling, so i blocked it. few weeks later, another account under the same name but with an extra ‚Äòe‚Äô at the end. i blocked that too, and not even the next day after blocking the second account, a third one came up with two extra ‚Äòe‚Äôs on the end. i made my account private to hide my stuff, and i just brushed it off. around the same time, i started receiving army recruitment letters in the mail like crazy. i blamed it on me just taking an MCAT prep class, and how the military always expresses interest in young medical students for recruitment, but here‚Äôs the thing: my ex was in the army right before he went to jail. why am i getting army recruitment calls, letters, pamphlets, etc right around the time i notice these accounts? next, i am noticing a lot of calls to my work and personal cell that are those ‚Äòsomeone is on the other line and i can hear them breathing but they won‚Äôt say anything‚Äô calls, and they all have private or blocked IDs. lastly, i have gotten those ‚Äúsomeone is attempting to login to your account‚Äù emails from every sort of login you can think of from netflix to linkedin to email to pinterest and everything in between in the last month. instagram tells you the location of the login attempt, and guess where is was? the state he‚Äôs in. nothing is concrete enough for me to get the law involved. my safety isn‚Äôt being threatened. he‚Äôs not hurting me or attempting to. he can‚Äôt come near me to physically start something since there are 3000 miles between us. but i have a feeling it is him. what can i do, wait it out? am i being irrational and acting on my past trauma with him? are these all coincidental? should i get the law involved?",21Sep2020,1
338,"Sorry for the vague title, I had no idea what to call this.

Recently I have been dealing with a bunch of things that I‚Äôve either put on the back burner for too long, or I‚Äôm just now having to experience. And I‚Äôm really having a hard time adjusting and learning how to do these things. 

Allow me to explain: first I need to learn how to drive, and recently I‚Äôve become more and more terrified of it since my father passed in an ATV accident in April (yes I know ATVs aren‚Äôt cars, but same safety principles) I‚Äôve had my permit for over a year and now I need to renew it, but I‚Äôve been putting it off since I get so anxious and shaken up when I try to learn. I was motivated at first and did things in baby steps but now it feels impossible. 

Next I need to get a job, I was never allowed one while I was in high school since I needed to ‚Äúfocus on my grades‚Äù and now that I desperately need one I can‚Äôt seem to even get a chance since I have no experience and I really have no idea what to do. I have filled out a few applications and recently I filled out one to work at Starbucks (a dream of mine) and it‚Äôs been a week and I‚Äôve received nothing, yet again from another business. I‚Äôm going to actually try calling today and asking about the application but if I don‚Äôt get it I‚Äôm not sure what to do next other then keep trying for more jobs. (I‚Äôm very nervous about the interview if I get one)

Lastly, I‚Äôm dealing with multiple emotional issues in my relationships with family and friends. My sister has become more and more cruel to me since my father had passed and it‚Äôs gotten to the point where she just degrades me all the time and puts me down for not getting a job. And sometimes I feel like I can‚Äôt talk to my mother because she‚Äôs still very hurt and sometimes she just can‚Äôt handle helping other people right now. The last person I could depend on was my boyfriend but in the last three months we‚Äôve been fighting on and off all the time and now we aren‚Äôt talking for a while. 

I am completely just lost right now. I feel very stressed and uncomfortable with my life right now., However I don‚Äôt expect anyone to have the exact words to solve any of my issues but I‚Äôm hoping some people can help me figure at least something out. 

I appreciate anyone who wants to give me advice.

TL:DR - I‚Äôm having issues getting through a fear of driving, trouble getting a job for the first time, and fixing my relationships.

* I do see a therapist every two weeks since my fathers passing, I graduated in June but I didn‚Äôt do anything until these past two months since I was depressed, going to college is not an option since I have no idea what I want to do and I don‚Äôt have money to pay for it.",21Sep2020,1

I've been here since year 7 but I somehow ended up with zero friends, and it makes my self-esteem dip when I think of what could have been and how people act as if I don't exist anymore even though I've been at this school for 5 years. I feel like I'm secretly the laughing stock of the school or something, it literally feels like people treat me like I have the plague.   


I don't think I mind if I don't have any friends anymore, but I'm just thinking of changing schools for year 12 so then at least I'd have an excuse for not talking to anyone and not feel so guilty/bad about myself for not having friends, since I wouldn't know anyone. The only reason I hesitate is that I'm scared that it'll negatively affect my marks. Year 12 is the final year of schooling here and is important for getting into university. Also, the high school that I'm probably going to change to has a few people from my primary school, and I can't decide if that's a good thing or a bad thing.

And boss doesn't give care at all he be like we will see. Current workplace wasn't too bad but here are the few things that kinda bugging me.
1. My boss is a porn-adict (yep he watches in office too)
2. He doesn't care much about employees
3. There's an girl he simps alot mostly listens to her.
4. My senior engineer doesn't do much work they only call me ! Same goes for the lady employees They call me offen even for small stuffs like connecting wifi (so dumb)

I turned 21 few days ago and I'm serious about the future
I will study where I'm interested and I feel like my work place is not good enough for me as no enthusiasm and everyone is lazy af.

344,"My ex boyfriend (27m) and I (21f) broke up two weeks ago. I initiated the break up. We got into an argument and it become really overwhelming for me, so out of anger I told him I wanted to end things. 

To be honest, the break up argument was petty and could have easily been talked out if I didn‚Äôt mention breaking up. When I did though, he just agreed that we should. At the time, considering how minor the argument was and knowing us (fighting, then talking things through in usually just a few hours and making up) I thought it was one of those fights. But when we didn‚Äôt talk for the rest of the day I knew it was more serious.

On the 3rd day of no communication, I reached out to him and sent him a long apology message for my behavior and taking ownership for my wrongs. I wanted to feel like I was in control, and to avoid him possibly rejecting me I emphasized that ‚Äú I still need time to work on myself ‚Äú type of vibe. I didn‚Äôt mention anything about getting back together, because I figured if I did he would reject me or say he needed more time still. He basically just said he appreciated the apology and it sucks this happened between us. 

I really really want to be with him and work things out. It‚Äôs been 10 days with zero communication and I can‚Äôt stand feeling like he is ok with me not around.

346,"Almost two years ago I managed to get out of my fathers house and move in with my mother, he was emotionally abusive and I was treated terribly while I lived there.

Tonight I finally got it together enough to message him to sort a pickup time, he then told me that he got rid of it. I asked what he meant and he said he just got rid of it. I said that it was my property and he had no right to do so and he just ignored me.

I'm still young so I don't know what I can do in order to be reimbursed for this, it was almost $6,000 originally and if I cant get the piano itself back I want to be paid the original price. I have no idea how that would work or if it's possible as I have no knowledge of the legality of the situation.

347,I just broke up with my boyfriend yesterday and my guy friend who I trust with my life finally opened up and told me my ex was super weird and get the impression that all my guy friends thought that. I get how he would come across as that but I feel deeply hurt by it. I know I sound like a pussy but I was with him for 6 months and it sort of is a reflection on me. Now I keep thinking if people think I'm weird or if word will spread that I only date weird people or that my reputation will be ruined. My ex was so nice to me but socially awkward and borderline autistic and was acting super jealous and saying weird shit in front of my friends. Like now I feel ashamed and kinda depressed about myself and feel like I'll get anxious in social situations with people I actually care about thinking about how others think of me.

In short I‚Äôm working at a game store, fairly new and I only work there two days a week so I don‚Äôt exactly have a lot of experience. Yesterday, my coworker bought a PS4 a customer brought to trade in, off the books. For herself. I accidentally forgot to take it off the ticket, so we ended up giving the customers money from the store even though the store itself didn‚Äôt actually get the PS4. My coworker did.

When I told her that I accidentally forgot to delete it, she texted the manager. He told her to void the ticket, and that one of two things can happen:

Either I pay her back $150 so she can give the PS4 back to the store, or we are both fired.

I paid her because I was shaken up and didn‚Äôt want us to be fired. Upon telling friends and family, they said I shouldn‚Äôt have given her the money and just quit. Some even said it‚Äôs her fault entirely. I know it‚Äôs partly my fault, if not mostly. They were also upset that I basically took the fall for this. 

They also pointed out how many of the employees have messed up more, but usually get only a warning or write up. Not fired. This particular coworker often sits in the back on her phone or playing games while I take care of customers, and will leave to go grab something from her house but will be gone for 30+ minutes. Recently she left me alone in the store at night, and our store has a history of being robbed a lot and didn‚Äôt come back until about 30 min before closing. So she was gone about 50 minutes. 

This was my first and only mess up. I have a friend who also works there and she said if that‚Äôs what my manager actually said, she was going to go to higher management and tell them, because she felt it was harsh and immature.

What should I do? I‚Äôm getting stomachaches over this and I really don‚Äôt know how to feel about it ;-;",21Sep2020,1

Hey guys.

It‚Äôs my girlfriend and I‚Äôs 4 year anniversary in a few days, and I really want it to be special, as last year I was in hospital for our anniversary. The issue is, we are both pretty skint, but I‚Äôm still determined to make this a special day for her, to make up for last year too.

I have about ‚Ç¨20, maybe ‚Ç¨30 if I stretch things, to spend on this day. I lost my job at the start of lockdown so I‚Äôve been barely getting by recently. I know I seem vastly under budget, but that‚Äôs just the way it is for me recently. 

Originally, I was planning a picnic, but the weather isn‚Äôt looking too great. I‚Äôd love to bring her out to this restaurant in town, we went there for our one year and she loved it! Only thing is the price. 

Then I was thinking about maybe just having a chill night in, have a few drinks, but that feels like it doesn‚Äôt do this day justice, we‚Äôve been together for four years, that‚Äôs something to celebrate in my books.

So guys, and tips or ideas for a broke romantic? Thanks",21Sep2020,1
358,"For a little background, I have suffered with social anxiety and depression for many years. The depression has been much less severe since quitting drugs &amp; alcohol, as well as sorting out my diet and doing regular exercise, but social anxiety is still present.

For the duration of the Covid-19 outbreak I've been working from home. A lot of people haven't enjoyed this but I have loved it as I am not being forced to make awkward small talk with co-workers on a daily basis, people I usually have nothing in common with.

I live alone, more or less - my landlord lives with me, but he is away a lot and when he is around I don't see much of him.

I have a few hobbies which I enjoy and these can be pursued in complete solitude. In fact I prefer to pursue these interests alone because, again, I don't have to deal with the awkwardness of social interaction, which I am terrible at.

I have accepted that I will never find happiness with a romantic partner for various reasons (that I would rather not get into).

Though I do have a handful of friends, I only see them infrequently, and I feel like none of them would really mind if they never saw me again. I get on well with my immediate family, and see them a few times a year.

I haven't had a face to face conversation (beyond saying hello to the person behind the counter at the shop) for about a week, and honestly I don't care. I'm quite happy to continue living in solitude. The thing that worries me is that I have often heard that loneliness is physically damaging and can even shorten your life. But if I am happy to be by myself, is the damage still being done in the same way? I honestly feel like forcing myself to socially interact with others will take more years off of my life.

359,"So weird situation. I had 2 surgeries, the second had to be redone because the first failed. It‚Äôs caused me a lot of issues over the years and I‚Äôm still dealing with complications. My mother wanted me to sue the doctor because he really did fail to diagnose an issue after the first surgery, so a second was needed. He‚Äôs a younger doctor and hadn‚Äôt come across my particular complication before. 

I don‚Äôt really feel like it‚Äôs the doctors fault for the issue. Could he have asked advice from older surgeons to find out about my issue.....probably. But I‚Äôm telling you I think he will never again fail to diagnose my complication again in another patient. I kinda feel like doctors need the opportunity to learn and this was a learning experience for him. His office was kind and caring and he was very good with me. The truth is surgeons always tell you there is a risk for complications so I mean.....he told me that before surgery.
My mother says that this cost me months upon months off of work, loss of money, lifelong complications, that he should have done something sooner by asking his colleagues for help. The office had removed my ability to see some online records. So I think the doctor knows he screwed up. I can see all of my medical notes for every appointment in an entire healthcare system except for his. In repeated appointments he admitted to struggling to diagnose my issue so they may have noted that.

So, am I being dumb by not wanting to sue? I just don‚Äôt want to go through the expense of getting a lawyer and court and damaging this surgeons career when I feel like he legitimately tried to help me.

361,"So here is the thing, last semester I was finally realizing my childhood dream of taking part in an exchange program in Japan. I met a lot of wonderful people and had a lot of amazing experiences. But 2 months into the program everyone  was kicked out of Japan due to the pandemic. I was allowed to stay because the government had granted me a scholarship of around 800$ for per month. So I stayed in Japan for about 3 months more. Although there were 2 other people who stayed with me,  most of the time I basically did nothing apart from being inside my dorm and going to a supermarket from time to time. I was devastated to see  my dream basically crumbling before me. Also the fact that this was my first time abroad didnt help my case. When I came back to my homecountry I decided to look up a series of government granted scholarships to study in Japan, called MEXT. When the embassy of Japan finally opened the applications, I decided to take a shot.Last week I received a call from the embassy and had an interview yesterday. Today I was told that the embassy would recommend me to Japan's ministry of education, culture, sports, science and technology. I'll get an answer around february but from what I've seen it is very probable that I'll be granted the scholarship. The problem is I am already half way through my current bachelor's (5th semester) and I'm 20 years old. 

Even though I don't hate my current uni and I'm a good student with fairly decent grades, I dont really feel that I'm accomplishing anything and to be honest I've been a pretty lonely and unhappy person for the last 2 years. When I was looking up universities in my last year of highschool I had some opportunities to study abroad, but I overlooked all of them because my parents wanted me to stay in my homecountry. I' ve regretted taking that decision ever since then. My parents dont really approve of me going back to Japan and wont help me financially if I decide to do so, but I saved some money from last semester ,so I think I can make meets end while the funds from my scholarship come in.( the scholarship would pay for my tuition and I'd be granted a pretty generous stipend each month)

Im really  confused as to what I should do right now. On one hand I would be graduating at 25 and the relationship with my parents would be harmed in some way, but on the other hand I dont want to keep being miserable here in my home country.

365,"Hey all.

So, for the last four years I had been in a relationship with a woman I thought I had really loved. We clicked really well, we had all of the same likes and dislikes and we took good care of each other. About two years in, we had a slight (unrelated) falling out and took a break for a few months, coming back together soon after. 

Now this is when things had changed. Over the course of the break she had been with a plethora of other guys. Once we had reconvened she seemed to notice that the fact made me slightly uncomfortable. She began showing strange behaviors around other guys while we were in public together, openly flirting, etc. This made me nervous around other men.

Later on, as the virus hit, I took an online job and began hanging around with my online friends a bunch more. She became very needing of my attention, to the point where I would need to take my breaks and dedicate them to her, as well as cutting back my time playing games with my online group by an extreme amount. The conversations we would have would always be extremely lovey in nature, we no longer talked about our interests, ate dinner over the phone or did anything we came up with to make the distance of quarantine seem smaller. This killed my online and interpersonal relationships, as if I hesitated for even a moment to respond I would be asked to show if I had been talking to someone else. This went to a crazy degree as she looked through my discord, social media etc to see if I was regularly.

Finally, as of two weeks ago we had a fight. By this point, I had become well knowing of these facts of what she was doing and I had confronted her, leading to her walking away from the relationship. I‚Äôve since gone to the doctors and gotten diagnosed with anxiety disorder. Since then, I‚Äôve noticed a trouble with driving alone by myself, even with the radio on. I‚Äôve noticed that i‚Äôve become extremely wary of others and their actions and i feel as if i‚Äôve been scanning for ulterior motives in every word someone makes to me lately. I find it hard to go to the convenience store without pulling out my phone and scrolling through my texts/contacts, dying to talk to someone or just... have someone there. I‚Äôve tried listening to music, but they all have memories attached. As well as this, I‚Äôve taken up watching things on youtube, but my brain doesn‚Äôt seem to accept it as much as an in person voice, if that makes sense.

My question: How do I get past this... need or want to have someone there? I feel so overbearing when I ask friends to stay in voice chat with me, or when I constantly ask other friends to hang out just for an hour or two so I don‚Äôt get the shivers. 

Thanks again for your advice and non judgement. I‚Äôll answer any questions i can.",21Sep2020,1

The first person was understanding and realised that i just posted it for humour reasons and that the meme was completely neutral but the other one went completely ballistic.

368,"Hi, I'm 19 years old male college student. I'm currently studying Psychology yet it seems that I'm not able to help myself.

I had severe depression last year because of issues in my class, rejection, and being in a wrong cycles of friends. Long story short my life last year is so messed up. I even self harmed last year and I have to rely on xanax (antidepressant) to make myself calm and to make myself sleep. I also have known that my so called friends are backstabbing me. Now I have trust issues.

Today, I thought I learned and become a better version of myself but still. The pain and sadness I'm feeling is never ending. It is because my ex gf left me during my birthday, it's been 5 months now since we broke up but I still can't move on even though we no longer have contacts for 5 months and I have removed and deleted everything that could remind me of her.

To make things worse my gf probably talked to most of our classmates and ruined me a lot from her story. Of course she also told it about those back stabbers which made them happier so they can ruin me a lot more. I can't believed that I even begged my ex for her to be back but nothing happens. I even went to her house during this pandemic but of course, it is such waste of time because her grandma simply told me that she wasn't there when I went there.

I am very broken and it feels like I was beyond repair. I got rid of my social media accounts and I was not able to talk to anyone for so long.

I can't even tell my mom that I think I should be back for antidepressants again because we're having problems financially.

I'am very tired and I really want to sleep but my stupid brain always reminds me these horrible experiences from my past. I'm starting to be suicidal again and I don't know what to do anymore.

All my gf do is cry and cry and cry and cry and cry then tell and tell and tell and tell and tell to others how disgusting of a person I'am. She is very pessimistic and it is extremely rare for me to see her being positive and optimistic. She is one hell of a negative person. Yet my stupid self keeps missing her and wanting her.

374,"My \[22 F\] Dad \[52 M\] is an alcoholic and I don't know what to do about it. 

My dad has always had problems with mental health. Particularly depression. However, his conditions have exacerbated in severity since my grandfather died 2 1/2 years ago. Since then he has turned to drinking to escape his growing depression and mental instability. 

However despite me, my mum's \[51 F\] and my younger sister's \[17 F\] best efforts, we can't convince him to go to therapy or help himself and he get agitated when we try and approach him about how his drinking has negatively affected him over the past couple of years. Ever since my grandfather has passed, shit has gone downhill hard and fast.

My dad has been suicidal, my sister has been going to therapy for her own issues which have worsened because of my dad and his deteriorating relationship with her, and my mum has mentioned to me in private when I've asked that sometimes she wonders if she still is attracted to and even wants to be with my dad because of his drinking habit and how he has completely changed as a person because of this.

However I don't know where I stand. Prior to this all happening, my dad did enjoy drinking however it was never an emotional crutch like it is now. My dad always was, and when sober is, a fun loving guy who always tells me he loves me and wants to know about my interests or my friends and is a good dad. We have a great relationship and I've always found that our way of thinking and habits are eerily similar. But I'm finding that this version of my dad is now becoming overshadowed by his alternate drinking persona. 

I want to clarify that he isn't an angry drunk and isn't abusive. He just has no capacity to deal with his problems. Since my grandfather's passing he has had several problems at work, and all of our family essentially turned on us due to difference in opinion regarding the funeral etc. He often turns to me to vent but as a 22 F I'm finding it very hard to help him. I have pleaded with him for years to see a professional. I have always been there for him to vent to and have always had his back. But no matter how much I try to help him or how many late nights I spend talking with him about his issues or crying  myself to sleep about it, his drinking gets worse and worse and I don't know what else to do. He has said some truly horrible things to my family. He has told me on numerous occasions that he wants to go off and be on his own as not to 'bother us' when he's drunk and we confront him about his drinking. He has told my sister and I that although he loves us, we aren't enough to make him want to stay and has said once, while drunk, that he sees us as a 'cancer' and he wonders whether to 'cut us off to save the rest of him or watch it grow and take over'. 

I don't take this to heart too much because he often says these things while intoxicated. I understand he feels frustrated and doesn't know how to cope with everything when things are overwhelming and so I'm more than happy, as an adult, to provide support to help him through these times. But its taking a toll on me too. I don't have friends over at my house because he's been drunk and yelled before and I don't want them to be uncomfortable. I love travel but find one of the reasons I love it is because I feel I am escaping him and home. I see the toll it takes on my younger sister, and as an older sister, feel like I should be protecting her from him as well as my mum. But through it all I still love my dad, but where do I draw the line? I feel like a therapist more than a daughter and sometimes I think that if he were to actually follow through and leave us, I would find it more relieving than heartbreaking. He says he knows it's bad, and that he wants to change however has made no effort to do so. He refuses to go on medication and he calls therapists 'shrinks'.

I don't know what to do and would love an outsider's advice. How should I deal with my dad? Is there anything else I can do? Am I being rude and ungrateful or am I being rational in acknowledging he is toxic? Should I be more understanding?",21Sep2020,1

I know the grass isnt always greener, but I'm starting to feel trapped by the mundane of our relationship, where I feel that theres no progression or excitement in our lives unless I action it. 
Matthew bought an engagement ring last year and still hasnt proposed. Is this a red flag? Ive brought it up with him many times, and he says he's not ready. He tells me he never wanted to get married or have kids. Then why buy the ring and tell me you have? To then not propose? But now, I'm unsure if I even accept. 

We talk about moving to another city as a last ditch attempt of a remedy for our arguing, but now I'm thinking that will just be a distraction from the fact that we're falling out of love?
My family tell me to stick with Matthew, he's a great guy, but I feel torn. I know Matthew would flourish being in a relationship with someone more mentally stable and with someone with the same logical mindset. I am irrational, spontaneous and Matthew finds my unpredictability due to my mental illhealth difficult to deal with. 

Matthew has been away for the past week and I haven't missed him. I've enjoyed my independence.  Thats what I feel Ive lost by being with Matthew. I've lost my fire, my drive and feel that Matthew can be very parental in his dominance that we should save our money wisely and act responsibly. I feel that we're in our 20s and should live our lives! Money is disposable! Throw caution to the wind and do whatever whenever! But our contrast in views is now causing strain and weekly arguments. 

I'm torn. Do I walk away whilst were still friends? Or do I stick with Matthew and hope things improve? Is it just the 7 year itch? Relationships ebb and flow but I dont know how much more I can give this. I feel like I changed myself for this relationship and am starting to feel like the payoff is not worth it and Ive lost who I am. 

Please help!",21Sep2020,1
377,"So I‚Äôm laying in bed currently and there is a very strange noise outside right now at 5:30 AM that is giving me anxiety and scaring me. I‚Äôve never heard it before.

383,"I‚Äôm probably going to delete this post after I feel like I get a reply but here it goes. 
  I‚Äôm currently recovering from an ED I have had for a few years which spiralled out of control recently, that resulted in me being in hospital for two weeks, which means I have to follow an eating plan in order to maintain my weight. 
The problem is I feel like I am losing it, I was told by a dietitian that weight fluctuations are normal as your body gets used to food again. However, I have been weighing myself on some occasions and have noticed my weight has actually gone down. I got weighed last week at the clinic I go to and it was just as it was when I last got weighed (however I had just eaten my breakfast). I‚Äôve lost about 400g which may not seem like a lot but for my current weight it is. My ED is related to control so also has a lot of OCD aspects, which can make meal times really hard for me. There have been some occasions where I‚Äôve skipped a snack I‚Äôm supposed to have in the day and not told my parents. 
I‚Äôm just worried I‚Äôm hurting myself, I thought that a small snack wouldn‚Äôt make a big difference. If I go back to the clinic and I‚Äôve lost weight they could get my parents in trouble (luckily my parents are supportive). This may seem a bit like I‚Äôve puked out what I‚Äôm saying but I just am really worried rn and some advice on what to do or how to get in the right mindset would really help. Thank you :)",21Sep2020,1
384,"To give you a context, I'm not someone raised on tv and junk food, I spent 8 years of my life on ancient Greek, Latin, French, 5 years as a classical choir soloist... I'm not alien to those things, if anything I am fed up after so much time only like this. I appreciate them, but I have been raised with a prohibition to read modern literature because it's common/vulgar (I don't really know why, it was just not the classics...). 

Growing up I was shamed for liking EDM music, which is the music of my soul, and I am very secretive about liking fantasy literature for the same reason, however it is known that I like k-pop music and it's not well... I'm fed up with my family's attempts to make me change my tastes and the look of despise in their eyes if I talk about that or the mockery. It's either relatives or an ex-friend with a PhD... I don't know what to do.

You have no idea of how much of myself I find in some fantasy series, how much of my inner self I express through certain songs and choreos and how meaningful some aesthetics of k-pop are for me, it's my inner world and my true self that are tied to these things and EDM since childhood.

387,"So a little bit of background, a couple of months ago I started dating a girl living on the other end of the country. I felt like it was worth it because she just seemed like a genuinely kind and worthwhile person to be around for a long term relationship.

I found out that she had been taken by social services because appearantly her dad was not making enough money to support her and her sister. Recently I asked her if I could visit her resident and that was when I realized something that has started to bug me. She is very desperate about her dad not finding out about us. I could just fill in some papers and request a visit permit and that would basically solve all of these problems. However she says that I shouldn't do it because they will tell her dad. When I ask her why she does not want her dad find out about this she basically does not give a good answer and tries to change the topic and she has said something along the lines of ""my dad has certain expectations of the kind of guy I am supposed to meet, he has to also be a kurd according to him"".

This got me thinking, maybe social services stepped in because her dad is actually abusive and her relatives will find her and commit some kind of honorary murder if they find out she is dating a swedish guy. I am really worried for her sake and I don't know what to do about it",21Sep2020,1

393,"Hi there,

so I started going to university one year ago in the area of economics. Now, one year later, I definitely realized I am not interested in finishing my studies. Of all 13 subjects I had lectures on I have a genuine interest in two of them. Around 6 months ago I told my dad I was thinking about dropping out and doing something else that has nothing to do with economics. He told me that he wants me to finish it so I'll have good chances for a stable income later in life. In short, he is against me dropping out.

Now stability and safety are fair points. But I realized uni is robbing my inner peace. I feel constantly stressed and need a lot of strength to do anything. I feel under pressure and not at peace anymore. I am not enjoying my hobbies anymore.

I want to drop out but I am scared of my dad, if it's the right decission, if I find something that I like studying afterwards and so on. I know it's my life and I am the one responsible for my happiness and I should not listen to my dad as much but I wanted to hear some other opinions on this.

I always found it difficult to really do what I wanted to do. It's hard for me to do what I think is right for me when my parents or others in general don't think something's right.

Soo should I do what I think is right for me and drop out? I think I'm writing this here because I want some reassurance. How do I start with doing what I want? How do I take the control of my life? What can I tell my dad so he kinda understands me?

Was anybody in a simliar situation?

397,"Now at my age alot of people seem to feel depressed, and this year I have been feeling the same. My friend group used to get along really well, but this one kid joined our friend group (J) . J is athletic and very negative, and likes to shit on everything he doesnt like. J (and kinda the whole of our friend group) shat on fortnite when it came out, and he just keeps shitting on intrests of others like anime, games, hobbies, and other things. Insults dont affect him and the comedy he uses is just being super reppetitive and annoying.  


recently our friend group has taken a steep turn, as 2 of our main friends(T) (L) have changed classes and dont interact with us as much, and 1 of our friend (Y) have moved to a different city. TJ has befriended my other main friend (IS), as they are both athletic unlike the rest of my friend group. When it comes to sport, I refuse to try in any team sport and I hate the feeling of being counted on and letting people down. J and IS often try to start little arguments, and will often randomly insult others, often bringing up intrests and skill as an insult.  


J,IS and i used to play minecraft all the time, but J has moved and is now in a busy school schedule, and IS is just super sweaty, and wont play any game other than mincraft

Im feeling good now, no depression, no panic attacks, no medication, etc. Everything got back to normal so to say.
But im still very insecure about everything and I hate answering the question about what I did before university.
But thats the thing, all the professors at my university want us to do a short introduction in the beginning of ourselves and such things and of course I always get asked about it by the other students.
I always talk around it and dont really know what to say anymore. Because of the depression part I also didnt do much the past years and I still have to find fun in doing things again bc after years of not doing much they still get me exhausted quite fast, so I also dont have really interesting hobbys.
Now I started to have anxiety about university and talking about myself.

can't look at my own point of view either since my mother has told me that I was ""easy"" to handle in my own teenage years. never went through a rebellion phase and just did what I was told. 

I have heard from my stepmother's family that they warned her about going into a relationship with a man with kids and I am kinda scared I am going to mess it all up due to my own view on stepparents and because the only experience I have with teenagers is my own little sister.

410,"The most spectacular case was a 10+ years ""friendship"" via chats, whatsapp, and very rare very short encounters with this friend... I tolerated rude replies, put-downs of my interests, attempts to make me do things their way, and the bare minimum amount of input from them: we would not have even met if it was not for me, I spent even money on gifts never reciprocated and trips, receiving crumbs now and then, and in the end when I said enough... well, just I stopped giving inputs and it has been three months of radio-silence on their part. Good riddance, but it was unhealthy on my part.

Another similar story for the same amount of years went on with a ""friend"" who never wanted to meet in person for mysterious reasons and that ghosted me two years ago, only to resurface as if nothing happened. I closed that door without them even apologising. Is the same story, me updating them about everything and spilling my beans like not even with a psychologists and them giving me next to nothing in return. I was not part of their group of inner friends but I called them my best friends.

A similar trend is going on with my sibling who at least loves me for real. But I am the one keeping things up and spilling my private beans while being in the dark about their live. It's painful and humiliating. Also I try to deny my interests, try to approve and nod at what they believe or like, and I'm generally a cheerleader even if it is emotionally exhausting and honestly insincere. I feel bad. Listen, nod, support, cheerlead, give. Friendship?

Strangely enough, me and those people have nothing in common but they are willing to put up with me. They are not the kind of people I would chose as similar-minded or similar-hearted or with similar passions, it's just that I tail-wag constantly and they let me be around them. Sort of. Now I am trying hard to do that with a new flatmate 12 years my junior who made me promise to watch football with him and then yesterday left me crushed by going to one of his friend's homes to watch the first football match. And I don't even like football that much at all, and also he doesn't know I dislike the team he roots for.

In short, I'm myself only within myself, I live in my inner world, my sanctuary, where I actually exist. No one outside me has ever really met me. And to put salt on the wound they claim to know me and give me advice and assessments, and then I feel pressured to conform to their idea of me and my values/personality/wishes.

I'm tired of having to expose myself by reporting on my inner emotions or my life events to people that I don't want to tell about things, and even more tired of bonsai-ing myself to fit their world view and be their mirror. And I am tired of all that anger and resentment when it turns out I'm not their best mate for life.

412,"I've never felt so strongly that I need to actually address my mental health until recently. Some backstory, I am a Junior in college and I absolutely can not get any work done. This feeling of not paying any attention and not doing any work started around March of this year. My whole life I avoided online classes because I knew I would never have the attention span to actually gain anything from the class. On top of not learning anything, I cant get myself to study or work on any asignments. I am a pretty big procrastinator, but I always able to map out the exact time I needed to finish a project or study, even if it was last minute, I would always pull out the motivation to finish and put out good work. However, in March I decided to just ghost all my classes and curriculum and I somehow passed everything based on pure luck. The worst part was that I wanted to fail and I felt like I was personally undermining myself. I thought it was just a build up of stress and that after this insanely long 6 month break I took, I would be back in tip top form and go back to being focused.

 I am back in school and nothing has changed, I started the first week strong and turning in everything and showing up, but my motivation strongly dropped after the second week of schooling where I had to do actual work. The work isn't difficult by any means, but I have no willpower to actually do anything. It's like an advanced form of laziness where as soon as I think of starting all the life drains out of me. Usually when im behind or I need to start up an assignment I usually would have this big lump of anxiety start to build up until I finally start on my assignment and it would alleviate pressure while giving me good ideals on what to design get my creative process flowing. The major reason I procrastinated is because nothing good ever came to me until it was the night before a desk crit or pin up and the ideals would flow to me in my sleep. Now however, I would know that I need to do an assignment and try to imagine scenarios where I would start, but I just lay there having no motivation to exert effort.

 I cant focus on anything, and while I understand in college you have to take most of your learning into your own hands, it feels like im really just doing everything and the inspiration that I used to get from in class lectures just isnt there. I just can not work at my house. I feel completely empty, so lifeless like nothing ever matters. All I contemplate is about how useless im being, the furthest I keep getting on one assignment is just watching a beginners guide to site analysis and just looping the same video and points without actually starting the research. Im back to ghosting classes because im so far behind again and it just keeps getting worse. I didnt realize how insanely productive having 24 hour school studio access made me because all I did was live in my studio. Even when I was screwing around at my desk space, I would always work on something. I just can not start progress on anything at home.

I feel like I've had some sort of mental condition for a long time, but I've been scared to get help for it or have it actually checked out. When I was in middle school, my sister was always extremely hyperactive and disruptive. My mom thought something was genuinely wrong with her and asked the doctor if she  had ADHD. The doctor said she was going through a phase and would grow out of it and actually started listing off symptoms of kids with ADHD. At the time, I remember thinking that sounded a lot like me and was nervous about how closely that described me. I didn't say anything because I didnt want to be any weirder than I thought I was, but I really wish I spoke up and got things like that diagnosed earlier.  As an adult, I just do not know where to start, I feel like something is genuinely wrong that I cant just willpower through like usual. When I had a therapy session, it felt like I really couldnt talk about myself and what was bothering me. I kept things vague, but I should have just been honest. I do not feel like existing anymore, living is bland and I just feel like a constant failure and im letting everyone down.",21Sep2020,1
414,"Of late,  I'm noticing that, the things that used to make me happy, even for some time being, don't make me happy now. I do not exactly understand why. And the set of things that still make me happy is dwindling rapidly. I can feel it.

A little background about myself - I'm 21M. I've raised by extremely abusive parents, and my whole childhood passed witnessing their almost-daily aggressive fights, and me being forced to pick sides.

I never had close friends. I wasn't allowed to leave the house when I was a kid, and by 17, I started going out, but still I never had close friendships like I see in movies, books and real life.

My mother has actively wanted to kill me since my birth (and this continues today, only in more passive ways, such as by finding ways to put barriers to whatever ventures I might be planning, because she senses that I'm closer to snatching my freedom from them.) Dad is a piece of shit. Both are classic textbook narcissists and abusers and manipulators and attention-seekers (speaking from years of observance)


Months back, my ex brutally broke up with me. She had been abusive too, to me (yes, fml), having always flirted with other guys, comparing me with her exes and saying I'm not worth shit, and making me her emotional trashcan. I've moved on, however. One of the 2 things that happened to me during this lockdown is this.

The other is, I've started taking my life into my hands, and I study with all my waking hours. Ngl, it's fun for me to learn new things. I like self studying because college is shit.

But I can't help but notice that although my studies are going good, I'm feeling less happier day by day, and more enraged within. My 'parents' continue to emotionally abuse me since I've been living with them owing to this pandemic.


I'd like it very much if someone explains why the things I felt happiness from no longer give me happiness, why is it increasing, and how can I stop and reverse it.",21Sep2020,1

416,"Our little apartment has been turned into a battle ground since last December or so. Food moths invaded our pantry and spice cabinet. We invested into airtight containers, threw away all spices and foods and hoped that would be enough. It wasn't. So we cleaned out all the cabinets and the pantry cupboard/wardrobes with vinegar and a hairdryer, threw away any and all food we had, put up moth traps &amp; used moth spray. That drastically reduced the number of moths but we still kept seeing some on occasion although we still have not been able to figure out what the source might be. After a few months of cleaning, searching, constantly setting traps and such, we bought a couple of parasitic wasps, which were recommended as a natural moth predator. They were kinda expensive tbh, especially on our student budget but we had to do something at this point. Local exterminators were of little help, as all they would do is either gas the apartment or use parasitic wasps themselves. Either ""solution"" wouldve been incredibly expensive and at least two out of the four bigger exterminators in the region told me that they usually wouldn't even come for food moths, as everything they could do, was pretty much the same we already did aka use poison spray (same brand we had even) or the wasps. Nothing else would work, they said and I believe them.

Today, as we are preparing to move to another place, I found some eggs and larvae in a few of our books - meaning I will have to clean every single book we own (as students who read a lot, this might just take weeks) and even then it isn't guaranteed that I will find every egg/larvae, as they are incredibly tiny.

So, I am in desperate need of advice. What should I do? I can't just throw all the books away, as I need them for my studies. Should I just purchase another batch of wasps and hope for the best? Do any of you know if the eggs on the books could survive there? Or am I worrying needlessly and the eggs on the books can't survive without food?


I am thankful for any and all help &amp; advice you can give me, as I am rather desperate at this point.",21Sep2020,1

I got so lucky to find a job in the middle of a pandemic. The pay isn't amazing but it's enough, and I feel such a weight lifted to finally actually have work.  
That being said, I'm struggling to adapt. I've had 2 weeks training, and am in my 3rd week, and feel a constant physical and mental exhaustion. I've changed my diet to be considerably healthier so that I can have more slow-burning energy throughout the day, and I am taking about 7,000 steps a day despite being seated for 8 hours. I know I could easily push through to the full 10,000 if I tried, but by the end of the day I'm so exhausted that I just get straight in the shower, have a cry, eat dinner and go to bed for a full 9 hours sleep.   
At work, we can't decorate our desks as we have new ones each day (based on who arrives first for a shift, basically) and we aren't really allowed to talk or skype each other much unless it's work related. The only interactions I have throughout the day are with great people but we're closely monitored so we can't really just have a chat.   
I have pain in my feet, calves, shoulders and neck despite getting up to stretch and move as much as I can. I have a headache by the end of every day because our work is quite complex and can take a lot of researching to work on.   


Does anyone have any tips on adjusting to this kind of lifestyle?

426,"So, to clarify I am rarely happy and I hardly even know what happy means. I have no real friends in my life, I don't have motivation to do anything (learning for example), and my days are just...don't know how to explain, they are just boring and always the same. Recently I met a girl online waaay older than me, we played, talked every day, she fell in love with me. We tried but it didn't work out so everything went downhill. Now she blocked me everywhere, we fought a lot, etc etc, the usual. I made some mistakes and I apologized for her for more than 2 months and she didn't even give a fuck about that. I'm a very sensitive person so I just can't live with this feeling. She said she won't hurt me, she will love me, I am the only one and now BOOM, she was a liar. I sure made some mistakes but I apologized for it to her nearly every day for 2 months. Today I wrote some things to her, I regret it a bit but she deserved it. She doesn't even care about me, so I guess that I wasn't the ""bad"" person in this whole relationship then friendship thingy. We both were. 

Today I couldn't pass my second driver exam, maybe I am dumb or something, so I lost all my wills to live. Everything happened so fast and I am unable to process it. I don't want to live nor die. I am just hopeless. I am disappointed. I have nothing. The school is shit, I only know my classmates and that's all, I have no friends. I am ugly too, but I would love to have maybe a girlfriend who truly loves me and won't disappoint me like this. I don't know what to do and I feel like there's no hope, my life is miserable. All my classmates have friends, girlfriends or boyfriends, go to parties, and I'm here left alone and I am not able to pass an easy driver exam, and that is my dream to learn how to drive. 

I always felt like that I am betrayed every time, but don't know why. Maybe I deserve it? Am I a bad person, or what? Nobody is listening to me, nobody likes me, nobody understands me so I have to write all of this down because sooner or later I will break. I want to be happy and live a good, successful life. I wanted to be a doctor but I changed my mind, then I wanted to be a cop but some people (family members, teachers, ""friends"") told me that ""you are not good enough for that"", maybe because I am not an active person. I want to help people but you know it's hard when you are hurt like hell by other people, who tell you good things about you and later on they will change their mind and stab you in the back. I am an introvert person, played a lot of video games but I stopped that because of her and now I think that online games and these online friendships are toxic and they just simply not worth your time. Now I want to make friends in real life but I don't even know how or when to start. I haven't achieved anything big in my life like others and I'm always left out from everything. 

Sometimes I feel like everything's okay, and after 2 minutes I feel completely devastated and depressed, I regret things then after 3 minutes I don't and I'm smiling. What is this bullshit? I just want to end it all because I can't cope with these things at all, and I couldn't even express myself correctly because I'm very upset.

Anyone who wants to learn the whole ""online story"" message me please and we'll talk about it. 

What do I want? To be appreciated, loved, and finally to be happy. That's all I want...It hurts when I see my classmates with their gf/bf's, or when I hear them talking about them because I know that nobody will want me and nobody will love me ever. How does being loved feels like? 

I don't know why I deserve so much bad and why good never, or rarely happens to me.

I started A-levels last year but dropped them back In March when lockdown in the UK started. This wasn't the only reason just the final nail that made me give up. The reason this was so easy for me was the fact that I could easily walk into a job with my family. But even at the time I think I knew this wasn't the best route but the easiest. Now I have been working here for 6 months and I really have started to hate every moment. At the moment my ""job title"" is administrative assistant.  But this isn't really correct at all. I mainly do warehouse work. And don't enjoy this at all. 

So my question is the best route for me now ? I'm 19 with 9 GCSE's I think I want to go back into education and go on to do a business degree but im not even sure how to go about this. The other route I see me enjoying is trying to get a job as a trainee estate agent. But I don't know if this is realistic with the current climate.

429,"TL;DR My online friend attempted suicide recently and told me yesterday that I'm the only reason they haven't done it again, and I'm struggling to deal with the pressure of someone depending on me so much


Throwaway account because the friend mentioned is on Reddit.

I've been talking online with this person for just over a year now, we met on a Discord server and we became friends pretty quickly. We've never met in person, all I know is that they live in the same country as me. Over time we started becoming closer, and they started to rely on me more and more. They get depressed very easily and they've been through a lot of abuse amongst other things earlier in their life. 

They're currently in care because their parents didn't want to care for them any more, which has left them completely alone. Throughout all this I've been their only friend and seemingly the only person who cares about them. Recently, they've started becoming more and more dark, talking about how they want to hurt themselves and how they don't deserve to be cared for, and it absolutely broke my heart.

This person recently jumped out of the window in a suicide attempt and broke their leg, and they told me yesterday that they only feel any sort of comfort when talking to me, and I'm the only reason they haven't committed suicide. I talk to them every day whenever I can, but whenever I'm doing something with other friends or even on my own, they get really mad and start hurting themselves.

I want them to get the help they need and I want them to feel better, but I can't handle the pressure of knowing that if I make one wrong move this person might kill themselves. Does anyone have any idea or advice on how I can possibly help them?",21Sep2020,1

So I applied for a sales job at a fairly new bio tech company a couple of weeks ago. They‚Äôre rapidly expanding and are looking to hire a lot of new outside sales reps. I‚Äôm looking to get into the field and have all of the qualifications, military experience, etc. 

Absolutely crushed every interview. Seriously. You know when you do and you know when you don‚Äôt. 

My final interview was Friday with their chief of sales for all of the US. Right off the bat the interview was more of just a conversation. He seemed to be just wanting to feel me out as a person. He talked about the position with me involved in it as if I had already gotten the offer. Talking about what I‚Äôd be doing and not the candidate. 

The CCO was also supposed to be on the call but couldn‚Äôt make it. He‚Äôs the one that has to make the call on it. He‚Äôs COS‚Äôs boss but is very new to the company, COS has been there since the start. 

At the end of the interview I went for the close on the position and in some shape or form asked him if I had his support for this sales position, this is where I want to be and the company I want to grow with. He said ‚Äúyou have my full support for this position‚Äù and something along the lines of having to talk to CCO etc.

431,"Hello all!

I need some advice about something. I've been with my fianc√© for about 4-5 years now, apart from an 8 month break (which is now about a year ago) I had a mental breakdown, psychosis and paranoia which led to me leaving her and sorting my shit out. 8 months later, I got in contact with her and we sorted things out and we've been happier than ever. 

However, during those 8 months she started seeing someone. It started out as just a friend for company (they knew each other before we split) but it ended up leading to them having sex, twice. Which she says was a mistake by both of them.

First off, I don't blame her for that, she thought we were over for good, that I didn't love her, and she found company elsewhere. That's cool. Except that now, I'm having some extremely graphic and intrusive thoughts about her and the other guy having sex. Not to be crude, but kinky sex, too. Stuff that I thought she would only do with me. Every time I close my eyes, or go to sleep, or daydream - it's there. Graphic and just, ugh. Makes me shiver.

I‚Äôm 20 (F) and I‚Äôm a uni student. I did my first year in Cardiff but it was a horrible year for me, my best friend from childhood passed away being hit by a car on my first day at uni and I couldn‚Äôt cope well, excessive drinking and anger and getting kicked out of clubs it was very embarrassing and I didn‚Äôt handle it how I should‚Äôve.
My flatmates were aware of this and supported me however one of them took advantage of me. I was very drunk and went back to my accommodation and it was just the 1 flatmate home who was the only boy in our flat share.
He was sat in the shared kitchen and I stumbled to my room and passed out, forgetting to lock my door. He came into my room whilst I was passed out and sexually assaulted me and I ended up moving to a university back home because I couldn‚Äôt spend another minute in Cardiff. He then bragged to his friends that he had had sex with me and I was distraught because he had raped me.
Since then I had a few sessions of therapy however it was too expensive and as a student I couldn‚Äôt afford it.
I thought I was recovering and met my boyfriend who was great and then ended up cheating on me with his ex 3 times and spoke to her majority of our relationship. I forgave him stupidly because I was so vulnerable and hurting and he hasn‚Äôt cheated and gives me access to his phone and invites me out with him etc.
I just feel like I was getting better after everything and now I am at a complete stand still.
nothing motivates me, i am so irritable, i have pushed everyone away and don‚Äôt want to go out clubbing or anything like that and i‚Äôm basically just existing.
i lost my job due to covid and have bills to pay and no money so that‚Äôs another stress, i can‚Äôt really afford food or clothes and my mum struggles with money too as a single mum so i wouldn‚Äôt want to put that strain on her. i can‚Äôt move back in because i rescued a dog who wouldn‚Äôt get along with hers so i had to move out 
I just feel so alone and depressed I just don‚Äôt want to be here anymore.
I can‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs going to get better which really upsets me because i used to be so full of life and positive and i now feel like a zombie drained of life

434,"I am male, almost 18, and my girlfriend is a 17 years old female.

She has always had trouble with making decisions, she is not honest with herself at all, and I have to pressure her to make decisions SHE wants to make.
She wanted us to get in a relationship, but never wanted to actually do so, and I had to pressure her and comfort her that it's okay and that everything will be alright and such, it was a really long day.
She wanted to open up about her past but again, didn't want to, it wasn't even that bleak as much as it was sad, and again, I had to pressure her to be honest with herself and do what she would love to do.

She has a huge past with relationships, but she still has next to know experience, I practically have to guide her through almost everything. She keeps saying that she is a bad girlfriend and that I am not worth her and such, and even when I say that I don't care and I just want her, because I saw how kind and sweet she can be, how amazing she is, how affectionate her love is, I saw hints of all of that in her, I saw the plum on her back. Even when I say all of that, she keeps denying it, even when she says that she does love me so much, and that her love is true and unconditional.

I have a history of helping people with their issues, that includes things like a past of r*pe, depression, guilt, fear, and so on and so forth. I am not the best, I am not anything special, but I like to think that I at least have some experience when it comes to helping people. I keep telling her that I want to be with her, and that I love everything about her, all her flaws, issues, fears, insecurities, worries, everything, from head to toe. I tell her that if she doesn't think she is good enough or whatever, that she should at least let me carry some of her pain alongside her, let me help her fix herself because no one can fix someone else; they can only give directions, that I am willing to stick along with her, through everything, sweet and sour, that I truly love her more than anything else, but she just doesn't want to give me a chance to help her.

She has been getting increasingly self-hating with time, she keeps distancing herself from everyone- even me -saying that she wants to be alone so that only she can be in pain, no matter how much I tell her that I want to share her pain, she keeps saying that she wants to die, disappear, vanish, and such. She keeps asking me to leave her behind ""So that you don't get hurt"", even when I tell her that I will never leave her, and it she wants me to leave her I would have to be broken and limp on the ground, and that even then I will still try some more.

My thoughts are really scrambled about, so sorry if something doesn't make sense, you can ask me about it in a comment.
Sorry if this is a long post, but I am really in pain, so much, I am in so much pain, knowing that I can't even be near her to comfort her since we are long distance lovers, knowing that I would have to pressure her and possibly hurt her in the process to be able to help her help me help her.

441,"I constantly feel so overwhelmed. I just don't know anymore, my parents won't take me anywhere for help unless im specifically suspecting signs of a mental ilness. There are some specific patterns that I started noticing in my behavior around a year ago and i have absolutely no idea what they mean.

I constantly worry about everything but only when it comes to other people. I know that I am extrenely insecure that I don't really matter as much as I think, and that other people (especially my boyfriend) have subconsioucly have settled for me since they have not searched for a better option. Especially when it comes to my boyfriend, I have absolutely no reason to believe that, he is literally the most amazing, kind and supportive person I have ever met but still. I've noticed that when it comes to practial problem solving I'm so good at keeping calm, but when there is a misunderstanding in one of my relationships with other people, or when someone texts me something like ""whenever u see this text me bc we need to talk"" I will literally start thinking about the worst fucking scenarios, even if most of the time there is nothing going on and no worrying signs.

I also have a constantly decreasing attention span. I remember that until 1-2 years ago I could read countless books and watch tv shows, but now i just cant concentrate on anything that is longer and doesnt constantly keep me stimulated. I feel unable to follow up with most of my teachers at school, unless they are one of those teachers that goes over everything very fast and do not make me feel bored at all. I've noticed that when there are others who teach more ""slowly"" and dont require my full interest and attention, I just cant stay in place. I have to either bite my pen, move my legs and hands, draw something or tap specific patterns with random objects etc. And all of that contradicts the fact that I have been an over achiever who got all 100's without even studying, till now. But I am in my 11th year and I never learned how to study properly because of the fact that everything seemed easy to me and nothing ever mentally stimulated me enough. I just don't know at all.

Also, my body is exhausted 24/7. I had a blood exam done to see if there was anything physically wrong but the results showed there was nothing abnormal. I find myself feeling overwhelmed by everything, I cry literally every single night not knowing why im doing it. Im irritable as fuck with my parents, but unable to feel angry at my friends/my boyfriend, always trying to keep the peace. Im suspecting its because my subconsious worries that they would leave me if i ever lost my patience with them, even if i had a serious reason to. When I am not overthinking or simply have nothing to think about, my mind just shuts down and its like i am ""not there"". 

Im just tired and want someone to understand me like i understand everyone else. I'm not saying that to brag at all, but I am very empathetic and notice when someone is feeling off without them telling me at all. It comes naturally to me to know what exactly needs to be done to help someone, yet no one has ever known me well enough to actually help me since i have already overthough about every possible solution and analysed everything.

443,"Hello!

I‚Äôm a 25 year olds sales support professional and am struggling between two paths before me.

**Path 1:** I work in manufacturing sales support and have for the last 3-4 years. Company has been good to me. Above average pay ($54k that jumps to $59k for an hours differential), benefits, and great people. I‚Äôm very well regarded and lots of high level people have mentioned me being a future leader of the company. There were even plans to get me into the first level of management soon. It‚Äôs a slowly dying industry (-2% each year), but they had plans to enter a new market slowly (5-10 years) that is growing rapidly, they‚Äôve also diversified into a couple other areas, so that they‚Äôd essentially be able to milk the current industry until its not profitable and then easily side step into the new market where they‚Äôd have built a sizable market share in by that time.

Covid-19 forced them to accelerate that plan after demand tanked 20% only 3-4% of which, we expect to return. They laid off 200+ people, including a lot of friends and even a great mentor of mine, as well to reduce costs. There‚Äôs a lot of sudden uncertainty here basically and it‚Äôll be a long while before I can get into a management position,but have been assured that it‚Äôll happen once things stabilize. I work weird hours (10-7) which could soon be an issue as my wife and I are expecting a baby soon and I will have to return to the office once Covid is under control, which is another negative as I‚Äôm a fan of working remote.

**Path 2**: I‚Äôve been applying for new jobs in anticipation for these layoffs. While I survived, I now have a few bites, one of which I‚Äôm interested in, who has also made an offer. It‚Äôs Sales Support but for a tech company mostly established in the Western US. Where my current place is basically the biggest and oldest kid in the playground for their industry with hundreds of corporate employees even after the layoffs, this company is only 6 years old and a couple hundred employees strong total. It‚Äôs done very well so far. So well that they‚Äôre actively expanding into the Eastern US market, secured 100+ million in new funding, and are creating new positions even during Covid. 

Pay is more at $62k, but I lose a 5% 401k match and the job will always be remote, and I‚Äôll get to work 8-4 so gauge that how you will. They‚Äôve also said that they‚Äôre specifically hiring me/this position, to eventually elevate to management and that I‚Äôll manage/train my own sales support team as heads get added to the East Coast side. 

**Dilemma**: Part of me wants to stay in my comfort zone and with the well established market leader. I like what I do and I do it quite well. But there are concerns with how these new plans to enter a new market quickly will go, and the general long term viability of the manufacturing sector.

The other part of me thinks this new position could let me get in at the beginnings of what could become a wildly successful company and I like how they‚Äôre actively growing even during Covid with not having to worry about maintaining such a robust supply chain. Their product and success thus far is impressive for sure also, but I‚Äôm also worried that I may fail as I have little tech experience and may struggle with the industry specific job duties.

So basically do I stick within my comfort zone and see how their plans play out or do I jump into a new and exciting company and build a new career in the tech field? Thanks for any insight guys.",21Sep2020,1
444,"22f here, I have a past of depression, self-harm (clean for half a year!) and anxiety. I still struggle, mostly with anxiety when I‚Äôm out, and depression when I‚Äôm alone. 

I work in the afternoon, and spend most of my morning / noon alone at home. While I want to do things (I write &amp; have a small YT channel) I always just seem to be able to do the bare minimum. 

Sometimes I lay in bed, or sit in my room, and look at a wall for 3 hours, while actively hating myself for not doing anything. I know I don‚Äôt have tk be productive 24/7, but it just sucks when I WANT to do something, but am not physically able to get up and do it. 

Does anyone know any ways to get myself out of this state? This happens to me all the time, when I‚Äôm alone. Sometimes I can beat it with deadlines, but sometimes not even that is enough. 

I‚Äôm so sick of seeing my time wasted, because I cannot bring myself to get up and do stuff.",21Sep2020,1
445,"So, I‚Äôve been making a lot of terrible decisions lately...a lot. 2020 has been a shitstorm of a year for many people, including myself.

I was laid off in March. I had been with the company for eight years and had enough of their shit. The new managers that I‚Äôd had for the past three months did nothing, no communication, no meetings, nada. I was sick of the culture and the crap. When I left, there was no checklist done, nothing. I just left the office and that was that. 

I took the laptop. Yep, I did. And I didn‚Äôt feel bad about it. But after making some foolhardy decisions on top of that one, I‚Äôve stepped back and thought about a lot of the lousy decisions I‚Äôve been making. 

I hadn‚Äôt done much with the computer since I left, used it a bit. But I just randomly decided a couple weeks ago to wipe it. So, I did. 

Here‚Äôs the thing, I want to return it now. It‚Äôs been six months and I‚Äôm not sure how to go about it. I know a couple of guys in IT, but I feel like such a scoundrel. It‚Äôs obviously not a mistake, especially since I wiped it. 

I think I can safely assume they have record of me not returning the device, though they never reached out to me. I could continue to play dumb, in the unlikely event that they reach out to me, but I really just want the thing off my hands to clear my conscience. 

I thought about having my partner drop it off a reception, so I don‚Äôt physically have to go in and bump into anyone I know. 

Should I keep it or just leave it? 

Not that I want to go back ever, but how do I know if they‚Äôd rehire me? And if they know I have it, why didn‚Äôt they ask for it back? 

Just wondering...",21Sep2020,1
446,"My dad is really ferocious. He seems to get angry over everything. If I do anything that he isn't 100% satisfied with, he starts yelling at me. He usually jumps and wiggles around and screams his head off, his face turns pinkish red, his eyes bulge out, and he pounds his chest wildly. It's so scary when he does that. I wouldn't be surprised if he had psychological disorders or mental problems. He has a very distinctive walking pattern, and I know it's him when I hear his walking rhythm. I always have to hide what I'm doing and pretend like I'm reading or doing my homework. He always finds a reason to criticize or lecture me.

And then when he lectures me, it always take about an hour. I can't help but want to teleport away when he talks to me. When he talks, he always hits the palm of his left hand with his right hand, as if he's cutting bread. He also bites his lower lip and makes really annoying sounds. I don't know why, but I just feel so annoyed when he does that. When he's around me, he burps without even bothering to apologize, and it smells horrible afterward. I just want to yell at him when he does that.

He just wants to get me in trouble. I feel very insecure around him, and because he is ugly, fat, and rude, I see him as an enemy. Recently, our relationship has been going downhill. We are often butting heads, and I get very defensive when he's around. He also finds fault with everything I do and tries to highlight my shortcomings. Meanwhile, I am disgusted by my dad.

447,"Here's the situation:

\- I got a job at a major bank as a teller. I've only been there for 3 months but they already moved me into the head teller position. They are aware that I am doing my master's and have tried to be as flexible as they can with my schedule (2 days a week). 

\- There is opportunity for growth at this branch as the manager and I have discussed moving me into corporate or financial advising. However, there also has been some empty promises and a hiring freeze with covid. 

\- Because of covid I had to move home to a city 1.5 hours away from where I work. So when I am working I commute. I wake up at 5 am to make it into the city for 8:30 am, work until 5 pm, and get home around 9 pm or sleep over at a friend's house. So this schedule wastes a good 2 days for me that could be used on studying. 

\- I'm doing my MBA and classes are Monday to Thursday every week except for the third week of the month which is Monday to Saturday. At this point I feel like I'm studying every single moment I have free to try and keep up. 

\- I'm 23 for reference. I feel like I need to quit because I can barely keep up with my master's and I'm not sleeping/tired all the time. I'm scared if I quit I'm wasting a good career opportunity and I'll never get it again.

448,"I‚Äôm 17. I met a guy online, on reddit, where I was pretending to be 19. He never asked if it was the truth, and I never told him any different. At the time, I was 16. He told me he was 25, but I didn‚Äôt think anything would end up happening between us. I thought he would be in my life for a day, maybe a week at most. But then we really hit it off. After a couple of weeks maybe, he told me he had just turned 20 a couple days after we started talking. Still, I didn‚Äôt think we would get close and I didn‚Äôt tell him my real age. I turned 17 a few months later, and he said happy birthday, thinking I had turned 20 as well. Well I still haven‚Äôt told him, and last night I was planning to but I had a panic attack on call with him because I‚Äôm so scared of losing him. It has been almost a year since we started talking, and we haven‚Äôt met in real life, and I thought we never would, because he lives in a different country. But he is moving to my country for university next year, and won‚Äôt be far from the town that I live in. This university was also the one I was planning on going to, but I would of course be in a lower year. I‚Äôm scared of telling him, because we talk constantly. There hasn‚Äôt been a day that we haven‚Äôt spoken for hours. And during the time we have been together, I have gone through a lot, and he has helped me with it so much.

My partner is starting to hate his job and doesn‚Äôt get along with his coworkers, but at a time like this is just grateful he has a secure job. 

So this is where our dilemma comes in- I have to be in the office 3 days per week and so have decided to stay with my parents for these days and then commute back to the city (about 2hrs) to work from home for the remainder of the week. While I‚Äôm fine with this in the short term, my ideal scenario would be that we move closer to my new job and then he looks for a new job in the area. However, he has quite a specialist job and so would have to change roles for this to work. I know I‚Äôm asking him to take on a lot by moving job role, company and area all for me, but I‚Äôm also doing the same to try and start my career. I now have 2 days before I sign the contracts to decide how this will work, where we will live and whether I even want the job or should just continue job hunting in the city.

451,"I will be posting this same question in other sub reddits as well because I am looking for more thoughts, thank you.

I am wondering if anyone can tell me that they also had the same issue when their children were still young that you as a parent have some sleep disturbances most nights.

I have had problems since I was young. Earliest I can remember is 1st grade. So I am not not familiar with sleep walkings, talking or just seeing things that aren't there. I have not gone into anything online if there is anything going on. I always saw it as it is something that many people do and it just happens. It happens very often for me.

Since growing older and now having 1 child the things I see have changed from me trying to get my hamster out from the bed(who wasn't really there, sleepwalking) to seeing my child stuck, falling off the bed, not eating, just some sort of situation that is not happening. It can happen almost everynight. I have not brought it up to a doctor before mainly because I don't know what to say and also because I don't know if they will give me pills which I don't want. I have gotten more worried in these episodes and I just don't want them anymore. I get very real dreams or night terrors. They have progressed since having a miscarriage and then pregnancy. I went through a time after my miscarriage where I can feel it happen all over again almost every night for the next few months after that loss. I just don't know if this is something that can be corrected or not. Is there anyone that has any tips or thoughts please?",21Sep2020,1

457,"I got employed on December 2018 in a local bank as a bank teller. things were pretty normal for the first few months but then I knew why so many people just quit their jobs there. So I got assigned in a small branch with 2 other staff one being the manager and the other have different title.

My shift starts at 9:30 and ends at 1:30 and then from 5:00 to 8:00. since the branch is inside a mall, some times it is hard to find parking and the walk from the parking to the branch is about 5 minutes walk which is not that much. 

around May 2019 my father got very sick and was moved  to the emergency room and went to do a surgery, I called my manager and said I can't make it since I have to be there for my family. They said No since I have part of the vault key and other keys as well and also they said why didn't I inform them before. Ever since that happened I started to hate the place because they don't treat the staff as humans and they expect us to just work and say yes to everything they say. 

A Month later I caught cold and had a flue, cant work or can barely move but they declined my sick leaves because I have not told them prior to my sickness and they don't have back up staff. so I took all my medicines and work there. Since it is a bank they want me to smile and advertise everything all the time but I couldn't that period and then I got a bad performance for the month.

Around September I decided to take 2 weeks off for October as a vacation leave and since there is no back up employee like always, they rejected but then after so many emails sent they barely agreed. 

Covid-19 Happened and total lock down started in my country on march, so we stay home and then we moved to partial lock. so banks started to open partially but malls and other places still closed. I get a call from my manager saying I must go to work on something that is not my job requirement. I can't do anything because all my stuff are locked up in the vault inside the mall's branch. They have told me just do anything and dont stay at home. For like a month my job was only to take people's temperature because fuck me why should i stay at home safe from covid. 

Just last Saturday I woke up feeling very sick. Headaches, fever, dry cough, sore throat. I war thinking it was the covid-19 so I immediately call my manager and let him know, his respond was "" don't come to work on sunday, take the test and let me know"". I go to take the test and thankfully its negative, its just regular flu. Anyways I'm still feeling a bit tired, with constant headache and I feel super lazy to do anything but manager says i don't care, come to work . Note that every staff is allowed 15 sick leaves each year, I have taken none and they only allowed me to stay home the past 2 days is cuz of possible covid case. Now that it is confirmed its not covid, fuck me they dont even care if im sick or not they just want me to work. 

I have saved around 20k $ and have only a 1k$ bills each month. I'm thinking of quitting and staying home until I find a better option instead of staying  there and look for more. I hate working there and my hate grows every single day but im still hesitant if I should go for it or not",21Sep2020,1

My Parents Called the Police

I‚Äôm honestly so anxious and paranoid even thinking about this and it‚Äôs hard to think about too much due to my anxiety, but I need to know if I‚Äôm being an asshole for being upset and angry. I‚Äôm a college student 4 hours away from home, and had spent an all nighter working on schoolwork and projects. My phone was on silent and on the ground so I couldn‚Äôt hear or feel it when my mom called me at 9am (like she usually does to make sure I‚Äôm up for classes) so I slept through it, and due to sleep schedule being shit I didn‚Äôt wake up until 2-3pm. 
I didn‚Äôt wake up on my own though. 

My roommate and police were knocking on my door and I woke up to two police officers looking at me and my roommate looking concerned. My parents call me afterwards and I get screamed at for not picking up the phone and am told that if it happens again I‚Äôm being sent home without second thought, and they yell at me more for not showing my face on video call because I was having an anxiety attack and crying and shaking.

I‚Äôm so paranoid from mania and just general anxiety from it for some reason and I don‚Äôt know what to do, and they‚Äôre angry with me for being upset about everything.

Am I a shitty person

I feel like I could be a shitty person because they said they only did it because they were worried, but I feel not okay with it

Edit: because of questions, I suffer from bipolar disorder and did have harm issues maybe 6, 7 or more years ago if that helps give information. I‚Äôm a freshman in college and further away from them, but things have always seemed different from the way they treat me and my older brother. They always assume I‚Äôm up to something I feel, but they always say they just worry more.
Sometimes it feels like I don‚Äôt have full control of anything I do or say so in my future.",21Sep2020,1
467,"Since I don't really know where to start I'll just dig right in. Basically, my best friend of 8 years, who I consider my brother in the most literal sense, and I haven't spoked to in four months because I built up quite a bit of resentment over the year and lashed out at him in the worst way possible.

Things have not been the same between us for quite a while now and he is not the biggest fan of communicating issues so things were kept bottled up inside, at least for me. Things really took a turn when he didn't proofread an essential 35 page essay I had written for university and which was **super** important for my final grade. Somehow I sensed he wouldn't do it the week before so I urged him to tell me honestly, since I'd pay a professional to proof read it in that case. I actually asked him a couple of times but he always reassured me he'd do it. Of course, he failed to do so and went out to hang out with his friends instead. Since this was all super last minute, I couldn't engage a professional anymore and had no one to proof read the paper (super specific topic) and I had to hand it in without anyone else giving it a second glance. This all happened during a really stressful phase as I was awaiting my final test results which were basically determining if I could keep studying the subject I was studying (the phase lasted for 5 months so it was nerve-racking to say the least). Finding out I could not rely on my friend when I really needed him was an additional burden and really hurt me. Worse though, he did not apologize at all and we didn't have any contact for four weeks. Over the years, I've grown scared of losing him and even though the breach of trust was major, I reached out to him and asked him why he hadn't apologised. Looking back, I don't think I should have done that as that's not how wounds heal. He apologised  but couldn't really come up with an explanation and I decided to move past it because I thought I could, or so I thought.

A couple of weeks later, he visited me and all seemed to be going quite well until he ditched our plans to have a one night stand (with somewhat of a reality star) the last night and came back at 2 am. The next day, I couldn't look at or talk to him. Even though I was trying to forgive him, the wounds were still fresher than I'd have liked and any wrong doing sent me spiralling back into all those hurt feelings. As I said, I don't think I should have reached out to him in the first place as it was his responsibility to do so and by overextending myself, I made things worse in the long-run.

Again, we made up until things fell apart for good. We used to talk on the phone a lot and more often than not, he'd hang up, telling me he'd call back a few minutes later, only to not contact me at all. I asked him to at least notify me should something come up and he made it sound really pathetic. I tried to cool down the situation by asking him to talk about it later but it was too late and we both wouldn't stop so I went into a full-blown pissed off modus and started insulting him quite personally, saying he sucked the energy out of all his friends without reciprocating anything, was the weakest person I knew and was a really egocentric narcissist who'd gaslight anyone who tried to point this out. It was really bad and I sent him links to undermine this self-made diagnosis. I'm a full-grown adult and obviously shouldn't have behaved this way. I told him I didn't want to be friends anymore and I felt this was the truth for the two months that followed as well, physically feeling the resentment when I'd even think of him.

Then I was in his city for business and slowly started seeing him as a human being again. I asked him to meet up neutrally, to which he didn't respond. A month later, I was in the city again and really drunk and asked him if he wanted to come to an event to have fun. The next day, sobered up I left him a voice mail apologising for that kind of behaviour and telling him I really wanted to apologise for the verbal attack and also think we should talk things out. Still, nothing.

Last week, I moved to this city. At this point, I did not want to initiate any contact with him because I was hurt I'd always been the one to make the first move to reconcile, even if he was the one who'd messed up in the past. When a mutual friend told me some rather sweet things he said in a very drunk state, I ended up sending him really emotional voice messages. The next day, I realised though everything I'd said in those messages was what I truly felt, things were a little distorted as as drunk as I was, I'd forgotten about my hurt feelings and my resentment which were very much there. He'd told our mutual friend he couldn't understand how I could even contact him without apologising first and it still pisses me off a little that he can't even message me when he messes up, but expects me to behave perfectly when I mess up. Anyway, I sent him a last clarifying message, saying I was not nearly as healed and ready to talk as I thought I was and sorry for being such a bother the last weeks.

In case you've come so far, you must understand what a huge mess this all is and how my follow up behaviour hasn't contributed to anything getting solved whatsoever. I simply don't know what to do anymore. In my ideal world, we'd meet up, talk about all our wrong doings and make up. But in reality, the other party does not always react the way we'd like to, intensifying the hurt and causing more damage.

On on hand, I feel  the friendship is too broken and cannot be fixed anymore. On the other, this is hurting me more than I'd have thought possible. I don't know what to think and what to do. I've always tried to be a good friend and valued the friendship, trying to forgive things I probably shouldn't have tried to forgive. Usually I don't have this big of a problem with leaving broken friendships but we've known each other since school and studied the same subject and also grown over the years. It's really messing me up. I would like to stop resenting him but at the same time, my ego is sick and tired of being the doormat and overextending myself.

What is your advice? Please be kind.

Thank you.",21Sep2020,1

475,"Hey, so since the beginning of working at this doggy daycare (about 2 months) I'm not so sure about it because on my first day, people where already talking about quitting/finding another job and since then it's been a rotating door for people to come in and then leave.

476,"Hi, I‚Äôm 16 and i have two brothers: 14 and 6. I am talking about this 14 yo one and he‚Äôs the physically strongest in the family. We don‚Äôt live with our dad because of his work, only with mom.

4 years ago, we moved to Canada. We had to learn new languages(english/french). It was very stressful but now we‚Äôre all adapted, we‚Äôre totally fine.

However, I feel like that‚Äôs the moment where my brother started to be so abusive. He always complained about how we moved here without his agreement (Of course he said yes with full happiness)

And now, he‚Äôs just a trash. He swears and yells at mom a lot that I feel hurt too. He attacks my mom‚Äôs weaknesses and how she‚Äôs not being responsible of her child. He used to kick and hit her a lot, but now it happens rarely since when I called the police this summer. But swearing? It happens almost everyday. We tried to talk to him seriously, but he refused it by yelling at us. (Talking about the police, they said they can‚Äôt punish him because of the child protection law, but could punish our mom.)

Also, he judges every single gesture of my youngest brother. When he talks in the backyard, runs in the house, finishes his dish later than others, make a little noise when he plays, even when he laughs. Until he turns 5, he used to get hit for a simple reason, such as, leaving one lego piece on the floor or just interrupting his mood. Because of the 14 one, when he was 2, he harmed himself by hitting his own head at the wall. He doesn‚Äôt hit him anymore, but now he‚Äôs strict than army.

Lastly, against me and my dad. He threatened me once that he‚Äôd hit me just before I die. Since that moment, we don‚Äôt care about each other. My dad tried to stop him by calling him, but it was no use.

I think my parents never did something wrong. They‚Äôre really chill and supportive, I love my parents. But only one thing, they get mad at us when we don‚Äôt do our homework, skip classes, are late or play games until 3am. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs so hard to respect those rules.

The whole family, especially our mom is tired of this situation now.

What should I do? Please give me some advices.",21Sep2020,1
477,"Hi so my close friend and I are both 27. She recently became friends with this girl. Each time we get together/drink etc, the girl gives her molly too (she then tells me because we‚Äôre close). I guess my question is should I be concerned? Not going to lie- I‚Äôve done molly when I was younger a few times. Now that I‚Äôm 27 though I‚Äôm just no longer interested in things like that. I know it‚Äôs kind of hypocritical since I‚Äôve done it in the past but when I did do it, it was a group thing or at like a concert. Plus I was a lot younger and more naive. It just seems weird to do molly every time they drink. Is this worth a conversation or am I being too protective?",21Sep2020,1
478,"I had to cut off 80 percent of my closest friends who are like family to me because they don‚Äôt believe that asking a woman repeatedly for sex until she gives in is not a form of rape but just a guy being ‚Äúcreepy‚Äù

I‚Äôm literally sick to my stomach writing this. These aren‚Äôt random dudes i just know from work. These are people i grew up with, guys i shared intimate details and moments with. One of them even has two daughters. We‚Äôre all just young men in our early twenties but i feel so disgusted. How could they really think like this? I tried explaining to them the nuances of coercive sex and pressuring a woman can have serious psychological impacts on her afterwards but they kept saying she ‚Äúshould have walked away.‚Äù 

We always talked about looking after each others kids if one of us were to die early. What if my future daughter came to them in confidence and they said this to her? I know it seems crazy to think that far ahead but these guys clearly are fundamentally morally corrupt. These men would have access to my family and while i doubt they personally would do anything to my family, they certainly wouldn‚Äôt protect them like we promised to do. I see that now. 

My closest friend told me that his friend asked a girl for head ten times until she said yes.....10 times!???? Dude wtf I don‚Äôt even know what to say. And he defended that friend by saying it wasn‚Äôt rape and she lied on him..... He even told me he‚Äôs friends with another dude who was found innocent of THREE different sexual assault cases by THREE DIFFERENT WOMEN. What are the odds he was falsely accused three times? What about the women who did not take him to court? He essentially did not care and said he was found innocent. I feel like I‚Äôm losing my sanity. Am i wrong here? Is it really not rape or a form of rape? Am I overreacting? Someone please tell me because I literally am having a meltdown right now.",21Sep2020,1
479,"Hello, the title pretty much says it all.

It all started when I was around 16/17 when my father died, which of course wasn‚Äôt easy but for some reason has made me a very nervous and skittish person ever since.

Some of the worst examples; someone turned on a light switch behind me and the noise visibly startled me.

A tutor in college had a very abrupt voice and whenever she‚Äôd speak (if she wasn‚Äôt in view or I was focused on work) I‚Äôd jolt, but would sometime happen with classmates too.

The third would be in the *middle* of a conversation, the person spoke just a little louder and I jumped.

In terms of movement, if I‚Äôm sitting by a door and someone walks past, I get spooked and tensed up.

Yesterday it happened twice in under an hour and once more today, people are starting to tread on eggshells around me but I just want to not freak out in the first place.

Not to boast, but I am intelligent and have been told so many times. I write my own stories, songs, screenplays and I want to become an actor when I grow up. I'm good at maths too.

486,"A few months ago around 4am myself and my husband were woken up by loud hammering, things crashing and a drill. It continued until 6am. I called security and it stopped. Then silence for a bit until now

Suddenly my upstairs neighbors are up all night and the worst part is loud sudden crashing. I am a heavy sleeper and I‚Äôve been woken up this past week or two because in the dead of night they are crashing things above my head. 

The walls in our apartment shake it scares our dog and it‚Äôs so hard and loud I‚Äôm surprised they haven‚Äôt made a hole in our ceiling. 

My husband speculated that they lift weights (as in exercising) and are then throwing the weights on the floor. I also hear a vacuum around 1am just about everyday now and stomping/running. Possibly some kind of nocturnal exercise routine. 

Twice now I‚Äôve had to call because of the noise. However some nights it‚Äôs mostly quiet except for one or two loud bangs/crashing. It doesn‚Äôt seem fair to call if they only made one or two loud noises but at the same time I‚Äôm constantly being woken up now and I‚Äôm an essential worker who already has trouble sleeping without this. 

I don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôve been doing (or snorting) the last week or two but the overnight routine is killing me. I hear constant noise. It‚Äôs only quiet for 3-4 hours a day. It would seem they‚Äôre trying to chill out at night but it‚Äôs very loud during the day too. 

I don‚Äôt want to be a Karen and call if they‚Äôve only made one or two crashes that shake my bed and wake me up at night but I don‚Äôt know what else to do. Our building also does nothing about anything so I don‚Äôt know how helpful that would be.

489,"I work night shift and i live in an apartment building that my grandma owns. Theres 4 apartments here in a 2 floor building. So i'm above a family of 5 or 6 people. 

Little backstory. The people downstairs have caused a lot of issues in the past. Multiple tenets have left from the apartment I'm in because the family is so loud. Their kids screech like hellish demons when they are not at school. The father screams at his wife constantly. They play music obnoxiously loud, way too often. I knew all this going into it but I had no choice.

Well this past Saturday night I got very drunk and loudly played Fall Guys with friends. I dont remember most of the night, but about 7am I was trying to sober up and go to sleep, and one kid was screaming louder than normal. About 30 minutes go by and I stomp 3 times to signal that they were loud. The man responded my knocking back and yelling ""what do you want""

I didnt say anything. I just went to try and soothe my stomach. The kid shut up and was immediately followed by extremely loud music. I couldnt understand my tv because of the music. I didnt want to piss him off so I tried to sleep again. Over an hour goes by and  there was no way I was sleeping with that music so I called my mom to complain. I could of called my grandma, but I'm not that close to her and I mainly wanted to vent.

Mom eventually brings me pepto and stops by to talk to the family, just to ask them to be quieter. I had passed out by the time she dropped off the stuff, but I called her and asked how it went. Mom said she heard the father screaming at his family from the parking lot. 

The man apparently screamed and cussed out my mom, saying I was loud every night. He said his children always hear me having sex and that they have even come into their room at night and said ""we cant sleep, because they are fucking again"". He blames me for the fact that his kids know cuss words. He says he can hear me and my boyfriend screaming and cussing at eachother every night. And a lot of other lies.

I'm at work every night of the week except thursday and saturday nights. So they arent hearing me every night. My boyfriend is very soft spoken, and we have never raised our voices at eachother. Hes only able to spend spend the night at my place once every 2 or 3 weeks because of our jobs and the fact he lives an hour away. I also find it hard to believe his kids hear me having sex, because the parents room is below my room, not the kids room.

The whole thing was fucked up. I dont like how he treated my mother. I never even knew I was being too loud, they have never told me. They have never knocked or anything. 

So basically I need advice on what to do now. I'm going to be more aware of how loud I am, that's a given. But should I bring this up with my grandma? Am I stupid for trying to get them to be quiet? Am I being an asshole for making an issue out of this? Should I speak to the people downstairs (my mother doesnt recommend this because she is afraid of the man now and because of my terrible anxiety) or should I just not give a fuck because they have been loud assholes to multiple people for years? I'd love to hear any advice that can help me fix this and finally have good sleep.",21Sep2020,1
490,"This has been eating away at me for quite a few months  now and over time it has progressively started to bother me more. 

I've known this dude for almost 2 years now and he is a genuinely good person and we do click, but in some topics I often feel as if I'm walking a minefield. 
We argue all of the time, and they're pretty big arguments vast majority of the time and there has been instances when this guy has actually hurt me with what he's said.

I've turned to a few friends for their opinions and they have said it would be better if we did just go our separate ways from one another.

Very recently, we spoke about some things, and these some things very important to me and I value them more than what I value my friendship with him; and although we weren't at each others throats and we were just having a 4am heart to heart, what he said regarding said important issues really messed me up a bit.

I think she genuinely believes these videos are helping people or something, but I personally find it quite offensive because my mum works in a care home and I've been trying to make sure she stays as safe as possible, also her residents who are obviously vulnerable.  
Cases in the UK are rising exponentially again and yet we've got people not wearing masks and mingling in bars, I just can't agree with it at all.

492,"19(f) here.
I was going through Facebook last night and a video came through my timeline. It was a CCTV footage of a teacher at a religious school who literally tied the hands and legs of a little kid (probably around 10 yr old) and beat him up like a monster using a stick.
I decided to watch the entirety of it (the worst decision I made this year). I hadn't realised it would, but it triggered so many emotions and childhood incidents I had put so far behind in my head that I forgot they ever even happened. 

I was trying to look through all the years and just try and figure out why it traumatised me the way it did, and one of the things that resurfaced in my memory, even though I can't see any correlation of it with the aforementioned, was this:  

For starters, I'm very shocked as to how I could bury it in my head like it never happened. 
When I was around 9 years old (or maybe even 8, I don't quite remember the exact time it started) my sister who is just 3 years older than me, started doing weird things with me. She'd tell me things like ""you know what boys and girls do"" and then whilst explaining things like kissing and getting naked she'd proceed to do the same with me. She'd kiss me on the lips and strip me down and lie on top of me. And do things. (There was no masturbation or rubbing of any sort tho. I didn't even know what sex drive or masturbation was till I was 14) 

I remember being okay with it and doing the same to her what she did to me. 

This continued until I was around 12/13. I found God and became religious, hence put a stop to it. 

I haven't been able to do anything properly since last night.
I'm traumatised. 
I'm not being able to talk to her about this because she's in a very suicidal and messed up place for her personal reasons. I don't want to add to that. 

But right now I'm terribly angry at her for doing this to me. I'm so much angrier at myself for going through with it without any sort of repulsion. Why didn't I stop her? Why didn't I protest? 
I mean she was also a child when she started but why would she do it to me?
Who tf do I blame? Her? Myself?

PS. I can't visit a therapist right now due to financial + COVID-19 reasons.

504,"Ever since graduating high school and shifting from the innocent and daydreaming teenager to being close to graduating college, discovering new things, especially related to the internet, has been a huge source of discontent and sadness for me, even if it's only temporary. For example

Me as a kid: -discovers a new community or a game, and then discovers a ton of new content creators on youtube and twitch and gets excited at all the entertainment I can indulge in-

Me now: -discovers a new community or a game, and then realizes how there's an entire group of people that have built something for themselves, which makes me evaluate what I've done, and usually that entails me feeling like I've wasted my time doing nothing of worth-

I have a really nasty case of grass is greener on the other side. I only really use youtube and reddit for social media, but whenever I discover something new now, it turns into this painful reminder that like, ""Why the hell did you not know about this long ago? What were you doing up until now?"" criticality. I'm not depressed, nor do these episodes last any longer than maybe a day or two, but it really bothers me that I went from being curious and interested in other people's bowls, to now looking at other people's bowls and seeing how much more delicious theirs is, and also how much more food they have. If you guys get that analogy.

I keep reading articles and books about being content with what you have, such as counting your blessings. That being said, while I am physically content with my life, mentally not so much. I know my calling in life, but now I struggle with my resolve wavering every time I find something new. Whenever I do, it turns into this dilemma of ""should I be a cook/singer/comedian/artist/athlete/economist/etc.etc.etc.etc.? or should I stick to my current dream?""

509,"Hi. I have been with my GF for 4 years. We both have children from previous relationships. I have 2 and she has 1. I have a good relationship with her child and treat him the same as my own.

  My issue is she has no relationship at all with my children and won't even try. She barely knows them. Because of this I have lost confidence in our relationship and am not as happy as I used to be.

  I have tried talking to her about this but she says for her to try and have a relationship with my children I need to get back to how I used to be (even though i have explained that this is the reason I'm unhappy). She says that our relationship should be the priority and that needs to be 100% before she even tries.

  Sorry if this doesn't make much sense. What would you do in a situation like this? Would you end the relationship? Thank you.",21Sep2020,1
510,"I just want to clarify I‚Äôm not asking for medical advice so I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm breaking rule 3 but correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. Sorry if this is long winded this is my first time asking for advice like this. 

Anyways to preface this, I (21f) come from a very southern baptist family who are all about the traditional ‚Äúno sex before marriage‚Äù ‚Äúno abortion‚Äù and my mom more so than my dad is against living together before marriage, just to show how strict they can be. 

I denounced the faith a few years back but because I live with them still while I attend college (which they pay for in full, including my apartment) I have not told them in fear that they may force me to do XYZ, including affecting my 4yr relationship with my bf. (When my cousin had come out as gay they were not-so-low-key about their disapproval for it and she is not a fan of my brother letting his gf live in his own house with him but she can‚Äôt affect his life as much as she can mine right now) 

The thing is that I‚Äôve been sexually active with my bf (my first partner ever) for years but have never been to a gynecologist because my mother believes I shouldn‚Äôt need to without a reason, but this is also because she doesn‚Äôt know I‚Äôm sexually active (which I just kinda confirmed this only an hour ago). I have only been once with her when I was younger over issues with period cramps but never since. I know I should be going at least once a year but I don‚Äôt know how to do such without them knowing and thereby suspecting something that could compromise my secret(s). I am on their health insurance and I can‚Äôt afford anything of my own right now as I have no personal source of income, and while I‚Äôm not 100% on how that works I‚Äôm assuming they‚Äôd find out eventually it‚Äôs been used on a gynecologist trip. 

I want to go not only for the general visit (my regular doctor has performed a pap smear already and I guess she thinks this is enough?) but because I‚Äôm interested in starting birth control for multiple reasons. Of course, if I start bc without reason she/they‚Äôd be suspecting. I am trying to go to a dermatologist under the guise of period-tied acne (not false I find my acne very tied to ‚Äúthat time of month‚Äù and I‚Äôm hoping bc will help with it) but if they don‚Äôt recommend that, I have no other way of being able to start bc without them suspecting. 

Is there anyone who has any recommendations about how I can go about this? I just know because of their religious views that some sort of consequences will come to me if they ever find out I‚Äôm sexually active and since they do provide me free living when I‚Äôm home and pay for my college and apartment I would really hope to not anger them.",21Sep2020,1

So I‚Äôm 24 and I have always hoarded money, it goes back to when I was a child and I was not even able to spend Sims moneyüòÖ

I managed to save 20K and last week I also sold my house and made a clear 60k in profit so right now I have like 80k total

The house thing was so stressful I promised myself I take a little vacation when I‚Äôd be done and now that it would be time to do it, I‚Äôm just freaking out

The whole thing I had planned would cost me a little over 1000$ and spending that amount of money freaks me out.. I‚Äôve never paid a vacation for myself, I buy cheap things..

515,"The job I have now is a good job. Any job right now is a good job. But it's sucking my soul out of me. It's not a job in a field I'm particularly passionate in, it's not what I have a degree in at all. But when I took the job I figured it'd be a good day job that could develop my professional and business skills which I could then take to a new job in a field I am passionate in. Enter covid. 

I was actually excited to start this job, I went from a retail job to an office job so it was a huuuuuge improvement. I was one month in role when we went to working from home. At this point I've been working remote longer then it took my training and onboarding and first month of role combined. Most of my time actually working has been remote, which trying to gain on job learning and experience has been like bumbling in the dark on an island. My job is stressful and it's having a major affect on my personal life and mental state. 

It's not like I can quit my job, not with COVID. Where would I go? But if I got laid off, I can't say I'd be upset. They just laid of my manager, and now my team is moving to a new manager whose going to be putting a LOT more pressure on us. I don't know what I can do. I can't quit, I can't move to a new role in the company, I can't give up and not work because BILLS. But I can't keep doing this. I feel trapped in a job I hate with no way out.

516,"Hello everyone of r/advice. I need some advice on what's going on right now in my life. First I'll tell you about myself and the situation. 

I went to college aiming to get into a radiography program to become an x-ray tech. I can tell you this wasn't my idea because I didn't know what I wanted at the time and just went with whatever my mom told me to do. I tried hard to get into the program but was unsuccessful 3 times. I gave it up. instead I graduated college with an associated in liberal arts. During this time I had been working at a chick fil a for a while (almost 6 years). Working there started off fun but eventually as time went by and management continued to change, the job became hell. 

I was miserable but for some reason still cared about the store I was working. I tried my best and continued to bare with the horrible and draining work environment. Another reason for staying there was the fact I was making $15.50 as a regular team member. They paid me that much because they valued me as an employee and wanted me around. But, at some point, enough was enough and so I decided to move on.

Now I work with a company delivering amazon packages. The pay is $15 an hour and I am scheduled 40 hours a week. However I started working I learned that even though I am scheduled 40 hours a week I don't actually work those hours. The way it works is every route I have an rts (return to station) time, and my boss wants us back by that time. Granted I was new and was on what they called nursery routes. nursery routes are smaller routes given to new people so they can get used to the job. The rts given to me is usually 2pm or 3pm or 4pm. I started work everyday at 9:30am but we left the station to start delivering around 10:30am. This means if my rts was 2pm I had only 4 hours to deliver all my packages to make it back at my rts time. Most of my routes were 40 mins away from the station. As you can see by these times, I was not working the 40 hours a week that I was scheduled. 

The current situation is this. I was injured on the job and haven't worked in a few weeks. Before I was injured my boss and the dispatchers told me I was doing a good job. When I got injured however, my boss started to tell me that he checked my clock out times and based on those my performance was actually lacking and he was wondering if I could even do the job. during this time my boss was very uncooperative and wouldn't answer any messages with questions that I had. I started to get the feeling he wanted to let me go. My workers compensation claim was denied because it was deemed not to be an accident because I didn't fall or slip. I'm feeling better now and would like to go back to work however they need documents from a doctor stating I can work but I don't have health insurance to pay for a doctors visit a long with the fact I have worked in weeks and I have bills coming up that need to be paid. I also am trying to go back to college for a computer science degree. 

I don't know what to do guys. My fear is if I pay for a doctors visit to get those documents to let me work that they will then let me go because of my lacking performance. I've been searching for jobs in my area but i have experience for none of them because most of my work experience is fast food. I really want to get out of fast food and grow in life but I just don't know how to get away from it. My girlfriend told me she would be angry with me if I went back to chick fil a. Also it would be embarrassing I guess going back to a job I left only a month ago. Should I just go with it and hope they don't let me go from my current job? or should I leave the job and try for something else which pays less? should I go back to chick fil a? 

Sorry for the long post but I just needed to share all the information. I'm so stressed by this to the point I'm barely sleeping just thinking about what to do.",21Sep2020,1
517,"This seems kind of like of those theoretical problems, but I‚Äôm thinking that on my road to recovery, I need to confront my past directly by contacting my old bullies and telling them off.

519,"This isn't probably the best place to post this, but I've been wondering - am I lying to everyone for attention?

Lately I've been feeling really suicidal and sad, I even thought I would actually do it, so I decided to tell my friends and spend time with them as 'for the last time'. Though I know for a fact I'm not going to do it. I just feel really suicidal for a day and then I'm sad/neutral, but way less suicidal. 

One side of me says no - because one day I will not be afraid to end my life, so I must be careful, and the other one thinks that I'm going to be fine, it's just my little dramas and me craving for love, care and attention. Or maybe it's just an impulse?

Am I lying to everyone, even myself, that I'm going to end my life? Do I really crave attention that much?

520,"Sorry if my grammar is awful! I wrote this in a hurry. 

As of late, I've been talking to this stereotypical druggie drain-gang guy with face tattoos, lanky, peircings, and a perc addiction. He was so sweet at first and I totally fell head over heels for this dude, we met at like 11 PM in town and walked around together for hours. It was a full moon, too. We just talked about everything under the sun, made out, and he walked me all the way home and walked back 2 hours to the next town over to go back to his place. Fucking insane right? What a nice guy! 

The second time we hung out, I was with my friend ava and we were at my house.  We hung out for a few hours and he literally just got up and left suddenly and didn't really give me a kiss or a hug goodbye? I was like, uhh okay kinda weird but I mean I guess he was in a hurry? 

The third time we hangout, were walking around town and we come back to my house and just chill for a little bit. He brings alchohol and starts drinking, im not a drinking so I was totally sober and this kid brought a whole thing of Hennessy and got wasted at some girls house he barely knew. I took care of him all night and gave him food, water, and I put a bandaid on the PURPOSFUL SMILEY FACE BURNT INTO HIS HAND WITH A CIGARETTE. WTF. So, i try to wake him up to ask him what time he wanted to leave so I could set an alarm and i wanted to talk to him because I was bored out of my mind, this guy shoves my face away, says ""oh my fucking god"", puts his clothes on, and storms out like a 5 year old. WHAT. WHY. I cried very hard that night, I will not lie. 

Now last night was by far the worst, it was afternoon and we were supposed to meet up, but on my way to out meetingspot I call him to make sure he's there and he goes, ""im gonna go home."" I said, ""uhhh alright"" and he says,""yeah."" And HANGS UP. I'm a very emotional person and I overthink so badly, so my brain was going wild. Later, he calls me and asks to come over. Of course, me being an absolute simp, I say yes. He comes over and its nice!! I dye his hair black (he stains my bathtub though and doesn't bother to clean it up.), we watch a movie, cuddle, and then he started to insinuate sex but I just wasn't feeling it because im on my period and I made that pretty obvious. He goes, ""I get it"" and pretends to be asleep and will not touch me for an hour after that.

   I have been having a really terrible few days, and that day especially was not going in my favor. I started to get emotional and I was crying a little bit, which now thinking about it in retrospect is so fucking embarrassing. Like CRYING crying. It was rough. I ask him if he's awake and he says yes, and I was just talking my head off about my grandparent and my childhood and I can tell 100% that he could not care less. He comes over and hugs me, but then starts to insinuate sex again. MAN IM CRYIN WHAT THE HELL ????? So he gets up, gets dressed, calls his brother, and says, ""I'm bored as hell can you come pick me up? I'm at bitches house."" Huh :D. What :D. 

  When his brother gets there, boy am I glad to see him leave. I'm gonna be honest, I really cannot rack my brain to find a single redeeming quality that would excuse any of this. But I cannot for the life of me just let him go, im so alone and its been this way for months. 

  To have someone hold you, even if you know for a fact they do not care about you, feels good if you haven't had that in a long time. The good times I have with him are cool! He's charismatic and has given me a lot of confidence just being the way he is, and I appreciate that a lot. I know he's a bad guy and all he does is leave me on read, use me for my shower, food, and sex, makes me feel awful, would NOT care if I died or just disappeared from his life, and smokes cigarettes in my room ! :D. (:D is very sarcastic.) I have always had problems with never feeling deserving enough to get a good boyfriend. I genuinely believe that I deserve to sleep on the floor and the fact I have a bed bothers me because I don't deserve it. I dont know why im like this either. Is there a secret to being able to let bad people go? Do I just totally ghost him? Or do I keep talking to him in hopes ""he'll get better"" or some bullshit like that? I am so lost and don't really have anyone to go to about this.

527,"I'm young, a 15 year old male with severe aggression problems, or at least what I know of. I can go from 0 to literally 1000 because of nothing. I am a gamer and as most of you know, games make you absolutely crazy, especially League of Legends which I am playing at the moment. As I've already mentioned I get angry really easily and not only that but I also get really angry, really easy. When something makes me angry I have to destroy something. Like I can feel in every single cell of my body that something must be destroyed and I must also feel some pain while destroying it. My room has some pretty good walls, they're not too soft and not stone so I can punch them and destroy them while it still hurts. 

Yesterday I ""accidentally"" punched a hole in my wardrobe door and I thought to myself ""can I really just fucking destroy my parents house just because I'm angry, I need to look it up"". Well today I did and the things I found (on the Swedish web) were like ""smoke a cigarette, go running, go to the gym, think about if it is really worth it"" and stuff like that. Well I can't smoke, neither can I go to the gym since in Sweden you have to be 16 years old to do that and I also can't just go running since I can't just leave literally every single game I play. Also when I'm angry, I just can't think ""is it worth it?"" because I have to punch something, preferably destroy it but if I don't punch something I will literally feel bad for the next hours. Also punching something soft doesn't work since it doesn't hurt at all.

I'm just wondering what I can do instead of punching my walls, my desks, the doors, my legs and stuff like that. I don't want to destroy everything my amazing parents have given me.

533,"My boyfriend and I moved into this new place almost a month ago. Our first night here a cat came over and started rolling around on our porch steps and seemed hungry and lonely. I assumed she was a stray because she was basically skin and bones. I brought her food and treats for a couple nights and the cat took a liking to us and obsessively came to see us every time we opened the door. I was even considering adopting the cat. 

 The neighbour saw me petting and loving this cat one night and she told me that it was her cat. I was surprised and also devastated because the neighbour already has two dogs that she neglects and leaves in her backyard 24/7 to sleep on piles of old garbage she just leaves there. I called the city about the dogs already because they broke into our backyard and killed and partially ate a skunk and it needed to be removed. They were probably so hungry and bored they needed something to do. 

A few days ago I saw a cat lying dead in the street and my boyfriend and I checked and it was the neighbour's cat laying next to a dead squirrel. She looked like she may have climbed up an electrical pole and got electrocuted along with the squirrel or had fallen to her death. I was so devastated I cried and cried in the middle of the road. Someone stopped and asked if they could call animal control to come pick up and possibly identify the body if she had been microchipped. My boyfriend moved her body to the side of the road and animal control came to pick her up. My boyfriend was clearly very shaken as well and was crying after moving her body.

My boyfriend told me that this morning my neighbour asked about the cat and he said he told her that he hadn't seen the cat. He doesn't think the neighbour deserves to know because of how neglectful she is. Now I'm not sure if I should tell her the truth if she asks or follow my boyfriend's lead and lie to her.

We want a small car, economic, cheap insurance and used.

But then, my crush text me this : hi, whos this? And i panicked and then said srry and left it alone. After tht i thot about it for a while and realised this was my only chance to tell her my feelings for her or it would be really akward as shes my senior. So i decide to tell her. She hasnt responded but i just want to ask if its alright that i like a girl whos older than me.

537,"Gorwing up, I always lived in smaller towns or villages - largest population of around 110 000.

I'm living in a big city right now. For now, it's just temporary, but I feel like it's ccausing me so much stress. It was a city that I always used to really like visiting, but living here is my nightmare.

Every morning I'm woken up by construction noises in the street (in the winter, it will be snowplows). Parking is an absolute nightmare - I've spent an hour amd a half so far this week driving around trying to put my car somewhere, and it's a constant stress knowing I'm going to have to do it again soon. When I lived in a small town, I also used to enjoy going for multiple walks every day - here, I don't even like leaving my apartment, because it just feels so claustrophobic and crowded to be outside.

I have a tiny little outdoor balcony, and I've managed to brighten things up out there with some vegetable plants, and a bird feeder, but it's hard for me to enjoy time outside with all the constant noise. Right now I'm feeling on edge because the noise from the construction site outside, which makes it really difficult for me to try to work from home.

But there's millions of people living like this in this city who just don't seem to care? And I don't know why I can't just be okay with it.

Is this something I can get over? How? Or should I give up and move back to a small town?",21Sep2020,1

540,"Like everyone else, 2020 has hit my life hard. Without going into too much detail (but keeping things relevant), back in December my mom picked up everything and moved here for me (without me asking) because I was having some trouble with some roommates, and was going to start looking for a new place, but with little money and not knowing anyone in a new city she jumped to the chance to move here....it felt like she was trying to ""rescue me"". So we moved into an airbnb (paid for 4 months upfront) and she paid some family back home to put her stuff back home in a storage room. She found a job with the state, I got a second job, and I started saving money to move into my own place so she could save to move to Florida (where the claims she really wants to live).

When COVID hit she fell really ill, and almost lost her life. So we got kicked out the airbnb (since we weren't lease bound, they acted in their legal right), So I spent every dime I had making sure she had a safe place to come to when she was stable enough to be released from the hospital (another airbnb, since I was laid off during that time and had to take care of my mom, I couldn't afford an apartment still). During my moms recovery, I waited for a call from either of my jobs (one ended up never coming) meanwhile, still looking for jobs with elsewhere.

By now, I'm nervous to take another job because of old jobs contacting me and offering me my positions back...and I didn't want to ruin that. But my mom hours had been cut to only weekends, and we've been staying in a hotel, and don't have much time until the have to put money on our stay again...money we don't have. My car is broke down, and we can barely afford food. Finally, a couple of weeks ago one of my jobs contacted me to come back in and even offered me a higher position than what I originally had. I was so excited to get back to work and when I did I wrote everything down at retraining and carried it everywhere with me. After training, I was trusted to close the store by myself, but it was a piece of cake because I've done it at hundreds of other places before. But register kept saying that something was wrong even tho I wrote everything down during training. Despite writing it down it still says that for the next couple nights. Later, I go through training again and I'm told I'm supposed to ""change"" some results in the register so the receipt that goes to corporate makes sense. And although that night everything evened out, every other night it doesn't when I'm alone closing when I've done nothing wrong. But I'm being told to change information going to corporate under my coding when I close at night. (I hope this is making sense to everyone because its kind of complicated to explain) So I quit. Because I didn't want to get in trouble for something I wasn't doing. 

The issue is, I don't know how to tell my mom that I quit my job (reinforcing her mindset that I need constant saving) because of something I was protecting myself from. I also don't know how to tell my mom that I can do things on my own because every time I bring it up she gets very defensive and typically uses a lot of emotional manipulation to guard herself against feeling like shes wrong.

This ended up being a lot, I hope this made sense. I love my mom and we have a really really close relationship. But I've been feeling smothered. I have brought this up to her several times already, and I don't want it to come to anything extreme. But we've been going through a hard time lately, like the rest of the world, but I need her to know that I can go through hard times by myself, and her babying me at almost 30 years old is pushing me away.",21Sep2020,1
541,"My family and I (my spouse &amp; 2 kids) have lived in this apartment for almost 2 years but the past 6 months have been really rough with my new neighbors next to us. We didn't realize that we lived in a non-smoke free community until after they moved in because our previous neighbors didn't smoke. A little visual of what the apartment looks like, my patio and everyone's patio in these apartments are in the front of the apartment. So in order to get to the front door, you enter through your patio. There is also a huge sliding glass door that you can open to let in a breeze. Right above it is the only window for our bedroom.   
However, our neighbors next to us, are very heavy weed/cigarette smokers (legal). It wasn't too bad in the colder weather because our windows didn't need to be open. However, with quarantine (having to stay home) and our heatwaves in Los Angeles, it's been brutal. During the heatwaves, they would make their patio their extended living room so if I open my window/sliding glass then my apartment to smell. It doesn't make a difference where they smoke on their patio because we're so close in proximity to each other. I honestly don't think it would be too bad if I had additional windows on the other side of my apartment that I can open but I don't. Unfortunately, there's nothing leasing management can do as they're in their property, not a common area where smoking isn't allowed. I've invested in everything that I could think of: glade plugins, air purifiers, portable A/C, fans, and sprays. Unfortunately, the cigarette/weed smell wins all the time. 

At this point, I'm looking to speak to the leasing manager, about moving to a different unit on the property. Preferably one with more windows! We like this location, affordable, the school district has high marks, parking isn't an issue, and it's a safe area. However, we risk getting another heavy smoker neighbor.

My boyfriend (m17) and I (f17) have been dating for over a year and his birthday is tomorrow. The thing is, we don‚Äôt really give regular gifts like clothes or snacks or things we can buy. For my birthday two months ago he spent hours editing some photos he took of me on a camping trip and put them in nice frames and also spent hours making an animation to go along with it. His mum said the minute we got back from the trip he knew what he wanted to do for my present. He‚Äôs really skilled at all of that so it was a great present.

Fast forward to now and his birthday is tomorrow.

544,"How can I stop feeling guilty for wanting to escape abuse?

So let me start by sharing my story which I‚Äôm pretty sure you‚Äôve guessed it after reading the title. Anyways, I‚Äôm a 23 year old woman who‚Äôs been oppressed my whole life just because I was born in the wrong place with the wrong family. My parents are typical arabs, my dad is religious and my mom is super traditional and cares so much about her ""reputation"". I‚Äôm the exact opposite of my parents, being so different from them is like a living nightmare for me, specially when you‚Äôre atheist and FORCED to practice their rituals! However, my life is a bit different from most of girls here. My parents ""allowed"" me to work, study, go out but certainly not allowed to travel or do anything on my own, every move must be under their eyes, every fucking step. The problem here is that they always remind me that they could literally take away all these things from me if I didn‚Äôt obey and do whatever they want me to do. And if they knew about me being atheist or not virgin I will probably be tortured or killed, as simple as that. That‚Äôs not a problem for me since I‚Äôm basically acting the whole time and living a double life till I flee the country which is very soon. I studied my plan countless times and I know what I‚Äôm going to do. However I started to feel guilty for wanting to do what‚Äôs the best and safe for me! When my dad treats me well which doesn‚Äôt happen unless I do something he wanted, I feel so guilty, I mean I‚Äôm aware that this is a result of the emotional abuse I‚Äôve been dealing with my whole life. They‚Äôre planning to force me to get married once I‚Äôm done with college in December, I told them that I don‚Äôt want to, they said ""we don‚Äôt have women who are single""!! My mom was suspicious and I heard her telling my sister she thinks I have a boyfriend and no one refuses to get married unless they‚Äôre hiding something!!! She also said that she wants to go through my phone which is insane! They did it before and my dad hit my head so hard I almost blacked out, and you know why? I refused to give them my fucking phone. But hey they were like we are just torturing you emotionally and make you feel threatened 24/7 for not wanting to get married, ""we aren‚Äôt forcing you"". They can do this anytime they want and I can‚Äôt even ask for help because you know my government ADORES women and their rights. If I went to the police they will laugh at me, I mean what do we expect? They‚Äôre abusive misogynist assholes themselves why would they help. I always say even if I had the most amazing parents in the world, I wouldn‚Äôt want to live in a country where it‚Äôs system is based on shariah law. And please don‚Äôt even try to justify it, at least not on this post. The religious system allowed this to happen to us for DECADES, TILL THIS FUCKING DAY. Fake news tells you that they‚Äôre ""progressive"" and shit, well let me break it for you, they‚Äôre NOT. At least not for another 3 or 5 decades.

I don‚Äôt think she wants to have a relationship, which I guess I‚Äôm okay with, but at the same time with all this said, I don‚Äôt want to ruin our friendship. 

I messaged her the next day but I haven‚Äôt gotten a response yet. I know that could mean anything, but I‚Äôm starting to think she regrets it and now is avoiding me or something. I did ask her if she was okay with it before it happened though.. I told her that I know we‚Äôre both drunk so if you‚Äôre not comfortable we don‚Äôt have to.. but at the end of the day, she was still drunk, no matter if I asked if she was okay with it or not, and I for some reason still feel like she felt pressured.

I don‚Äôt want to message her again, I obviously just want to give her her space.

555,"Hooooo boy 

So basically one of best friends is in an abusive relationship right now. This guy that she knew for a while started talking to her more in depth about it to try and help her through it. They started to like each other, the guy broke up with his now ex gf (he was going to do it anyways).

I then hung out with this guy and my best friend. We all talked about feelings and sad things in feneral for a while. To make me feel better we all cuddled. I knew that he liked her, even though he never said it. I'm pretty damn sure she liked him too... it all just depended on if she broke up her current relationship with her toxic bf atm.

Now, for me I've only been in one relationship that was really bad lol. To help me feel less lonely, this guy offered to cuddle and hang out. (My best friend was totally fine with this btw). 

So I went over to cuddle and he was very cuddly and loving. He essentially told me that he could keep doing this for me, but to not tell people - as he didn't want it to be misconstrued. Which I understood? But also idk. He was very flirty with me, and kind of teasing about it which is like AHHH.

Here's the thing tho, is he never did anything I didn't want. Which is weird, bc in my experience guys have always been obessed with sex and thats all they would want. This guy... idk. He said he wouldn't do anything I didn't want to and it seems like he meant it.

Now I'm an idiot lol and I got a crush on him (which I rarely get crushes). And he said that he felt like he liked me too. He said he liked both of us and would go out on a date with me, but did talk to my best friend first. He even said that he felt bad and that didn't mean he liked me less, this just was more circumstantial. He said that if my best friend didn't like him, that he'd love to go out on a date with me essentially.

I'm waiting on what my friend does, essentially. I know I have my feelings for this guy, but my best friend's current boyfriend is really toxic and I think this guy and my best friend would be really great for each other. I care about them both so much... idk what to do. Idk if I should go for it, hell, I don't even know if I'll have the chance to go for it.... help me out here friends?

Update: She didn't break up with him. He of course felt disappointed... but asked if I still wanted to go on a date. I said yes, also I talked a lot of things through with him.

I am worried, because I want to take things slowly, I'm not as experienced as him, and also I really don't know if I am enough of a sexual person.

I also addressed how he felt about my friend. He said he of course felt a little disappointed, and sad about it... but that he would get over it quickly because he knew nothing would come of it and he was excited that I was going to go out with him. It makes me feel a bit weird, but he said he would get over it quickly. I worry that I'm an after thought even tho he said I absolutely was not. Idk if Im being stupid, or manipulated.

I told him I take things slowly, and he said he felt 100% fine with that, and that all that mattered is if I was willing to be open to things as the relationship progressed- but to not feel pressured. To just wait and see how I would feel about things.

Am I dumb for going for him? Part if me thinjs I'm gettong played but dont know if Im overthinking it. We were going to hang out/go on a date today. Idk plz help and give me some perspective - ask any questions that you need for clarification and I'll answer as best as I can",21Sep2020,1

So I will be turning 16 within the year. And the past 2 years I've been thinking about getting an emancipation. 

Just a little background on my situation: my dad was extremely abusive when I was little. Both mentally and physically. And it took around 8 years to get away from him. Almost as soon as I got away from him my mom started being mentally and emotionally abusive. And it hurts to think that both of your parents dislike you or don't want you. My mom will tell me things like ""you aren't and never will amount to anything"" and ""the world would be so much easier without you"" and she says that my being born ruined her chance at having the life she wanted. She remarried and I have a 3 year old brother that she just absolutely adores. She'll say that hopefully he turns into the child she always wants and not a disappoinment like myself. She seems happy and content with her new family and I feel like Im a fly on the wall- there but not really. I used to mention things like that to her asking if we could improve on our relationship or telling her how I felt. And she just tells me I'm wrong about my feelings it yells at me saying I'm entitled and will never know what it's like to actually be sad or hurt. 

All of my friends say that this is toxic and that I need to get out if I can. 

Idk how to build up the courage to leave. And I don't want to hurt her. She says if I left it would hurt her and she ""wouldn't know how to go on"" she will also have these crying fits and say she's sorry. But ik that sorry without change is just manipulation.

Last night I opened some milk with the ‚Äúbest by‚Äù date set for the next day. ‚ÄúPerfectly good milk‚Äù I thought so I poured some. It was spoiled and was pretty disgusting smelling and while I threw it all away he kept saying how ‚Äústinky‚Äù I was in a playful manner and low key saying it was somehow my fault. After this incident he then goes into fucking cleaning mode and insists I clean up my area, which is considerably more organized than his. He starts painting me out to be some sort of slob in the most playful manner as a way of beating around the bush which really pissed me off because I‚Äôm a pretty neat person. He never cleans his bed and his work area looks like an utter mess but I don‚Äôt say a word because it‚Äôs really none of my business. So really this night was just one big eye opener. The next day he‚Äôs readying off some chemistry information aloud about a test that‚Äôs coming up. He reads a part where it states ‚Äúno collaboration during the exam with other classmates‚Äù or whatever. He then says something like,‚Äù oh you know what that means I guess I can‚Äôt help you with your exam‚Äù in a sarcastic way like I‚Äôm some sort of imbecile. I then respond with,‚Äù like wise‚Äù. After I say this he just looks at me with the most perplexed expression as if to say,‚Äù why would I ever need your help on the exam.‚Äù I‚Äôve literally never even asked this guy for help with any of my work and vice versa. We don‚Äôt really collaborate as far as all that goes. I still really like the guy and consider him a good friend but he‚Äôs getting too comfortable and being too playful in all the wrong ways.

566,"I'm 21 years old and currently going to university in sweden. I've always been considered as the smart guy, and I will admit that I probably was.

Before this, I've never been into anything special. . I'm currently studying ""System development"". The first year is complete, and I felt like it was really easy. I barely had to study, because I have a really easy time learning stuff. However, this second year has had a really rough start. At this point I actually have to work to understand stuff, and I just can't to seem to motivate myself to do that. I've always had a hard time doing stuff that will only benefit myself. I work way better in a group where I have some sort of responsibility towards other people. I've come to the point, which I end up at with everything that I've ever done really, which is that I just feel like I wanna do something else.

I'm already tired of this. I just can't seem to get myself to dive deep into complicated subjects, and therefore, I have no idea what I could do with my career. I just feel like this level of education is extremely helpful when searching for a good job, with a decent salary, although I will always prefer being happy at my workplace.

568,"For starters here‚Äôs a few disclaimers. 
- I would never cheat on somebody (I‚Äôve been in a position where I had the opportunity and decided not to cause I‚Äôm not that guy) 

- I‚Äôm on mobile so I‚Äôm sorry if grammar is off

- I do truly love my Fianc√© 


Okay, so now for a bit of backstory. 

My fianc√© and I have been together for 8 years. We‚Äôre planning on buying a house in a year or so and once that we plan on starting a family. Another thing you should know is I‚Äôm at 23 year old male. My fianc√© is a 24 year old female. We‚Äôre both introverts who pretty much work come home, cook, smoke weed, watch movies and play video games. However I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm a 60%-40% split. 60% introvert 40% extrovert. I like sports, I go to the gym every morning and I like to socialize but only with people I‚Äôm comfortable around.

Now for the explanation of my title. This all started a week or two ago. I was browsing on Instagram and stumbled across a friends photo which was her and my ex who I dated for a year when I was 15. Things kind of just ended, I mean she broke up with me with not much of an explanation but I wasn‚Äôt really asking too many questions as I too felt we were growing in opposite directions. I clicked her profile more out of curiously y‚Äôknow the one you get where you wanna see how their doing but mostly for selfish reasons. Well I did and of course it was private so I followed her without much thought considering it‚Äôs been 8 years since we broke up. Instantly it was accepted and a follow back, which I accepted.

This is when I clicked her profile and saw she lives a very adventurous life, hiking, travelling, concerts, sporting event etc. I saw how pretty she had become, I mean she was always pretty but now she‚Äôs 22 and matured. She also has a boyfriend which looks like they‚Äôre a great couple. 

A few days later I posted a picture on Instagram and she liked it, within 5 minutes of liking it she posted a pic (from behind) on the top of a mountain and another pic with friends. I didn‚Äôt like hers back.


This is where I got this weird feeling. I don‚Äôt know if you call it lust for her or envy of him but I do know I wished for a moment I was with someone who isn‚Äôt so introverted. I wished I was 15 again and could have so much fun. I know if you‚Äôve read this far you‚Äôre thinking, you‚Äôre only 23 you can still have fun. I problem is if I go out I almost feel guilty for leaving my fianc√© at home, she doesn‚Äôt say anything but just gives me a feeling that she‚Äôs not okay with it. So I just chose to not go out as if I do go out I don‚Äôt truly enjoy my time.

Now when my fianc√© is in a mood, I‚Äôm short with her. She tells me she loves me I say it back but feel different about it. I do truly love her, but I wish for only a day I could see if the grass was truly greener on the other side. 

Is this just a phase which will pass? Am I living a life I will be unhappy with in 10 years? Should I talk to my fianc√© about it or anything in general?",21Sep2020,1
569,"So, since about 2months, I have what some can call a ""cyberstalker"".

It's a bit of a weird story how I got him, because the reason for his behaviour is as petty as it is dumb.

From the beginning:  
We met on a small YouTube video, regarding an Anime for children that featured a very controversial romantic arc between an elementary student and her grown-up teacher.  
Long debate short; I wasn't okay with the authors ""love has no boundaries"" approach (no boundaries = every relationship -incest, pedophilia - is okay) especially as it was in a show for kids.

The guy who would become my ""stalker"" disagreed with me, somehow connecting my hate on that depiction as an attack on his ""loli"" fetish.  
For context: Lolicon is a controversial branch of Anime/manga which features sexualised depiction of young girls bodies, aka it's the origin of the ""she looks like a 10yo, but she's actually 10000yo so it's okay if I find her hot"" joke.

The debate ended that we both (apparently) agreed to disagree, however, that was not enough for that guy.

He started searching up my YouTube accounts name, which somehow brought him to an old Facebook I made when I was 13yo and forgot about.  
From there, he gained my name and E-Mail adresse, starting his personal crusade to...uhm...I don't know exactly, destroy ""the SJW"" he sees in me?

It's a bit of a weird situation. His actions mostly include:

1.) posting comments on weird niche porn sites, like ""Heeey, I'm an Xyo girl called \[my full name\], please send me CP \[child porn\], loli porn to my email""

2.) ranting same porn sites about what ""I"" had said and how much ""I"" am an SJW (aka he makes up things I apparently said, like ""all loli fans deserve to be castrated"", ""George Floyd is a gay hero"" etc.).

Now, this probably sounds pretty serious, but the ironic thing is that most of his posts actually backfired quiet heavily.  
Most people either called him a troll, thought I was his gf and salty that I broke up with him, told him they couldn't find me (the luck of having no social media presence) or called him a perverted creep.  
Furthermore I also indeed got some mails, but 99% were people just telling me someone posted my info and the 1% that didn't was a 15yo kid who thought my post was real and immediatly backed off with his horniness after I told him what's up.

Still taking his shit serious, I collected all his posts, filed a police report and mailed every site's host to remove &amp; blacklist the info he typed about me. I also deleted my old mail &amp; set up a new one, which means he has only my name now.

Which...okay, is a bit unique, ngl, but you'd still have to digg a lot to get to his posts on Google.

However, even though he's pretty much an ankle biter fighting a loosing battle, the shitter doesn't seem to give it a rest!

The police says they only start tracking him if he does it for longer than a year / something extreme happens, which means I'm kinda on my own.

Does anyone know how to potentially get him to quit? Should I just hope he gets bored one day? He's always posting stuff anonymous, but sometimes replies in his rants -should I go into the lions dent undercover and trick him / talk him into quitting (without revealing who I am)?

P.s: Don't worry, he has no clue I'm using Reddit (runs on a different mail even)",21Sep2020,1

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory: When I was 18 I started college and \[redacted\] University. There I met a boy who shared a lot of classes with me, and we just kinda hit it off. We were having a great time going on dates, hanging out with friends, and just general dating stuff. Skip forward a year or so and I start to think he's cheating. It was completely irrational, but just a thought I had. I asked him about it, and he punished me. He hit me a couple of times, and I got what I deserved. 

&amp;#x200B;

Actual Story: After about 3ish years of dating him, he started getting kind of physical, punishing me when I was bad, or bothered him, and the such; normal stuff. Then he started taking other girls home. I didn't really mind, because I knew I wasn't good enough for him. He then started borrowing money. He would hit me if I asked him to pay it back, which made me kind of mad. In total he took, without giving back $2130, and I still don't see it to this day. I decided that I had enough, so I broke it off with him. I moved in with my parents until I got a stable income, then moved into a small apartment. I switched all of the classes I could, and blocked him on social media (but I think he made fake accounts to still see what I post.) I thought he was out of my life at that point, but then I checked my mail one day and got a letter. I opened it up, and it was $30 and a copy/paste note, basically threatening me to come back. I was kind of scared because I never told him where I moved, and I thought there was no way of him knowing. 

&amp;#x200B;

The next day, I got another letter, this time written in super bad handwriting telling me he knows where I live, and I better come back ""or else"". I thought about calling the police, but I didn't want him to get in trouble. I disregarded it and went on with my day, when I got spam texted. I mean, I was getting literally hundreds of messages a minute. They all said ""get over here right now you fucking whore, or your ass is grass"". I got really scared because I changed my number too. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then came the last straw. I woke up and saw a note on my car window. The note stated ""last warning"" and when I looked around, my tires were slashed, door handles were broken off, and trunk bashed in with what I assume to be a sledgehammer or something (I have no clue how he didn't get caught).

579,"Hi everyone,

On mobile and English isn't my first language.

I need your guys advice about the following:
I'm a 23yo guy and recently finished my study in marketing. Currently looking for jobs, which isn't the easiest in covid times.

When I grew up I have always been a bit shy and insecure. Part of it was probably because I couldn't fully be myself since I'm gay and grew up in a religious environment. I'm out now and doing a lot better and even have a wonderful boyfriend.

I struggle sometimes with being a bit socially awkward. A lot of people in the marketing field are very extravert and this is also what managers etc. expect from candidates. Me myself don't always have the perfect answer prepared and sometimes need time to think about a good answer. Because of this there are some awkward silences sometimes. I have heard that this sometimes comes across as not being very confident.

I feel like this is affecting my chances on the job market as well as making friends. Once I know someone better I usually open up a lot more and have a lot less of these awkward moments, although they still happen.

Another example is when my boyfriend or a friend asks me to 'tell them something'. I usually have no idea what to start about and find myself going for something that recently happened to me. This sometimes works but due to the lockdown situation and me not having a job right now I don't experience to many interesting things nowadays.

Do you guys have any advice on what I could talk about in such situations and for when there is an awkward silence? It would be much appreciated.

I just broke up with my bf (m20) of 10 months last night. Our relationship was extremely healthy: support, consent, some disagreements but no fights. He's done everything right and is absolutely amazing. We go well and felt safe together. 

The reason I broke things off is because I feel constrained. I haven't truly been single since I was 16. I'm such a flirty person and I want to flirt without guilt. I just began college. As a 19 year old, I feel like there is so many more people to get to know and try out.

585,"
You may think this is a nuts post, but brace yourselves, the backstory gets heavy. We‚Äôve been together now for about two years, and so far as I know they broke up from an on and off relationship over three years span a month before he and I got together. I had never been the jealous type, if someone I was involved with ever wanted to speak with someone of the opposite sex, I‚Äôd push them in that direction. That was until-

Ten months ago, we had been dating almost a year at this point. As far as I knew, he had no female friends and didn‚Äôt speak with any of his exes. Then very late one night while I‚Äôm relaxing with him, (let‚Äôs call my boyfriend) Chris gets a call from his ex, someone we‚Äôll call Stacy. I fall silent as I immediately feel some trust was betrayed by him never telling me they still corresponded, but he apologizes and overcompensates in trying to reconcile the situation by blocking her on every platform. I was forgiving and easy going about it, especially since he seemed sincere there was nothing going on there, that she had sometimes called him depressed and even suicidal. I tried to be sensitive, and even urged him not to block her. He did anyhow. Fast forward a month. 

I mention boyfriend‚Äôs name in public (he has a rare name) and a girl asks me how I know him, and I ask the same. Apparently it‚Äôs a friend of Stacy. She then went and told Stacy of this encounter with the person who may be Chris‚Äô ex and this goes all the way back to Chris through a friend. Chris would later reveal to me he unblocked her to tell her the situation so she stopped freaking out and asking his friends why he blocked her, but he didn‚Äôt tell me in the moment. I wouldn‚Äôt know he had ever talked to her again until-

Another month later, I see he‚Äôs getting messages from someone named ‚ÄúDrake‚Äù in his phone about a gig for work that Drake apparently recommended Chris for (he‚Äôs a performer). It‚Äôs a long story but eventually I find out through context in texts that it‚Äôs actually Stacy, and again, nothing off-color in nature except for Chris blatantly hiding her number in his phone under a different name while corresponding. Also, I saw she was invited to work the same event after recommending him. This comes to light between me and him, and he cancels the gig, and apologizes, says he didn‚Äôt want to bother me with worry and thus his decision to conceal the brief convo, etc. He shows me his messages with her reaffirming a brief nature that implicitly didn‚Äôt pursue further contact, and promised me ANY contact he had with her moving forward would be told to me immediately. 

Honestly, after two deceptions, I felt a little burned about this Stacy at this point. Still, I trust him, and do to this day. But he obviously felt something about the correspondence was wrong, otherwise why would he have hid it both times?

Many months later now, I get a call from Chris while he‚Äôs been out of town with family for a few weeks that we needed to talk. A mutual friend between him and Stacy told Chris that Stacy is suspected to have lung cancer. He doesn‚Äôt know what stage cancer and neither does she, according to him. He tells me he‚Äôs gonna try to be there for her if she needs him considering the circumstances. I say okay. 

Maybe this shouldn‚Äôt be mentioned, but so far it seems uncertain what types of cancer and what stages she may have. And I‚Äôve seen her make regular model shot posts since all of this happened, which seems strange for someone with this specific issue at hand. 

Now at this point many of you are going to say I‚Äôm insensitive, but I‚Äôm truly sympathetic to my boyfriend and certainly don‚Äôt wish him any loss or concern. I hope she doesn‚Äôt have this serious illness. I hope she turns out alright. I‚Äôve never met her but I feel connected in the way that we‚Äôve both known and been with him. 

In spite of this, and having trust in my boyfriend that indeed no ‚Äúfunny business‚Äù will ensue, as he reassured me in that phone call, I still feel this strange tightness in my chest and nagging concern for IDontKnowWhat. I feel it‚Äôs the mistrust that‚Äôs been laid in the past, though I truly forgive him and felt I moved past it, but I guess not, and have this ridiculous suspicion they‚Äôre going to start speaking intimately with each other. He said he‚Äôll be open with me about everything in regard to this, but I‚Äôm worried this could complicate things between us, it already has in the past relating to this woman. We‚Äôre about to move in together after he gets back from visiting family, and I don‚Äôt want anything (including my potential jealousy) to get in the way of our wellbeing. 

Should I tell him how I feel, or is that a terrible idea? He‚Äôs very private and wouldn‚Äôt respond well to too many questions, otherwise I would just ask for reassurance every now and then about their nature of correspondence. How do I get rid of this feeling I have in my stomach? Am I just being ridiculous? It probably doesn‚Äôt help that he‚Äôs out of town for so long. 

TL/DR: Boyfriend‚Äôs ex who has caused brief trust issues between us in the past now supposedly has lung cancer, and he informed me he reopened communication to her because of this.

We hadn‚Äôt ever talked, but we knew each other from school, and I know he has a mental disorder. (I think it‚Äôs a form of autism but I‚Äôm not sure).
Anyways, he messaged me asking how I was doing during quarantine. Although I found it weird that an older man was talking to me it seemed with good intention so I replied. I didn‚Äôt want to be rude. Now it‚Äôs been about 3 months and he messages me non stop practically. Even when I go 2-3 days without replying he still messages me about his problems, and he calls me one of his best friends.
Although he seems really nice, I‚Äôm super busy with all of my schoolwork and I really don‚Äôt have time for this right now.

587,"to be more specific computers and smartphones

It's annoying to explain them multiple times the most basic things such as how to enable the wifi (slide the bar down and press on the button). They don't even try on their own, it's easier to just call me for everything. I mean, if there something pops up like your PC is endagered or similar stuff it's ofc fine, but they should try things on their own instead of calling me ten times a day.

588,"I posted this in AITA but I think it‚Äôs better suited here.

My (f31) family and I have a tradition on Christmas Eve to spend the evening together and exchange gifts. Last year my grandmother passed, so my willingness to participate was already diminished prior to the incident I will explain below. I have a very strained relationship with my dad and my family is a bit dysfunctional. 

I have been with my boyfriend (m29) for half a year. I already know he is my soulmate. Our relationship was sort of fast tracked due to all the time we got to spend together during the pandemic. He treats me amazing and has been great with my 6 year old. 

With that being said, we have opposing political beliefs, for the most part. My family is pretty liberal and we live in a liberal state. He is voting for trump. We debate politics from time to time but it never leads to a fight and his political views do not bother me since it‚Äôs mostly due to financial reasons and he agrees with me on a lot of things.

My dad has met my boyfriend once on Father‚Äôs Day. He messaged me the other day and told me we needed to talk about who was allowed at his house on Christmas and that I was ‚Äúnot going to like it‚Äù. I was pretty sure it was due to my boyfriends political affiliation so I called him to confirm. I told him if my boyfriend could not come, I didn‚Äôt think my son or I would be able to either. He said ‚ÄúOK bye‚Äù and hung up. 

I told my boyfriend and he was hurt but encouraged me to still go to keep the peace.  I told him I had no interest as he is my family and why would I leave him to spend time with people I have no relationship with. My sister took my side and is not going to go if my dad doesn‚Äôt change his mind. 

We already have an alternative Christmas planned with my son‚Äôs dad and grandparents who love my boyfriend.

Am I being unreasonable? Is my dad justified?",21Sep2020,1

590,"My brother (11) just moved into a new school. I've been studying abroad so I don't see him or my family that regularly but I just got home recently. He's been talking about how he's being bullied at school, sitting alone at lunch, being beaten and teased by other kids. He talked about it at dinner and right in front of my parents too but they don't seem to be doing much about it, they just ignored it completely. 

My brother is also over weight so I know he struggles a lot with his self esteem. It doesn't help when my parents are constantly criticising him and then also over feeding him. I've noticed that my dad, though is very gentle at me since he doesn't see me a lot, treats my brother pretty rough sometimes, and I know it can be hurtful. It used to happen to me but I've found a way to compromise with it. 

I used to be in his situation too, being overweight and all, and I turned out pretty messed up right now. I really don't want him to be the same. 

What can I do to help him? I can't show up at his school and tell the other kids to F off, my mom did that and it never turned out well. It just makes the kid stands out more. I'm also pretty concerned about how my parents are treating my brother, I don't want him to be self-conscious, he's a bright kid with lots of potential.

593,"Over the course of 2020, my dad lost his house, his job, his car, and 2 of his siblings to COVID. He himself barely survived COVID after being in bed for 2 months.

Ever since then, he‚Äôs been consistently stressed out at a VERY high level. In 2 months his hair went from black to light gray. His vision has gone down from clenching his jaw so much. He can‚Äôt sleep at night.

He also doesn‚Äôt release stress in a healthy way. He doesn‚Äôt cry, but rather bottles everything up for weeks at a time until he finally explodes in a fit of screaming and yelling at anybody who happens to be near him. For example, a few weeks ago, he almost got into a fight with someone for not social distancing, after they bumped their cart into him at the grocery store.

He doesn‚Äôt hit anybody or release his stress physically, for those wondering, just shouts and shouts about anything and everything until his vocal cords go out. I KNOW that isn‚Äôt healthy.

Now here‚Äôs the actual problem: Over the past month, he‚Äôs been having constant shoulder to neck pain, and certain parts of his body just suddenly ‚Äúhurt‚Äù (could be a wrist, or his head, etc). He DID go to a doctor for those issues before we lost our healthcare, and was prescribed stuff that worked.
But after he lost his car in a car crash, his shoulder pain came back. 

Then, yesterday, he stopped his shouting midway and said ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt breathe!!‚Äù, and clutched his chest while taking deep breathes. We‚Äôre all terrified he may have done some internal damage.

When we got home, he laid in bed from 2-7PM, and just slept. He was exhausted, after getting minimal sleep the last few days. He didn‚Äôt have a fever.

When he got up, we made sure he had lots of fluids, ate food, etc. We calmed him down for the most part by distracting him from everything going on in his life, and turned on a comedy movie. He laughed, and we thought he had come back to his old self again!! But I‚Äôm still unsure.

As of now, he seems better, but I know something is wrong. 2020‚Äôs been rough, but I pray it‚Äôs not ‚Äúyour dad‚Äôs going to be hospitalized‚Äù rough.

Also, he‚Äôs religious, but because all religious centers are closed in our area, he can‚Äôt seek spiritual comfort. The news depresses him, and he‚Äôs terrified of getting phone calls from family, incase someone else has passed away.

As of now, we seriously cannot afford a therapist because we lost our healthcare. How do I make sure he doesn‚Äôt get stressed out like that again?",21Sep2020,2

596," I had a friend group, which I was eventually separated from because we had our differences. I had no hard feelings for them, I really wished them the best.

Recently, an anonymous confession was posted about said friend group, talking smack about the people still in the group. My old friend group think I wrote the confession - I never did. Why would I be lying on Reddit when I'm anonymous? They're telling my other friends to drop me. They're posting more confessions saying things about me.

I never wrote that confession. Being blamed for something I didn't do hits close to home because my parents do this to me constantly. I'm just incredibly sad that my friends believe I crave that much drama and have hate in my heart towards them.

They have things they could use against me that I'm paranoid of. Especially because I never wrote that confession, they'd be said without any factual basis but still ruin my life. I'm having a hard time, my mother may go through chemo again, my dad will have surgery for the 2nd time, i may need eye surgery, my friend group fell apart, and I need to get into an Ivy League college.

I just cried my eyes out I'm just heartbroken right now. It's not like I don't have friends, I just valued these people and they could turn their backs on me so quickly...I had one friend reach out to me telling me that my friends are telling her to drop me too.

600,"Thank you for taking the time to read this. I'd love to hear some advice from others as I have never told this to anyone and I wouldn't want my friends to know about this.

I've been helping my mother ever since my father passed away three years ago with finances. I do not mind doing it and I see it as paying her back for all the help I've received. At the moment I am paying 17.5% of my salary to help out with rent.

However, due to circumstances my mother will get less money because I earn more in this household and the government will lessen the aid given to her. This means that I will have to contribute in order to buy food which will mean that 30% of my total salary will go to my mother.

Again, I do not mind. However, I told her that I don't mind but that I would like to pay my mother bi-weekly instead of monthly. This is because I do not trust her with money, and especially not the money which I work so hard for every day.

She disagrees saying that she doesn't want to be treated like a baby. Then goes on saying that it is her money after I give it to her and that I shouldn't care what would happen with my money. I disagree.

What would you do in this situation. I just don't want my money to be spent on stupid things.

My mother is depressed and is without work due to the passing of my dad.

Note that I am brutally honest about both sides of the stories and that I do not want to seem like I am putting myself in a better position. Please share your thoughts, I would like to know.

603,"This might be long so I'm sorry. My now 15 year old sister (who is currently in therapy and medicated) met her boyfriend when she was 14. She was recently released from ICU &amp; psych hospital after an overdose attempt that gave her seizures and nearly put her in a coma. This is her first actual boyfriend but she did get groomed by the 18 year old quarterback of the school football team when she was 12 or 13. This seems to be when the inappropriate self destructive behavior started. 

This new guy is 17 years old and they've been together since December or January. He has a philosophy that women should be seen and not heard. He believes my sister should get a full time job, clean the house, cook dinner, raise the children, and yet MUST sit outside with him while he does yardwork. That's his only job. Yardwork. ""When"" they get married. He controls what she wears. She went from wearing cute teen clothes to wearing my deceased grandmother's pants. I'M NOT KIDDING. I dont know if it has anything to do with the fact that she has put on over 30 pounds from her medication or if it's him. But I do know for a fact that he approves or disapproves of her outfits. He ordered her to take down a picture she had of her and a male friend. He told her to stop wearing makeup. He wanted her to move in with him during quarantine.

And don't get me started on this shithead's parents. His father is a disgusting and creepy grandpa of an old man with a wife nearly 30 years younger than him. The moment his parents met my parents they hinted at the fact that it's okay for my 14 YEAR OLD sister and their son to have sex because they are ""ADULTS"". The father writes my sister letters and we thought they were from the mother because of how complimentary they were. He thinks she is beautiful, that he can't wait to see her again, that she is so wonderful. They read like a love letter. The father was pushing for my sister to move in with them while his wife was out of town.

But back to the issue at hand, my sister's boyfriend asked if my sister would still love him if he murdered our parents, our sister, and our brother in law. I wasnt mentioned in the messages because I hadn't been living here during the course of their relationship. But I did recently move back in. She. Said. YES. We have installed a Ring door bell and my sister now has to sleep in my mom and dad's bed because we don't trust her to not let him in to kill us in our sleep. We know he has guns and that's he is batshit crazy. We know she's submissive to him to the point of giving him permission to kill us. The boyfriend is currently banned from our house. It's so bad that I have alerted my partner that if something happens to us that he must tell the police that my sister and her boyfriend did it. 

The issue is, we don't know how to get rid of him. My sister will attempt again. I know we are likely going to lose her if she stays with him. Either through murder or she be completely disowned if they're together when she's 18. Theres more but I feel this covers it without becoming a novel.

TL;DR Sister's abusive &amp; toxic bf has expressed desire to kill us. Sister gave him permission to. Boyfriend's father is a disgusting creepy pervert who will likely not take this seriously. Sister may attempt suicide again if we get rid of him.",21Sep2020,1

To put it bluntly and specifically , I feel like everyone is watching what I do/ waiting for me to fail/ or expecting me to succeed. I still don‚Äôt really know why I feel like this.

606,"Idk how mobile affects posting format so I‚Äôm VERY sorry if this becomes a single block of text.
I (24X) am struggling with body disphoria and am struggling with what to do about it.
Obviously by the ‚Äúx‚Äù it is gender related dysphoria. I get this visceral kind of uncomfortableness whenever something unmistakably gendered is applied to me. Mostly this is physical things since I have a ‚Äúany gender can have any hobbies‚Äù kind of person. I am naturally very curvy as I was designated female at birth, my hips are visibly wider than my shoulders and even the strongest of binders can‚Äôt break the illusion that there are boobies. 
This isn‚Äôt always an issue for me, as my dysphoria comes and goes, but some days, the existence of curve on me feels like scratching on a chalkboard constantly without ever stopping. The longer the day goes on, the more distressing it is. Imagine your fork is scrapping across your plate the second you wake up and it doesn‚Äôt ever stop.
I think the problem is my weight. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6‚Äù and 170-175lbs. Not super fat, but clinically overweight and there‚Äôs plenty of chub. I know if I were to drop to 130-140, it would help A LOT. I would be able to hide my hips with clothes and binders would make the boobs go away and i would be able to actually look androgynous instead of like a butch lesbian.
The problem is, is i have never had an issue with my weight in an unhealthy way unless I try to lose weight. As soon as effort goes into it, I start spiraling towards eating disorder territory (mostly throwing up when i eat and nonstop exercising) and then as soon as I stop, I‚Äôm totally fine again. I don‚Äôt really know if it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm reliant on food (I hate junk food but eat larger meals than I should) or if it‚Äôs because the idea of not perfectly progressing fast enough at everything I do is what‚Äôs hurting me. (i have adhd and malidaptive perfectionism is my biggest struggle in my life) But it‚Äôs like I turn into a completely different person every time I‚Äôve tried, which is more times than I can possibly count.
I can‚Äôt keep living with the dysphoria anymore though. It‚Äôs horrible and i have to distract myself from it constantly (usually with weed or light and non serious instances of self harm (like hair-pulling, hitting myself not hard enough to leave marks or lasting damage)). I‚Äôm terrified of getting myself into even more issues though, especially because I‚Äôm totally happy with my body on non-dysphoric days, weight and all. Like, wearing crop tops and bikinis level of happy.
I guess I feel I am trapped between a rock and a hard place of shitty brain feelings and unhealthy coping mechanisms and I‚Äôm wondering if anyone has any advice on the best ways to keep your mind in a good place when losing weight and/or dealing with dysphoria when you can‚Äôt simply just change the silhouette on your body into anything other that what it already is. I am not trans so anything permanent, like top surgery, is kind of off the table for me.
I‚Äôm also apprehensive about any kind of professional therapy bc not only am I a poor American so $$$$, but also because I‚Äôve had bad experiences with therapists and my gender in the past. 
Sorry for the rambling and the dumb life problem, ik gender issues arent very relatable. Thanks to anyone willing to help.",21Sep2020,1

A good friend of ours passed away in July, and I suspect his death caused an uptick in his drug use... Which is horrible because our friend died from doing a laced drug. I just don't want him to die, or be responsible for killing someone else. And I can't deal with this shit anymore. My options at this point is to call his family and tell them what is going on. What should I do? All of his peers agree that he isn't doing well but enable him because they want coke. I feel like I am the only one who can really do something. What is the most responsible thing I can do at this point? I have been battling with this since May. Please help.",21Sep2020,1
619,"So in late May early June I was diagnosed with Pericarditis (inflammation of the heart). I was working a construction job and because of my condition I had to stop.  I went on medical leave (WA state, US) and then that ran out.  I'm still struggling to heal.  I've been trying really hard to learn graphic design and use this as a time to finally change jobs and do something I'm passionate about! But I'm just feeling so depressed and lost at times, and don't even know if this is going to work out.  I'm trying so hard but it's just stressing me out at times.  

I'm just wondering if anyone knows of another program I can get an income from until I heal, or if they have any other ideas.  I'm wondering what jobs I can take that won't stress me out and cause me to not heal completely, but I'm not sure what to do.

But the thing is, I haven't been able to concentrate on my online classes, and over time it has gotten worse. At first, I could get distracted for 10% of the class, but now I lose like 75% of every class and I don't know what to do about it.

623,"i'm 17 years old. 5 months ago in quarantine i was using a lofi  youtube playlist to study, and it had a chat. i followed some people i liked talking to on the chat on instagram (a public account i have with no personal information), and with one of them i had a conversation over dms one night. he is 16, he lives in Chile (i live in the US), and he wanted to learn English. he was using a translator during our whole conversation. i have had internet friends before in middle school. i talked to them very much, but i never told my parents who they were. i had other friends at the time and it never was a problem. 

over the next few weeks, he would text me a ""hey"" or a ""wassup"" and we'd have a conversation. we would send audios and i would help him with pronunciation. after a few weeks, we called each other on discord. it was just a voice call, and it was very awkward because he barely had any practice having a conversation in English but i still found it fun. i realized after a few weeks that he was going to be somewhat of a permanent friend, at least until quarantine ended. we texted every night and even with the language and geographical difference, i never felt so close to someone. i felt understood, and we had similiar tastes and opinions. we sent each other songs  and made playlists on spotify to listen to. i liked everything about him. we started calling about once or twice a week, and i would always wait till my parents were asleep and go in my closet with the lights turned off. we also used netflix party to watch movies together. and we started to video call as well. his english has improved drastically and he only occasionally uses the translator. we can call and video call and have good conversations, and slowly all of the awkwardness and hesitation has went away. now we are very close and he's become much more than a casual friend. 

his family know about me. and they don't have a problem with him talking to me. it would be impossible for me to keep it from my family completely since we talk so much, so i told my mom that he goes to my school, and we're just friends. but, understandably, she has become concerned about who he is, having never seen him or heard of him before, and she has told me this a few times in different ways. i want to tell her everything, but i am very scared of how she will react. but i don't want to wait very much longer, because the longer she finds out i have kept this from her the worser her reaction will be. plus it is a lot of stress to keep something like this to myself. 

my mom told me today she has no problem with me talking to boys as long as she knows them. but, she is also very conservative and i am not sure she would be very accepting of me talking to someone online. when i told her i was talking to people from different countries on the chat of the youtube video, she said to stop doing that because people can track your ip address. and i don't know what our relationship will look like after i tell my mom. but i really do wish to meet him once i am in college, and i would like her support when i do. 

i guess what i'm asking is, i don't really know how i should began saying all of this. should i explain what happened chronologically so she will understand everything from my perspective? or be more straightforward and tell her the guy i am talking to is from Chile and not from my school? and is there anything i can say to her that would make her less anxious or worried? he said he is willing to talk to her on a video call. should i call him first and explain it to her with him on the call?

624,"I don‚Äôt know how to make this anything other than long, strange, and complicated...but I‚Äôll try. 

My mom and my aunt, ‚ÄúMary‚Äù have been best friends since childhood. They were each others rocks, especially cause of family is rather small, and most of them live in other countries, so every member counts. Mary was an amazing aunt to me, and we would visit here in her home country whenever we could. She would call of every week for hours and hours, write page after page of letters, and send gifts all the time. 

Up until about 4 years ago. 

Suddenly, the gifts stopped. The long letters were now 2 sentences, generic and insincere cards you send an acquaintance out of the need to be polite. The call stopped coming. When we would try to call her, she would never answer. On the two times she did, she made up an excuse almost immediately to get off the phone. 

She claimed that her last boyfriend had pushed her to get therapy, and through therapy she had ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù that we were bad people in her life. She said it was her duty to ‚Äúcut us out‚Äù and that although she would always try to be ‚Äúcivil‚Äù to us, we could no longer be anything more than that. 

Slight backstory: Mary has been married *many* times. Mary has had many, many boyfriends. Mary chooses *terrible* men. Pedophiles, low life‚Äôs, thieves‚Äîand this past time, a literal con man. Yes like those Nigerian Prince scam types. 

I‚Äôm not gonna get into the details of the scam. It happened 15 years ago, and in a country that I am not familiar with marital and divorce law. But anyhow, they married, she was the breadwinner because he was supposedly disabled. He decided to begin divorcing  her, gets her house and she has to pay alimony to him. She barely can support herself, has no where to live. 

My mom buys her a house, not a trailer, not a tiny house, but a very nice house in her hometown. Free of charge. Mary wants the house in her name, understandably. My mom points out to her, hold up, your divorce isn‚Äôt completely over with‚Äîdon‚Äôt you want to wait until it‚Äôs done so that there‚Äôs no way he can take this from you too? 

Mary wholeheartedly agrees. Within a couple months of the divorce being finalized, my mom signs over the house to Mary‚Äôs name. Life goes on splendidly. They are closer than sisters. She is like a second mom to me. 

Then the weirdness starts a decade later. And when my mom confronts her about it....


She claimed we had never done a thing to help her with her divorce, and we didn‚Äôt act the way real family should. 

She said that therapy had made her realize that She claims that we tried to steal the house from her (I literally can‚Äôt even imagine where she cooked this idea up, so I‚Äôm not gonna even try to explain it). 

She claimed that we had so much money we could have given her when she was struggling after the divorce, but we were selfish and didn‚Äôt give a penny (I can vividly remember my parents writing and sending thousands and thousands of dollars, $5000 at a time to her, and much more in wire transfers). 

There is more, but these are too that seemed to rile her the most. Most of them are outright lies. When my mom tried to show proof that Mary was remembering literally the opposite of what happened, Mary straight up refused to listen and basically just said ‚Äúnope‚Äù. 

As far as mental issues, she has always been a completely sane, sweet, kind and very forgiving woman. She is playful and loving and always seemed to have her head on straight. The only things that might indicate mental issues are substance abuse in the past, and...in the past she had such a dependence on men that she chose to believe her husband over her daughter in a molestation case, which backfired on her big time. 

Now, it‚Äôs gotten to the point where she is turning all of our relatives that live on her side of the country against us. Spreading these same convoluted lies. They think we‚Äôre selfish, horrible now. And no one will even listen to our side when we say we have proof. Slowly we‚Äôre getting iced out of the family. 

What on earth can we do?",21Sep2020,1

627,"So‚Ä¶.

This is some shit y‚Äôall lol

I don‚Äôt even really consider myself as someone who is political in nature, but I guess if there‚Äôs a time for me to start, it‚Äôs now. I currently live in the United States (Texas specifically, which it‚Äôs as Red as Red gets in these streets). Most of y‚Äôall already know what‚Äôs going down over here. And with the recent passing of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, we‚Äôre in even more of a precarious situation than before. 

I‚Äôm going to do my part. I‚Äôm gonna show up, I‚Äôm gonna vote, and as non-religious of a person as I am, I‚Äôm gonna pray to whatever fucking deity may exist out there that this motherfucker doesn‚Äôt get re-elected. But I'm a realist, and I need to consider my options in the case that the worst comes to pass. Here's the thing though:

I‚Äôm black.

I‚Äôm a woman.

I‚Äôm a lesbian.

If Trump gets re-elected, I don‚Äôt see a future for myself in this country. It can‚Äôt (and won‚Äôt) be right away for various reasons (many countries are still closed off to US travelers, I have a whole ass house I just bought a year ago that I would need to figure out what to do with etc), but I envision myself leaving the country within a year‚Äôs time frame if the stars align in just the right way. 

The problem is‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt really know what life would be like living as a black lesbian in a different country. I want to live somewhere that doesn't treat black folks or the LGBT community as second class citizens/undesirables. On top of that, something that has become increasingly important to me is how a country treats its people (and how well said people treat each other) during a time of crisis. Like during, say, oh I don‚Äôt know, a global pandemic. I want to move somewhere that‚Äôs safe for me to live, that has a high quality of life, that treats its people well, and DOES NOT have sub-arctic temperatures for the majority of the year (looking at YOU, Nordic ‚Äúhappiest in the world‚Äù countries and Canada, y‚Äôall are too damn cold and I‚Äôm not sorry bout it).  
 

I would love to hear from anyone/everyone that has an opinion on where this magical place might be for someone like me. Even if Trump does not get re-elected, my intention has always been to move out of the country, just not under as much of a time crunch, so this would be helpful to know in either scenario.

632,"Alright, just starting this off by saying I‚Äôm not against mask at all. I wear them where I feel I am/will be in close proximity to others and for the most part I‚Äôm wearing one all day while in public. I follow all of the campus rules regarding mask. However, I clearly can‚Äôt wear one while I eat and here in lies the issue I‚Äôve been having with an individual.

About a week ago I was in a campus building eating a snack and studying when a man walks by and tells me I need to have a mask on in the building. I panicked and did what he told me to do, thinking it was a professor or some building authority. Then I thought about it more and realized it was just a student who didn‚Äôt even ask but commanded me to put my mask on while I was eating.

He came back again an hour later and caught me with my mask down drinking water and he again told me to wear a mask, I told him ‚Äúlook man I‚Äôm drinking water give me a break‚Äù and he told me he ‚Äúhad asthma‚Äù and would get the building manager. I said ‚Äúby all means, I want to talk to them‚Äù. About twenty minutes later the building manger arrives and this dude shuffles off not wanting to be around for the discussion. Manger tells me that ‚Äúhe‚Äôs been having a rough couple of days. His house is under construction (?) and that he is on edge‚Äù she also says that she has been dealing with this guy for the last few weeks. I said ‚ÄúOk I understand all that, and I would have probably done what he said if he would have asked nicely and not just commanded me.‚Äù I explained to her that I have no problem with mask and that I was in fact eating/drinking at the time of both confrontations. She was cool about it and mostly was just there to diffuse any potential tension.

Fast forward to today when I‚Äôm in a literal restaurant eating a meal and listening to a lecture. He comes by me again and tells me to put on my mask. I looked at him for a second and he goes ‚Äúyeah me again‚Äù and I lift up my food to show him what I‚Äôm doing. He tells me to ‚Äúgo outside then, it‚Äôs really nice, go outside‚Äù all the while backing away from me. I laughed at him and told him to get the building manger again because ‚Äúthat worked so well the last time‚Äù and he walked away. 

One of my friends suggested I contact somebody about this dude harassing me, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs escalated that far yet. What should I do if he keeps this up, if anything at all? He seems to be singling me out because in the restaurant nobody is wearing a mask but he chose to confront me.",21Sep2020,1
633,Hey I'm currently 15 years and 9 months old and I don't feel comfortable with my height.

634,"I was a good student until 4th grade. Very attentive and active in class. I liked school and felt it was a healthy and competitive way for me to mature. I was always looking forward to the next grade for it each year is a major milestone at that age (and a large percentage of one's life). 

My family was moving to a new town at the time that I was supposed to go into 5th grade and my older brother was supposed to go into 6th (middle school). During the transitioning summer, my parents dropped the news that they wanted my brother to experience the town's elementary school before going to middle school and told me that they didn't want us in the same grade because of how other students might react to it. My brother was ok with it (he recently told me he was fine because he wanted to dominate the younger kids in sports..). 

I'll vividly remember crying and begging for them to not make me repeat a year and grow up with younger kids for a long time. I was devastated. They tried to make me feel better by offering me a ""computer setup,"" which did slightly help, but I still felt as though I lost 10% of my life. I never did end up getting a computer setup, though they got me a nice desk, that i didn't use often because of what i'm about to type.

I resented school from then on. Hated everything about it. Hated when my parents asked about homework, hated being older than everyone in my grade, hated relearning what I previously had, and it set off a chain reaction into my future years. I never studied, avoided doing homework as much as possible, developed depression (not saying that was linked to being held back), and was against the grain in many respects throughout middle/high school. Skipping classes, remedial classes, alternative schools, prioritizing everything ahead of academics etc.

I graduated high school with a 2.2 gpa and dropped out of the first semester of my college, SIX TIMES AT FIVE DIFFERENT SCHOOLS. I had enough, school wasn't for me, I had decided this long ago, I wasn't onboard with ""the system."" 

A few years after the decision to not try again in college, after my parents even tried to get me to attend college, I wanted to attend community college for myself. A self-motivation that I never had with school before. I adamantly made it clear that I didn't want my parents to know what I was going to school for and told them not to ask me ANYTHING about school. It had nothing to do with them. This was for me.

I did well in CC, very well, and got into a great 4 year college. I had anxiety because the 4 year is in a major city so I switched to part-time. I'm 29 years old and in a lot of respects, I fear the ability to soak up new information quickly may have sailed or may be on the way out. My time also feels extremely limited as opposed to if I was 20. School and education in general are some of the most beautiful things i've ever come across and I feel as though I was put in a position of failure, almost forced to dislike one of my now favorite things in the world. I'm so sad at times that it happened this way and i'd be lying if I were to say that I don't regularly think of where I could have been if I wasn't held back. 

I need something rational thought on this, it doesn't have to be uplifting, anything real would be appreciated. Perspective from an outside source. Please. I know there are many other bigger deals in this world that dwarfs my issues, but I still want advice on how to handle this. I feel like I was a science experiment. Thank you very much.",21Sep2020,1

On a similar post someone asked form my diet so I'll copy paste my reply here.

My diet starts with either something sweet or boiled eggs on something for breakfast (usually a salad, burrito or toast.) I usually eat something sweet though.

Then I don't eat anything for about 6-8 hours and eat half of my school lunch and take care to eat the salad most of the time, I usually either skip dinner or eat a lot of snacks instead like dried fruit or sweets. 

But if I do eat it, it's usually leftovers which can be pasta with a bunch of veggies and meat, meat and potatoes or whatever else we got in the fridge. Though I do admit, I usually only eat on a tea plate when I eat dinner. If I do eat more it's usually soup I put togheter with the veggies I can find in the fridge.

While my diet might sound healthy, It's not really because  I' obssessed with sweets and eat way too little real food. My BMI is 19.7, I'm in the healthy range (18,5 to 24 I think) though a bit under the average but I exercise quite a lot, usually 30-45 min 5 days a week.",21Sep2020,1
637,"I cannot stop thinking about this, it has been going on for a few months now. I was with a girl for 2.5 years, we had everything together, it was a very healthy relationship, at least I thought. Ive never been so happy with anyone in my life.

I joined the military over a year ago. She supported my decision the whole way, we knew eachother long before I even considered enlisting. I think the long distance is one of the major factors that caused us to split.

During the timeframe of january to now, i was in training for my MOS (just got assigned to my duty station in Okinawa). That was seriously a low time in my life. I could never be there for her, because i was always busy or stressed out. Due to my emotional unavailability, she leaned on some dude (a close friend of hers too) for support, and ended up cheating on me with him at a party. She left me in June, right after my birthday. 

I dont want to move on, i just want her back, and i know that's stupid and absurd, because shes the one who hurt me. But whenever i try to talk to other women, it just feels like im filling the void. Nobody catches my interest like she did. Its even worse because i know she doesnt care anymore. We're still ""friends"" but it really means nothing, whenever we talk she just does not care at all.

643,"I've never felt so strongly that I need to actually address my mental health until recently. Some backstory, I am a Junior in college and I absolutely can not get any work done. This feeling of not paying any attention and not doing any work started around March of this year. My whole life I avoided online classes because I knew I would never have the attention span to actually gain anything from the class. On top of not learning anything, I cant get myself to study or work on any asignments. I am a pretty big procrastinator, but I always able to map out the exact time I needed to finish a project or study, even if it was last minute, I would always pull out the motivation to finish and put out good work. However, in March I decided to just ghost all my classes and curriculum and I somehow passed everything based on pure luck. The worst part was that I wanted to fail and I felt like I was personally undermining myself. I thought it was just a build up of stress and that after this insanely long 6 month break I took, I would be back in tip top form and go back to being focused.

 I am back in school and nothing has changed, I started the first week strong and turning in everything and showing up, but my motivation strongly dropped after the second week of schooling where I had to do actual work. The work isn't difficult by any means, but I have no willpower to actually do anything. It's like an advanced form of laziness where as soon as I think of starting all the life drains out of me. Usually when im behind or I need to start up an assignment I usually would have this big lump of anxiety start to build up until I finally start on my assignment and it would alleviate pressure while giving me good ideals on what to design get my creative process flowing. The major reason I procrastinated is because nothing good ever came to me until it was the night before a desk crit or pin up and the ideals would flow to me in my sleep. Now however, I would know that I need to do an assignment and try to imagine scenarios where I would start, but I just lay there having no motivation to exert effort.

 I cant focus on anything, and while I understand in college you have to take most of your learning into your own hands, it feels like im really just doing everything and the inspiration that I used to get from in class lectures just isnt there. I just can not work at my house. I feel completely empty, so lifeless like nothing ever matters. All I contemplate is about how useless im being, the furthest I keep getting on one assignment is just watching a beginners guide to site analysis and just looping the same video and points without actually starting the research. Im back to ghosting classes because im so far behind again and it just keeps getting worse. I didnt realize how insanely productive having 24 hour school studio access made me because all I did was live in my studio. Even when I was screwing around at my desk space, I would always work on something. I just can not start progress on anything at home.

I feel like I've had some sort of mental condition for a long time, but I've been scared to get help for it or have it actually checked out. When I was in middle school, my sister was always extremely hyperactive and disruptive. My mom thought something was genuinely wrong with her and asked the doctor if she  had ADHD. The doctor said she was going through a phase and would grow out of it and actually started listing off symptoms of kids with ADHD. At the time, I remember thinking that sounded a lot like me and was nervous about how closely that described me. I didn't say anything because I didnt want to be any weirder than I thought I was, but I really wish I spoke up and got things like that diagnosed earlier.  As an adult, I just do not know where to start, I feel like something is genuinely wrong that I cant just willpower through like usual. When I had a therapy session, it felt like I really couldnt talk about myself and what was bothering me. I kept things vague, but I should have just been honest. I do not feel like existing anymore, living is bland and I just feel like a constant failure and im letting everyone down.",21Sep2020,1

645,"My younger brother (17) was playing a soccer game yesterday and him and an opponent were talking the usual shit to each other that you‚Äôd hear in a game. Never once did they talk bad about another player. After the game the opponent told one of his teammates (who‚Äôd been sent off 5 minutes after coming on for two footing someone) that my brother called him a ‚Äúforeign c**t‚Äù. Not a single other player on the pitch heard this at the time and my brother was playing centre mid so would have been within earshot of a lot of people. As my brother was heading towards the car with my mom, the kid who got sent off squared up to my brother and hit him in the head a few times. My brother was shocked and confused because he didn‚Äôt know why he was being hit. He was upset but by the time he‚Äôd gotten home he was scared about what was gonna happen in school today.  He‚Äôs friends with some popular lads in school and they all spread word around that my brother was innocent so we thought he was going to be ok. But then this morning three fellas cornered him and made him get on his knees and say that he never said anything racist which he did but then they hit him anyway. He came home straight away and now he‚Äôs scared to go back to school. And one of the guys who‚Äôs apparently still after him has the insta name of ‚ÄúBoxer of God‚Äù. 

The two clubs have investigated it and today we found out that the opponent club was talking to two lads involved from them. The two of them said they‚Äôd heard it (wasn‚Äôt mentioned at the time) and that ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù else on the pitch heard it. When they were asked to specify who said it they couldn‚Äôt name anyone but just said everyone again. It‚Äôs pretty clear to me that they‚Äôve made it up and now they‚Äôre trying to cover their tracks. The fella who claimed to have heard it first left straight away instead of reporting it to the referee at the game. (Two years ago I reported a racist comment made by someone against one of my teammates who actually played for the club my brother was playing against so I know what action should have been taken by him). 

Sorry this is so long but we genuinely don‚Äôt know what to do now. My parents want to go to the school over it but my brother and I think that could make it worse. These guys have been suspended a few times already and school punishment clearly doesn‚Äôt phase them.

650,"So I (15m) would say that I generally have had a good childhood. My parents love me and care for me, but we just don‚Äôt ‚Äúget each other‚Äù. I‚Äôve seen that a lot of other kid‚Äôs relationships with their parents go one of two ways: either the kids don‚Äôt really interact with their parents that much and they leave each other alone, or the kids are friends with their parents and really take an interest in one another. The issue is that my parents are pretty strange. Neither of them are very social, and overall, they are pretty old fashioned. My dad doesn‚Äôt even have a phone, and the only computer in our household is a very old laptop. My parents work a lot, but not a crazy amount, probably a little above average. I guess my issue is that my parents don‚Äôt take very much interest in me, but also never leave me alone. I get good grades, but they always say that they should be higher. My mother is usually busy doing things, but the second that she isn‚Äôt, she expects me to be there with her, doing the things that she is interested in. I guess I get annoyed because I try to connect with them but it just doesn‚Äôt happen. I try and do one thing with them that isn‚Äôt their idea and they immediately dismiss it. But they won‚Äôt leave me alone. I have some friends, but overall not that many social obligations, and most of the free time that I have I like so spend either exercising, being with my friends, or playing video games. My parents just don‚Äôt seem to see the value in me just doing my own thing. They act like they want to be friends with me, but whenever I want to show them something like a new hobby or video that I‚Äôm into, they are asking if I have all my homework done, or if I vacuumed the house or whatever. I do all those things and I understand that they should be done, that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm complaining about. When we all have downtime, my parents say that we should be doing something as a family, but it‚Äôs never really ‚Äútogether‚Äù, and it never lasts very long. 

I would honestly be fine with either of the above stated parenting styles, but I‚Äôm not really happy just operating on the same schedule and doing the same things in my free time as them. Any advice on what I should do ?",21Sep2020,1

653,"I have a friend who I‚Äôll call joy. I knew joy from a mutual friend and I‚Äôve been friends w her for exactly a year now. We were super close because we had no one else to start university with. However, in July, my dad passed away and I had a very very hard time because he was basically my best friend and my support system. Obviously a few days after he passed I wasn‚Äôt replying much to my friend joy and she became angry at me. When I told her my dad had passed, she said quote on quote ‚Äúcondolences man‚Äù and nothing else. I was already kind of put back because it sounded disrespectful but I let that go. About five days after my dad passed she comes and says dude r u on ur period why r u so cranky to me over text. She was saying how I was being mean and unfair to her although I was not in my opinion. She said I was using her as a punching bag and nothing more. She apologized for saying that to me a while later bc she said she felt bad. But words are said and can‚Äôt be taken back in my opinion. And she kept going on. Even when I said lm just depressed she replied with ok. I thought of her as my best friend. Her excuse for not talking to me about my dad passing was because she didn‚Äôt want to bring it up but she never once asked me if I was ok or checked up on me or asked if I needed anything. She even told me to help her with her quizzes. 

Back track, in first semester and throughout first year she really adored this guy and thought he was super cute. She liked him for his looks but never interacted with him ever.  I‚Äôll call him Ben. Ben reached out to me because he saw we had the same class and texted me. I was surprised so I texted joy telling her that he texted me and I can now introduce her to him. And hype her up to him for that matter. She said no. So I didn‚Äôt do it. Ben and I continued talking and I started to realize that he is a rly good friend to me and we had a lot in common but again I felt guilty talking to him. 

Fast forward, joy told me she has no feelings toward Ben anymore and doesn‚Äôt care about him. And the reason why she was being distant with me and didn‚Äôt like that I was talking to him is because I didn‚Äôt tell her I was talking to him since she saw him tag me in a Facebook post. But that was it. She didn‚Äôt like him anymore and she said she doesn‚Äôt care that I talk to him. 

However, today, she tells me that she feels uncomfortable and that I‚Äôm breaking girl code for talking to someone that she used to like (they never talked once again). She said she can‚Äôt control me but is pissed off that I‚Äôm friends with Ben. 

She said that I cannot talk to guys she has liked in the past even though I have no interest in pursuing them. Strictly friendship. That‚Äôs not okay right ? 

Is this reasonable? I should cut her off right ?

When I call to remind him to go to his appointments or make appointments he tells me I am nagging him and to leave him alone. He says it's none of my business. 

I gave him numbers for free ride services to medical appointments and told him to call them since he doesn't have a car and he told me to stay out of it and quit nagging him. 

I have two half siblings. One of them wants nothing to do with him and the other is barely capable of taking care of himself. I also live far away from my father and can't be near to help him. My father wasn't the best growing up and we were very poor so there is some resentment among my siblings for how we were raised. 

I don't know what to do. I feel like it's my responsibility to make sure he gets taken care of but he's making it so difficult. Part of me wishes I could just forget about it and live my life like my siblings seem to be doing but I'm a better person than them and the guilt would eat at me.

Their biggest arguing point is that they don‚Äôt like sex before marriage. And they think the worse case scenario is if I got pregnant unmarried. Even after I said the worse case scenario is I would killed. And which they shrugged, saying things like that happen everyday but they care more about me sinning. 

While yes I understand religion is an important aspect for people and I respect people‚Äôs morals/beliefs.

He is concerned because the school has not made any attempt to refund him of the class or use the grade from that class, which was better than the first one.

The first message explained the situation and I kindly asked for my missing item to be sent. The reply was ‚Äúyour item is on its way!‚Äù This annoyed me a little because I had already stated the package was delivered without the item, so I assume a bot replied. I kept calm and sent another message explaining there were multiple items in the package that had already been delivered. Their reply: ‚Äúthe item was delivered. Please check your doorstep or mailbox!‚Äù When I received the package I actually approached the mailbox as the mailwoman was filling the boxes and asked for mail for my address, and she handed me the package so there was certainly no other package. Also, the package says 1/1 on the front (not 1/2, so there‚Äôs no second package). I am certain that I received the package and the item was missing, I explained, still remaining calm. Support replied: ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt offer refunds for delivered items.‚Äù I don‚Äôt want a refund, I want my item.

Additional info:
-the package was delivered by USPS and didn‚Äôt seem tampered with. 
-the clothes arrived kind of wrinkled and the bags within the package that contained the clothing looked like they‚Äôve been through some handling. 
-there was a mask in the package that I didn‚Äôt order. I figured it might be a gift but maybe they accidentally sent a mask instead of pants. 

What I‚Äôve tried:
-contacting the main Chinese distributor of the clothing who sent the package (not the Wish seller, though I am unsure if the Wish seller and the distributor are the same company or if the Wish seller is a reseller). The distributor is reputable but since they are based in China they don‚Äôt offer an opportunity to call them, only chat message. I asked them if they could check the order and their inventory to see if the pants were accidentally not sent out or if the order inquiry never included the pants. They have not yet replied but I sent the message last night so I will give them time. 
-contacting Wish customer support (which was a dead end).

What I haven‚Äôt tried:
-calling Wish‚Äôs customer service phone number
-contacting the Wish seller and inquiring about the missing item
-calling my bank and demanding that the charge be cancelled

672," This became a long post as it ended up being a bit of a rant which I do apologize for. I did however write a TL;DR at the end.  


 I'm born and bred in Portugal and have lived the majority of my life there with the exception of the past 7 years where I lived in the UK and the 2 years I lived in the US as a child. After returning from the US it was very difficult for me to adapt to Portugal due to cultural differences and a traumatic event that led to me becoming depressed and suicidal from the age of 9. My mom was raised in South Africa so she too has raised me differently than the Portuguese ""norm"". As such, I always felt different from those around me. For example, although it's my native language and the language I speak the most I still feel like I can barely communicate in Portuguese and others don't understand me (nor want to), I find it difficult making and keeping friends there and the fact that I don't look Portuguese nor look like anyone in my family doesn't help either.

My first years in the UK were great, I had to go to college before being able to go to university but I loved it and was one of the best students of my year (I had never been a good student before so it was a really nice feeling and made me feel confident which was also something new to me), I had friends, I felt integrated and felt no different from those around me.  


  
 Fast-forwarding in time to my first year of university and the Brexit referendum results came out. That was the beginning of the decline. It's as if the referendum results gave people the right to mistreat foreigners, all of a sudden none of my opinions mattered and if I dared to voice my views it's as if I was asking to be attacked with a variety of xenophobic comments including the classic ""just go back to your country then"". My 1st year of university started well until about halfway through the year when a girl from my class started spreading rumours about me and other members of my class joined in. During my 2nd year the bullying became physical to what many witnessed but nobody vouched for when I reported this. The situation escalated even more after I reported her as the course's director went to talk to the girl, she made a very racist and threatening post about me online, in the comments of said post I saw people from my course (not just from my class, from all years) who barely knew me (some of who I never even spoke to) and some of who I didn't even know posting images of weapons, racist comments and threats about me. It was scary as I lived on campus and many of the people commenting not only lived in the same student accommodation as me but about five of them lived in the same building as me. I screenshotted it and showed the post and the comments to the course's director who did absolutely nothing but say there's not a procedure in place in the university for bullying and that the most she could do is direct me to the university's therapist and contact the police if I really feel threaten by the comments. I had to take a year off the course as it caused me to attempt suicide.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 Returning to university was incredibly difficult as the people who bullied me were now a year above me and I'd cross paths with them ever so often and I didn't know anyone from my current year. I barely learnt anything throughout the entirety of the as I was too anxious to focus or even ask for help in class and that was reflected in my grades. I have since graduated but due to my grades and broken knowledge I can't even apply to the most basic job role in the industry I studied in as I know I'll be rejected or I feel like I'm not competent for the job. Whenever I have free time, I study and practice my work to try to piece together this broken knowledge but it's been so very difficult and as ashamed as I am to say it as it makes me come across as weak, studying and following tutorials reminds me of everything and I feel overwhelmed with anxiety. My therapist told me to just give up on this and focus on something else but I don't know how to do anything else. I don't have any talents, I barely have any friends and because the ones I do make ghost me after a month or so or treat me badly I have lost the ability to trust people and leave before they have the chance to hurt me, I live in a house that's divided into flats and two of my neighbours are incredibly racist with one of them getting drunk and yelling awful things at my door. I can't afford to move as the houses in my area are too expensive or don't have access to the public transport I need to take for work. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 But I had another hope, which was Sweden. I have a deep love for Scandanavian languages and have taught myself (with the help of Rosetta's Stone and Swedish course books) basic level Swedish and am still studying to advance more. I was considering moving there once I felt more confident in my language skills but after talking to other immigrants there, I am now scared that it will be the exact same if not worse than England. The immigrants I spoke to have also suffered from xenophobia and one of them pointed out how Neo-Nazism is becoming a trend with there being two main Neo-Nazi groups (I have a tattoo in Hebrew so this scared me quite a lot). I am however taking this information with a gigantic pinch of salt as not only the few Swedish people I know don't have an inch of cruelty in them, I also don't like others opinions to completely influence mine. However, it was still something very heartbreaking and hopeless to hear.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

 So I just feel like there's not a single place in the world for me. I don't want to go back to Portugal because I never felt at home there and would never find a job there, I feel pressured to leave the UK due to how an increasing amount of the general population perceives and treats me as soon as they notice my accent and I feel that all other countries are the same. I just feel so unwelcome, unwanted and alone all the time it's as if I can feel it physically. I know three countries aren't the whole world but I'm so exhausted from immigrating and working so hard for a country that treats me like a 2nd class citizen. I just want a safe and unthreatened life, I don't need the highest paying job, the best house or even the biggest group of friends, I've already given up on any hopes of having a partner so I don't even expect that at this point, I just want to not feel like this and feel like I matter just as much as anyone else.  
 Despite all, I am still and will forever be very grateful for even having the opportunities that the UK gave me in the first place, no bad treatment will ever make me overlook that. But I feel like I don't belong anywhere and this imposter syndrome has taken over my entire identity. Was wondering if anyone else feels something similar or if anyone has any advice.  


&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR -** Never felt welcome in my native country, so I immigrated for my studies only to be bullied, ostracized and a victim of xenophobia. Was considering moving to another country but according to their immigrants' xenophobia is also a problem there. Feel like I don't belong anywhere",21Sep2020,1

679,"I am on a mobile so sorry if formatting isn‚Äôt great. I can‚Äôt delve into extreme details as i‚Äôd hate for this to reveal any personal information about myself or others. 

I am 23 and live with my mum at home in UK, i pay my way with bills and rent as i work full time and have done ever since i was 18 without fail. This hasn‚Äôt always been easy, but i‚Äôve never been irresponsible with the money i need for those things. 

My brother who is in his mid/late 30s, is entirely different. He is troubled and just seems to have never have grown out of the young teenage chavvy dickhead phase. We have never been close, because even as a child i was aware that any form of close relationship would backfire on me either emotionally or financially. I still loved him to death though, but as i grew i just saw more of who he is. 

Anyway, last year we found out he had a pretty bad drug addiction (could have told you this but my mum was in complete denial, and even bringing this up to him he would flip). So yeah, a fuck tonne of debt that he expects everyone else to fork out for him. This was resolved and for as far as we were aware he was clean, this week we find this is not the case. 

He has been harassing my mum for money for months on end. Every week infact. Up to the sum of ¬£800 he owes her, and hasn‚Äôt a penny to pay back. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, i know my mum has been fucking undeniably stupid and i want to give her a good shake. But she has just been conned by her son. (Despite me raising concerns months and months ago). 

Hes still asking her for money. He has robbed his dads wage. He blew his compensation from an accident on god knows what, above ¬£15k. Hes emotionally abusing my mum. He tells her that if she doesn‚Äôt give him the money then his house will be petrol bombed. Hes suicidal. Its not his fault. He has no food, gas or electric. 

My answers for this are: it isn‚Äôt our fucking problem. He is in his 30s and should be working and making a life for himself, but he has completely wasted it. I truly believe the damage he has done to his life is irreparable. After weeks of my mum telling him to literally fuck off and leave her alone, he still rings her begging. 

It has gotten to the point i have nothing but hate fuelled resentment for him, and i feel robbed that i have a brother i was never able to create a normal bond and relationship with because he‚Äôd rather be a smackhead instead. It infuriates me that as it is, my mum and i have never had a lot. He has often left us for money without bills, no food etc. He doesn‚Äôt care. I honestly don‚Äôt care about him anymore. 

I don‚Äôt know what advice i want. I guess advice that i want him to leave us alone. How can i get through to my mum to cut him off? She never will. 
But i need to know i‚Äôm not being a cynical bitch. I feel used, i feel sick, and i feel like i want to smash heads over the fact he has done this to his own mother.",21Sep2020,1
680,"Hello,
I (16F) am so tired of having to listen to the children on this street scream and yell and crash. I am so tired of having to hear their music. I have exams to sit and I often develop migraines because of all of this noise.
I am writing to the estate company and was wondering if this email is appropriate?
 
 'To whom it may concern,
I am a tenant of..... and I am writing to you to with a complaint.
There are some residents of this street that have children and a lot of these children roam the streets screaming and yelling and banging all evening on weekdays and all day on weekends.
It is a nuisance and I have many important exams to sit throughout the coming years and I am unable to concentrate, especially as I develop a migraine.
On top of these screaming children, some often play loud music which further disturbs me from my studies.
All homes are supposed to be a place of comfort for people, yet when I come home, I have to deal with this. I understand children are quite active, however there are local parks they can be taken to and it is important to teach children how to control themselves, rather than screaming incessantly. Additionally, I have not seen this issue on other streets, just mine. 
This is unjust. Please solve this issue as soon as possible'

I feel like I am being fair because I know a lot of people are like 'oh they're just kids' but no. It is important kids are taught how to respect other people in their neighbourhood and there is an appropriate time and place for such behaviour. Parents can take the children to the park which is quite near by or on a walk for a bit every day. Why should I have to suffer just because your child cannot deal with all that energy? I never screamed and yelled as a kid for all hours of the day
Any advice and feedback to my email would be appreciated",21Sep2020,1

684,I‚Äôm 27 and my gf is 30. At this point most likely ex. I have a female best friend which been in my life for a little over 3 years. She was going thru divorce and I was suicidal so we kind a clicked and basically became sex buddies/would do everything together. We were never in the relationship or anything. We eventually moved in together to save money. We both wanted a relationship but not with each other since we didn‚Äôt have same interests. I met a girl in February and ever since that point we never slept or done anything inappropriate together. I never told my current gf about my best friends and my history since I was scared that she would never give me a shot. It was really messed up and selfish on my part. Huge dick move and I know it. Fast forward 6 months now. I moved out a month ago since I bought a house. I finally told my gf and she feels betrayed and hurt. Which she has every damn right to be. I regret everything I done. She told me that if I complete cut her off she will forgive me. It‚Äôs easier said then done since I have such a long history with my friend. I love my best friend in a friend way. But I love my gf like I never loved before. But it just kills me to cut my best friend like that. My gf is super upset as she has the right to be since I should have told her. I never cheated on her. It never crossed my mind for a second. It‚Äôs just hard to cut someone off you knew for a while and basically saved your life. I don‚Äôt know what to do. If I don‚Äôt cut my best friend off it feels like any future relationships could possibly suffer. Except I would never hide the fact we had history. I made a stupid selfish mistake.

699,"I‚Äôm writing this not only to get advice, but to get this off my chest as well. When I first started medical school, I became close friends with a classmate for her humor, kindness, and intellect. Even though she had a never-ending supply of outrageous/funny stories, I didn‚Äôt think much of it other than that she was a gifted storyteller. However, over the last few years, I have come to the challenging realization that she has a fairly serious compulsive lying problem. She becomes obsessed with certain people (classmates, colleagues, doctors we work with, friends from before med school that I have no interaction with), and frequently tells me stories about them that are a bit too far-fetched to believe. She never tells stories about people I work with closely, such that it would be hard for me to verify details. However, whenever I‚Äôve subtly tried to verify the stories with other people who were supposedly present, it is consistently met with confusion. Sometimes she will tell the same story to multiple people, but then it ends with a totally different punchline than the version she first told me.

I started writing it down each time she shares something that seems suspect/off, and it appears that she makes things up on a daily basis. The frequency increases when she is under stress. I‚Äôm unclear as to the exact motivation and the extent of her insight into knowing she has a lying problem. Nonetheless, I am increasingly frustrated about being lied to constantly. One part that really sucks is feeling like I can't believe anything she tells me, even though surely some of the stories she shares actually did happen. The lies are primarily inconsequential and benign in their nature. Other times, there's a persecutory component with stories of people casually telling her vicious things about her looks and relationship status.

Even if it‚Äôs a pathological issue she has no control over, it is disturbing and feels crappy to be on the receiving end of it. Moreover, I am deeply concerned that she is going to be a physician with an out-of-control compulsive lying problem. While I have never once had evidence of her being dishonest about patients, it scares me that she is so facile with lying despite going into a profession where integrity is everything.

I‚Äôve been stuck-in with them since March, and it gave me a closer look at something my dad does almost constantly, but I never noticed until now. 

For example, I‚Äôll be going to put something back in the fridge but can‚Äôt find room, instead of him asking if I need help, he takes the object out of my hands and puts it in the fridge himself.
If I‚Äôm struggling to close an envelope he takes the envelope from my hands and seals it.

706,"TLDR: I'm gay and closeted. My parents are loving, yet very homophobic. They're very sick. I'll graduate high school next year and don't know if I should move away or not. What would you do?


Long version:
I love my family. I really, really do. Might sound cheesy as hell but I kiss my parents good night every night, when my older sister stays for the weekend, I give her my bed and take the mattress, I forgave my brother the year-long physical and psychological abuse he put me through as a kid bc he was genuinely sorry. 

I'm also gay and very much in the closet. I'm 95% sure that my parents will not be supportive at all; when I was a kid they used to say that being gay is like having cancer and that gay people need to go to a doctor to get treatment. Yikes. 

When I was younger, I always planned to move across the country right after graduating high school. I'll graduate next year, money won't be a problem bc uni is basically free and as a low-income student the government will give me money every month. 

Now that I'm so close to graduating it's kind of too much? I'm really scared that I'll regret moving out so young and cutting my family off. 

My parents are both very sick. My dad had a few near death experiences before I was even 10. I think that's the reason why I never had a full blown ""I hate my parents"" phase, I just think about how little time I have with them and then I can't help but think that I'm selfish for just throwing that away. 

I'm scared that I'll regret moving away and not spending more time with them. But I'm also scared that I'll regret hiding who I am for longer than I have to. 

Ik that nobody can tell me exactly what to do, it's my life and I have to make life decisions like these.

707,"I have been writing of this guy, Alex (not real name) for a few months now. Documenting the things we do and asking for advice on how to proceed. To everyone who has given me advice, helped me, listened to me ramble - I thank you with the entirety of my heart and soul. After much debate with myself, I have been in a frenzy of emotions when it comes to this boy. 

We have spent a lot of time together. Three days in a row last week, and one of those days was sneaking him into my room! Oh it was fantastic, we got so close and I could have kissed him. We almost got caught too, if we had left my room 30 seconds later than we did, my father would have seen us. When we got to the bottom of the stairs, we heard my father wake up and start making his way to the bathroom, so I yanked Alex under the stairs and we froze in silence, waiting for the dreaded sound of my father making his way down the stairs. The sound never came, and we remained in place for a few minutes. After we heard him go back to his room, we had to wait for him to fall back asleep (which took not even a full minute) and as we waited I clung to him, hugged him so tightly. He hugged back just as tight, holding onto me and even rubbing my arm in comfort. We snuck out, got him back to his car, where we hugged again. So so tight, and each time we broke apart, we held each other by the arms and remained close as we spoke our goodbyes. Now we are even speaking of sneaking me into his room sometime soon. 

That fear I felt was minimal to the closeness and protection I felt in his arms, where it just felt right. It felt like I was supposed to be there, being held by him, holding him. Before he had left, we held hands while sitting on my bed, and just talked. We spoke a lot of sexual things, which added to my sexual tension to begin with but now it is amplified tenfold. We hung out the next night, under the stars in 30 degree (Fahrenheit) weather, under a blanket. He had gotten cold so I draped my legs over him (I was also cold but it was a good excuse to put myself on him without it being weird) and we froze together. But we just enjoyed the time, holding hands and leaning on each other. 

He had told me that night that because of me, he has become more touchy and affectionate, but only when it comes to me. He told me he enjoys my time, and that the biggest compliment he had ever received was me calling him a 9/10 (reference the previous posts I have made about this if you want more understanding). I had brought up a website of questions to ask people you want to get to know better, and we passed my phone back and forth (something I never do with anyone) and asked each other question after question. 

We then, the next day, went to an art show and then walked around his old high school, then proceeded to just drive around until he had to drop me off and go to work. He even told me I looked great in the outfit I wore to the show, which felt good. I even brought him dinner, which he insisted on paying for. I wanted to pay, since he had paid for a drink we got while we were out (not alcoholic, just a bottle of tea). He wanted to get a drink and could not decide so I picked it for him. We walk around a bit and then he asks if I want anything and I said sure. I told him he could pick my drink so he did, and he paid for the two of them. I had brought him a snack too, and I think I have figured out his love language when it comes to what he likes from people. I think he likes little gifts, tiny things to bring him when we are together. So anyway, he gave me a $20, and said ""I am not gonna let you pay for my dinner, there's just no way"" and I gave in. 

So now here we are, at the crux of my problem. I had asked my dad about it all, finally. I never really tell him of my relationship problems but I did for some reason. He told me ""well, if he spends so much time with you  one on one, odds are he likes you."" I told him about the hugging and even hand holding and he said ""most men are not affectionate like that, so there is a good chance, if he is anything like a typical male"" which he is. 

Alex, being willing to hold my hand and even admitting that it is just easier for him to do now. Alex, hugging me for over 30 seconds at a time when we say goodbye. Alex, spending hours and hours alone with me. Alex, who now for the past few hang outs has not even smoked weed with me like we usually do, all to have the same amount of fun. Alex, who now helps me when I have something I cannot do, and demonstrates concern when I am upset. Alex, someone I am afraid to admit that I love. 

I am afraid to love. That is my fear. I keep saying I don't love him but I know that I do. Is three to four months long enough to know you love someone? Has it been enough time? I don't want to admit it and I won't until I am sure. My feelings for him grow every day. When he compliments my art, tells me I am doing fine in life, tells me everything will be okay. When he holds my hand, when he moves the blanket over me to make sure I am not freezing. When he wears my hoodie and I sleep in it to feel close to him. When he opens up about his life and his dreams, his feelings and his desires. When he laughs and his teeth show, and he puts his tongue in between them before bending forward and taking a deep breath. His hands, how they feel in mine. I am terrified to admit that I am slowly steadily falling in love and I am afraid he does not feel the same. My fear is keeping me from saying anything and if I were to say anything, my father says I should just make it matter-of-fact and to the point. That I like him, and to ask if he feels the same. 

What do I do. Please help, please tell me if it sounds like I am in over my head, if it sounds like he does not like me back. Please someone, anyone. I am slowly feeling things and feeling like a real human being for once, who loves and who cares about someone so passionately. And I am terrified.",21Sep2020,1

It only takes 16 weeks (not including basic training) to become a medic in the Canadian military and then 18 months of on going training which is what any paramedic would do on the civilian side anyway. 

So I‚Äôm thinking to myself... if they shut down the schools because of COVID I‚Äôll have to restart the whole program again since it‚Äôs ‚Äúintensive‚Äù / constantly evolving. 

Ok, I‚Äôm impatient it‚Äôs no lie and I hate re doing things. I‚Äôm more of a measure twice cut once type of person... Now, I have a wonderful life where I currently live so moving would be the last thing on the list, which is why I‚Äôm hesitant to re enlist.

722,"Hooooo boy 

So basically one of best friends is in an abusive relationship right now. This guy that she knew for a while started talking to her more in depth about it to try and help her through it. They started to like each other, the guy broke up with his now ex gf (he was going to do it anyways).

I then hung out with this guy and my best friend. We all talked about feelings and sad things in feneral for a while. To make me feel better we all cuddled. I knew that he liked her, even though he never said it. I'm pretty damn sure she liked him too... it all just depended on if she broke up her current relationship with her toxic bf atm.

Now, for me I've only been in one relationship that was really bad lol. To help me feel less lonely, this guy offered to cuddle and hang out. (My best friend was totally fine with this btw). 

So I went over to cuddle and he was very cuddly and loving. He essentially told me that he could keep doing this for me, but to not tell people - as he didn't want it to be misconstrued. Which I understood? But also idk. He was very flirty with me, and kind of teasing about it which is like AHHH.

Here's the thing tho, is he never did anything I didn't want. Which is weird, bc in my experience guys have always been obessed with sex and thats all they would want. This guy... idk. He said he wouldn't do anything I didn't want to and it seems like he meant it.

Now I'm an idiot lol and I got a crush on him (which I rarely get crushes). And he said that he felt like he liked me too. He said he liked both of us and would go out on a date with me, but did talk to my best friend first. He even said that he felt bad and that didn't mean he liked me less, this just was more circumstantial. He said that if my best friend didn't like him, that he'd love to go out on a date with me essentially.

I'm waiting on what my friend does, essentially. I know I have my feelings for this guy, but my best friend's current boyfriend is really toxic and I think this guy and my best friend would be really great for each other. I care about them both so much... idk what to do. Idk if I should go for it, hell, I don't even know if I'll have the chance to go for it.... help me out here friends?

Update: She didn't break up with him. He of course felt disappointed... but asked if I still wanted to go on a date. I said yes, also I talked a lot of things through with him.

I am worried, because I want to take things slowly, I'm not as experienced as him, and also I really don't know if I am enough of a sexual person.

I also addressed how he felt about my friend. He said he of course felt a little disappointed, and sad about it... but that he would get over it quickly because he knew nothing would come of it and he was excited that I was going to go out with him. It makes me feel a bit weird, but he said he would get over it quickly. I worry that I'm an after thought even tho he said I absolutely was not. Idk if Im being stupid, or manipulated.

I told him I take things slowly, and he said he felt 100% fine with that, and that all that mattered is if I was willing to be open to things as the relationship progressed- but to not feel pressured. To just wait and see how I would feel about things.

Am I dumb for going for him? Part of me thinks I'm getting played but dont know if Im overthinking it. We were going to hang out/go on a date today. Idk plz help and give me some perspective - ask any questions that you need for clarification and I'll answer as best as I can

Update Update: She doesn't feel good about her decision to stay with her bf. I think she is going to ask him for a break and try to date this guy. I basically got caught in a love triangle wtf lol.

I feel like telling the guy that idk if it will worm out (obviously) perhaps in another life it could have worked... but not this one.",21Sep2020,1

730,"So we have plots that we inherited, not that big just 1/4 each sibling. 

Currently some plots were up for sale and I wasnt in the country, so one of the siblings was in charge and managed to sell the plots but at a cheap rate. I have no problem with it as parents(owners) had agreed to it.

Right now, the sibling is developing his plot, building 4 2bedroom bungalows. He says he sources the materials for cheap and all. Thing is, he watches youtube videos, calls the builder (just one guy who hires other guys) and builds. He hasnt called an architect or an engineer to check the buildings, he hasnt planned for ventilation and speocifc materials to use, he basically does not have a plan for the development and just has a ""vision"". I helped him out with a site plan and a render for the units , but it clearly shows he is going with the flow and he tells me that he is. 

With he financials, he has no financial statements and tells me he has everything in his head. I have a feeling there are things he has not considered while developing the land and selling it, so I would love if I could get advice on things I should consider about developing land and selling it especially in the book keeping department. 

I love my sibling , ofcourse , but he has a habit of just being all over the place, he will convince you since he smooths talk (if you listen closely you will notice he is redirecting and not using specific estimates or technical jargon), says stuff like it's the cheapest around here, high profit margin etc. 

He has just informed me that he doesnt want to do it on his plot anymore as he doesnt want to sell the plot too so he wants to use one of the parents plot (so he doesnt lose his). I have explained to him he needs to pitch it but with proper estimates and a plan. I said this because my parents are old and cant deal with his over-selling as he will push it on you however he wants and just is all over the place when he tries selling his idea to you. So since I'm here I'm trying to get things in order. 

So please, ask me anything,  and advice me with anything,  I need to learn as much as possible from people who are in real estate development and real estate finances. This would be greatly appreciated.

I‚Äôll first state that - I understand empathy as a concept. If someone is crying because their pet died, I‚Äôd understand that losing a loved animal would create a sad response to the person; therefore I‚Äôd react sadly. The problem is, I‚Äôve barely emotionally reacted to anyone before, only dissected it logically and then react accordingly. 

I love my family, but I have a tendency to overlook how they feel, I take feelings too literally and I come across as cold, ignorant and unloving. I completely failed to pick up on my actions and emotions until I had a final confrontation, thinking about what the person said and dissecting it ‚Äî and have a light bulb moment for my behaviours. I don‚Äôt think I care, I just react because I SHOULD react to solicit a positive response, I don‚Äôt genuinely feel it. I didn‚Äôt know people could feel empathy until I heard discussions of it, I had thought empathy is a learned behaviour, not naturally given. I also find it naturally hard to bond to others, and have extremely short friendships throughout my life. 

Would I kill anything? No, I wouldn‚Äôt, because it‚Äôs morally incorrect. I don‚Äôt like seeing animals or people suffering because it‚Äôs unpleasant, do I actually care? No. I know why people feel certain ways, and I can be emotional just as well, but I truly don‚Äôt emotionally understand it. Like a wall. 

Can this be fixed before I ruin my relationships?",21Sep2020,1

739,"So I have a very tightly knit friend group, we‚Äôre all in college but we‚Äôve known each other longer than most of us can remember. 5 guys and one girl, although she has that ‚Äúone of the guys‚Äù vibe about her. I‚Äôd never really had feelings for her until the two of us kinda spontaneously went on a bit of a one time date a couple years back. Probably the most romantic thing I‚Äôve ever done, it was the middle of winter and we went out on this frozen lake, danced around, kissed, and that was it. We‚Äôve barely even talked about it and not much else has happened. 

She‚Äôs currently in a relationship with someone right now and I definitely still have these feelings but I‚Äôve put them to the side for now because I‚Äôm honestly just not the type of guy to feel comfortable going after someone in a relationship. (And I doubt I‚Äôd be successful anyway) until recently when it‚Äôs been feeling like she‚Äôs giving me signs but maybe I‚Äôm just being hopeful? Idk, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here lol. Me and her have been getting a lot closer in the past year in terms of our friendship and recently we‚Äôve been hanging out a lot. I‚Äôm not really sure how to format this so I‚Äôll probably just throw out all the ‚Äúsigns‚Äù I feel like I‚Äôve noticed and leave it up to the reddit gang. 

There‚Äôs the classic one of her pretty much dying laughing (snorting, can‚Äôt breathe, the whole shebang) at anything remotely funny I say, even shit I myself don‚Äôt really find funny at all. She compliments me on my looks randomly a lot, in small ways but I can‚Äôt help but appreciate it in that way ya know. 

The biggest thing, and the reason I‚Äôm making this post is basically the entirety of yesterday. It‚Äôs like a switch flipped and she‚Äôs been acting so strange. I‚Äôve been learning guitar and she likes to sing so we‚Äôll often send each other little clips and comment on them or whatever. I sent her something the other day and she was like ‚ÄúThat sounds beautiful, I could just lay down and listen to you playing all night‚Äù. She‚Äôs always complimented my playing but that just seemed like a lot, so I basically just told her we could hang out the next day and I‚Äôd bring my guitar. That‚Äôs what ended up happening, and she kept making comments like ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôm being serenaded‚Äù and stuff like that, at one point she was going on about how she always feels nervous around me and never knows what to say, and was very specific about how it‚Äôs just me.

While we were hanging she had the idea to get the rest of the friend group together to hang out and drink a little that night, which is what ended up happening. Me and her shared the couch for most of the night, and somehow she kept ending up closer and closer to me until the night ended with all of us just kinda chatting while she leaned her head on my shoulder. It sounds childish but i was so happy in that moment. Once everyone left and it was just me and her we kinda cuddled like that for 5 or so minutes and then she said she wanted to head to bed and I let myself out. I know reddit isn‚Äôt gonna be the answer to my problems but I do enjoy asking for advice on these things before I do anything and I figured I might as well do it here. I‚Äôm really not the romantic type, I tend to do a lot of one night stands and haven‚Äôt saw myself in a long term relationship for a long time, but she‚Äôs always been the exception. I‚Äôd go for her in a heartbeat if I knew there was a chance and things feel like they‚Äôre changing pretty quick",21Sep2020,1

I recently got a new job, and it‚Äôs at Target. I‚Äôve been working there for about a month now and it‚Äôs taking a toll on me.

The biggest thing that concerns me is the opinions of my friends and my partner. My friends say that I look miserable working at Target. My partner says that they miss me and that I‚Äôve been working way too much, I don‚Äôt have as much time with them anymore.

768,"Hi all! I'm going to try keep this as brief as possible:)

I [19F] met a man [29M] about 3 months ago in the professional industry. He is a qualified medical professional and I am studying to be one. My future profession has been a huge aspiration in my life since I was young, because of that I've always been more drawn to men in the same industry. 

Its important to mention that I feel I have unrealistically high standards when it comes to men, and it is very rare that I make myself vulnerable to initiate a relationship with a man because of this.

That said, I met this man and was already impressed by his mind, his skillet, his knowledge and his future outlook in life. We spent a month together working every day, of which we shared some special memories. I usually have a good instinct and read signs well. He was definitely interested in me, at some points other people asked if we were a couple. Things were going great, when we stopped working together we exchanged numbers and talked 24/7 on the phone, went on a couple dates and had slept together once. Very recently I realized I had very strong feelings for him, I was direct with him and told him where I stood. His response was that he was in an awkward stage of his life and didn't know what he wanted but he liked me a lot. We lost contact for a week while he was in hospital and spoke again as if nothing happened. At this point the feelings resurfaced and I felt like he ticked all my boxes, I could see a future with him and I felt like he brought out the best in me. I truly felt that I could give this man my all and thrive alongside him as a life partner (in due time of course) 

This is where the fruit hits the fan. All of a sudden he just stopped talking to me. It was about 4 days of no contact where we ran into each other and he said he lost his phone (which was a lie he was online almost every day) and soon after the encounter (which was pretty friendly) he blocked me. To this day I have no idea what happened, I ran into him today in a social setting, he could barely look me in the eye. I realize its time to get go. But I cant help it keep feeling like he was perfect for me. I keep remembering all the sweet things he did for me, things that previous relationships I asked them to do because its how I feel loved, but he did it because that's how he expressed love. It felt perfect while it lasted. 

How do I begin to get rid of the ""I felt like it was meant to be"" thoughts I struggle letting go of, because of the unresolved issues. (P.s I did phone him and ask what was cooking and he couldn't answer me so at that point I gave up pestering him) I'm absolutely heartbroken, I've been crying for 2 weeks now and I'm just on a roller-coaster. How do I deal with all that happened? 

Thank you all :)

770," Recently my wife has gotten into this habit of moving my belongings and then forgetting where she places them. It takes me up to an hour sometimes to look for my car keys.

This has slowly started to piss me off so I started moving my stuff onto a shelf that she can't reach, well even that hasn't worked either, because when she misplaces something she carries her stool around with her to stand on to get to higher places, so she's been moving them when she finds them on higher shelfs.

The thing is when I confront her about it she told me she stopped doing it weeks ago when I first confronted her about it, she is adamant that she is in the right and whenever I tell her that the kids can't get up there and it is only her that can, she tries to throw the blame back at me and say I put my stuff in stupid places, Which isn't true.

I even tried telling her this makes me super late for work and it can't keep happening and she still insists on being in the right and the innocent one.

When I asked her if she actually cared I was late to work and losing money that helps us afford everything we do, all she did was say was that she was sorry I was always late, but it's not at all her fault.

She has always had a thing of forgetting where she puts something destroys the house looking for it, now that its me mostly destroying the house, and then rushing out the door because I can't stay behind to clean up. So she now wakes up most mornings comes down stairs to see the living room completely ripped to shreds, this has completely pissed her off and now I've been exiled to the spare bedroom for the time being.

She seems to not want to take the blame but it's only her who could be doing this.

780,"TW: Sexual Harassment/Inappropriate touching

Background is really important here, but ill try to make it as short and detailed as possible. August 2019 I got a job at a pizza shop after my boyfriend recommended I work there since he did and they paid really nice. I started working there and a guy I had been friends with in elementary school, lets say John, was there and we kind of reconnected. We were friends or so for a few months. 

Eventually John started acting inappropriately with me. He and another one of my coworkers also left the shop for around 30\~ minutes at a time to go get coffee or just dick around without telling anyone and on the clock. At first my boyfriend was defending John and telling me I was being dramatic until he saw it for himself what he was doing and how it was affecting me. I reported John multiple times to my manager, and so did my boyfriend. They didn't take me seriously and John continued to say/do sexual things to me.  Eventually he came up to me and said ""do you like being choked?"" and when I told him to leave me alone he then proceeded to put his hands around my neck and choke me, although not that hard. I had my first panic attack that day and left early. I started calling out because going to work made me feel like I was going to have another one. 

I quit a few months later. In my resignation I stated I was quitting because of the harassment and the hostile work environment. However, I found out later that John and his friend had been telling people that me and my boyfriend were the ones who weren't working, and the main reason he hadn't been fired is because he was selling carts (like weed vape I guess) to a lot of the staff and a manager. Its illegal in my state so I guess they're hard to come by so people wanted to keep him on their good side. 

About 2 weeks after I quit he told everyone at school that I lied. I was crushed. I haven't felt lower than that in all my life. School closed 2 weeks later due to COVID but it was still hard. People were so cruel to me. Everyone loved John at school and I was just some girl, so they obviously believed him over me. I'm going to try to seek therapy sometime early 2021 when my family's financial situation is more stable. (thank you American healthcare /s)

I've been feeling better since school closed. I'm in college and its going really well even with COVID and everything being online. However, its been difficult to find another job. My boyfriend has had the same struggle. But he told me today that the pizza shop offered him a job again. The only problem is that I know that John still works there. This has been making me feel.. conflicted I guess. I want my boyfriend to have a job, I know how important having an income is right now and *nobody* is hiring in my town. I really want him to be able to have a job because I know having something to do makes him feel a lot better. I care about him greatly and don't want to ask something so big just because it makes me feel anxious. The only thing I asked is for him to not mention me whatsoever to anyone there.

I guess my question is how else do I cope with this? Sorry for the long post, I appreciate any advice. 

TLDR; Boyfriend is working at that place where my sexual harasser is working, how do I feel better?",21Sep2020,1
781,"My father has some heart issues, he takes some medicines to keep his situation under control. He should have done constant checkups, but he didn't.

A cold has been going thru our family recently (Not COVID, got tested) where first my sister got it than my mother and now me, they had very mild symptoms similar to mine but I seem to have some more severe versions of these symptoms, my nose is super runny and burns, so are my eyes and I've been constantly crying for over 48 hours now and it's causing sores under my eyes, yesterday it wasn't as bad but today it's unbearable. I can't fall asleep due to the pain and nothing I do helps.

I also can't sneeze for whatever reason, every 5 minutes or so I get to the edge of sneezing like the AHH part of the AHH-CHOO, but instead of sneezing it just makes my eyes and nose hurt even more and causes them to run even more for a few minutes, I need advice on how I could make it less torturous and how I could possibly treat it, it will probably go away with time but I don't know if I can manage another day cause it hurts so much.

786,"I‚Äôm getting sick of reading real news all the time, news that pretends to convey a realistic perception of society but actually just wreaks havoc on our collective psychology to promote an image of fear and suffering, anger and division. So I‚Äôm thinking that by starting a fake news website, there can finally be a platform where hopefully nearly everyone agrees that the information isn‚Äôt true. For example, in the sidebar on the eventual website, i will host a variety of celebrity birthdays and deaths that are false, and everyone who reads the website, for the most part, can agree that it‚Äôs not true, which to me, will be a starting point for us to bring real solidarity about issues that actually affect us.

Good afternoon, i am a 15 year old boy who wants to get involved in volunteering in adult special needs homes.  I have a passion for helping those with special needs, and when I grow up, I want to be a special ed teacher.  I told my mom and my older brother yesterday about what I wanted to do, and they seemed supportive, then I met with my guidance counselor today and she gave me some food for thought.  

She told me that due to covid restrictions still in affect in my state these homes might not want my help.  However she did tell me about the PEP program at my high school, where special needs students 14-21 are allowed to come in and we work with them to not only entertain, but to give them some work place training to prepare them for jobs in the real world.  

Working for the PEP club after schools sounds awesome but I would also like to try to make my way to work in these adult homes.  How would be the best way to gain information and contact these adult homes, as I don't have much experience applying for jobs/internships.  I would like to at least call/fill out a volunteer form and try to get in, but they may not let me due to covid restrictions.  Last thing is i'm 15 and would not be able to drive myself.  What should I do? Should I try and call and see if maybe the special needs homes would let me work there? or should I just do the PEP program at my school. Thank you for you're time!",21Sep2020,1
791,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for about three months now. She has a really tight-knit group of best friends (one girl and three guys). They have all been best friends since high school and she is 25 now. They all have a group message that they text in 24/7 and hang out weekly.

After learning more about her relationship with her friend group, I have found some pretty interesting information.

Guy 1: They dated in high school. He took her virginity. They were friends with benefits less than two years ago.

Guy 2: They dated in their early 20s, and obviously had plenty of sex.

Guy 3: Drunkenly hooked up two times at some point in the last 4-5 years.

She still has pictures on her phone of both her relationships with the two she dated. She has screenshots and videos and things all over of the guy she didn‚Äôt date as well.

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm asking at this point, I just think it‚Äôs a bit unsettling to know that they‚Äôre still so close after all the incest (literally every guy in the group).

Hi I (16M) have recently started the new year and have been hanging out with some new people that came to our school, two extroverted girls (A and B) and another very shy guy. A, B and I struck a conversation relatively easily and get along really well, and have a common interest in stand up, but I am having trouble integrating the other guy into the conversations. The first day he decided to follow us, which I think is awesome cause I would never be able to do that and I was nervous about making new friends, but he didn't talk at all even when we tried to talk with him. This guy seems super awesome from his Instagram, he speaks 6 languages and we have shared music taste, I love a band that he is into, but I don't know how to integrate him in the group. I tried to start a conversation about that but it died soon after. A and B also tried several times. I also tried to get him to come with us on our way home but he lived in the opposite direction. 
How can I help him open up or make him more comfortable? Is it just a time thing?

818,"I hate to write this post because it totally sounds that I'm bragging (which I'm not), or at least this will look like one of those ""first world problems"" memes :-P

The thing is: it seems that I hit the salary cap in my profession and I don't see how I can progress from now on.

A little background: I work with IT in Europe (Sweden) and I have 20 years of experience in my field. I have always worked in positions that required hands-on coding skills (developer, tech lead, software architect, etc) and my currently salary nowadays is around 8000 EUR/month.

With the pandemic things changed a lot in my company and I had to be placed in a really boring project, so I decided to job hunt again, but based on the feedback that I received from many recruiters, it seems that I'm ""extremely experienced"" (their words) and it would be almost impossible (again, their words) to find a company that could afford pay a salary of 8000 EUR to someone that works as a coder.

According to 2 recruiters, many people in management positions don't have a salary as high as mine here in Sweden, let alone developers.

Now I'm a little lost and out of options because it seems that in order to work on something different, I will have to:

1. Either accept a lower salary in a different company.
2. or Accept a job position with a different role that could possibly pay the same salary that I have or more (as a CTO, for example).

But, to be honest, I don't want any of those options. I don't want to be paid less in a different job and I also don't want to be ""forced"" to work in a different role... I like to believe that the reason my salary is so high right now is because I specialized in coding roles and I became very good at this. Plus, I really like what I do... Working in a different role, like a CTO or other similar management position would be the worst to me.

Anyway, sorry again if this sounds like a ""first world problem"", but I would like to hear your advices about this. Can you see any other options for me?",21Sep2020,1

I just don't want people to think I just want attention or pity, I just want this shit to stop. I want to feel like myself again. But right now, I don't even know what myself even is. Am I really just a short tempered dick, or is this lockdown making me feel like this?",21Sep2020,1
820,"I don‚Äôt really know where to start. Throw away for obvious reasons. I feel disgusted just typing this out. First, I want to clarify that my dad has never assaulted me, and that we have a moderately okay relationship. He wasn‚Äôt an A+ dad growing up - he drank a lot and acted like more of a bachelor than a dad sometimes, but he always had what was best for me in mind despite his fuck ups. 

Anyways. When I was about fourteen, fifteen, he came home drunk one night and while having a conversation with me was very blatantly staring at my breasts. I tried to ignore it but I obviously haven‚Äôt gotten over it because it‚Äôs been about six years later and it still makes my stomach churn. It‚Äôs never happened again since that I‚Äôve noticed, but I‚Äôm realizing it‚Äôs not normal for a daughter to feel like she has to cover up when visiting her dad. I should be butt ass naked and still feel comfortable talking to him. 

The other night I visited and he had some friends over, again made sure I covered up. I was wearing a tank top with a button up over top, I buttoned it up upon arrival after noticing his friends making some quick glances at my uh.. collar bone area. 
I gave my dad a hug and his knuckles brushed my butt. Normally I wouldn‚Äôt think anything of that, but I remember listening to a video in which a woman was sharing her experience in catching her husband molesting their daughter, and she said one of the methods child predators (I am not legally a child, but still) use is the ‚Äúaccidentally on purpose‚Äù method in which the predator ‚Äòaccidentally‚Äô grazes the victim so that his touches don‚Äôt seem predatory. He was then later on the phone with my step mom and kept making sexual conversations with her right in front of me, even though he was using a low voice I just got up and walked away bc I heard ‚Äúsomething something cock‚Äù and internally gagged. It rang an alarm bell in my head that I‚Äôve tried to ignore because these are the only two instances that I‚Äôve felt off about him. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I love my dad a lot and would never imagine him hurting me. He‚Äôs always been my hero and a man I‚Äôve looked up to. But I‚Äôve also grown up seeing how he treats the women in his life and how grossly misogynistic he can be, and I just don‚Äôt know what to do here. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd hurt me, and I have the right to be uncomfortable with what happened, but I fear bringing it up might make him think I hate him and that‚Äôs not the case. I just don‚Äôt know what to do and can‚Äôt help but wonder if I‚Äôm just over thinking.",21Sep2020,1
821,"I am 27 years old female and never experienced this before. My friend, 32 (f) just got out of a relationship. She was super obsessed with this guy she lived with, they dated, and he left her. She continued to knock on his door, text him, bug him, convinced herself he loved her too even though he never said it...a bit delusional on her end. I helped her through it all. We became close friends. I enjoy hanging with her, we hike a lot, and do a lot of activities together. But now, she is attached to me lol

She is the sweetest girl in the world. She suffered from childhood trauma, dad died, mom is a heroin-addict, and I know she has no family. She functions very well, she has a normal functioning (job, car, she does do drugs or drink alcohol etc). She's a very healthy girl but she just has a ton of anxiety. 

 She calls me everyday, texts me all the time to see what Im doing or wants to join in on whatever I am doing. Im frequently with my boyfriend and she will purposely hike or find an activity in the area (an hour away) in hopes I will call her or ask her to hang. She doesn't know how to be alone. I know she really looks up to me and tells all her other friends about me, but I'm feeling uncomfortable. 

If I don't talk to her for more than a day, she asks how my day was by at least the night time....or what did you do today? what you doing this week? how about morning? Can I come over? I know she probably has zero social skills. But its extremely overbearing. Like one time I told her i'd be gone with my family for the weekend in Maine, and she drove from CT to Maine with a friend to go hiking...OUT OF NOWHERE...then texted me that she was in the area in hopes I'd want to meet up lol. Just weird. It happens often. Or she'll visit me at work. I have talked to her before. I politely told her she is overbearing when she calls a lot and I need my space. I explained that my other friends dont do this. The only thing that has changed since the talk... is she just asks politely now if it's OK to call me, before she does lol but still calls me a lot. 

and of course I have issues with boundaries and telling people no. I don't want to hurt her feelings but she is up my ass, Im about to lose it lol I feel very mean, and I'm working on being a nicer person but I am struggling with this. My boyfriend and I are having a huge trip coming this Fall with all our friends, and I dont want to invite her (its his bday not mine, and he is not feeling her anxious vibe being around for a calm weekend)...although I know she will be pretty upset if I don't invite her.

I'm also moving and she wants to come with me. I originally said yes but this has gotten worse since then...now I am reconsidering. Gosh. I would break her heart. She is sweet. I even suggested therapy for her but it's not my place.",21Sep2020,1
822,"Hello all, and good afternoon. 

I'm M26 living with a M26 roommate. I'm extroverted and love people, and love spending time with people. He and I come from very different backgrounds. He lived with his mom, who is divorced, for 3 years after college, and when he got sick of her, he moved in with me. He hasn't had a lot of experience living with other people, which doesn't make things easy. 

We've been living in the same apartment for over a year (we're in year 2 of a lease).  When I've invited guests over (he doesn't really invite others over), he has struggled from time to time with social interactions, just missing social cues about what's appropriate in the presence of others, and he'll often try to embarrass anyone he feels insecure with, in an attempt to look better to others. He tries to constantly put me down when we're with friends, and usually I just laugh it off. I've spoken to him several times about this, and what's appropriate and what isn't, and he doesn't seem to be able to handle any criticism without breaking down and getting incredibly upset at which time he expresses frustration at me, the world, and seemingly never himself or his own choices. 

He struggles in social settings, and he doesn't really put himself out there much, and it's been a weird year for social interaction, so the odds are sadly stacked against him when it comes to making friends. From what I've seen, he doesn't have many friends, nor does he have many people to talk to about things. He told me that he goes to a therapist and he's taking medicine for ADD or ADHD, I can't recall which.

Back in June, I found a letter on my desk one day when I got home from work, which expressed all of the reasons in his opinion why I was out to get him, and how I am a horrible person, and how I'm emotionally manipulating him, etc. When we talked about the letter, I respectfully asked him if he feels any certain way about me in the future, to please just let me know, and then we can try to resolve any hurt. Based on what he told me, there were a lot of expectations that he had regarding our time living together that did not come true, nor were they communicated. I encouraged him to communicate in a more effective way than either a letter or an outburst. I thought things were headed in a good direction; we had agreed to do a weekly roommate planning meeting, where we could sync up on schedules and discuss any dirty laundry that needed to be aired. 

However, I was wrong. Since then, the whole situation has deteriorated badly. He informed me a month ago, that he is moving out. He said it would be better for his mental health for him to be on his own, and that he's been trying to communicate with me, but I don't want to communicate with him, among other complaints. He was upset that in his words I'm ""never home"" and that I'm ""always on the go"". We had a conversation about what went wrong, and I encouraged him to set expectations up front going forward, to help limit negative interactions. We spoke about how a lot of these issues he has with me aren't specific to me, but to expectations that we have for others, and generally speaking, living with other people. 

I want the best for him, and so I've always included him in events, trips, parties, etc. Sometimes it's been awkward, and I know that I'm not under any obligation to invite him, but it's usually for the better, and he enjoys meeting people and he's even made some friends through these outings.  

Today, I texted him while I was at work, to invite him to an overnight campout with some mutual friends of ours. He responded with ""*no*"" and I asked him ""*are you sure*?"" and then told him which friends were showing up, in an effort to be kind. He responded with ""*I'm a No. Give me my space and stop attempting to manipulate me into spending time with you. I need my space to my self.* "" 

I told him we would talk when I get home from work, but I honestly don't really want to. Is it worth the effort? He moves out at the end of October, and he just doesn't seem like he's able to be reasoned with. If I hadn't invited him, he would have given me crap about being left out. At what point do I draw the line of trying to help or being kind? This is so frustrating for me, because I care about him, and I've invested into his life. 

We both moved to this area at the same time, and all of the friends he has in the area came through my social spheres, so I'm worried for him that he being on his own is going to be worse for his mental health, and that he's cutting himself off from all of his friends. 

How do I treat him with kindness, knowing that the ship is already going down? How should I approach communication with him at this point? Also, I've been going insane here trying to figure out what's wrong with me and what I can change about myself, because he keeps telling me I'm the problem. I will gladly take any advice.

828,"For a long time, my brother has struggled with undiagnosed and untreated depression, anxiety, and what we're starting to think may be borderline personality disorder (my mother has it as well). He's also suffered from allergies and asthma for much of his life. These afflictions are starting to combine in an extremely unhealthy way. It's also important to point out that his closest friend passed away in a very disturbing freak accident, although there are suspicions that it wasn't exactly an accident. Ever since then, he's gradually isolated himself more and more from the rest of our family, started smoking dabs (weed in oil/wax form- comprised of a very high concentrate of THC), and he also began to notice a lot of ""allergies"" to foods that he did not previously have. 

Naturally, we (my family and I) were all very concerned about the emergence of these new allergies. They seemed to be really taking a toll on his body, and he couldn't pin point exactly what foods were causing him to have such negative physical reactions. However, when his diet became more and more limited (down to just a number of things), we began questioning whether a doctor had actually recommended he do these things. He has seen doctors for these allergies, but they can't seem to identify what it was that was causing the allergic reactions either. One GI specialist suggested his liver was inflammed and he began treatment for that. Since then, he's been self-medicating with Xyzal, a type of allergy medicine. The number of these pills he takes has gradually increased over time, totally to about 20 a day (he takes 4 at a time). His diet has also become severely limited- he's pretty much only eating ground beef and blueberries, last I checked. By the looks of it, he weighs about 115 pounds, maybe less, and he is 5'9. 

Since COVID began, he's pretty much become a total recluse. He rarely leaves his apartment, insisting that if we want to talk to him we can FaceTime. He's terrified that he will die if he gets the disease, since he has such severe asthma. It doesn't help that our mom is an ""anti-masker"". However, we live in a state where the spread of COVID is controlled and we have very low rates of new cases. I'm not saying he shouldn't be careful, and he is in a high risk category for the disease, but I'm not confident that he's left his apartment in weeks. My sister and I are concerned that he's begun to use the pandemic as an excuse to hide how sick and skinny he's become (we haven't seen him since July). Today he told me he ""stares mortality in the face every day"" because of his allergies and GI issues. We're not even sure these issues are physically real at this point, and have become more psychosomatic.

He absolutely refuses to take any of our advice or seek any kind of professional help and gets very defensive whenever we bring it up. At this point, we're considering involuntary hospitalization. He's starving himself, isolating himself from society, smoking weed all day (he left my birthday dinner twice to go rip dabs) and he's growing more depressed and unstable every time we hear from him. Our problem is, we don't even know where we would admit him for in-patient care. We think this is more of a psychological problem, but it has physical affects as well. We've considered psychiatric wards and rehabilitation centers, but we don't know which one would fit the type of care he needs. 

Any ideas or advice would be greatly appreciated. Please be kind.

833,"I'm a junior worker, in a type of operations job. My company seems to really like me, I have gotten good reviews, etc.

One part of my job is approving costs. There are often costs for making trucks wait, etc.

Let's say that I'm responsible for sending trucks to warehouse facility XYZ, to load product. Facility XYZ is on someone else's land. Facility XYZ is known for being a bit of a 'shady' company, for a bunch of reasons. One day, a bunch of trucks had to wait - we get charged for jamming up the facility. I was expecting some costs for this, but nothing came through.

Months later, the facility XYZ sent me an invoice, saying that ""Hey, these $1800 in charges are for you, can you please approve"" and I said something along the lines of, ""yes, I agree.""

Shortly after that, a law firm emailed me, saying they had an invoice of $60,000 in connection with this. There was no back up at all, and the charges seemed exorbitant. I basically emailed back right away, saying ""We do not accept this, all will have to go through my manager whose email is this, etc..."" I never heard anything for months.

Today, like 5 months after that, a private number called me from that law firm, asking if they could speak to someone in connection with the invoice. I told them I would write down their number.

Obviously, this all seems very shady. I know there's a possibility of some of these charges being real, but I think they are either 1) Trying to stick us with very old invoices, or 2) Trying to charge us for stuff that doesn't belong to us at all.

To me, it seems like this shady law firm is trying to trick me, as a junior employee. I don't believe they can't find our payables inbox, or my manager's email, etc.

How do I handle this?

1. Disregard it as being shady, and just ignore the call
2. Just tell the simple facts to my boss, saying ""Hey, some law firm wanted to invoice us for something. I am not sure what that's all about - I just approved $1800 of charges once, that were legit.

this all happened last night.

i got extremely high. i mean, way more than I can handle. I don't remember much. this story is gonna be all over the place because i cant control my thoughts right now.

heres a bit of a backstory: My sister and her husband have a dumpster fire of a marriage. They have this 2 year old. He's cheated on her 3 times, and tried to set up a threesome with my sister and the women he cheated with. my sister thinks shes bi, but she doesnt want a threesome. hes pressuring her basically to have a threesome. she doesnt want to do it. my sister has been planning to divorce him. last time she brought it up he said ""you'll never see your kid again."". by the way, hes a bum. he has spent the last 3 days (theyre staying over for a week bc my mom has cancer) watching tv and playing video games. hes maybe spent 2 hours with his kid in total. im being generous. i've been the one whos been taking care of her with my sister every single day. turns out, thats what its like at their home too. point is, they have a dumpster fire of a marriage. theyve been trying to save it with sex.

hes in his 30's. im a teenager.

last night, her husband and i smoked weed. he asked to smoke. my sister and my brother stayed sober bc my sister has work and my brother doesn't smoke all that much.

next thing i know im passing out at the kitchen floor. my sister is calling an ambulance and then she cancelled the ambulance. and then i was up and ready to go to my room. this all took around half an hour. i remember my sister yelled at her husband saying ""you cant sleep with her."" and he said ""why would i sleep with your sister?!"" and she said ""because youre not a good person!!"" and by the way, hes been talking to me about sex non stop. two days ago, we were texting and he started the conversation with ""don't smoke without me plz."". i was taking care on the kid in the same room. my sister was sleeping. the kid wouldn't sleep so i offered to chill with her so she wouldnt cry. anyway her husband and i were texting in the same room and he turned the conversation into talking about the attempted threesomes with my sister. he was talking to me about their sex life. then yesterday we were playing this virtual reality thing and i asked him whats the craziest thing youve watched on here and he ws telling me about how pornhub has a whole section about this shit.

anyway back to the story, she was telling him he isnt a good person. i kept telling them ""theres no need to fight here. this is a bad place to fight. go fight in a controlled environment."" and after that didnt work i simply started saying ""SHUT THE FUCK UP SHUT THE FUCK UP SHUT THE FUCK UP"" and we had about 2 episodes of Community and there was super bad tension. anyway, my brother wouldnt let me sleep. all i wanted to do was sleep this off. i went to my room. they all followed me and stayed with me till 3 in the morning. from what i remember, my sister and her husband kept leaving the room to fight. she was crying a lot.

its the next day. its really awkward.

841,"Hi,

I am torn about work at the moment.

I cannot decide what job to take. I work in before and after school care with children. This isn't my career goal, I am still in university. It is the same position at two different places. Here is my dilemma:

Place A - Pays $2-3 more per hour, don't enjoy being there as much as I don't feel close with my colleagues (have only started working here during the summer, it's really only been 1.5 months)

Place B - Pays less, love my coworkers, sense of comfort, more physical space (aka more space to spread out because COVID), I feel inspired to be better there

Granted, it is the same position at both places. I'm just torn on what to do. When I do the math, the higher paying job rewards me with \~$130 more per week, which equates to about $600 more per month. I'm a college student so yes money is important and I should start saving, but I've been at Place B for so long that I think a part of me is scared to leave?

Not an option to ask for a raise at Place B. The $600/month between the two jobs is quite a difference though.

I mention a sense of comfort at Place B - like I genuinely love all of my coworkers there and can trust them, whereas I do not trust the team at Place A at all. I feel like I'll be a bit more stressed at Place A, but I guess the extra stress can be compensated with the higher pay? I'm not sure. Maybe I just need to give Place A more time? Only been working there the past two months, in comparison to Place B where I've worked for 3 years.

Now with COVID and me panicking about the future in general in post-grad life, who knows? Should I go for the money? My parents are immigrants and I'm worried for them too, financially.

Basically, my head says to go work at Place A, whereas my heart says Place B. Any tips on what to do? Do I do it for the money or overall good time? Hard to decide.",21Sep2020,1

844,"I am terrified to think I am falling in love, and I need help

I (20f) have been writing of this guy(20m), Alex (not real name) for a few months now. Documenting the things we do and asking for advice on how to proceed. To everyone who has given me advice, helped me, listened to me ramble - I thank you with the entirety of my heart and soul. After much debate with myself, I have been in a frenzy of emotions when it comes to this boy.

We have spent a lot of time together. Three days in a row last week, and one of those days was sneaking him into my room! Oh it was fantastic, we got so close and I could have kissed him. We almost got caught too, if we had left my room 30 seconds later than we did, my father would have seen us. When we got to the bottom of the stairs, we heard my father wake up and start making his way to the bathroom, so I yanked Alex under the stairs and we froze in silence, waiting for the dreaded sound of my father making his way down the stairs. The sound never came, and we remained in place for a few minutes. After we heard him go back to his room, we had to wait for him to fall back asleep (which took not even a full minute) and as we waited I clung to him, hugged him so tightly. He hugged back just as tight, holding onto me and even rubbing my arm in comfort. We snuck out, got him back to his car, where we hugged again. So so tight, and each time we broke apart, we held each other by the arms and remained close as we spoke our goodbyes. Now we are even speaking of sneaking me into his room sometime soon.

That fear I felt was minimal to the closeness and protection I felt in his arms, where it just felt right. It felt like I was supposed to be there, being held by him, holding him. Before he had left, we held hands while sitting on my bed, and just talked. We spoke a lot of sexual things, which added to my sexual tension to begin with but now it is amplified tenfold. We hung out the next night, under the stars in 30 degree (Fahrenheit) weather, under a blanket. He had gotten cold so I draped my legs over him (I was also cold but it was a good excuse to put myself on him without it being weird) and we froze together. But we just enjoyed the time, holding hands and leaning on each other.

He had told me that night that because of me, he has become more touchy and affectionate, but only when it comes to me. He told me he enjoys my time, and that the biggest compliment he had ever received was me calling him a 9/10 (reference the previous posts I have made about this if you want more understanding). I had brought up a website of questions to ask people you want to get to know better, and we passed my phone back and forth (something I never do with anyone) and asked each other question after question.

We then, the next day, went to an art show and then walked around his old high school, then proceeded to just drive around until he had to drop me off and go to work. He even told me I looked great in the outfit I wore to the show, which felt good. I even brought him dinner, which he insisted on paying for. I wanted to pay, since he had paid for a drink we got while we were out (not alcoholic, just a bottle of tea). He wanted to get a drink and could not decide so I picked it for him. We walk around a bit and then he asks if I want anything and I said sure. I told him he could pick my drink so he did, and he paid for the two of them. I had brought him a snack too, and I think I have figured out his love language when it comes to what he likes from people. I think he likes little gifts, tiny things to bring him when we are together. So anyway, he gave me a $20, and said ""I am not gonna let you pay for my dinner, there's just no way"" and I gave in.

So now here we are, at the crux of my problem. I had asked my dad about it all, finally. I never really tell him of my relationship problems but I did for some reason. He told me ""well, if he spends so much time with you  one on one, odds are he likes you."" I told him about the hugging and even hand holding and he said ""most men are not affectionate like that, so there is a good chance, if he is anything like a typical male"" which he is.

Alex, being willing to hold my hand and even admitting that it is just easier for him to do now. Alex, hugging me for over 30 seconds at a time when we say goodbye. Alex, spending hours and hours alone with me. Alex, who now for the past few hang outs has not even smoked weed with me like we usually do, all to have the same amount of fun. Alex, who now helps me when I have something I cannot do, and demonstrates concern when I am upset. Alex, someone I am afraid to admit that I love.

I am afraid to love. That is my fear. I keep saying I don't love him but I know that I do. Is three to four months long enough to know you love someone? Has it been enough time? I don't want to admit it and I won't until I am sure. My feelings for him grow every day. When he compliments my art, tells me I am doing fine in life, tells me everything will be okay. When he holds my hand, when he moves the blanket over me to make sure I am not freezing. When he wears my hoodie and I sleep in it to feel close to him. When he opens up about his life and his dreams, his feelings and his desires. When he laughs and his teeth show, and he puts his tongue in between them before bending forward and taking a deep breath. His hands, how they feel in mine. I am terrified to admit that I am slowly steadily falling in love and I am afraid he does not feel the same. My fear is keeping me from saying anything and if I were to say anything, my father says I should just make it matter-of-fact and to the point. That I like him, and to ask if he feels the same.

What do I do. Please help, please tell me if it sounds like I am in over my head, if it sounds like he does not like me back. Please someone, anyone. I am slowly feeling things and feeling like a real human being for once, who loves and who cares about someone so passionately. And I am terrified.",21Sep2020,1

849,"I (26F) started a new job in HR (talent and culture) in May. I have less than a year of experience in that field prior to that, I am a recent graduate. At first, I was getting a lot of coaching from the director who was answering my questions and giving me a good feel of how things work in the company, what I can and can't do and just general coaching in HR-related aspects. It was great!

We are a small team of 3 people. About a month ago, my manager became the third person, who has been there for 7 years. He however has no experience in culture and has very little recruitment experience (which are the 2 aspects I'm supposed to handle). I feel left alone most of the time, or when he tries to help me, I feel like it is so contradictory to what the director was originally telling me. I feel lost half the time. This person has also been there for so long that they don't put in as much effort as I normally do, which makes me look bad because they will tell me that what I did is fine and to leave it ""as-is"" (even when I'm questioning it and telling them I feel like we should add to the task), and then I will get an email from someone else in the company telling me to do it better.

It's a small-ish family company in which I already feel it's difficult to make my place, which I know is normal. I just feel like half the time I need to take charge and get things done, and the other half of the time I need to ask permission to so many people who don't know what they're talking about before even doing one thing. I am usually pretty independent, I'm a very fast learner and I follow my gut, but working here is having me second guess myself and feel incompetent.

I wish I could get more coaching, not necessarily have someone tell me what to do, but just to guide me when I need help. I don't feel like I can say anything because everyone has been working together for such a long time that I will sound like I'm complaining. What can I do?",21Sep2020,1

I go upstairs to my room after 9pm and I‚Äôm itching to keep going, I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it- thinking about all the stuff I could do.

852,"Hi r/Advice

30 y/o female here. Earlier today a person from my high school sent me an instagram account of someone pretending to be me. The account had my first name and a profile picture from about 7 years ago. The account was created in June and had an inappropriate handle (referring to pedophilia)

When I opened the page I was sickened. There were photos from my grade school, high school, and up until I was 25. The grade school photos appeared to be photos taken from a year book. But another one was of a disposable camera photo that even I don't ever remember seeing with 2 friends who I am still friendly with. These photos had explicit captions and sexualizing my childhood body.

The later ones had personal information such as who I was friends with and under the guise as if I was writing them. For example, ""Just got dun fxcking these two, I did all the time in high school."" Other ones had photos of me and my friend's kids that insinuated I was a pedophile.

I'm a mental health professional and have a very private online presence. While I recognize it is unlikely that my patients have come across this, I find myself very paranoid. The account had over 100 followers and appeared to be normal people rather than bots. This has been up since June, and out of shock I immediately reported it.

I was able to grab screen shots of the photos, but I regret immediately reporting the account because I would've like to see if I could pinpoint any clues to who it might be. I grew up in a very small, rural town so the options are limited. Any advice? Is there any thing I can do to contact instagram and see if they could show me the page again and also to get the IP address?

Thanks.",21Sep2020,1
853,"I recently adopted a cat and I regret it. I love cats to no end but I feel so overwhelmed and scared taking care of it. I suddenly feel this huge sense of commitment and I wasn't expecting to feel this way. I was expecting to feel super happy and content as I've been wanting to adopt a cat for a while now. 

I just have been feeling really depressed and I feel bad for the cat because I just feel it could have an owner that loves it more and has more time for it. I feel so bad that Im an idiot and didn't think about this more. It kind of just hit me all at once that I'm y responsible for this animal and it's a for life kind of thing. I will feel really bad if I decide to go out and leave my cat alone and I just don't want to feel guilty for leaving her alone for any period of time that I just want to go out. I also work full time so she's already home alone now and I feel so sad for her. She's also shredding my carpet and couch, which I'm very unhappy about.

The thing is, people already warned me that I probably should get a cat because I live in a small apartment and they're a handful sometimes, depending on the cat. I don't want to tell people I just gave her back because I don't want them to judge me and I already feel bad. What is a very good excuse to give a cat back other than I just don't want it? I need an excuse that people won't think I'm a terrible person or that I just don't care for the cat. I just want the cat to have a better home.

854,"  Writing this, I noticed this will be a rather long post, but I do want to provide enough information to understand my situation. This is only about looking forward and is in no way intended to be a cry-out, incase it might look like it.

**Depression:** My depression started late 2010 and I literally crashed 2011. I did drop out of school and have no education. It took me until 2016 to be ready for therapy and I have since been really motivated to do everything possible to improve and do the best out of my situation. Since 1st of April I ended my contact with my therapist, as I'm no longer considered sick. 

  **Work-training and job:** Currently I do still live at home and I do ""work-training"" in the cleaning field and receiving a very small activity-compensation.

   This looks very promising and I do believe when this end the next month, there is a possibly they will offer me employment as a fill-in they can call when needed. 

  Due to recent changes in my work, I have started to believe that there would be too much stress for me mentally as a fill-in as I would have to clean in various different places were I'm needed, compared to be positioned in one place only. I otherwise enjoy the job.

   I also guess I'll have to chase hours as a fill-in and I've heard that people usually go as fill-ins for atleast 2-3 years until they get asked to be hired fulltime, if there ever is a opening.

  But I'm also afraid that I'm about to lose a really good opportunity to get my first employment.

 **Study:** Right now I guess I do want to study. I've tried before but couldn't do it due to my mental health. I also lacked motivation as I thought to myself ""*I can't even work even if I did study and got an education*"", but as of now, I have prove that I'm able to work. 

  I'm not really sure what I do want to study either. So far I know studying on distance might be a bad idea for me, but unsure if the current pandemic allows me. I'm afraid that if I do choose to study I will ""waste"" even more years of not being were I want to be in life. 

  I fear that the older I get and without ever had a real job, it will be even harder to employ me in the future as it might raise some eyebrows. I also have the feeling that some people might think it's weird that I still live at home, I just hope that I've moved out before I get 30.

  I'm just unsure and afraid to choose the wrong path now that I've made it so far, and any advice or different ways of viewing this would be very welcoming.",21Sep2020,1
855,"I realized this a few years ago, but I never really let it sink in completely until now. I had realized that most of the things I ""learned"" in school I wouldn't use in real life. I used this to comfort myself whenever I got angry for not being able to solve a problem. 

When I was in 3rd grade, I used to ask so many ""what-if"" questions. I used to think a lot and was creative. That was until I started to take tests, and I was told by everyone, including my parents, to just listen to school and stick to it. I stopped thinking about more ""creative"" ways of solving things, and I just started to drill answers into my head just so I could pass one test. 

I then became a grade nazi. I believed I was smarter and ahead of my peers who didn't have As, and luckily I humbled myself in middle school, but I still was a grade nazi. If I didn't have an A, I was worthless, I started to cry and breakdown. I felt like grades reflect who you were as a person. I thought college was the only way to go in life. 

In middle school when we started to have more STEM/Creativity based classes, I then realized what was the truth. Those who were ""below"" me in the school hierarchy were doing better than me, They could think of things, they could construct without being given instructions. I wasn't jealous of them per se, but I began to hate and cut myself. I also started becoming more loud mouthed to make myself appear less closed off.

I began to despise myself and think what did they have that I didn't? I then realized that their grades never reflected how smart they were, but how well that the SCHOOL system felt they were doing. I fell into a pit of depression for a few years, and now I'm glad I'm not depressed anymore, but I still feel this sense of emptiness. 

I had so many things I want to accomplish in life, but I felt totally lost, and I still do. I want to be self-employed and travel places, etc, but I don't know how to achieve my dreams. I feel like I lost all my creativity and desires to think outside a certain system after 3rd grade. 

I don't really want to go to college anymore, but I still keep my grades for my mother and the chance that I will go because I feel like I have no other choice. 

My biggest fear is failure, and I don't know how to get over that. I'm scared I'll look back at my life now and realize how worthless school grades ultimately were. I am scared I will never accomplish the things I want to in life, go the place I want to, learn the thing I want to. I'm tired of it. I'm tired of stressing so much, so I came here looking for some advice. 

I was to start feeling more fulfilled in life, and I want to work towards my future, but I don't know how. I have been told I have a whole life in front of me, so why rush? I am not rushing, I just want to start early. I am hoping that you redditors can give me some advice, and I will try to respond.",21Sep2020,1

858,"Hello, I need your help as I'm not sure what to do. I've a relative who has been a drug dealer for quite some time. This doesn't bother me. I'm not a user of drugs, but I'm also not really against them, so if you have to sell drugs to support your family then whatever. Not my choice of a career, but its not something thats going to get me in a fit. Recently, however, I've found out that this relative has started a scheme with illegal weapons. I'm not sure of all the details, but from what I understand he is building guns from parts he purchases online, then selling them off to gun shoppes. Since these guns are built from parts they have no serial numbers or methods of tracing. I'm not too up on my gun law, but I have to believe this is entirely illegal. 

I'm anti-gun. I have kids, I have a wife, a family, and the thought of a gun ending a life so easily terrifies me. Plus, my area has been a hot bed for gun violence and is increasing exponentially. Knowing that my relative is putting guns on the street with the sole purpose of being used for illegal activity is worrying. I'm not sure what to do at this point. I could turn them in, but they would lose everything (I imagine) and they are a family provider.  I've considered submitting an anonymous tip to the ATF, but I don't know all the details of the operation, and it would still lead to the same problems as just turning them in.  Also, I'm skeptical as to how anonymous it would actually be.

860,"I (18F) was ""blessed"" with two roommates (both 18F) my first year of college. In the beginning, I didnt mind it too much. I got to start out with two friends and we really connected. Most of the time, I really do enjoy hanging out with both of them. There are just some things about one of my roommates that bother me and I dont know how to deal with it.

-First off, she is CONSTANTLY forgetting to take her anxiety medication which she admits makes her a lot more hyper and is a significant contributing factor to what's listed below.

-She does not stop talking. She always wants to talk. Even when I tell her I'm in an online class or I'm taking a quiz or I just need some quiet time, she's constantly talking.

-She never leaves the room, therefore I never get any alone time with it. She hasn't really made many friends outside of me and our other roommate, but that's just because she stays in the room all the time. There are things that I prefer to do alone and struggle to find time to given that she's always there (ie work out videos, masturbating, or just needing a little while alone to recharge my social battery)

-Shes very immature when it comes to some adult topics. An example when I thought I had an STI earlier this fall and was talking about it with another friend and she overheard. She just butted in and started telling me how irresponsible I was and just things I really didnt need to hear when I was scared and away from home for the first time with no idea what to do.

-I just started figuring out ways to get some alone time. Some times I go to the store and drive around for a little while or go for a walk. She doesn't necessarily understand that I am literally doing this to get away from her and constantly asks to come along and I always feel bad saying no. Not to mention that she asks where I'm going every time I so much as put my socks on or go to the bathroom. I can't even brush my teeth without her wanting to tag along.

I just don't know what to do or how to approach her about my irritations. I know I'm kind of a bitch, but we're a lot different from one another and those differences are making it hard.

Any advice on how to handle anything is welcome.

Long story short, is i basically messaged a girl i know from high school on instagram and it just progressed from there.

867,"Me [f18] and my boyfriend [m19] live together with his parents. We‚Äôve been dating to two years and I moved into his house because my mother was pregnant and worried about COVID while I had a job and schooling. And now after she‚Äôs had my sister, my sister has heart failure and COVID would be very detrimental to her. So I have gone back. 

I moved in May of this year. Things were nice the first couple of months, I help around the house plenty. I‚Äôve formed a close relationship with my boyfriends mother, accepted by extended family, etc. but things have gotten rocky. My boyfriends mom, I‚Äôll just call her my MIL, has a drinking problem. And she loves to rope me into her convos. It‚Äôs very hard to deny her when she wants something from you, and I am by far the most anxious in the house and she sees that and must prey upon it I think. So she gets me inevitably drunk with her and stays up all night. This does not sit well with the man of the house. He‚Äôs addressed me and thinks I should be the one monitoring her alcohol intake. This confused me as I‚Äôm 18, she‚Äôs 40, and she gets shitface drunk before she even pulls me out of my room in the night. 

Well things came to a head, it was me, my boyfriend, his mom, and my little brother [15] out in the porch talking and having a good time. MIL, me and boyfriend are all drinking but nothing too excessive. My little brother has been very depressed since COVID especially with the condition of my little sister. He‚Äôs also at the age where he wants to go out and be adventurous, but COVID has restricted that. My brother feels comfortable around MIL and I should note MIL is a very touchy-huggy person. She will hug me for 10 minutes straight and kiss me all over my face and neck but it has never been anything weird, she does it to all of the kids. Anyways, my brother was upset and had his head down on the patio table, and MIL was giving him a sort of side hug and rubbing his back. MIL‚Äôs boyfriend comes out and is red in the face and asks my brother what his intentions with his girlfriend are. We‚Äôre all shocked and ask if he‚Äôs joking, he reassures us, he‚Äôs not. MIL keeps saying ‚Äúdon‚Äôt make this weird, they‚Äôre kids‚Äù but things escalate between them and they begin fighting. My brother asks everyone to stop fighting, MIL boyfriend tells him to grow up and be an adult. I flew off the handle at this point, IMO my brother was being more of an adult. And how are you going to request a 15 year old be okay with this argument when you just accused him of trying to have sex with your 40 yr old girlfriend? Anyways, things come to a point and MIL boyfriend goes and packs his bags. 

Fast forward 20 mins, everyone has went to bed except me and MIL. She keeps asking me to bring my pipe, (yes I do smoke), and I keep telling her I think she‚Äôs had enough. But after her berating me and saying she‚Äôll just go get it herself if I don‚Äôt I decided fine. I loaded a one hitter and let her have it. MILS boyfriend walks out on her hitting the pipe and completely grills me on how I shouldn‚Äôt be letting her smoke. He takes his bags and leave. MIL spews a bunch of stuff about how we can make it and we‚Äôll be happy even if we die homeless on the streets. (Doesn‚Äôt sound very nice to me.) 


I put MIL in bed since she‚Äôs drunk and head out myself. I wake up the next morning to find them cuddling on the couch. I have since felt very awkward and horrible around him. He won‚Äôt even look at me, better yet speak to me. Also, the day after this event my boyfriend came out and said that he wishes we could‚Äôve had a normal relationship in the beginning where we would be more separate from each other.

870,"So basically I moved home because COVID is bad where my school is. My parents pay my rent (which I am grateful for) but I feel so bad that they are paying so much money for an empty room. I signed my lease because my school said we‚Äôd be having classes but then went online at the last minute. 

I‚Äôm currently living at home. I don‚Äôt see a point in living at school because I can save a lot of money here, don‚Äôt have to buy groceries, etc... however my roommate does not want to live with a guy because she doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable. The only people who have responded to take my lease so far are guys. No girls have responded at all. 

There is already 1 guy living in our apartment (2 girls and 1 guy) but she says she doesn‚Äôt want to live with another. It‚Äôs annoying because now I have to pay rent every month just because she‚Äôs picky about who she wants to live with. I understand that it‚Äôs scary to live with a guy, but the people who have responded to me seem nice. Plus, I suggested that the guys stay on one side of the apartment and the girls on the other (it‚Äôs a 4 bed 2 bath) but she doesn‚Äôt want to. Now I‚Äôm probably going to have to move up to school just to live there. I guess this is more of a vent but is she being unreasonable?

871,"I am 20 years old and have been friends with the same two people for 8 years. We met on a video game at the time, and we realized that we were all Parisians so the relationship turned to reality halfway. I am a very lonely person, and these are the only people I consider friends. The only ones I've had in my whole life, actually.

Here are the concerns that lead me to consider ending our friendship:

\-Friend 1 (22F) is passive-aggressive and very touchy, sensitive. She had been twisting everything I said for 3 years into a stupid argument. She's always right, never apologizes, and when she's wrong and I make it clear to her, she goes into the realm of emotions saying that I hurt her. After that, she sulks for three days to a week without answering me until I apologize. I used to take it upon myself and apologize for whatever reason, thinking that our friendship didn't deserve to take such hits for so little. I am far from engaging in ego games, I am not touchy or resentful. After all these years, I realized that she was unintentionally passing his frustration on me by creating quarrels, which I accepted.

After years of coming to terms with this behaviour, the event that makes me question everything happened this week: We were discussing an irrelevant topic when she misinterpreted what I told her, got angry and ignored for three days. During those three days, my grandmother passed away and I sent her messages to tell her that I needed her support and advice to take care of my father, who was very close to my grandmother. Coming back she told me that I had hurt her by calling her ""difficult"" (for getting upset), and she has been missing for two days again, putting her ego before our friendship since I told that I was having a hard time and needed her support.

I'm getting tired of walking on eggshells lest she understands my intentions and feels attacked, diminished. She thinks that I'm intentionally trying to hurt her. During those years, I tried to talk about it several times, it always went wrong: she always dodged my feeling by saying that she felt attacked, ending all conversation.

\- Friend 2 (19M) no longer makes any effort to talk, he answers me in two / three words, never starts any discussion... It's always up to me to come to him, and I'm always disappointed with his answers. I asked him and he's not busy. I guess he doesn't value me anymore. 

I would point out that these are obviously the ""worst"" of these two people. If we have been friends for 8 years it is inevitably that I appreciate them. But there begin to be more bad times than good times, and I have absolutely no one else. My family doesn't give a damn about me, I don't have internal or external support.

872,"So, I have this friend and we are both F19. I have known her for a little over year but we have grown pretty close because we study the same thing and have the majority of our classes together. As we got to know each other, we obviously began telling each other about our life and she told me about this guy. Lets call him Evan. 

She liked Evan and they were friends. Both of the graduated from the same high school, he is older than us by like 2 years. She would often try and like get together with him (she is very insisting when it comes to guy, she sometimes acts like she is 14 and we have talked to her about this cuz its not good for her). She is the kind of person that if she has a crush on someone, no matter how small, we can‚Äôt do anything with that person because otherwise she will get pissed.

Anyway, I knew what happened, or didn‚Äôt happened between them. Pretty much they were friends and they talked and hung out at the gym sometimes and she told him she liked him but he didn‚Äôt feel the same so he turned her down. She was kinda pissed about it cuz he told her that he wanted to focus on his friends and family and all that. I obviously knew about this and I told her to just let it go, not everyone is gonna like her. 

A few days before my birthday I was at the beach so I uploaded an ig story and he answered it so we started chatting as friends. I told my friend that Evan hit me up and she was pissed and told me to tell him to screw himself and how dare he hit me up knowing that we are friends. I told her that i was gonna do that if i saw he had other intentions but I wasn‚Äôt going to be a bitch to him and we could be friends.

We then starting talking through messages after he asked for my number. He kinda asked me out to go to his house (if i end up going, nothing like that is going to happen) and watch a movie and get some food. I told him that I didn‚Äôt exactly feel comfortable with that cuz i know its gonna upset my friend. My friendship with her is waaay more important to me than Evan. 

I told him that and that I didn‚Äôt know what to do. He told me that nothing happened between them but my friend let us believe that something did, never outright told us what exactly happened. I don‚Äôt want to hurt her feelings and go behind her back cuz that happened to me and it really sucked. 

He said we had two options, to tell her or get together and talk it out and keep it on the download but it doesn‚Äôt affect him. I really dont know what to do, Evan and i barely know each other but he seems like a nice guy and i would like to get to know him more but on the other hand, i dont wanna be THAT friend that does that to someone and i really care about her.

878,"Hi there! I've come here to seek help and advice, despite doing my research on this matter.

Back Story: I live in an apartment complex with very poor management and maintenance. Ive had issues in recieving help during emergencies, my mailbox being broken (still broken after 2+ years and literally swings open from the wind), and other frustrating issues that have been ignored.

*Now I've been faced with an extremely awkward situation, in which my (new) neighbor has decided to set up a camera at his door frame and it faces my door (and only my door). There are only 3 units in the corner we are in, so its very awkward being the only one with a camera facing me from close distance, every time I leave and come into my apartment. 
I have been (too) passive in the past with my neighbors noise levels at ungodly hours, and yet ive chosen to always mind my business and not start any issues.  

I decided to speak to my neighbor and told the couple that I'm uncomfortable with being surveillanced by them, simply bc they never asked me. I asked if they could move the camera to be at the front of their door (along where the seeing peek hole is). They laughed at me and made excuses as to why the camera facing me is the only way it would work for them. They mentioned its for packages, but most mail stays one the first floor for us to pick up, so that reason isn't too valid. 

Its been over 2 weeks since I've spoken to them and its clear that they don't take me seriously or respect my privacy. It's a clear violation on my privacy, and now I cant deal with the anxiety I'm experiencing at night and random hours of the day. Ive even had nightmares about them trying to retaliate against me. 
I don't have the highest hopes asking the building manager to back me up, but I learned that this is indeed illegal, and I have the legal right to file a lawsuit against them... but again, it's in my nature to simply mind my own business so the idea of resorting to that is daunting. 

I think I'm seeking empowerment more than anything, but I'm so uncomfortable. I don't know if i should speak with them again before reaching out my landlord, and then worse case scenario, threaten them with lawsuit?? Ugh.

I've been desperately trying to find a new place to live but with covid and unemployment, those plans have been placed on hold until I save more money.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

Love,
An angry and tired young lady",21Sep2020,1

She's tried to kill him, abuses him, does not allow us to see him, go to their house, etc. It's straight up abuse. Don't tell me to call APS; my brother and I already did. They do nadda. I barely get to speak on the phone to him, yet they go to her family's house.

SO NOW, my niece is getting married in April. I'm brutally disabled, so I won't be able to go, but she said, ""Oh, we are not going to go!"" He and his grand-daughter are VERY close!!! She would be heartbroken. I asked why and she said she did not want to explain!!! She said he has no clothes and just pajamas. She treats him like a baby and abuses him. Classic gold-digger. 

Every day I hope she dies in her sleep. She's a monster! When he dies, I'll probably be allowed to see him then. He was about to divorce her and then had a stroke. I told him to get away from her. Too late now.

What do I do? I'm so afraid of how she treats him. And, he was a millionaire, so she's getting it all. His family gets shit. I'm almost homeless, so that money would have helped me. Plus, I used to work for my dad for 15+ years. My mom just died and he's all I have.

883,"At this rate I'm imagining you will all tell I'm ""trying too hard"" and I ""need to be myself"" - I have had occasions where I was completely myself and afterwards people admit I was loud, embarrassing, I have to ""reign myself in"", I ""made a tit of myself"" and I just don't know who I am anymore to be honest.

To keep it simple, I'm part of 2 groups, my family and my work group. My work group are my friends as well and in both chats I just feel invisible.

When I'm away from them the conversations are thriving and everyone seems happy, people open up more. There's 2 other girls and it turns out they are closest of friends and wait till I'm gone to have their actual conversations.

When I'm sat with the guys, they will talk about women in a way they probably shouldn't do in front of a woman and that's it... I'm not part of the conversation. I'm just there.

I try to be engaging, I try to listen to people's lives and interests. I'm rarely rude or cruel.

I'm tempted to leave the work group chat. It is getting too hard to just ""mute"" them and every single attempt I have at conversation kills the conversation until a polite enough time has gone by to change the subject. It is giving really bad anxiety attacks.

I write letters to myself to reassure myself it's okay if they dislike me, how I have to be myself.

I'm terrified leaving will just create drama, I have no idea how to just be better,im just finding out how much closer everyone is to each other and yeah... Its not fun",21Sep2020,1

I reached $5k this week, in my savings account.

I also recently lost my only best friend. It's nothing really bad, I guess we just drifted apart. She never was into getting jobs / doing adult things.

I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm happy for her that she's getting men. 

 I think she kind of came to my store today for some beverages, but I just busied myself with work/ et cetera. 

We were, for the first time, overstaffed and I realized how socially awkward I am. All of my coworkers hang out with each other / are best friends. I don't really fit in with them. I was born in America, yet I feel like I just moved to America from overseas, while learning the English language when I'm at work. 

I mispronounce words wrong, I live under a rock so I don't really understand many of the slang they say, I work and then go to school (online.) And spend my time playing social games and watching YouTube and listening to music, doing art. So I stay at home after work all day, every single day.

There are some times where I attempted to fit in, but of course, I failed. That's why I'm here because I'm legit a hopeless case. I feel like a literal incel, except I'm an incel in the ""friends department"" lol.

We had lived together for several years but I have never lived alone before. I have been trying to keep busy by seeing friends and occupying my time, but I'm already finding the isolation difficult. I work from home, so there can be days where I now will see no one at all. 

What are your tips for staving off the loneliness? I am disabled and now do not have access to a car, so exercising/getting out to see people can be difficult. 

Would be grateful for any tips or advice. TIA.",21Sep2020,1
903,"Me and a girl that I have been talking to for a couple years have had an on and off relationship for a while, and multiple times ive decided to take some space to see how i feel without being in contact. Every time I try this I get stared at constantly if I am in the same room as her. if I am within 15 metres of them at any point, she will make the effort to look at me for the longest time she can, and doesnt make it subtle either. On top of this, my friend who hasnt spoken to her for over a year constantly overhears her and friends making fun of and insulting his appearance, clothing and other pointless remarks. This is because he used to date the girl i am reffering to's best friend. I have been drunk texted many times with unintelligible scrawls, as well as me not replied back to her at all in over a week. The last time she texted was Friday, as i called her to express my frustration over the fact that I feel trapped trying to take care of her dwindling mental health, and being a big part of her life because of her attraction to me, and also trying to avoid conflict from my friend complaining about insults, and the feeling of never really being able to take a break and reevaluate what life is like without her.

906,"So we have plots that we inherited, not that big just 1/4 each sibling. 

Currently some plots were up for sale and I wasnt in the country, so one of the siblings was in charge and managed to sell the plots but at a cheap rate. I have no problem with it as parents(owners) had agreed to it.

Right now, the sibling is developing his plot, building 4 2bedroom bungalows. He says he sources the materials for cheap and all. Thing is, he watches youtube videos, calls the builder (just one guy who hires other guys) and builds. He hasnt called an architect or an engineer to check the buildings, he hasnt planned for ventilation and speocifc materials to use, he basically does not have a plan for the development and just has a ""vision"". I helped him out with a site plan and a render for the units , but it clearly shows he is going with the flow and he tells me that he is. 

With he financials, he has no financial statements and tells me he has everything in his head. I have a feeling there are things he has not considered while developing the land and selling it, so I would love if I could get advice on things I should consider about developing land and selling it especially in the book keeping department. 

I love my sibling , ofcourse , but he has a habit of just being all over the place, he will convince you since he smooths talk (if you listen closely you will notice he is redirecting and not using specific estimates or technical jargon), says stuff like it's the cheapest around here, high profit margin etc. 

He has just informed me that he doesnt want to do it on his plot anymore as he doesnt want to sell the plot too so he wants to use one of the parents plot (so he doesnt lose his). I have explained to him he needs to pitch it but with proper estimates and a plan. I said this because my parents are old and cant deal with his over-selling as he will push it on you however he wants and just is all over the place when he tries selling his idea to you. So since I'm here I'm trying to get things in order. 

So please, ask me anything,  and advice me with anything,  I need to learn as much as possible from people who are in real estate development and real estate finances. This would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you!",21Sep2020,1

909,"I‚Äôm a liberal American living in a liberal city. Before Trump, I felt that both Democrats and Republicans wanted what was best for the country and just differed in how to accomplish it, and that people are overall good and decent. However, over the past four years, I‚Äôve become increasingly frustrated and angry with Republicans‚Äô outright rejection of science, facts, and expertise.  


The other night, my wife and I were talking with our Brazilian au pair over dinner about Ruth Bader Ginsburg‚Äôs death and why it matters. The au pair asked about the difference between Democrats and Republicans and whether they hate each other. I found myself getting extremely angry talking about this subject. I believe Republicans hate liberals like me to the extent that they're willing to listen to anything Donald Trump says and accept cheating in this election to ""win"". Even some of my relatives have posted hateful memes talking about shooting Democrats in the street. They would never accept this kind of BS from a Democrat and neither would I. I was almost yelling when I talked about Republicans and their love of guns.  


I think that at this point I do hate Republicans, but don't want to feel that way. I try to tell myself that these people are still fundamentally good, but when they stay silent and continue to vote for the president despite his horrible actions just because he claims to share some of their beliefs, it's hard for me not to think that conservatives have no ethics and are willing to do anything to remain in power.

912,"I've lost a lot of good friendships due to a number of personal problems (jealousy, guilt, paranoia, burnout after not setting limits) and it always ends by me cutting off the relationship prematurely by ghosting/suddenly stop talking.

All but 1 friendship were really good people, willing to help and listen but because of my own fault and low energy, they've fizzled out. How do I keep up with my friends while also making sure I don't burn out in the process? 

.

 .

.

Some context:

- When I was younger to my 1st year of college, I've lost friendships because I got jealous that my friend had other friends. To avoid feeling like I'm going to get left out, I cut off the relationship. 

- As I got older I became someone who's kind of lazy and doesn't time manage very well. I couldn't maintain more than 1 friendship at a time because of how much energy it took to split my attention. Eventually, I would crash and vanish for days or months trying to recharge myself. This was how my current friendship is going to end, even I really don't want it to.

- My time away from friends piles guilt and shame which later leads to me getting preoccupied with thoughts of ""they probably didn't like me anyway"" or ""They're probably mad at me for ghosting even when they don't say it"" or ""Why are you making assumptions about your own friends? How terrible is that?!"" And it just results in me coming to the conclusion that maybe everything would be easier if I just wasn't in the picture anymore, so I let the friendship end.

- I also have a hard time opening up because I'm afraid that it was going to change their view of me or they'll gossip about me/invalidate my experiences or use what I've told them in confidence against me. As a result, I tend to get a little paranoid when dealing with people who aren't acquaintances.",21Sep2020,1

Someone please reply as I need to get some outside opinions of this.

So recently, my best friend had a 21st birthday (one of the biggest you can have, right?). She invited 3 other girls who we are all pretty close with (so 5 total, including herself and I) and who we go out with every now and then. So the details of the birthday were given like 2/3 weeks in advance (so everyone had enough time to clear the day) and honestly, the other 3 girls barely showed any interest from the start, e.g. we were talking about clothes (as usual) and no one would reply. It didn‚Äôt feel like it was a birthday, let alone a 21st. 

Fast forward to the day before the birthday, one of the girls said she can‚Äôt come for cos she was looking after her sibling (so ok, there was 4 of us left). Then on the DAY of her birthday, one of the girls said they weren‚Äôt coming because their stomach had been a bit funny for days (??) to which I asked if medicine works and she said it does but she doesn‚Äôt want to be ‚Äòuncomfy‚Äô. So then I have to ask the last girl if she‚Äôs still coming (cos why wouldn‚Äôt she, you know?) and she proceeds to say basically if she turns up, she turns up and if she doesn‚Äôt, she doesn‚Äôt. She then said she‚Äôs not coming (with absolutely no explanation). This was the same day we‚Äôre supposed to all go out btw. So then there were only 2 of us that went (we still had a great time).

I just couldn‚Äôt believe the bluntness and, what I thought to be, the bullshit excuses. I felt so bad for the birthday girl as it was her 21st and I wanted her to have the best time but it was obviously somewhat ruined by the others. These are girls we‚Äôve known for years now so for them to be so nonchalant was a shock.

Now the one who had the stomach problems I don‚Äôt believe because literally a day or two later, she went out with another friend. No one tried to plan another day where they could celebrate or anything. Not even a sorry. I just feel like they all took the piss. Also, with all 3 girls, we are always the ones who have to plan things first and even when we do, we get half-ass responses.

I‚Äôm now having second thoughts about our friendships with said girls as although it wasn‚Äôt my birthday, it showed a hell of a lot about their characters and I‚Äôm questioning whether I want friends like that.

931," Hi,

 I need some advice to keep up my motivation to finish, I am 31(F) student of geology and I have lost my way too many times, I have given up at least half of the days I have tried to work on this. I used to feel successful with myself until my 25y but then I started a master's degree and haven't been able to finish it, I have had some good advances however. In fact right now I only have to finish the introduction of the paper the conclusions and some images. 

Now I have until the 15 of November to re-enter the program (they kicked me out at the beginning of this year, but I have the chance to come back with my work finished and give my presentation). To me working in this its literally hell, it makes me super unhappy and anxiety kicks in around 20 minutes since I start to make some progress. Some advices I have received from psychology and friends has helped for a while, but always get too unhappy and stop going on, so I think that if I get al lot of advice here I migth manage to keep up the good woork :).

This month my mother told me that she will help me with my bills son I can work on the thesis, but I'm very scared of not acomplish anything and that it's not worth it to accept her offer.

 I am working on delivery so I can work whenever I want and I have some money saved up, but I feel extremely guilty when I stay at home and don¬¥t work on anything because somethimes I get depressed and feel hopeless and lost and bassically scape from it by cleaning my house or other chores like this (intense procastination). 

ps: I love geology I¬¥m just fed up with this particular work, it's hard for me to imagine trying to BE anything else, my teacher its really bad and didn't help much in the making of the manuscript, and been this my first try conducting an investigation for me it has been the hardest.

936,"Alright, first of all I'm not sure if this is the correct subreddit for me to post this on butt I didn't see another that was better suited. 

Before I talk about all this I want to say a few things; 
No, I do not believe in soulmates.
No, I do not believe that dreams can see the future or something along those lines.
No, I do not believe in spirits/ fate and any other supernormal things.

Alright now that I have said this I hope that you will better understand where I am coming from and that I originally did not believe in those things.

Now to the story.
It was about 2 years ago. This was a time before I knew that I was gay. I was on a trip with my school and a friend of mine had dreams of me. His dreams were quite explicit and were about me being in a relationship with another man named James who looked quite a lot like another person that I knew. My friend, though did not have kind of dream only once. It was like a story. For three days he had dreamed about the things that I stated previously. At the time I didn't think much of it obviously, but I was still a little bit disturbed that he was dreaming something like that about me. Though me and my other friends simply brushed it off and just saw it as a funny thing.

Now that you know the 'backstory' I'll tell you what happened around this week. 
I now know that I am gay and have completely forgotten about the stories my friend had said. I'd say around 6 days ago I was minding my own business when I saw a boy that was in some of my classes though since it was the start of the year and I wasn't in the same classes as him last year I didn't know him at all, including name. Though after looking at him for a few seconds I had already developed feelings for him, and through him managed to get over my 1 year old long crush. Bear in mind this is before I knew his name. After developing a crush towards him I found out his name as we were in the classes for some subjects as mentioned previously. After finding out his name nothing happened for a few days until, out of nowhere i suddenly remembered the story that my friend had dreamed of. That's when I realised that the names matched up as well as that he looked similar to the other person.

I am now at the stage where I don't know what to do. I don't know if I should believe that it is pure coincidence or something else. I also do not know whether I should take action on this or not.

Hopefully you guys don't think that I'm a weirdo and crazy. And again sorry if this is the wrong subreddit",21Sep2020,1

I recently started studying a new language, and ive noticed the lack of online help resources for said language. 

For example, there is absolutely no site for verb conjugations which i have found very helpful whilst learning other languages. 

How would i go about organizing my thoughts to start making a website for verb conjugations? 


Its a slavic language spoken in several countries in Europe. There is a lot of irregular verbs, alot of different rules to follow.

940,"Warning, very very long post coming üòÖ
but if you could take the time to read, I would really appreciate it. 

So, best friend (22f **STRAIGHT**) and I (19f lesbian) have known each other well over a decade, we met on an online game when we were little kids.  Our friendship has been almost completely long distance, since we‚Äôre a couple time zones away from each other.  We‚Äôve only met three times in real life, but we‚Äôve always been incredibly close over the years.  

When I was about 15, I was dating a girl (ex girlfriend #1 we‚Äôll call her) and I introduced best friend to her, (talking in a group chat together), and they sorta hit it off and got along pretty well.  I was so happy they liked each other, and even more happy that my best friend ‚Äúapproved‚Äù of who I was dating (being a kid, that sort of thing meant a lot). Fast forward a couple months or so, ex girlfriend #1 and I had a very, very bad breakup.  I‚Äôll spare the details, but let‚Äôs just say something bad happened to me from a male in my life, and she ridiculed me for it saying it was my fault and calling me a whore.  The whole situation was incredibly, incredibly difficult for me to process.  Meanwhile, best friend knew about everything that happened, was very supportive and kind to me and helped quite a bit for me to get through everything that happened.  
Later in the year, I find out that best friend and ex girlfriend #1 have still been talking and keeping up with each other.  It definitely hurt my feelings a bit to find that out, though I don‚Äôt believe I addressed it with her at that time, I brushed it off and just let it go.  
Then, ex girlfriend #1 invited best friend to come spend a weekend with her for ex girlfriend‚Äôs birthday.  Ex girlfriend #1 at the time lived only two houses down the street from me.  Best friend then makes plans to come down, with telling me only a few days before, and stays with ex girlfriend #1 at her house.  I don‚Äôt quite remember the timeline perfectly, but I did get back in touch with ex girlfriend #1 by this time, while we didn‚Äôt reconcile exactly, we got along enough to bear each other‚Äôs presence I suppose.  
Now the weekend of ex girlfriend #1‚Äôs birthday, I was out of town with family while best friend was staying with her.  I was feeling extremely hurt that best friend would make plans to come down, when she lives so far away, and not plan anything to come see me.  Yeah, forgot to mention that, she didn‚Äôt have any intention of seeing me during this.  So I was pretty upset but I was trying to just let it go, I always had a very hard time setting boundaries with people and especially if I was close with them I never wanted to hurt their feelings.  So I guess that‚Äôs a big reason why I just tried to ignore how best friend‚Äôs relationship with ex girlfriend #1 made me feel.  
Anyways, I get a text from ex girlfriend #1 I believe on Saturday night, and she invited me to her party the next day on Sunday, so I could come and see best friend and spend some time with her.  I was really happy that she invited me, and I came home a day early from my family trip since I really wanted to see my best friend. 
The next day, the day of the party, ex girlfriend #1 texts me something along the lines of ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been thinking about this and I feel really bad but I just don‚Äôt think you should come today.  It would be awkward for everyone here‚Äù 
I was upset, and explained to her that I rearranged my plans in order to be back home to come to the party.  Ex girlfriend #1 didn‚Äôt care, just got increasingly mad at me saying she never should have invited me in the first place, etc etc.  So I texted best friend and I was like, well is there any way I can still see you? Best friend declined, saying it would be too awkward for everyone and I should just stay out of it.  
Now I felt completely betrayed.  I got very upset, sent some nasty messages to both of them, and overall it just wasn‚Äôt a pretty picture.  In the coming weeks after that, best friend and I fought, day in and day out about it, and she refused to apologize or admit she did anything wrong by not making plans to see me.  (Also, we were not on bad terms prior to this, we were very close and I did not understand whatsoever why she would do something like this to me and leave me out of the loop).  
So we stopped talking for about a year, since I just felt like she was very disloyal to do that to me. 

We did eventually start talking again, and we did not bring it up for discussion.  We both just wanted to leave it in the past, and I figured since best friend lived so far away it wouldn‚Äôt be something I‚Äôd need to worry about happening again. 

That was four years ago.  Fast forward to this past year (sorry the backstory was so long), I dated another girl for about a year.  Best friend knew of her, but I never introduced them.  In January of this year, I had a health crisis, and wasn‚Äôt well enough to answer the phone or talk to anyone for quite a few weeks.  Over that time period, best friend had reached out to ex girlfriend #2 (who at the time I was still dating) and they became friends while I was out of the picture (which I did NOT know about, I only found out that they had talked a few months later, and from what they told me it was just asking if they knew what was going on with me etc, so I didn‚Äôt think anything about) 
Around June I had finally recovered a bit from what happened, and ex girlfriend #2 and I broke up, which I broke up with her since this whole year after my health crisis, I‚Äôve had a very very difficult time keeping up with the people in my life.  i lost my job. I‚Äôve become very secluded, and I have a very hard time staying in touch with people, and maintaining a relationship wasn‚Äôt something I was able to do, and I didn‚Äôt want to hurt ex girlfriend #2 by leading her on throughout that.  She is an amazing person who has been so supportive of me from day one.  
Well, ex girlfriend #2 and I had a couple bumps in the road from June to August, and decided it would probably be best if we didn‚Äôt talk for awhile, so we‚Äôd have time to center ourselves and move on before attempting to be friends again.  
This was about a month ago that we had that conversation.  
We got back in touch with each other just over a week ago, and decided to go out to a theme park together.  It was really nice to catch up and spend time with her, we‚Äôve always gotten along so well and it was very refreshing to be able to see each other again.  While we were waiting on seeing a show at the park, I notice she was texting someone quite a lot.  I just saw from the corner of my eye that who she was texting was my best friend, that caught my attention and I was like, ‚Äúyou guys talk? I had no idea!‚Äù and I noticed that what my best friend was talking to her about, she was actually ranting about something going on in best friend‚Äôs life that was very personal.  So I knew at that point it wasn‚Äôt just a casual conversation.  I didn‚Äôt say anything, as I already started getting a bit flooded with emotions from what happened so many years ago.  So I brushed it off and continued to enjoy my day with ex girlfriend #2. 

When I got home, I texted best friend and asked what was going on, I didn‚Äôt know you guys talked, etc etc.  I was very calm and not accusative in my approach, I asked her to please not get upset at me for bringing it up, I was just very curious as they had seemingly gotten very close and I had no idea about it.  Best friend immediately fires at me ‚Äúwell when you don‚Äôt text me back, I need someone to talk to‚Äù.  I said to her that it made me uncomfortable that she had gotten so close with yet another one of my ex girlfriends, especially since ex girlfriend and I were not on talking terms up until a few days prior.  She denied knowing that ex girlfriend and I weren‚Äôt talking.  I repeated myself saying that because of what happened in the past it makes me feel pretty uncomfortable and awkward.  She messages me back a few ‚Äúapparently our friendship can‚Äôt move on from 2016, are you fucking kidding me right now?‚Äù texts and I didn‚Äôt respond after that.  I didn‚Äôt want to get in an argument, even though it absolutely made my blood boil that she was AGAIN going behind my back and getting close to MY exes, and her response just made me even more upset. 
The next day I made the decision to tell ex girlfriend #2 what had happened, since she could tell I was a little off put by them talking.  I told her the whole story of what best friend did to me in the past, and told ex girlfriend #2 that it made me very deeply uncomfortable that they were talking.  She apologized profusely, and told me that when her and I stopped talking, she texted best friend and told her specifically that we had made the decision to not talk for awhile and she wanted best friend to know that, in case it made best friend feel awkward about continuing to talk to her.  So, best friend DID know that we weren‚Äôt on the best terms, therefore lying to me that she had no idea.  
Ex girlfriend #2 said she would not talk to my best friend anymore (which I did not specifically ask her to do, at no point did I ask that they didn‚Äôt talk) but she didn‚Äôt want to make me feel uncomfortable and doesn‚Äôt want anymore drama.  I thanked her quite a lot for that, and apologized to her for this whole situation. 

Now yesterday, I still hadn‚Äôt texted best friend back after we initially talked about it and she cussed me out for it.  Best friend texts me a couple very long messages (since ex girlfriend #2 had told her she didn‚Äôt want to continue talking to her) and best friend is swearing that I‚Äôm being completely unfair to her by ‚Äútaking away‚Äù her only other friend besides me.  Saying that I‚Äôm never around when she needs me, and that ex girlfriend #2 is the only person on the planet that‚Äôs consistently there for her, and she just can‚Äôt believe I would do such a horrible thing to her, to sum up what she said in the messages.  
I took a few hours to think about what to say, and I texted her a very short message saying that it just simply makes me uncomfortable because of what happened in the past, and I‚Äôd really appreciate if she could at least consider why I feel that way.  I said that I didn‚Äôt want to talk about it further until I feel like I can consider her side of things better. and I didn‚Äôt tell her this part, but since I am so extremely upset over the whole situation, I really don‚Äôt want to handle this incorrectly and cause a massive fight and drama between us all.  best friend texted me back a simple okay, agreeing that we would talk about it later once I felt ready to consider her side of things.  


I‚Äôd also like to point out, best friend has plenty of friends of her own in real life, a boyfriend, and a job.  I just don‚Äôt understand why she has to leech onto my exes like this at my expense. 

any advice would be GREATLY appreciated.. I‚Äôm very confused on how to handle this right now.",21Sep2020,1

942,"I feel like an idiot. I‚Äôm 21 year old girl that met this guy in late May. I am not a person who falls for people quickly. I get over people very fast it‚Äôs actually quite scary. But man o man I have no idea what kind of spell this man put on me.

I had never connected with a person like that before. I hate texting, but we would text every day because we both just blended so together there was always something to talk about. and the funny part is, we only hung out FOUR TIMES. four times, ladies and gentleman. and yes within those four days I fell hard for this dude. On our third day of hanging out, we both basically told each other the same thing; that we both really like each other even so early on and that we want to keep being in each others lives basically. 

Then of course, his ex reached out to him. I guess they had dated for 5 years prior. He told me he was going back to her and that he‚Äôs sorry. I understood. I told him I hope everything works out but man was I heartbroken.

I thought I‚Äôd be over it fast anyway since we had only hung out 4 times. Man was I wrong. It‚Äôs already late September and I still cannot stop thinking about this man. We had so much in common about music and movies and stuff and that‚Äôs not really common for me to find someone that likes the same stuff as me and as passionately. A lot of it reminds me of him because I think ‚Äúoh X would love this song!‚Äù or something of the like.

It‚Äôs quite pathetic, I know. I even met this one guy recently that I think is cool and that I potentially like. But even still, I can‚Äôt stop thinking how he was the one that got away. I know I deserve better. I just can‚Äôt stop thinking about him. I don‚Äôt know how to get over him.

944,"Hey guys! 

First time posting ever so v sorry for any formatting badness haha.

I don't really have anyone/anywhere to get this off my chest so i thought why not try here?

Anyway, i'll try and keep this short but basically i've suffered a couple traumas over the past two years from un-hanging my sister to my best friend killing himself and I know it's a bit stupid of me but I've never had any help throughout any of this. My parents generally had a sort of 'when the goings get tough the tough get going' attitude or blamed me for it and never really reached out or offered me support. I can understand why, i mean it must be impossible knowing what to do in those situations as parents so the best you can prolly do is use what you know/have learnt from your own childhood, right? 

I'll be blunt and say i've considered suicide a few times. you can guess how that turned out haha.  It might be weird asffff but honestly i kinda prefer having hard shit thrown onto me, i guess it's a way to kinda prove to myself how capable or strong i am and that despite everything that's wrong with me and the mistakes i've made i'm capable enough to get through anything on my own. 

I think it's weird how people consider attention-seeking a negative thing. As humans, we all need attention, it's a pretty basic need and yet we all go ape-shit crazy whenever we see someone clearly trying to fulfill this necessity in what they find to be the most reasonable way for their situation. 

sorry for rambling on so much but i get off-topic pretty easy and zone out even quicker haha.

I've been repeatedly told to seek professional medical help. Each time i've either rejected that, convinced myself otherwise, or just carried on as if they hadn't said so. even when that person is myself. hell i was in a further maths class last week and one of my episodes hit really hard to the point where i was bout to just straight up leave the room and walk away somewhere quiet no questions asked, and in that moment i'd told myself i'd call the doctor and get an appointment straight after the lesson. Half an hour passes, class ends, i walk out, go home, and do nothing about it. Weird isn't it?

Memory is another big issue for me. I had an accident during lockdown where i'd been drunk skating, slamed my head at the skatepark giving myself a concussion, and then dropped acid when i got home. Ngl, that was the worst bloody night of my life. 12hrs straight talking smack, 30 degree C heat, no food or water. Ended up asking my best friend out lol. (was a no for anyone wondering). Next day i was just sat in my room staring at a room tryna process wtf had just happened. wasn't great for my mental health. 

Following that was when i started acting out for the first time, telling close friends i hate them one minute, and apologising profusely the next. They eventually just got fed up with me and i was lonely for a while. 

There's a lot more to my story like i skipped out a ton of shit about when all my money got stolen but tbh i think this is long enough already ygm. 

i might post again but ehhhhh idk. later gators",21Sep2020,1

Alright Reddit, I need some help.

I want to ask this girl I like out on a date. Here's some backstory:

I met this girl (we're both high schoolers) in middle school, I'll call her Bree, and we've always been friends. I started talking to her this march during quarantine, and we talked for a few months, but kind of fell off for reasons I still don't know after a little while. I guess we kind of both just got bored, and neither of us could drive at the time, and we were still kind of under quarantine, so we couldn't really do anything anyway. But, we became pretty close friends, even after we stopped talking, and still hang out a lot.

I started talking to a different girl about a month ago, but realized that I still liked the first girl, so kind of broke things off. The thing is, I noticed that Bree acted kind of weird when I told her about this other girl. I just assumed that was normal, and she just wasn't sure what to think about her guy friend talking to a different girl that she had never met, but looking back she had a strange nervousness to her the night I told her. A couple weeks later, her best friend, whom I also hang out with texted me out of the blue to ask me if I was still talking to that girl. At first, I thought her friend had a crush on me, and maybe she did, but I'm starting to think she was asking on Bree's account. Anyway, I eventually told Bree that I didn't like this girl anymore, but that we still snapped, just because I didn't necessarily dislike her, and Bree really pushed for me to stop snapping her at all. She wanted me to just straight up leave this chick on read. Not only that, but one of my best friends said that he told her about a gift I gave the other girl, and he said Bree couldn't stop talking about how sweet it was. I felt that was enough of a sign that I should probably make a move on her.

I have a couple issues though. I'm not sure Bree's parents will let her date or not, and I'm not sure how to ask that without it being awkward. Also, even though I'm pretty sure that she will say yes, if she says no, what do I do to make sure things aren't awkward between us, and keep our friendship intact. Finally, I have no idea what to ask her out to do. I'm not sure my parents will let me go inside a restaurant or movie theatre with Covid, and even then, I've never been on a date, and don't know where to go. She really likes Marvel Movies, but isn't really nerdy or anything, so I thought about trying to find one of those to watch, but again, covid. I'll also mention that I play guitar. Not to be douchey or anything, but I've had people tell me I should write her a song, but that seems a little cheesy and over the top, but I'll let the internet decide. Any suggestions?",21Sep2020,1

951,"First time poster. Sorry, long story.

So, some backstory:

When I was around 11-12 my dad cheated on my mom. During this time he always said that my mom treated him horribly and that this new woman was much nicer etc. etc. At one point he snuck me out in the middle of the night to meet this mystery woman. Of course, at the time I was easily influenced and felt like this woman was a better match for my dad considering everything my mom was ‚Äúdoing‚Äù to him. During this time my mom and I had a very bad relationship due to how she was handling everything and just overall not taking care of me and my brothers, but I later learned it was from her being severely depressed.

After about a year of the affair, my dad had a ‚Äúcoming to light‚Äù moment and thought that God wouldn‚Äôt accept him for cheating on his wife he should go back to her. He told her if she still wants to leave she can, but my mom being my mom took him back.

Obviously their relationship was still rough around the edges, but eventually it started to get better.

However, over the last year I‚Äôve been noticing a few things more and more. Honestly, I‚Äôve noticed that my dad is a straight up dick to my mom.

Here are a few things he tends to do/how he treats my mom:

- every single Saturday, my dad wants to go somewhere with my mom. This mainly consists of walking along the river and in the park. My mom loves nature, but doesn‚Äôt like to do this because she has fibromyalgia and other health concerns like CIDPthat make it exceptionally hard for her to do. If she says she doesn‚Äôt want to do it BECAUSE OF THIS, he loses his mind and tells her she only says that because she never wants to be with him and they should just separate.

- my mom and dad have two separate bank accounts. Their paychecks go into the separate ones. My dad makes my mom use all of her earned money for all of the bills and he uses his leftover money to buy things for himself, mainly consisting of guns. If she would like something, he tells her she can‚Äôt get it because she needs to use her ‚Äúearned money‚Äù but he can get what he wants because he has ‚Äúearned money‚Äù leftover.

- on the subject of money, my mom needs a cleaning machine for the breathing machine she uses at night. One of her health issues is sleep apnea. The hospital put her through a test and she stops breathing around 30 times an hour while sleeping. It‚Äôs been months of her asking to get the cleaning machine and him not getting it. I asked about it myself a few weeks ago. He said he was getting it for her birthday. Her birthday party was this past Saturday. He got her nothing. However, he currently has a gun in layaway and doesn‚Äôt want to give it up in order to get the machine. For reference; the machine is around $100. The gun is around $600.

- he insults her and when she gets upset, he flips it, getting upset himself and saying that she ‚Äúnever knows when [he‚Äôs] joking‚Äù. This includes him saying that she needs to eat less, she gets too many servings of food, and in general about her eating habits and physical traits. My mom has gained weight since they married 30 freaking years ago, but so has he. They‚Äôve come over to my place for dinner and he‚Äôll get 3-4 servings but if she gets two, the comments start.

- he likes to act like he‚Äôs never mean to her and she just blows up at him for no reason. The reason I didn‚Äôt catch on for so long is because he does it when he thinks no one is around. Relevant info: my dad shames me all of the time for cussing. When he think I can‚Äôt hear the phone call or I‚Äôm not at their place, he belittles her and humiliates her. He called her ‚Äúfucking stupid‚Äù, a ‚Äúfucking bitch‚Äù, an ‚Äúasshole‚Äù, has told her she‚Äôs incompetent because she doesn‚Äôt have the correct grammar all of the time when speaking (who fucking does?) and calls her names under his breath while people are around so that she‚Äôll react and she looks like the bad guy.

- my brother and his girlfriend and her three kids live with them. The kids are all under 8. He will start an argument and yell at her in front of them. She‚Äôll yell back. He tells her to leave, most of the time she doesn‚Äôt leave, but when she leaves, he calls her and yells at her for running away. He then insults her for making the kids feel terrible by arguing in front of them and tells her she‚Äôs why they‚Äôre upset and she always makes them sad. He then always says he wishes they would just separate and shifts all of the blame to her.

- he uses me and my husband to make her feel bad. He will tell her that I or my husband have asked him if he‚Äôs okay because we‚Äôve noticed her being absolutely terrible to her. This has never occurred. He just likes making her feel worse.

Anyway, these are just a few of the things that occur. 

I‚Äôve talked to my mom about it and she begs me not to talk to him because it will make it worse. I asked her why she wouldn‚Äôt leave and she said she wouldn‚Äôt be able to afford living on her own. I‚Äôve told her she could stay here but I think she‚Äôs scared to admit she doesn‚Äôt love him partly because she decided to stay after he cheated. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do, but my dad is an asshole.

952,"I [26F] was interviewed for a Marketing manager position that opened up within the company I am working for. I was offered the job but my whole career thus far has been in Software Engineering. The job is offering slightly better pay but it's a lot less than it should be for that role because they are telling me that they cannot raise my pay more than 15%. I am already being severely underpaid and this isn't a promotion, it's a move to a whole different field and if I was not already part of the company, they would not be calling it a promotion. I really want the job but I am afraid to negate my Software Engineering experience for what will be a fresh start in a new field for a low salary.

962,"I have been working at my (first) job for 6 months now. I was previously working full time. However, I have recently begun a specialized program that requires me to be enrolled full time. I‚Äôm in class Monday - Friday from 7:00 a.m - 2:00 p.m., so I now only work on the weekends. After class, I spend majority of my time studying. I‚Äôm enrolled in a very fast paced program where I am getting on average 4 exams per week, plus assignments. 

The problem I‚Äôm having is I‚Äôm feeling burnt out, completely on my jobs end. The job I‚Äôm working has me on my feet for 10 hours straight, dealing with customers and I am doing a bit of lifting constantly. Because of this I feel physically drained so it‚Äôs hard for me to study and stay focused when I come home feeling really tired. So now I feel as though I have to finish everything on my agenda for school between Monday - Friday. My thought process is: you‚Äôre gonna be tired Saturday/Sunday after work, so study all day Monday - Friday. This causes me to never have time for myself it feels like. I hardly ever have time to spend with my own family that I live with, I hardly ever have time to see my boyfriend, I hardly ever have time to see my friends, I hardly ever have time to just relax. I don‚Äôt feel comfortable living like this for the next 12 months until this program is finished and I start working in the industry. 

Additionally, an instructor warned me that my upcoming semester (starting late October) is going to be super heavy on coursework. I also have to start rotating shifts for husbandry at school where I‚Äôll have to be there every single day of the week, including weekends, as early as 5 a.m. and as late as 5:00 p.m.. So when this starts I‚Äôll only be working 6 days out of the month, and I don‚Äôt feel like that‚Äôs even worth it. 

I‚Äôm fairly young so I still live with my parents where I‚Äôm not required to pay any bills. I really don‚Äôt have any financial responsibility at all. I‚Äôm pretty responsible with my money as in I don‚Äôt just spend it on unnecessary things I don‚Äôt need. On top of that I have most of my money saved up. 

I‚Äôm also guaranteed a job upon graduation, and the job I‚Äôm working at right now is not at all related to the field I‚Äôm pursuing. My only problem is I don‚Äôt know how it would look quitting after only 6 months? I appreciate any advice.",21Sep2020,1

965,So I really wanted your guys opinion on a situation I‚Äôm dealing with right now. Be prepared for a long story. Sorry I have a lot to explain. Im really upset with my ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù. I‚Äôve know her for about a year and a half. I met her through work. We ended up be coming really close because we had a lot in common. We listened to the same music and we had a lot of the same hobbies. In the beginning there was a point were we were hanging out so much were we got super close. We shared our deep and very personal secrets to each other. I have never ever told anyone these secrets before. We also have had very deep and emotional conversations as well which I have never experienced with anyone else‚Äôs before. She was my best friend and I really cared about her. I cared about her so much I would‚Äôve really taken a bullet for her. We have never ever gotten into any fights as well. Our friendship was always good and positive. We have only got into one disagreement which we squashed really quick and made up. Moving on to present time which is now. A month ago I felt a drift in our friend ship. Things didn‚Äôt feel the same. I felt distant from her. I even told her that I felt like she was becoming distant from me. She started hanging out with these new people a lot and started becoming close with them. I don‚Äôt care if she makes new friends and becomes best friends with them. I‚Äôm happy for her that she makes new friends. But don‚Äô forget about me and at least still hang out with me here and there. She told me she would never leave me and forget about especially because of all of the stuff we‚Äôve been through. But I felt like that was a lie. It‚Äôs been a while and we still haven‚Äôt hung out. Here birthday recently just past it was this month September. For her birthday she told me that she rented a cabin and she wanted me to come. The cabin was $2000 and was non refundable. She rented the cabin for 3 days. I was excited to go because I was happy to hang out with her and celebrate her birthday. Plus we get to hang out again. I texted her later on that night and told me she wasn‚Äôt going to the cabin anymore. I asked her why? She gave me an explanation that didn‚Äôt add up. It was really confusing. She told me that another girl wanted to go to the cabin with her and do her birthday party with her at the cabin. The girl ended up sending her money for her share of the cabin. The girl  covered her half which was $1000. She told me that the girl was really annoying and was complaining about the people my ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù was inviting to the cabin. She told me that the girl came at her really disrespectful and if she sees the girl at the cabin she‚Äôs gonna fight her. So I asked her multiple times ‚ÄúSo your really not gonna celebrate your birthday anymore and go to the cabin‚Äù? She said ‚ÄúNo I‚Äôm not going anymore and the people I invited aren‚Äôt going anymore since I‚Äôm not going‚Äù. That didn‚Äôt make sense to me because she spent hella money on the cabin and she‚Äôs not going to go. Who spends $1000 on a cabin that is non refundable and decides not to go? Thats a lot of money to waste I would not do that kind of shit. So the next day was her actual birthday and I texted her happy birthday in the morning. I checked my social media which was Snapchat and I find out she lied to me. She went to the cabin with her new friends and they were all partying. That shit really hurt my feelings and made me upset. I‚Äôm her best friend and she didn‚Äôt invite me but what hurt me the most was the fact she lied to me. I would have had more respect for her if she just told me up front I don‚Äôt want you to go. She made all that shit up. I‚Äôm all about loyalty and I am a very loyal friend. I felt like she had no loyalty and what she did was fake as fuck. I asked myself did I do anything wrong? Did I ever do anything wrong to her? Did I make her upset? I always try to look at both side in a situation. But I swear that I have always been a good friend. God can strike my ass with thunder right now if I‚Äôm lying! I think she doesn‚Äôt care about me anymore and only cares about her new friends because they‚Äôre ‚Äúcooler‚Äù than me. I was going to give her a gift for her birthday. But after what she did made me angry but more so really sad. So I decided not to give her a gift. I don‚Äôt even consider her a best friend anymore just acquaintances. I still have love for her and wish her nothing but the best in life. But our friendship won‚Äôt be the same. I want your guys opinion. Am I being over dramatic? Am I being to sensitive? Am I blowing things out of proportion? Please share your thoughts and opinions with me!,21Sep2020,1

I have a small business that I run and I have three years of retail sales that I included in my resume, therefore, I decided to not include that 6 month job that I got let go from on my resume.

970,"Okay so just for some context, i was late to sign up for my courses and i missed a few sessions. The sessions were recorded so i was watching them and i heard this one girl talk and i don't know what it was but just her  voice and the way she talked made me... feel something. I don't even have any idea what she looks like but i keep thinking about her.

Because i was late i needed  someone to help me catch up with everyone else, and i had two courses in common with this girl so i thought i'd send her a message asking for help. Was i also using that as an excuse to talk to her? Yep

And she did help, she answered every question i asked her, sent me her notes (which i didn't even ask for), she even offered to explain anything i don't understand in an online meeting but that wasn't necessary, she has sent me messages out of nowhere just asking how i'm doing and making sure that i understand everything. She's honestly one of the nicest and smartest people i've talked to. 

So we've been talking for a few days but it has been mostly (like 80% maybe) me asking her for help with a few occasional jokes and some talking about a few things.

The problem i have is i don't know if she wants to be friends or if she's interested in just talking and seeing how it goes. I'm not sure how i should transition from just asking her for help to suddenly talking about other things.

Do you think i should send her a message and tell her that i think she's really nice and that i want us to talk/ be friends and see how she responds to that? Or should i just talk to her without sending her a message about how i feel?

I feel like if i don't send her a message and let her know that i want to be friends this could be confusing for her. Because for her this is just her helping me catch up, so it might be weird if i just talk to her about other things and just have a conversation.",21Sep2020,1

She never told me she was proud of any of my accomplishments and she never showed interest in my life (i played several instruments as a kid and she never paid my talent any mind, she never wants to meet the people in my life ie my girlfriend, and there are a lot of times i meet coworkers of hers that don‚Äôt even know i exist.)

973,"I have a very fluid perception of relationships. I've started experiencing living abroad during the last year of high school and now I've been away from home for 6 years. I have a stable relationships here, and I call it home, next to my other home (home town).

That means that a big part of my core friends group from my oldtown kind of shattered. Some people I lost contact with, some I am super happy to talk to, but that happens rarely, some I consider close friends. We regularly chat on WhatsApp and I always meet them when I visit my home town.

But I am not a whatsapp talker, of there is no ""real"" problem or issue, I'm not really one for casual small talk chat. I get impatient with it and I end up either ignoring it or just write short messages.

Now those two friends I consider between my closest ones. And it recently occurred to me that I really might not be the same for them. Although I'm there for the bad times, I feel like they see me as more as ""the nice person that sometimes is here"" instead of ""a good friend who lives away"". 
I didn't know myself to be jealous/envious, but this year I witnessed yet another gift-exchange between them and I couldn't stop thinking how I actually never received something from any of them. It's an unfair thought to have, but still.

I don't know. The ""present"" thing is also a theme because I grew up in a family without Christmas and birthday presents (only presents when you feel like giving one, which is nice), so I rarely had friends who gave me something because my BD was never a thing and now sometimes I feel like nobody thinks about making something for me. 
I think a main love language of mine is actually gifts so a part of me feels hurt that it's such a rarity from other people. And I can't even ask it from them because, well, it's horrible, and it takes away the spontaneity of the gesture.
But maybe I'm derailing. 

In the end, I don't know if my minimalistic communication make our friendship thinner than I imagine, for me it doesn't really matter if I've not seen/talked to someone for ages because of life, I'm still going to be attached to you as the last time we saw each other. But for others it might be different. This kind of scares me a little. I am afraid of being perceived as an acquaintance from somebody I consider a good friend. I think that's it.

986,"Hi, this is maybe going to be a bit much but I really need some advice on how to fix my life. I apologize if this is the wrong subreddit or if my post is a mess.
    

Background: I was always the smart kid in grade school, one of the smartest in my grade and that‚Äôs all my parents and I really cared about. Math and numbers were my main skill. In high school, this changed to just being one of the smart kids. Along with this, my effort went down and I‚Äôd started procrastinating horribly. I started missing tons of days, just from feeling awful in the morning or rarely because I didn‚Äôt finish an assignment and didn‚Äôt want to deal with the shame (even a small homework assignment). I still finished with a good GPA and many college credits.
    
I can‚Äôt deal with social situations. I‚Äôm not diagnosed with anything, nor have I seen a doctor or psychologist about it, but from what I‚Äôve heard from others as well as my own research I believe I might be on the autism spectrum albeit mildly, and that I have anxiety as well. It becomes hard to breathe out in public and I don‚Äôt trust anything or anyone that I don‚Äôt know well. I don‚Äôt like trying new things and I hate mistakes and failure to the point where it hinders me from putting myself out there. This paragraph isn‚Äôt meant to be an excuse, I am just trying to get as much info on here as possible.

As far as interests or passions... I‚Äôm not sure I have any. There‚Äôs nothing that jumps out to me. I thought my skills were in math, not so sure anymore.
    
I‚Äôm in college now, as I have to be. I couldn‚Äôt get a job straight out of school, I did not and still do not know how one would go about that. I‚Äôm at a decent in-state school (though not currently at said school due to the pandemic) and with my financial aid, my debt should be reasonably paid off within 5-7 years. My first semester went well, I put a fair amount of effort in and focused entirely on school, which works for me since I had nothing else to care about.
    
Second semester didn‚Äôt go as well. I took more classes this time, and some of them felt entirely miserable which affected my interest and effort. This was fine for two classes, but for another, I failed my first exam (in my life) and this crushed me. I knew it was over, there was no coming back from that. I‚Äôd have to get nearly perfect scores on everything else if I wanted to pass. I felt pretty numb after this, and this is when I was convinced I‚Äôm not going to be able to make it in life or even survive. As far as the other classes, they were fine and I got pretty strong grades in them.
    
    
Present: I‚Äôm feeling impending failure once again. Not just my classes, but my life. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm capable of being a normal person. I lack willpower and don‚Äôt know how to fix myself. The future just seems so bleak and pointless, though I‚Äôm not suicidal. I don‚Äôt have the fearlessness required for that. I can‚Äôt see myself succeeding or being able to live life. Everything seems so difficult and yet everyone else can do it easily - both in terms of my courses and life in general. I‚Äôve been told I just need to grow up but that tells me nothing, I don‚Äôt understand it.  
    
I‚Äôm not certain where to go from here. I‚Äôm only posting as the result of yet another low, where I feel as though if things continue the way they are, if I continue to be how I am, I can‚Äôt see myself making it through college. The things I was once good at, which I prided myself on, are now making no sense to me. I‚Äôm losing everything good about me and I don‚Äôt what to do.
    
    
If you made it this far, thank you, and I appreciate any advice you may have.",21Sep2020,1
987,"My parents have always been very controlling and strict but I have listened to them and behaved my entire life up until about 2 years ago when fights about school started. After that all I ever did wrong was talk back and argue (my mother is unbearable so it's almost impossible not to). 

My fiance has known about my moms problems since practically the beginning. We're very open and talk about anything that comes to mind at the moment. His whole family loves us but mine always picks at all of his mistakes. He knows about my mother's manipulation and sickness but he was raised to be independent and his own person, not his parents property.

My fiance and I have been dating for 2 years and just got engaged about 5 months ago. My parents have always hated the idea of me getting married because they feel like I won't know how to do anything (I'll be a housewife so cooking and  cleaning will be what I do all day until kids come along) and I'm perfectly okay with this. When we wanted to get engaged there was fighting for months until they finally scared my into saying that I'll wait at least a year or two (until at least next fall) until getting married. After that the subject wouldn't come up otherwise there'd be more fighting because of how angry they were about everything. 

About a month ago my fiance and I decided that we could get married and have a place to live in 2 months. Our original plan was spring so thats what I always told my parents until they made me say fall. Once we had a solid plan on living conditions we told them that we were to be married in two months.

 Now I would have told them more than the 1 time that fall was also an option if we got lucky in this hell of a housing market,  but my mother exploded when I brought it up. 

Once we told them they were livid. They told me no, which before would have worked before but I refused to back down. My fiance told me I had to be a rock since I've always backed down from them but this time I stood my ground. 

My mother has had health problems for as long as I can remember so whenever something was too stressful for her she would be down in bed sick(1. J just about anything makes her stressed and 2. They would use this to guilt me; have my sister and i's whole life). 

My mom and dad told me that I'm an awful daughter, they insulted me, told me I don't know anything and that they don't care if I'm 18 because im their daughter and I have to listen to them and I'm their property.  They said that I ripped their hearts out and stomped on them. Which I know is true because I hid it from them, but unless I wanted to live in a never ending argument, punishment, and a downright awful environment, i couldn't say anything about it. Now that they've calmed down somewhat i seriously regret hiding it. I feel childish and immature but what's done is done. By the time I started doubting myself we had already booked several things for the wedding and my fiance gave me pep talks saying that if they're the only reason I'm rethinking this then i need to stick to what i want. He told me that if its my desition to postpone then that's okay but if they were the ones convincing me then I had to stand my ground. 

I feel just awful about my dad, he's always been the nice and logical one. He has his own issues just like my mom but not near as bad. Just recently he was working on my car, trying to get me back to a job. Trying to help me grow up finally. I feel like I really betrayed him. 

With my mother, I don't feel as bad but still guilty about it. She's a very emotional and delicate person. She's always been a little princess, always getting what she wants otherwise she fights with my dad, even insulting him over nothing telling him how awful he is too. (He's a wonderful dad, both of them came from bad families but my dad really became a good person from it). But before a couple years ago happened I really started to look up to her, I loved her so much but now I'm full of a lot of resentment, I hide it though because im really trying to make things easy for her with this news.

Over the past month has been the worst, it's better now but my mom is still always on edge. We're constantly walking around eggshells for her but even doing that doesn't work. She just finds things to be angry at and blows them completely out of proportion. 

I'm not going to change my mind, but I want to know if I'm really such an awful daughter like they say I am.  Am I TAH?

Yet I find out a day later he asked two of my friends and said, ‚Äúif sicsemper mentions me tell him he needs to get over it and I‚Äôve moved on, he needs to change‚Äù.

So okay whatever, then ANOTHER friend of mine who he doesn‚Äôt talk to randomly texts me asking me why this dude texted him that were not friends. Idk why he says I‚Äôm the one who needs to move on when he‚Äôs still talking to people behind my back when I haven‚Äôt said anything(until this fucking post).

What really made me write this post though was when I went to a local bar(outdoors social distanced). Since this toxic guy used to be around our group she described him saying he was talking crap about ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù and she thought it was weird he was telling her all that since she‚Äôs just a bartender. We told her it‚Äôs nothing he‚Äôs just upset and whatever(not gonna share drama with a bartender) but we said he‚Äôs also stalked us before. 

That kinda annoyed me then my friend and I left the bar to find out our other friend told me ‚Äúhey ____ is at *local bar*‚Äù literally 5min after we left. Normally it wouldn‚Äôt concern me except for the fact this toxic friend has admitted to seeing my location on Snapchat and finding me. He told my other friend that he knew where a DIFFERENT friend was and knew we were hanging out. He told him he wanted to avoid me...yet shows up at my location minutes to a bar after I leave? 

Anyways, I‚Äôm wondering if I should confront or ignore him like I‚Äôm doing. Even friends who ask me I‚Äôm just short about saying what happened because I‚Äôm 24 and too old for this. However, if he‚Äôs trying this hard I‚Äôm thinking maybe I should tell him he needs to stop.

989,"  My neighbors have lived directly under me (24f) for about 8 months. Mostly there have been no big issues, they smoke cigarettes on the stoop and it wafts into my bedroom, they litter and occasionally get into really loud fights but nothing that‚Äôs been worth me complaining to a landlord.

991,"Looking for a little help.

My partner and I are trying to decide where to buy a home and settle for the foreseeable future. We are located in New Jersey.

We are between a few towns down the shore - Fair Haven/Rumson, Little Silver, Shrewsbury, or similar - and a few in North Jersey - Maplewood, Montclair, Westfield or similar. We like these towns because of their good schools, nice communities, and progressive values (some obviously better on this than others). Our jobs will be where we are.

We are currently renting in Monmouth Beach month to month for the off season and really like the area, love the beach, but we worry it might be too quiet. Convenience is also a minor issue - a bit far for groceries, access to EWR, etc.

Our concern for living further north is that it will be too hectic, crazy, and stressful. We also feel we might miss easy access to the beach.

We spent the last 6 years living in the city and we like having the option to go in, but don't plan on commuting daily. We like going in to see our friends still there, games at Yankee stadium, and shows once in a while.

We would like to buy and settle in a town where we can be part of the community, be friendly with our neighbors, and have some sort of downtown area in either that town or surrounding towns. We want to pick a town where people share our values and interests. We both worked in high end restaurants and bars in the city and loved the group of friends we have from being a part of that. Hoping to find something similar in Jersey.

Our family is in Passaic county and we do enjoy spending time with them. We would like to start a family of our own soon and want parents/aunts/uncles to be a part of our children's lives. Is driving an hour about once a week to see them too much?

We also like to ski and the better ski mountains (plattekill, windham, hunter) seem more accessible to north jersey, whereas the ones accessible to the shore in the poconos are not as great.

I realize that's a lot to unpack, but hopefully someone can shed a little light and bring some clarity. Thank you very much!!!",21Sep2020,1

But for various reasons, I am not able to keep a job. I don‚Äôt understand why.

1002,"Hello everyone,

Me (20f) and my partner (18m) have been together for almost 3 years now and everything is going good. But, I am worried about my partner. I know he has been masturbating for quite some years now, which started out as a interesting new thing (I mean, I'm sure everyone remembers their first few times trying it) but he started doing it as a way to cope with his depression. This also including looking up more and more porn. 

Where now it is at a point where he masturbates daily (not the worst thing, but he told me he still often does it to get rid of his sadness temporarily), but also look at porn and NSFW art on social media basically through the day. I follow him on those socials, and I've been noticing he've been liking NSFW stuff all day long basically (thanks to sites showing what friends/people you follow like) even on days where I know he is as work, which leads me to conclude he even looks at the porn/NSFW stuff there. 

Since he turned 18 about 2 months ago, it only got worse (this is also when he started openly liking that stuff on socials etc) and I'm starting ot get really worried about it. I tried talking about it with him multiple times, even like a year ago, but he acknowledges the problem, but hasn't done anything ot fix it, even though he said he would. Instead it seems he is falling even more into that hole, causing him to basically seemingly develop a kink for/being interested in anything even slightly lewd, and seemingly also looking at pornographic images more and more.

It has been affecting sexual interactions and conversations between me and my partner, as they seem to focus on the other stuff so much that he isn't interested anymore in talking about that stuff with me, or even doing stuff, or at least to a way lesser extend.

How should I deal with this? Should I talk about it with him again? Should I try and contact his therapist about it? (he never talks about that stuff with anyone, but me basically). I don't know how to deal with this, especially with there being a huge distance between us, with him being in the US and me being in Europe.

1004,"I posted this in parenting as well if you would like to take a peek. 

Last year this boy ""Trevor"" caused numerous issues with my daughter, to a point where she was so uncomfortable that she would skip out on recess everyday to keep away from him. He would follow her to the bathroom, around the school, touched her butt, etc. I called the school and they didnt do anything. They said it was just kids being kids.

Fast forward to a little while later. She comes home crying saying that ""Trevor"" grazed her shoulder, all the way down to her privates while telling her how ""hot"" she is. I flipped the fuck out and immediately went above the school and directly to the superintendent. He was livid and called a meeting with the school which never happened because they promised to take care of the issue. Their way of resolving this was by changing his classroom (a promise never kept) and by supervising my daughter at all times, not him.

When Covid hit obviously my daughter was home and I didnt think too much of it. When school started this year I was promised he would not be in the same class but he is. My daughter came home today and said ""Trevor keeps telling all my friends that I kiss him and then he told me that he wants to make babies with me"". I'm fucking pissed, to put it lightly. I have half a mind to walk my fat ass to the school and smack the shit out of people.

Anyways, I called the school and asked to hold a meeting with this Boys parents. They told me no because of Covid and apparently due to lack of a translator. I had no idea originally but I guess this boy is a refugee from Somalia seeking sanctuary and his parents dont speak a wink of english. He might not even know any better but I truly dont care.

1020,"&amp;#x200B;

I apologize if this is not the thread to post this but I didn't know where else to post it. Thank you for entertaining my debate with myself. 

I am a huge gamer and a huge VR enthusiast. I sold my original Oculus quests (I had two of them so I could play multiplayer with my games with my girlfriend.) I saw the leaked video for the quest 2 and immediately put mine up for sale and was lucky enough to get them for $300 each. When the event happened 3 days later I managed to secure two Oculus Quest 2 pre-orders. Now I have a Rift CV1 and all of my quest games (except beat saber) are cross-buy. I plan to keep my rift but I loved my quest so much and all of my games! Now here comes the dilemma.

&amp;#x200B;

I worry about my PC not being able to handle next gen games. I have an HP OMEN 870-224 (prebuilt gross I know but I figured I could upgrade it a bit which I did). The specs are:

&amp;#x200B;

Intel core I5-7400

Zotac RTX 2060

2 sticks of DDR4 8GB RAM 2666 

500 WATT PSU

and 4 mechanical hard drives. (I'm pretty sure they are mechanical)

&amp;#x200B;

So my worry is not being able to play next gen games.  Especially with the new 30 series being unveiled. 

That is where my other option of the PS5 comes into play. I figure I'd be set for a while with the ps5 in terms of playing games, but then I think maybe I am set for next gen. Honestly I don't know. (the reason why this decision seems so permanent is because I am in college an don't have a lot of money, But I really want to game.)

&amp;#x200B;

I have never owned a PlayStation product, However I have owned multiple Oculus Products I have always been satisfied with them. The only ps4 exclusive that I only considered buying a PS4 for was Spiderman PS4. It seems the only PS4 exclusives I care about is miles Morales and dreams. However if my computer cannot run next gen games then I am interested in the pc games that are also coming to ps5 (RE8, Cyberpunk, etc.)

&amp;#x200B;

I also Really love VR and really enjoy the games it offers.

(IF YOU ARE GOING TO BRING UP THE WHOLE FACBOOK ACCOUNT REQUIRED. PLEASE KNOW I DO NOT CARE ABOUT THAT AND I HAVE COME TO TERMS WITH IT)

1026,"Hi, I‚Äôm looking for advice on what I should do next, but in summary: My son (13) just started secondary school. He was in religion class and his teacher was talking about how (I think) Muslim people pray in Arabic, or something along those lines. My son, innocently put his hand up and said in his church people speak in tongues when praying.

The teacher told him that‚Äôs what ‚ÄòMad People‚Äô do right in front of the class. My son was really embarrassed and said a couple of people laughed at him.

Okay, that out of the way here is some background to give you an idea of the situation. I live in a predominantly Catholic country and my son attends a Catholic school. We are Christians, not specifically Catholic though. My son did do all the sacraments regardless. I have a friend who teaches Religion and English in a school and I asked her opinion of speaking in tongues. She just said it‚Äôs something some Christians do and she teaches about it in her class. I should also mention that I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily say my country is racist, but of course there‚Äôs always a lil racism that no person would realize unless they were a POC. My son is biracial.

Here‚Äôs where I need advice. Do you think it‚Äôs something I should write to his tutor (basically a home room teacher) about? I really want to because it bothers me, but I don‚Äôt want to come off as entitled, or make the teachers think differently of my son. Do you think I should directly contact the Religion teacher instead? Or maybe mention it at the Parent-Teacher meeting which is months away and I‚Äôm not sure will even go one because of covid? Or should I ignore it all together and let it go?

Saturday morning, while my dad was doing his job (he's been delivering papers for 7 years), he lost control of his car and hit a concrete barrier on a country road and immediately died on impact. I am devastated and it feels so unreal, I don't want to believe that my dad is really gone. Everyone is having a hard time coping, especially my grandparents and my uncle. I've never seen them cry all my life and when I hear or see them crying, it just breaks me even more.
My grandma and my mother have been taking care of everything funeral related but they have been making sure my siblings and I have a part in everything. Even though my dad didn't have a life insurance policy, my grandma was hoping that his insurance would still cover the funeral expenses and left a little extra money to leave to my siblings and I. However, with my dad's car insurance policy, we'll only get $3000 in claims ( since he was the driver and not a passenger.) Funeral expenses cost a lot and neither my grandma nor my mother have almost over eight thousand dollars (the estimate for just the funeral home was around $7,200 not including the cemetery) to spare. She doesn't feel comfortable with a GoFundMe so she decided instead of having any relatives or family friends send flowers, she was going to ask for money to help pay. There's no guarantee that they'll send enough to cover everything and I don't want my grandma having to pay the rest from her savings.
I know my grandma said she would feel uncomfortable with a GoFundMe, but I want to lessen the burden on her about money troubles. We also wanted to put his obituary in the paper that my father worked for, but the funeral home director said it might be a little hard since it costs around $800, which is ridiculous. 
I also want advice on how to deal with my father's passing since I still can't believe he's gone.

She asks to talk multiple times a day and sometimes I can but sometimes I can't. I've been gone about 2 weeks and I got a text today saying that no one cares about her the way that she cares for other people (she'll ignore assignments or quizzes if friends are in a bad headspace for example). I explained my side of how things are and how she might better get a response from me or let me know whether a call is urgent or not and she told me I was victim blaming for suggesting things that she could do, which maybe it could be seen that way but lashing out when I'm busy doesn't elicit the best response. I just don't know what to do at this point, I constantly feel like a bad friend and a disappointment. We can't text about her feelings because she explained that gives her anxiety or something along those lines so it's either we talk for hours a day or I worry about her harming herself.

1031,"A girl has been the closest friend I've ever had for four years. She was in a relationship the entire time. She ended things with him a month ago because he was wasting her time. I started realizing I like her a lot and started wondering if something could develop between me and her. I wasn't planning on pushing for anything soon, but I wanted to see if something could develop naturally in the next few months as she moves on.

I hadn't seen her since before the break up, but we hung out this weekend (we spent 16 hours total together over two days), and she told me about how she's already doing some casual dating to get back out there, and isn't quite ready for something real yet. She spent a lot of time telling me all about the dating apps she's using and the guys she's been chatting with. I know this means I'm pretty much not in the equation at all (though I did make a joke at one point that she and I were on a ""date"" and she laughed and played along).

I feel like I had my feelings under control, but hearing about her out in the dating world has put my feelings into overdrive, and I feel this constant anxiety. As a friend, I want her to be happy, and I want her to pursue what she needs to in order to feel that way, but it's just amplifying my feelings so much.

I feel like I absolutely cannot lose her, and I think she, herself, would be absolutely crushed if I ended the friendship. But I also don't think I can stop feeling how I feel. And I know I can't have it both ways.

I won't see her again for another 2-3 weeks, and while I feel it's not the right time at all to have this talk (even if she could be open to dating me, she's not even ready for something ""real""), I wonder if I should just tell her how I feel and try to have a discussion about what that means for us as soon as I can. I can't hear more about her dating life. I just can't.

At the same time, I don't want to do anything rash and compulsive, just because I'm feeling overwhelmed. But I don't know how long I could or should try to weather the storm.

I do not normally go on any social media platforms for anything, but I wanted to ask this one question to see what you guys think from an outside perspective. To give some context, I am a 18F and married last year. 
Both my parents have severe control and manipulation issues, but I struggle the most with them placing everything in a wide grey area. For example, if my parents do something wrong then they will tell me that they love me and expect a hug with me saying everything is ok. Especially when they did it to me. One troubling thing my parents did was at the wedding. For the wedding, my parents did not allow me to chose anything, even the colors. The only thing I got to chose was to pick out a wedding dress from one store. Thankfully, they had a dress that actually looked pretty on me and my grandma out of the kindness of her heart bought it for me. On the day that my parents and I were flying out to the wedding, my mom told me to not worry about packing my wedding dress and accessories. I tried to check and make sure that everything was there, but my dad became furious at me and shoved me out the door to the car. Morning of the wedding, I went to my parents hotel room to get my wedding dress and accessories. When I got the bag, I pulled everything out to find that my mom ‚Äúsupposedly and accidentally‚Äù had mistaken my dark navy prom dress with my wedding dress. I was in complete shock and didn‚Äôt know what to do. For the rest of the day some of my family and my mom went out looking for another wedding dress. One hour before I was supposed to walk down the aisle, my mom find the ‚Äúmiracle dress‚Äù which also happens to be her favorite style of wedding dress. I had to wear the ugly thing that she got from a thrift store for a $100. For almost a year I was so traumatized from ‚Äúother‚Äù factors that happened that I had no idea that my parents purposefully swapped out my dress just so that she could ‚Äúdress me up‚Äù one more time.

Idk how long after I sent the message she opened it, but 20 minutes went by with no answer. My friend‚Äôs ex is her best friend, so I text my friend. He said that the group will discuss things for a few and then she will respond. After 30 minutes went by since I saw she opened it, I sent a ‚Äú?‚Äù. 

About 5 minutes later she responds with this: ‚Äúaww {my name} I wanna start off by saying that you are incredibly sweet and I really enjoy talking to you. I think you‚Äôre a really great guy! that takes a lot of courage to tell me that and i appreciate it so much. right now, i‚Äôm not in a good place to be in a relationship with school and everything but i think you‚Äôre a really great friend and I definitely wanna continue being that way.‚Äù

I responded with a question asking her if this was the nice way of saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wanna talk to you anymore.‚Äù 

The reason why I asked that is because with almost every girl I‚Äôve liked, I‚Äôve always gotten that response, and then never talked to them again. 

She said 2 times that she wants to be friends with me, she just does not want a relationship.


I am completely lost now. Do I still be friends with her and talk to her more and maybe in 2 or 3 months ask her out somewhere? Or do I leave her? 

Do I not send her any texts and see if she sends me one first? Do I keep talking to her? 

My goal would be to eventually ask her out around Christmas maybe.",21Sep2020,1

1051,"My whole life I‚Äôve had people comment on my family‚Äôs ‚Äúscent‚Äù. I smell that with other people too and always thought it was interesting how different houses and families smell different. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs the smell of my childhood home which was built in the 40s and is filled with antiques, and oak pollen, and definitely some mold somewhere. Of course, I can‚Äôt smell it on myself but I‚Äôve since been to college and moved away, and people always said a bit of the smell followed me to my dorm rooms, apartments, etc. 

The embarrassing problem is I get some really mixed reviews on the smell, to the point that I‚Äôm  actually really self-conscious about it. I wash my clothes, have a clean home, and good hygiene. I know some people who say I smell like an old house and it is very comforting. Some people like my boyfriend find it really intoxicating and love it. And some other people think it smells really gross and overpowering. My best friend and her mom always make me wash my clothes when I come to stay with them cus they hate it. 

So my question is‚Äîhow do I get rid of it or at least make it super mild without totally burning my skin off, buying new clothes, and getting rid of my car? My parents still live there so I know whenever I go back to visit I‚Äôll definitely pick it up again.

1052,"Not a shit post, so bear with me. Throwaway for obvious reasons..

I [M27] occasionally masturbate at work. I‚Äôm a sales manager in an incredibly competitive and high pressure industry. I‚Äôve been with this company for five years, two of which have been in a management position.

Six months into my promotion, my stress and anxiety was at an all time high. Paired with my promotion, my wife was dealing with the emotional and physical roller coaster that was the pregnancy of our first child. My wife and I have always had a great sex life, but I could not in good conscience ask my wife for sex during this time. 

So, I‚Äôm at work, in the middle of a typical 12 hour day, and I feel like I‚Äôm going to emotionally and physically fulminate. I take a break and go to the restroom (single person restroom). I spent a few minutes in there just trying to calm myself. Then, in a desperate attempt to relax myself and ‚Äúrelease‚Äù, I masturbated. Much to my surprise, I felt quite a bit better. A few weeks later, I was in a similar state, so I tried it again. And again, I felt significantly better. I continued this sporadically over the next 4-5 months as my wife healed from childbirth. Once she was up for it again, we resumed sex and I stopped masturbating. 

Fast forward to present, my wife is working on our second child and much to our horror, this pregnancy is starting to look very similar to the previous. I feel the stress building and I am having thoughts of recommencing my stress relief ‚Äúritual.‚Äù 

But, this got me thinking, ‚ÄúIs what I am doing wrong, sick, or twisted?‚Äù For clarification, I don‚Äôt regularly masturbate. Having sex 2-3 times a month is more than enough to satisfy my urges. I‚Äôm not addicted to pornography and often times I don‚Äôt use it when I masturbate. It gives me no satisfaction to masturbate at work, it just happens to be the place that all the stress and pressure really hits me. 

I am looking into and trying alternative options for stress relief. Right now, it seems that meditation and strenuous exercise is quelling the storm, but only time will tell. 

So, that leads me to the strangest question I have ever had to ask. If I were to get to that stress level again at work, is masturbation something that I should avoid? What is a viable alternative?",21Sep2020,1

1055,"Have you ever felt that all your ‚Äúfriends‚Äù were so close to you but you weren‚Äôt close to them? I never understood why that was. If there was something wrong with the way I handled my friendships. My counselor mentioned to me that‚Äôs because you are a ‚Äúlistener‚Äù. People pull towards you because you offer them empathy and compassion. I‚Äôm that therapy friend I guess. I never wanted to be though. Being that person makes you feel so exhausted because I never found my ‚Äútherapy‚Äù friend. If you feel like this could be you I will share some of the tips I‚Äôm working on. 
1. Try to avoid the people/friends that turn the conversation topic towards themselves. If this happens it‚Äôs okay to listen but I would try to avoid hanging around these types of people frequently because I promise eventually you will feel so unfulfilled by these relationships. 
2. I know it‚Äôs hard finding the type of people that will listen to you. I think a perfect sign of these people will be easy to talk to. The genuine type of people. The conversation should feel so good afterwards.
3. If you aren‚Äôt sure if you are the ‚Äútherapy‚Äù friend. Look out for these signs: feeling like you are fixing your friends, feeling like a doormat, not being able to talk about your own feelings, barley talking in conversations, and finally feeling so exhausted after hanging with your friends. ( for a long time I thought maybe I had a super introvert personality. But no, It was because I was constantly hanging around people that mentally exhausted me and I never had any relationship that filled me up just emptied me out.) 
4. Don‚Äôt give up searching for fulfilling friendships. It‚Äôs worth it.",21Sep2020,1

He has tried to reach out to her many times prior to all this, but gave up trying.He said he will not be contacting her as she has made her decision to have him in her life. He feels that he wants her to be in his life because she wants to, not because she is obligated because he is dying.

I dont really know anything about their relationship. All I know is that if this happened to my dad when I went through a point of not speaking to him for a while, I would be heart broken nobody told me and I didn't get the opportunity to repair that relationship before he passed.

She said that she had a strong feeling to move to Oklahoma so we started shoving shit into boxes, got a moving truck and they weren't the best at all but they brought our stuff. We started living in the hotel because the people that were buying our house, their lender for their loan wasn't doing anything till september 15. They took too long so we lost the house and now it's the third week of living in a hotel. 

I have not gotten time to myself unless it was in a car waiting for them which was only a couple of minutes. This has been bugging me for a while and it's starting to affect my mood a lot. I lash out sometimes and without thinking I get grumpy just by hear someone talk or even touch me. Another thing that's bothering me is that my mom won't let me get a job even when we are in debt. There are plenty of places that are looking for people to hire. I now live in Oklahoma so the rules are that I don't have to have a work permit because I'm 16. But it pissea me off because I dont want to ask for things because that's just gonna make it worse.

I didn't want to move in the first place because I had a lot of friends and a boyfriend. My boyfriend hasn't had the best life and I want to be there for him. But it's kinda hard when we cant see each other and we can barely text cause he is busy most of the time. But he has carona right now so I'm guessing hes mostly sleeping because of it. It's making me really worried because he also has athsma. I just dont want to lose him. I usually talk to him when I've had a stressful day but he's been not able to text me cause of sickness and he usually calms me down.

1071,"Ok, this is a throwaway account because my friend might be suspicious if she sees this, but this is about her. We're 18 years old and we just graduated high school this year. Recently, she told our friend group that she had been getting involved with a man (26) who used to be her boss at the place she works. According to her, he's not her boss now, but I'm pretty sure they work at the same place (since starting college, I'm don't talk to them quite as much as I used to). Immediately, most of my friends and I reacted negatively because of the large age gap. In addition, I'm 95% sure she's told us stories about him when we were in sophomore/junior year (when we were 16-17); he's known her since she was underage. We always thought he was just a wacky guy, and it didn't seem like she liked him them. Based on what she said, I think they've done some sexual stuff and the thought makes me sick to my stomach. In my own opinion, there's nothing a 26 year old and 18 year old can really have in common. Why doesn't he date someone closer to his own age? The fact that he knew her when she was underage also has be bugging. I mean, she \*just\* turned 18 in August! If I was 26 and dating an 18 year old, I would be embarrassed. She got a little upset at us when we expressed our concern, and I'm thinking I might have overreacted? She's one of my closest friends, and I just want her to be safe, but I'm thinking this man is definitely engaging in some predatory behavior.

1076,"Such a dumb thing to ask advice on but I'm reaching my wit's end. 

I'm 26 M, recently moved back to my home state and to the Philadelphia area with my girlfriend [23F] of 2 years. We moved from the [lack of] comfort of California wages, being unable to pay for a decent place even though combined we earned roughly 130k a year. I've struggled with depression and stability in life for the past decade, maybe a little earlier than that due to home abuse, extremely low wage jobs, lack of wanting to live, and motivation that felt nonexistent. 

I finally moved to a career in tech, and endured 4 long years of constant mismanagement and a low wage of $10/hr in the hopes of achieving something higher.  Which I did. I moved up to $28/hr, working remotely, chose a cheaper area to live in, and I've been trying so hard to boost my own spirits to no avail. I still feel worthless. I've still applied and interviewed at places for similar pay in the hopes of going into an office and feeling slightly more stable, but for some reason I feel like I'm an absolute moron and can't function in these face to face interviews anymore. I feel stuck. I feel unqualified to be considered a Network IT. My last interview, he vaguely asked questions that anyone could make mistakes on, but yet I feel like the dumbass.

I've lost all interest in the majority of my hobbies again and the hobby I do want to participate in comes at a financially immature cost. I typically build entry level cars for enthusiasts to be able to get into the car community, to have some fun, and for them to enjoy, while also making a tiny bit of profit. Usually not much. But I can't. I decided to settle on a car, after owning about 55 other cars in the past 8 years. I've settled on it and want to work on it for myself but I'm so picky that it comes with a massive price tag I feel financially uncomfortable with doing. So I'm left with no hobbies. It's not that I can't afford it. It's just that we just moved and I feel like indulging in that specific hobby is a setup for failure since I tend to ""go big or go home"" with these projects. Plus, I'm not sure my girlfriend would feel comfortable with me spending $6-8,000 USD on modifications on a car I technically don't own. I financed it, and it's my first financed car at 26... and I'm obviously behind everyone else.

I expected moving back, after keeping in touch with friends, that I'd have a sense of friendliness around me but I was met with disinterested inquiries about me coming back. I feel hurt by that. I lost my friends purely because I wasn't around for 2 years due to moving in the hopes of furthering my career past barely livable. I achieved one thing and lost another.

I've always been an unfocused individual who struggles with paying attention to anything besides things I'm heavily invested in. So that's coming back to bite me in the ass, since I have literally spent the past 3 weeks laying on our futon or in bed not moving. I feel anxious and don't want to go to get groceries. I don't want to walk our dog but I do. I just generally don't want to do anything. I can't even convince myself to play video games. I put on shitty shows on Netflix I have zero interest in, and just sit on tiktok and get paid to do it since I'm remote. I feel like I'm losing myself again.

My girlfriend, bless her fucking heart, has been putting up with me. I've still been doing chores and whatnot, but anything past bare minimum, I haven't been giving. I feel like such an utter piece of shit. I feel worthless. My stress levels are so fucking high I've resorted to smoking almost 2 packs of cigarettes a day. I've never in my life smoked so much. At most, maybe a pack. Now, 2.

I don't know what to do. I feel so fucking lost. I'm happy we moved but riddled with guilt. I feel like I've lost who I was again. This isn't the first time this has happened and maybe not the last. But God, I fucking wish I knew what to do.",21Sep2020,1

1078,"Due to schooling and covid, my social interactions have dwindled down to next to none. I moved almost 200 miles from home for nursing school in August following a summer of a an extremely messy break up. So with those factors and the sometimes overwhelming amount of work from school, I‚Äôve been spiraling down, developing toxic mind set (like worrying extremely when people don‚Äôt reply sometimes, prioritizing things that are not important when I have more pressing issues, getting discouraged by negative things extremely easily, etc). I have good friends that check up on me over text and discord and they mean the world to me, but it doesn‚Äôt fill up the same need for the in-person/physical interactions with people. 
I also am extremely shy and nervous about beginning/starting new bonds/interactions with people. Like part of me wants to but another part of me is uninterested due to nerves/wanting my friends. 
What could I do to help cope with this loneliness?

TL;DR: I am very lonely due to distance, school, and covid, but I‚Äôm also I‚Äôm shy/uninterested in making new friends. What can I do?",21Sep2020,1
1079,"23M, always dreamed of flying planes for a living but wasn‚Äôt born into a family that had a lot of money (single parent, 2nd generation immigrant). Applied for scholarships and bursaries my whole life but never got awarded one, applied for University Air Force scheme while doing my degree and didn‚Äôt even make it through the selection process (which a majority of people make it through to at least interview stage). 
I also might have an inherited condition that will make me sick for the rest of my life and medically be unfit to fly. 

I‚Äôve got everything stacked against me, no financial support, I can‚Äôt get financial aid, can‚Äôt join the military and even if I was trained I‚Äôd never make it through the interviews or aptitude testing. Literally everyone else my age is able to get some sort of scholarship or bursary or even get through selection processes but I just am not good enough to pass the tests. 

I hate the fact that the only thing I‚Äôve wanted to do in my life I‚Äôm just bad at. I‚Äôm so depressed about it which sounds ridiculous and that makes me feel even worse. 

What should I do? Is it time to give up and accept that I‚Äôm not good enough, won‚Äôt ever be able to make it and try and find a different career? If so, what can I do that‚Äôs not being a pilot but doesn‚Äôt require a lot of aptitude or intelligence?",21Sep2020,1
1080,"The title summarises it all quite well but in an effort to expand: I'm 23 and graduated in January with a Masters in Media having seen the success of a lot of my peers at undergraduate with getting jobs, I felt okay about my prospects. Obviously the world has changed a lot since then and I am one of the many who have ended up stuck in a part time, dead end retail job that was labelled as essential in the UK. 

This year has really had me pushed to my mental limits, I've felt so overwhelmed, anxious, depressed and under accomplished since graduating. To a lot of people, my job isn't essential and was able to remain open on a technicality. (I know it sounds like I'm ungrateful for even having a job during a recession). Customers shouting in my face, refusing to wear masks and failing to follow basic safety requirements for our shop has made me extremely anxious and scared of the public.

Last year, my first and only girlfriend broke up with me and despite being nearly two years on from that, I still miss her like crazy. Even after the horrible break up and tremendous stress following it. I miss sharing the ups and downs of life with her and the pandemic has only exasperated that feeling. 

As a recent graduate, I have also reached a point in my life where my friends are all moving on with their lives, going off to careers related to their jobs, settling down with a partner and getting places of their own, meanwhile I'm stuck here with my parents. Feeling alone and isolated despite seeing people on a near daily basis.

I just can't see myself getting out of the rut any time soon and I really need help.",21Sep2020,1
1081,"I‚Äôve been thinking a lot lately about if I should enter a college or a university, my case is this: 
I want to study psychology and do that as a therapist in my full job, but aside from that i want to own a business like a pool hall or maybe buy houses to rent for more income, so if I want to do that both things when I grow up which is best to get the best preparation?",21Sep2020,1
