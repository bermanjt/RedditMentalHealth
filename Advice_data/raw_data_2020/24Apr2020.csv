1,"More info: I've never had a phone (with service) before because my mom is unemployed and we can't afford it. Now that I'm 18, I can work and am planning to buy a phone before September. Basically, I have no clue what to do and am needing advice. I don't want to get ripped off and I want reliable service since I'm attending college where coverage can be a bit spotty (due to hills/redwoods).

2,"With everything that's going on I've had worries about money but they were managable as I had a second job lined up and just needed to do a dbs check and stuff to get it. I did it yesterday however now I'm scared that it will be rejected because of addresses (I forgot one as I genuinly don't know it, I only lived there for one month) and this would mean I don't get the job and I don't know if I could apply for any others there.

In addition to this that job is writing to my current job abiut something (I'm assuming a reference) and I'm nervous this could cause issues there if I end up jot getting the job. I really can't afford to have less money right now, I'm surviving off under £20 a week for all food and toiletries and I'm so scared about losing those jobs and just be screwed. Could this happen? What do I do if i lose them? Please help me not be obscenely stressed about this",24Apr2020,1
3,"I work for a small company with around 60 employees and business isn’t doing well. We are  majoritively contracted out to a larger company and they are no longer needing our services, people are being laid off left and right. As of this week my company started paying our full health insurance premiums and I’m just trying to understand why? I have a feeling I will soon no longer be needed for the company we are contracted to and the company I work for knows this. So what I’m wondering why they would start paying my health insurance premiums out of the blue. What do they benefit? They don’t really have the best reputation for philanthropy, so I’m just trying to figure out how they’re gonna try to screw me. Any input would be appreciated.",24Apr2020,1
4,"Hi guys, I know this is a bit odd, but I am getting different bits of advice from my family and I thought I’d ask indifferent internet strangers for advice. 

So I am currently trying to get back into school. I havenMt paid my dues, but I am geared for online courses starting in June. I have about two years, maybe two and half years, of coursework to complete to obtain my degree in CIS. The issue I am having is whether or not I should wait, and why I should wait. I’ve got some of my family saying it would be stupid to attend college right now. I realize the virus is going to be around for a good while, and will make it difficult or impossible to go to lecture classes when I have lecture classes. But to me, the longer I wait to go back, the longer I’ll be stuck doing jobs I hate. I have a decent job now but it’s been in decline for ages, and honestly I took the job knowing I’d get back in school, but there is a ton of forced overtime. I was in the process of job hunting when the virus dropped, so for now I’m kind of stuck. But I can do coursework online. So, what would you guys do? Should I just wait out the virus(and who knows when or if it will end) or just start making progress toward something that could improve my life? I feel like even if I can take tiny steps toward the degree it would be nice.",24Apr2020,1

6,"I have a weird situation. I’ve been looking for a small dog to join my household for a little bit and I got in contact with someone claiming to have a puppy for pretty cheap. 

This person never asked for any money up front, instead saying to bring the money when I pick up the puppy.

They stated the puppy will come with a small pack of supplies for free and told me what her favorite / current brand of food is.

They have told me they gave the dog a name and what it is.

They have stated they currently don’t have possession of the dog until April 30th because their sister has it.

They claim the dog hasn’t gotten any vetting yet but I can pay them to take her to the vet or do it myself. I told them I’d take the puppy to the vet myself and they said it was fine.

The only picture of the puppy is a picture of a picture. They stated this is because the sister has her currently. I reverse google searched the image nothing came up.

The dog doesn’t fully look like the breed it should be, but she still looks like a small dog. I cannot fully say if the picture is misleading or not.

I feel somewhat iffy, it seems legit and they haven’t asked for any money. Their grammar is bad but at first I chalked it up to possibly not being tech savvy.

Should I be suspicious?",24Apr2020,1

8,"Long story short, our lovely landlord decided to show the house we are renting during a global pandemic. I took an audio recording of their time here. There were 4 people in their group.  They didn't use any PPE (mask, or anything) and didn't take their shoes off. I had to ask them to use the hand sanitizer before entering. If I get sick, what should I do?",24Apr2020,1
9,"I don't know what I feel. Sorry this is long. 

My sister inherited our childhood home.

She just sold it 

At the time I supported her getting the house because she lived with my parents and she had a lot of issues.

My parents were sick and she helped them out with care of the home and yards..

She didn't take really good care of my parents. She moved in after being released from prison and my mom hoped to help her kick her drug addiction.

For seven years she seemed to be living pretty clean. My mom and she were not close, but they became so.

I moved down the street to help out, moved back close by. It affected my marriage and put a lot on hold for me, I was just starting out on my twenties and thirties. 

My sister was back on drugs by the time our mom died and was trying to get more money from our mom before she died.

We thought it could be because my sister never had much and it was a survival move, like worried about her future after mom died kind of thing. She had only street hustled most of her life and lost jobs because of theft and drinking. I used to help her apply for jobs and she would get them but lose them because she would eventually give in to her nature that crime pays.

She was like a pirate living in the wrong time period, very charismatic, very street smart. She knew some scary people.

It was like a different world from the one I walked in.

I would go over and she would be like the wild west guns in drawers.

She brought over some unsavory people and I would fight them and tell them to leave.

My parents and I were super close. It was just the three of us for years after all my siblings left and moved away for years.

There are five siblings, it was just my sister and I back home trying to care for our parents in the end.

I think she tried to take good care, but she was too messed up herself to really properly care for anyone.

She had two sons who were adults and when they were kids she was a horrible mom, very self focused and neglectful. Her kids were raised by others as she was in and out of jail,running with gangs.

In the end, the boys came to live with her and my mom,they were men by then, and one died of an overdose and the other died running from police.

It broke my heart and then my heart broke for her

My parents were lawful people, always working hard to give us all a good life. I went to college and got an advanced degree. I am the youngest, an accidental baby, born decades after the other four, so I saw a lot of drama from them growing up. They put my parents through a lot.  Most of my siblings all had addiction issues, all had drama.

My mom passed away and there was discussion that my sister gave her pills that she wasn't supposed to have. That it was planned in a way.

I can't believe that. We had social services and law enforcement involved, but before she died my mom said she took the pills herself, since she was competent they dropped the investigation.

Two weeks later after returning home, my mom was dead.

My sister called me after she died this time. 

My sister and I had a huge fight at the funeral because she had her dealer living in the drive way of my parents home and he came to the funeral and played his stupid guitar like he was someone. 

It was so bad the clergy threatened to walk if we kept arguing before the service, so we stopped. 

We went through some of my parents things and then I moved away, far away.

The estate was settled years later. 

My sister had my mom change the will and name her executor.

I didn't care I was never the one my mom would trust with anything for some reason anyway, like my mom had this weird idea that I would always be okay, that's what she told me, that the others needed more help.

My sister just sold the house. I expected that, but it still saddened me that it was all really final.

She received almost half a million and bought my dream property to live out her days. She has three years of income left to live on. She is on heroin again. 

I called her at Christmas. I call once a year. She never calls me or reaches out to my kids, though they are young and she was close to them.

It hurts. The whole thing. I feel disgusted my parents' hard earned money is going into her arm, to be shot up into nothing. They went without and lived frugally to save up for a solid life after retirement they never saw. I feel bitter that I sit in an apartment here with no yard and she is there living on acres of land she shares now with her dealer and other druggie friends. I never want to be her I know that, I pity her for being how she is, I feel like there is good in her somewhere and I can't bring myself to hate her. I feel really sorry for her because she lost her sons. I wonder sometimes if she is lacking in the ability to really care about others because of how she was wired. I think she can't help that part. It's how she was born, a sociopath. I have so many feelings.  I feel like my parents would have preferred that my kids and my other siblings kids received that money to go to college on or whatever.

I still have so much debt in student loans. I received a small inheritance sum, nothing close to what she received. It made me feel like okay the house was my mom's to do as she wished, it is none of my business who she left it to, but on some level I feel confused and hurt as to why I am struggling and my sister is living ease now and just squandering everything on her addiction. 

I don't envy that, but I feel like the cards were dealt in a very unexpected way. I feel like I should just focus on the fact that I am healthy and my parents gave me a lot that was not money, that enabled me to be strong and carve out my own way in this life. 

My other siblings day she killed our parents and profited off of it, they no longer speak to her.

I don't think she killed our parents,I think she was negligent, I think she was not capable of taking good care of anyone.

I feel like the others dumped everything on her and me to handle and went on with their lives while we were experiencing very hard things, it was just she and I dealing with our parents getting super sick, trying to help them. 

I know she did try. 

I saw how the others moved away and were just like never offering to switch their lives around to care for our parents. They put our mom back with her after the hospital, thinking that my sister gave her pills, they did that instead of asking mom to live with them.

I was trying to work full time as a teacher, visit my parents enough, help out, I had two babies. The house was filled with cigarette smoke. One time my baby picked a pill up on the floor. I had to stop breast feeding abruptly because one time I walked in and there was meth on the house.

I couldn't make my mom eat to live let alone move or get into a different situation. 

I lived in a 600 square foot studio in a very scary area just to be close to them. It was all I could afford there. My marriage was neglected as I tried to juggle everything.  I rode a bike to work when my car broke down because I couldn't afford to replace it. My mom would buy cars for my sister and my nieces and stuff but be okay with me biking into very bad places. 

I don't know why, but it still bothers me.

One time my sister and my mom called up my landlord and pretended to be my neighbors to try to get me evicted.

They were mad because I couldn't go over and take care of my dad because I had to go to work.

So many feelings.

I felt really powerless a lot of times when my parents were alive, like my mom was really stubborn and never listened to me, wouldn't let me help as much to care for her or my dad. It was a struggle a lot to try to help, to be there.

It was weird. 

I miss my parents.

10,"My family and I have been quarantining in order to be able to safely see my parents. 

Earlier this week, I found something that feels like a lump in my breast and I’m going to get a sonogram tomorrow. I do not want to tell my parents about this because hopefully it will be nothing of concern and I don’t want to worry them. 

I know my mom will get very anxious about it. 

However, going to get the sonogram means breaking my quarantine. I feel like my parents should know about it so that they can make an informed decision about whether they are comfortable seeing me and my family.

We are supposed to be spending the weekend with them so I need to make this decision soon.

14,"Hi everyone, this is something I have been struggling with for years. I'm 25 years old living with my parents and it has been constant hell and emotional/physical abuse since I was born. My parents constantly fight so its screaming in my house everyday. Even hearing their movements in the house makes me so anxious and feeling at unrest. The main issue is my mom thinks my dad has been cheating on her for about a decade now with no solid proof that I know of. So if anything goes missing in the house ill be interrogated because she is worried my dad takes these items to give to his so called ""girlfriend"". Even things as simple as food that I ate. I would have moved out years ago by now but the my main concern is I'm worried about their health and mental sanity as well if I leave them both. It would be really difficult if I left them because I still love them, but living at home has made me extremely depressed. Whenever I leave the house for anything, I dread coming back, but I feel so much guilt for leaving them by themselves. I am their youngest and last child. I feel like they have some kind of hold over me to live with them until they die or I get married. I can afford to move out but I would be struggling and living in a poorer area.

17,"Mine has it and whenever her mood and emotionally abused me quite frequently a lot in the past. Even the smallest thing ticks her off and makes her mad sometimes her mood swing so much one minute shes angry and yelling the next shes calm.

So I drive with either my mom or dad (I only have a permit) and my mom gets very impatient with driving and yells easily so I asked her to please not raise her voice when I'm driving because it stresses me. 

She took it very personally and accused me of trying to shut her up and as we were driving we approached a yellow light and my heart started racing and I asked what to do but she said that since ""I didn't need her help"" then she will not say anything and I ended up driving through a red light as it changed from red to yellow.

in retrospect, this was pretyy trivial but my mind was racing and she kept yelling which fucked up my train of thought and I was angry at her for this and called her bipolar because she got mad over a reasonable request and when we came home she started screaming at the top of her lungs and crying and saying shit like how I keep misbehaving.

Later on when I was helping my brother with something in the workroom she pushed me out of the way so I said ""Hey, don't touch me"" which made her mad and she took my phone and when I said give it back she says ""it's not yours"" and I started breathing heavily because I got mad and then she pushed me towards her room insulting me.

At this point, I just started bawling and screaming like a banshee (Cannot emphasize how loud it was) and starting scratching my face/pulling hair which made her mad. She said 1. I was putting on a show and 2. She had it worse than me so I should stop whining. I went off on her and told her to die which hurt her feelings now she won't talk to me.

I went to college for the first semester Fall 2019. When I got to school I flourished to say the least. I had a good group of friends, was positive about a lot of things I had never been positive about, and was doing really well academically. It took visiting home to know I was doing so well because I finally escaped all the emotional pressure my family, specifically my mother, put on me. 

This wasn't a problem for the most part, as I only came home a couple weekends. Winter break was rough, but coming home after quarantine has been a completely different story. I feel worse than I have in months, been incredibly depressed, and have no idea how to navigate my relationship with my mother. 

Recently, she has been accusing me of 'changing' since I went to school. She says I've become a b\*tch, and am causing the family more stress. I have no idea how to handle this or how I can continue living here for the rest of the summer, and potentially next fall.

There was also a time that my parents made me stop hanging out with boys (even cousins) and I didn't know why.

So i found this out by my sister. She thought I knew, but i have a horrible memory from when i was 5. She told me that, when I was younger, my brother's friend would come over and he would ask me to sit on his lap. My family thought nothing of it until they found out that he was touching my underwear. He was also double my age at the time.

21,"I have a pretty good life, but one thing I can’t ever do is talk honestly to my mom or sister. My mom has a very short temper, she’s pretty self absorbed, she doesn’t respect my opinions, and she often gets very emotional. My sister isn’t’t mean to me, but she doesn’t respect me. Any time I was honest about my feelings with her she would get very upset about it and tell my mom. It’s happened twice and now I’m scared to be honest with her. She’s very intelligent but her emotions often get the better of her, so many of our more serious conversations end up with her crying at the end. My dad is honestly great and I feel really bad that he ended up with a bunch of shitty people for a family. 

I also know that I’m not perfect. I’m very blunt, I’m horrible at reading a situation, I’m horrible with emotions, I’m bad at dealing with other people’s emotions, and I’m also pretty stubborn. 

We (my sister, my mom, and me) recently had an argument. Basically my sister wanted to download Hulu on my ps4, but I didn’t want her to do that. We have a room dedicated to watching movies and tv, but for some reason she wanted to use the room the ps4 is in. Long story short, I lost the argument. What I was really surprised to learn was that no one was on my side. Am I in the wrong? I know I can be an asshole but I felt like I was being reasonable until my mom stared yelling. 

That’s only one example of an argument between us. Every time I get into an argument with my family I always feel so alienated. My dad is on my side sometimes, but he tries to stay neutral if he can. But nowadays it feels like even he’s against me sometimes. That’s the main reason I feel like I must be in the wrong, because my dad is such a great guy and even he’s against me. Basically I just want to know if I’m in the wrong and what I can do to better.

23,"
So I’m 22 years of age and I used to have an amazing bond with my mother, at the age of 7 (or 6) my mother met what I used to call “step father” so anyways, ever since she met him my life just went down hill, they would constantly drink and I would look after my siblings who were only babies at the age of like 10 I watched my baby sister who was 1 at the time while they would go out clubbing and also my other younger sister who was 5, as the years grew on they had more kids and I ended up being a second parent. So anyways I grew a tight bond with my siblings from then on as I was always their main carer, after they stopped drinking as I begged them for so many years as I was honestly failing at school, they stopped drinking when I was 14, and then moved on to using Meth! I still was a second parent I honestly tried to run away so many times but the fear of something happening to my siblings always brought me back home, so they got worse and worse on the drugs and I finally met someone who took me away from all the mess but I was still part time caring for my siblings. Anyways they would call me crying (the eldest of them was 16) and she would always cry and got to the point she wanted to kill herself as she was trying to succeed in school and they did the exact same to her, left her for hours on end with the children going who knows where all day and most nights, I pled with them for so long to get off the drugs and then I had my own children, so I started to notice my step father wasn’t looking at us as his step children anymore it was more of a deviate look, he would check us out I caught him staring at my boobs more then a million times. One time he got drunk and so did I, long story short he told me to go down the beach with him to have sex! I felt so violated I was so afraid to go to sleep that night it completely sobered me up after he said that and I was afraid to tell my mother as we were already having trouble with our relationship together she would accuse me of sleeping with him and everything. So anyways after that happened I didn’t end up telling her until I was 22 years of age and I gave her an option to either leave him (because I was sick and tired of him and all the drama he caused) or to never speak to me again. So anyways she’s lied to me my whole life and told me “she was leaving him” but she never until he decided that he wanted to get drunk and talk shit about her. And my mother has never been there to protect us, my younger sister got molested by his younger brother and she did nothing, I can’t believe she wouldn’t leave him until it was convenient for her not because of what he tried to do to me? And I’ve put up with her bullshit for so long I’m just tired of it, I literally can’t stand her every time I think about her I just feel anger and hatred because she’s never been there for us, she literally chose him over me and my siblings, she did not care about us one bit only herself and her partner, and now she has finally broken up with him after 10 or 11 years or so, and now she thinks it’s ok to just come back into my life and act like nothing ever happened? There’s more to the story but it’s way too long to put into this post, I’m just asking, what should I do? Why do I feel so angry? I can’t forgive her like all of my other siblings have, I just can’t get over the fact she chose a man over her own biological children? Someone who literally treated her like shit? I honestly can’t even talk to her anymore all I can do is say Hi and bye, but I honestly think she would be better off dead then in my life. Our bond has been crushed and I’ll never be able to look at her the same way ever again, I also forgot to mention she caught him spying on my little sisters while they were in the bath and still did not say or do anything. I just need advice I don’t even really know what I’m looking for, how do I bring it up to her when she never lets me speak or talk about things and she just turns it into an argument and makes me look like I’m the bad person, do I just get rid of her once and for all? I only talk to her because she’s my children’s grandmother, but I honestly don’t want shit to do with her to be honest..",24Apr2020,1

26," After being in love with a man (30,M) and knowing him for 7 years and him repeatedly letting me down, making me feel like crap and never returning much feeling at all, I (26,F) finally decided to cut him out of my life for good. 

It's been immensely hard processing all this weirdness that has happened. He never treats anyone else like he treats me - from what I've seen and heard he is a fantastic friend and partner. But to me, he is an asshole for no reason a lot of the time. We'll call him T.

We were once incredibly close speaking every single day. He was once awesome - we would check in with each other regularly and have a good laugh.

Then for many years after that he used my life as a revolving door. Ghosting me, then coming back like nothing had happened. He would say I would love this and this around the city, I suggest we hang out sometime and he always immediately shoots it down stating his girlfriend wouldn't like us hanging out. Someone I didn't even know existed.

Occasionally over the years he would be a total ass to me for no reason. 

He invited me out for drinks and then spent the entire evening throwing ice cubes at me while I spoke to his friend. He told me I wasn't good enough for any of his friends. He told me we might as well delete each others numbers as he won't ever hang out with me again due to my past feelings (making me feel terrible for how I felt for him). When I told him my ex cheated on me, he laughed. He made a point to remind me that he forgot important details about me (like the fact I'm half British) despite us having extensive conversations about this. Yet he was the one that kept re-establishing contact.

T is aware of my feelings and 3 years ago and he rejected me so I cut contact. The following year, he continued to pop back up into my life. Last year for no reason he blocked me on Snapchat (we weren't even talking at the time).

Recently he again came out of the woodwork after 8 months no contact.

This time he called me telling me our mutual friend had passed away. He rang me hours before the funeral. I had no idea she had committed suicide 3 weeks prior (her family kept it private).

The phone call was very casual and aloof. T spent the entire phone call talking about his errands in the bank, his recent trip, him seeing his family later. Never asked how I was. Never asked if I was okay.

When I asked for a follow up call as I was in shock, T became indifferent again and unresponsive. He said he would call me back. He didn't. He ignored my messages while online speaking to someone else. I however offered to call him if he needed someone to listen. He left me on read and went to sleep. Great.

I was asking for some sort of comfort and answers to my questions during the stage of shock when he was ready, and he snapped at me saying he is busy. Uhh? He was the one that re-established contact?

I have no idea why he took it upon himself to be the person to tell me this? He could have easily notified a friend to pass on a message. He wasn't looking to bond or for sympathy.

After our call, I then found out via a mutual friend that at the wake T said him and I have never had any sort of friendship and that's why he didn't invite me. I couldn't believe how hurtful this was, even from him.

I'll never understand how someone I've known for 7 years can be so indifferent even when telling me something so traumatic and heavy. He told me he has looking after everyone else, yet here he was landing this news on me like it wasn't a big deal and not even asking if I'm okay. Why am I singled out consistently?

From my knowledge, he doesn't treat anyone else like this. He is extremely generous and loving towards his girlfriends - taking them on trips around the world and to first class dinners. He is great towards his friends. Yet he treats me like a total afterthought despite knowing each other for almost our entire 20s.

Even when I asked to cut ties and for his thoughts on closing the door, he read and ignored my message.

Now during this lockdown with very little to do, it's making me feel miserable and I'm ruminating. How do I move on from someone who never cared about me?

A couple of years ago, I (now 15F) got an abridged version of the Bible (it was only the New Testament) at the state fair. I began my descent into fundamentalism, self-hatred, etc. Even after I stopped my fundamentalist bigotry, my relationship with Christianity still damaged my mental health. Eventually, I stopped caring as much, and realized I only believed because it was how I was raised. Nowadays, I consider myself atheist/agnostic.


I found the old Bible a few weeks ago while cleaning my room a little. My first reaction was anger and fear. I wanted catharsis. I wanted to destroy it...and then I realized the implications of destroying a holy book.


My parents don't know that I'm no longer religious. I don't know how they would react if I told them. So I can't really ask them if they want it or know anyone who might.

I’ve know this elderly woman for a year and a half and she’s honestly one of my best friends. Now half a year ago I moved away from my neighborhood (only 10 minutes away) and kinda lost contact with her we texted for a little after the move but we haven’t spoken since mid December. 

It sucks that I couldn’t make time for her after the move and I terribly regret it now so I contacted her again Monday and Tuesday, however it reads that she hasn’t read my messages.

Today I called her and it went straight to voicemail, and I’m worried more then ever that something happened to her. She got a new phone in May 2019 so I doubt it’s a new phone, and it’s unlike her to miss a call or text.

She’s one of those people that doesn’t let age affect her life and spends most hours of the day in her giant garden so I texted when I thought she would be out (breakfast and later at night).

I’m so worried about her since she’s one of the most influential people in my life and I don’t think I could bear hearing any bad news about something happening to her, I’m really afraid and need some advice right now.",24Apr2020,1
30,"So for context I'd been seeing my partner for about 2 months when this happened, we'd had sex without condoms before.

I hadn't slept in 35 hours, and she came over after work.
We went to bed, and right before I passed out we started kissing.
I went down on her for a while and then came up to kiss her.
She said something along the lines of ""get the condom"" and I kept kissing her and playing with her.
She was receptive and from my perspective was enjoying it even as I got my cock closer and closer to her..
I then penetrated her (without putting a condom on) and we started having sex, she seemed into it but a couple minutes in I asked if she wanted me to put a condom on and she told me to just pull out..
We kept going she seemed to enioy it, so did I.
We fell asleep cuddling.
The next day she tells me she doesn't want to see me again.
That she has to deal with the consequences and get the morning after pill.
That I put my pleasure above her.
That I don't care about her.
But I care about her a lot, we'd hang out all the time without having sex.
I know she's had abuse happen in the past.
I was tired but I just assumed it was going to be one of those ""taboo"" times she didn't make an effort to stop me or say ""stop"" or ""no""
She says she can never trust me anymore and since she's blocked me everywhere.
I know I'm not in the right and we should be using condoms anyway.
But I just feel like it's not worth throwing this whole connection we've found away?
I don't know if it will ever be possible to change her mind but if anyone has been through something similar I would really like advice because I just feel like I've sexually assualted someone I really care about.

36," I've posted this on many subreddits hoping for a response

I am a 16 y/o male, and for as long as I can remember I never cared much about anyone. There isnt a single person on earth that I can say for sure that I care about. My father suffers from bipolar disorder, and is generally a massive asshole. He is verbally abusive to me, my mother and my brother (has called me a freak, told my mother to kill herself on several occasions etc) and has distanced himself from most of his friends. My brother is a socially awkward mess, and my mother is a generally nice, but very naive person. I spend most of my time either programming or smoking weed. I have a pretty large friend group, and although I don't care for them much, they get good weed and are pretty good rollers, so I spend most of my free time with them. As far as family and friends go it wouldn't bother me if any of them were to pass away. (although i'd find it annoying to have to find a better roller). I've been in a few relationships in my life, but I find girlfriends pretty annoying so I've been single for a while.

When I was young I remember not quite fitting in with everyone else, I preferred talking to adults when I was younger, and for years I didn't seem to fit in. I'd always accidentally offend people without realising how, and I was in general a bit of a weird kid. Until I learnt how to put a mask on. I started learning how people acted in situations and mimicking their behaviour and mannerisms, that way I started making more friends, and over time became more and more popular (I was even voted prom king for some stupid reason). And although this has fixed my social problems, I still felt empty inside. So I started talking to people online (mostly discord), a social network where I can be myself, which did help a bit with the emptiness, but now it's starting to feel like I have 2 personalities (an online one and a real life one). I just wish I could put a name to the problems I am experiencing and find a way to fix it. I have thought about going to a psychologist, but I don't know if that would help at all.

I've told my mother countless times about how I don't like him and he keeps making me get in trouble for no reason, but she never listens. She always defends him and takes his side. In fact, I get in trouble not liking him.  Not to mention that he will stand at the end of the stairs and try to listen to me and my friend talking, and he claims that I have no right to privacy. My mom agrees with him on almost everything he says and/or does. This is basically what I told them all, except I told the school about my past issues to give them a better understanding.

Through all this I tried to keep my distance and mind my own business as much as possible. Of course i'm not perfect, and I admit that lashed out at them from time-to-time. However I was quiet and kept to myself a lot. Hell I didn't even cause problems with anyone at school and got good grades.

More Context On Why I Don't Like My Mom's BF

To recap, my mom's bf is emotionally + verbally abusive, manipulative, lies a lot, tries to snoop on my conversations, goes through my things, and punishes me for no reason. Obviously I really don't like the guy. He's said things like "" You know that guy's don't like fat girls, right?"" (He doesn't know but I think i'm lesbian but, it still hurts. Also i'm 124lbs, I don't think that's bad), "" I can't wait til you move out and you have three kids that you can't take care of, then your going to wish that you respected us more."" and, "" Your a loser! No wonder nobody likes you! I don't even really like you!"", those are just three examples. He has said these things in front of my mom too but she only ever agreed with him or pretended that she didn't hear it. Also he's made up tons of lies to get me in trouble for not reason. For example, one time the remote for their TV's batteries went missing and he screamed at me because, he though I did. When I tried to tell him that I didn't do it, he would scream louder to drown me out and start talking that second I would open my mouth, while claiming I was guilty because I wasn't saying anything. Eventually my mom remembered that she took them for something, he just shut up. When I asked for an apology he told me that "" I don't owe you an apology, especially not to a  dumb kid."" Thought whenever he does something for me, no matter how small, I have to act like he's god. Another thing to mention that, he'd walk up to the other kid's from my school and start lying about how terrible I was. There's more but this is only a small percent of arguments we had that either wasn't my fault or he just didn't want to admit that he did something and blames me for it instead. One more things to end this giant paragraph, he constantly makes fun of mental health issues and berated me for the one time I tried to be open with them about my mental state. As you already know, my mom didn't care.

Context On Why I'm Starting To Really Dislike My Mom

Some of my issues are about when I was growing up. Luckily we lived with the rest of my small family ( I don't have a dad btw) so I was at least taken care of by then. She was neglectful in almost every way ( She at least feeds me), verbally + emotionally + sometimes physically abusive, likes to guilt-trip, manipulative and makes everything about herself. She tells me that she has depression and that she's upset all the time but, whenever I try to tell her about how I think that I think I might have depression, anxiety and maybe some level of ptsd, she lashes out and say that ""I'm only a kid so I have nothing to worry about"" (I think what I've gone through might beg to differ. I don't really feel like writing out my whole life story so, i'll just say that I've lost people permanently, been bullied my whole life by friends + teachers + family, and struggle with thinking positively about myself. She knows most of it) . Two years ago when I tried to talk about it, she straight up ignored me for a week until she forgot. When I was very young, she would always be out with boyfriend's and never really paid any attention to me, hell I can't even remember one time she actually played with me. Whenever when me and another kid would get into fight's, she'd only hear there side of the story and punish me. I didn't matter if I actually started it or not. This is all the early stuff.

There's still more to the story, this was when something big happened in my life that caused my family to change. By this time, it only ended up being my mom, my uncle and me living together. My uncle wasn't very happy and general, he only ever called me names but was somehow was around way more then my mom was. I've forgiven him since he has changed, and I feel like it's unfair to hold him to it, because he has apologized to me about it, though he's at least kinda decent. This was when my mom started to get really bad. Constantly taking everything out on me, yelling at me for small mistakes, threatening to get rid of me over small disagreements ( It happened a lot and still kinda does now), going out pretty much every night to the point where I might not see her for a whole month or two, getting in trouble for the few times I stayed up because I wanted to see her, got mad at me when I wanted to spend time with her, she was never satisfied with my grades, etc etc. I want you to keep in mind that I was 10-11 years old during this time.

School's Involvement In My Situation

This is about what's happening now. A few months ago, I opened up to one of my friends about the situation ( they only know about the stuff in the second  paragraph + that I've been bullied, though they don't know the people or what happened, they only know that I was) and they dragged me down to the school's CYW's, the very next day. Bit by bit I started to tell them about my situation, more and more over the last two months of 2019 and the first two in 2020. In the last month, they helped me keep in touch with a girl's home because, the CYW's and I believed that I needed to be away from my mom and her bf. I learned about their routines, rules and even went to see what the place was like for myself. So much time was spent agonizing and crying over how I was going to leave, what happened when I did, I knew I was going to lose everything but felt like it was for the best. Then when the day finally came and I told my mom. She was so angry and was upset. Saying that I had no regards for her feelings and that I was being dramatic. I was trying to tell her that this was what I needed to do but, she kept telling me about how she was a good mom, she didn't know what she did wrong and that I was heartless.

I made it to school shortly after and was ready to go (The week before I was gradually starting to move my stuff out and into my locker). The Vice principle and one of the CYW's told me that I looked so much happier and said that they were proud of me. My mother was brought in shortly after to talk to with them, while I was in my first period class. I don't know what she said but she must of sugar-coated it a lot because, the Vice Principle was telling her that this was something that I needed to do and I was doing so that I could build a better relationship with her (the CYW wasn't with her and I forgot to mention that the other one was away). She was compliant until we went to go and talk to the girl's home lady.

She yelled at me and demanded to tell her what I told them. I decided to open up to her about it so, I told her about how her bf was treating me, how I felt unwanted and how I felt about how she treated me. Do you want to know what she said?

"" Animator, he's never said any of that to you! You know we love you so I don't understand why your doing this to us! I was always there for you, so I don't know why your making us the bad guys! You need to learn some respect!"".

I was shocked. I got so mad that I screamed that I have told her about all of this and that she was SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO HIM WHEN HE DID! It only got worse when we went to the place. The lady was angry at me for leaving so soon (she told me that they had a place ready for when I did so...). My mom and her talked for a bit until I was brought in. She told me that because I was unproblematic and quiet, she felt like there was no real reason for me to leave. When we left I felt so disappointed and upset. My mom proceeded to berate me and told me that I wasn't allowed to keep secrets anymore. We stopped by the school to pick up my stuff and I told the CYW I was going to be out of school for the rest of the day. He told me that the second I told him I wanted to leave, he would make sure I had a place stay and convince the lady that I absolutely had to go. At home my mom's bf said that he didn't know that he hurt me (I've asked him to stop and that I didn't like the things he said multiple times), that he was upset so upset that he wanted to throw himself off of a bridge. They said they would change and get help. My mom even said that she was willing to take me therapy. However, the very next day, my mom told me about how she wanted to kill herself and that I made her so much worse. Then she said that if I left she would.

Then the pandemic happened. I was in and out of school for that week because I felt so many conflicting emotions (My mom didn't want me to go to therapy either). The first week was fine but they must've got comfortable during quarantine because they are back on their bs. Though it's worse this time since, they are using what had happened against me. My mom keeps telling me that she hates me, her bf is doing the same shit however he just intensified it, they constantly guilt me about how selfish I was to leave them, and they keep telling me that i'm a horrible person who's lucky that they don't beat.

&amp;#x200B;

Final Thought's

That's where I want to end off. What they are doing now feels like blatant manipulation because they are telling me that they would kill themselves if I left. Once school opens again, I want to tell them that I need to go. My mental state feels worse with each day, i'm behind in my classes because I lack motivation and have a horrible sleep scheduled. For example, I can genuinely relate to Steven from Steven Universe Future and feel like my own mental health is a ticking time bomb. I doubt i'll turned into a monster but I can feel like a giant mental breakdown is getting closer with everyday. I fear that it might happen at school, and/or i'll do something that i'll seriously regret. I just don't want anyone to get hurt, if I have to then I want to be the one who will. Mostly everyone tells me that I need to keep them around because they are family, and that i'm a jerk if I don't. Though I truly feel like that's not an option anymore. I don't want to go No Contact when i'm older but I need to to get better. As I stated before, unfortunately, therapy isn't an option for me right now. They won't let me and they refuse to let me have a job anyways.

So can you please tell me your own thoughts on this? I'm sorry to ask for advice again but I just don't know what else to do. Am I just being over dramatic? or is it as serious as I think it is? and is it wrong if I leave them again, for real? or should I just try to suck it up for another year? and is it wrong for me to cut them off when I'm older?

Thank you listening and I apologize for any errors. Hope your all having a great day.

48,"Background: After 6 years of dating, my boyfriend (29m) and I (23f) broke up in May of last year after he cheated on me. We have been trying to work things out, talking off and on, so on and so on. 

This was until he mentioned a coworker had asked him out and he turned her down. I trusted that sentiment, until I asked for more information and he got suddenly very defensive. Turns out they’ve been talking for months and he had feelings for her. So we have completely cut off contact at this point. It’s been about 2 weeks.

FF to today: I’m trying to do my own thing, school and dealing with being laid off due to Corona. One of my classmates is suggesting what I can assume is a date. Nothing crazy, just grabbing sushi and going to his place since we can’t eat in the restaurant. Maybe a movie. 

I’m having difficulties if I should say yes or not. Part of me is waiting for my ex to come back around, part of me is saying he doesn’t deserve me and everything I’ve done for him, and the other other part of me is just scared to meet another man.

49,"Needless to say I’m in a relationship (me 20/her 21), and I have been for 10 months.
It’s the first real relationship I’ve been, only other experience I’ve had was a disastrous tinder date which I’m never trying again and a girl who was 4 years older that I met in college, I was desperate for any kind of affection and I’m still not sure what she wanted from me, probably just a casual sex buddy, in short, it lasted a month and I couldn’t care less.
This isn’t my girlfriend’s first real try at a relationship, I was a virgin when we met and she wasn’t, to be fair I don’t believe it matters but maybe it can set some kind of context.

I’m any case this quarantine and all has separated us for a month now and that I don’t spend almost every week with her it’s been making me think a bit more clearly and without this kind of love sickness I feel when I’m with her. 
I’ve been thinking, wether our “love” (can’t find a better word, it’s no so deep as love but not so shallow as just “like”) when we met was born out of a genuine desire to be with this person, if when I first felt like I really liked her, where those words really from my heart or was it my loneliness and libido speaking. 

I can’t tell if she really likes me either, we’ve never had a fight or clashes with each other, the only times we’ve had some sort of trouble we’re me speaking my mind and being thoughtless about her feelings like mentioning I would love to be only with her because I really loved the time we spent together but wondering what being in other relationships and having that experience would feel like, not like I would break up with her just for it or anything but regardless I hurt her feelings and still regret it every time I think about it.

Anyways, I do think our relationship is going pretty well in the sense that we enjoy each other’s company and we like over all the same things, but I want to wonder wether we are in love with each other or in love with the feeling of being with someone else.
From the bits and pieces she’s told me of her past relationships they haven’t been that great, one of her friends (an ex, actually) even said that “I’m glad you’ve finally found someone you’re happy with, considering what you’ve been through”, I told her i was happy to hear it, but also that it was a really bittersweet feeling.

I’m not sure if she loves me for who I am or because I’m the best option she’s gotten yet, and I’m not sure if I love her for who she truly is or because I’m in love with the thought of being with someone else and with this sense of responsibility that I have to protect her at all costs, that I want to encourage her to do the things she wants to do at all costs.

Do you guys have any ideas of how I can clear these doubts? Or wether I’m right, and this isn’t a genuine love after all.",24Apr2020,1

51,"So I'm a bit conflicted here and confused here.

I (F23) was in a toxic relationship for 3 years with my partner (F24) that ended in November 2019. During the relationship, I was incredibly depressed. I am a total people pleaser, I would do anything for anyone and go out of my way for others who would not do the same for me. I understand this behaviour is due to the fact I did not love myself and I was trying to make people like me by always saying yes to any of their requests. 

Eventually I was taken advantage of multiple times and would be upset about it. I knew I was at my lowest point in life.

As time went by, for the last couple of months after my breakup I've become more satisfied with myself and got into self development. I am a lot happier with myself and have learned how to be comfortable on my own. I genuinely feel like I love myself and I have a lot of love to give. 

I now look at things differently and want to inspire the people around me. I now wake up at 6am to meditate, go on morning jogs, read books often, gain knowledge from watching ted talks, try to make more connections with my friends and family, cook for those I care about etc

Recently, I have noticed a lot more people would try hit on me, especially men as I am Bi. I would instantly tell them I'm not interested because I am not looking to date. I allow these guys to keep talking to me and I would constantly remind them they should not expect anything from me. My friends would say I'm too nice and approachable hence why they're still talking to me.

I bake a lot for my friends and family because I enjoy seeing people's faces light up as they have a taste of my baked goods. One of my friends have never thanked me for it but I made their favourite dessert knowing they like it. I remember my ex mentioning to me that I only bake for people because I want people to like me and get validation from them. So I'm questioning myself and thinking I only do this for other people's approval.

I generally give advice to a couple of people when they want someone to talk to and some people will not do the same back which I'm okay with. 

From my point of view now, regardless of how someone treats me I will always try to be kind/ I will not let the bad treatment get to me. I'm not mentally exhausted like I used to be being in my previous relationship or anything and I feel happy giving than taking.

But I do often question about my kindness and thinking it's too much because my friends would say I'm too nice and I shouldn't be because people will either take advantage of me or I am sending them the wrong message.

I need some help. Is this a bad thing? I feel quite happy with myself doing the things I do now but I question myself here and there.",24Apr2020,1
52,"Hello all, 

Long post ahead, I’m sorry. Recently I’ve found out my best friend of 8 years is pregnant. I want to be happy for her, but I’m just not. (Before you judge, please hear me out.)

As for everyone else, I have been effected by COVID-19 drastically. My fiancé lost his job, our undergrad graduation has been cancelled, our wedding/ honeymoon has been postponed (we’ve been planning it for over 2 years) and our first trip outside of the US has been cancelled. (Collectively I’ve waited about 4.5 years for all of this to come to fruition and now it’s all cancelled or postponed.) On top of all this my friend called me to let me know she’s pregnant. 

I’ve always longed to be a mom, to have life growing in my tummy and all the many things that come along with pregnancy. I promise you, if you can think about it, I’ve dreamed about it when it comes to motherhood. I’ve longed to be a mom for quite some time now... probably 4 years or so. And I’ve always been open about it with my fiancé (he has voiced his opinion and he isn’t ready for kids) and best friend because they’re my people. But, this news just broke me. I ugly sobbed for probably an hour or two. I was able to push away this longing because I had all this stuff to look forward to in 2020 (not the healthiest thing, I know.) I was finally going to get closure on so many big life events that I’ve been waiting so patiently for, for years. 

My best friend and I work together and this week has been awkward. I can’t look at her without getting a pit in my stomach. I haven’t even talked to her. If I did, I kept it work-related. She can obviously pick up that somethings up. I just don’t know how I can not feel so triggered by looking at her knowing she has something my soul has craved for. It’s literally gut-wrenching. How can I be okay or manage to get through this without feeling resentment towards my fiancé for not wanting kids? And my best friend getting the one thing I’d give up everything for? All on top of losing the one day every little girl dreams of. I’m regally sad. If you’re going to be mean, please don’t comment. Just looking for some advice as I’m grieving a lot of loss.",24Apr2020,1
53,"So basically I followed a guy last year through ig because I though he was cute, he followed me back, we limited our contact through seeing each other's stories and yesterday we finally chatted. It was 4AM and he then asked me to send nudes, and I don't mind because I'm confident enough to do it (I have already showed my body anonymously in internet) BUT I'm still hesitant. I don't have friends to talk about this because they know me as a shy and innocent person, and if I send him nudes via ig, is it going to be safe? Idk, I need advice lol",24Apr2020,1
54,"For context's sake, I don't know where I am on the political spectrum. I just know that I'm not far left or far right, though I get called the latter quite often.

The one thing about this pandemic and lockdown is that it has shown me in the sense of wisdom education, that people are breaking down into their real selves. They blindly trust authority. They will have complete disregard for people around them. They will turn on others, because of the new conditions of living we're all in right now. And I'm outside of the status quo of thinking for my own nation. I'm not priding myself on wanting to fit in and be a part of the crowd, but I wanted to be appreciated in my personal life and online life, for trying to find the truth of things. It's always something I got defensively aggressive, and arrogant over... Safe to say, despite my values, communicating my ideas and thoughts to others is not my strong point.

The contempt, you have to understand though, is not something just felt personally by me. Any attempts to break away from the indoctrination or to point it out when it's happening in real time, shows how people here love to judge you, and push you out of discourse altogether if they can. I am far from perfect, but I've never seen so many people lost in a way that I never could be. If I was to exaggerate a little, then while normal people would go along with things and look for that time when the world starts operating again, and try not to get too deep into subjects... Zealots would put people who break quarantine to death if they had the power to. Humanity, hates each other, underneath the propagandised messages and banner slogans of all being in this together, and to flatten the curve, and an artificial community only exists for those who buy into everything... Fears have just locked people into their baser selves.

I can't stand to look at the world, but it will be something I will have to contend with in the future, and not be overwhelmed by. The truth is not what I want it to be, it's what is objectively real, and sometimes purposefully buried away from people. In looking at this concept though, this value... I realise that even if I want to get those kinds of truths to very real matters in the world today, out there for people to see, no matter how good or bad a job I do... Some people will never change in their thinking. Being born from a Narc mother, and having my paternal influences in my life completely uninterested in all of these ideas.... Its done a number on me. So I thought myself better than Leftists, and took it out on them from time to time, despite obvious points where I couldn't stop myself from being something far worse at heart. Worse than even the dreaded Fascists they're so afraid of.

Coming out of the rage, I've recently felt the pressure, of this psychological flaw. It's like a person standing next to me, a personality that takes me over, that just wants to see everything that people placed their blind faith in to be destroyed. Whether it was a staunch Christian, or a progressive activist which in very verbal in opposing more than anyone, or a regular person that to me seems blind to worse dangers than this pandemic and refuses to talk about them out of fear... Anyone was fair game. I knew it, because this was how much this other side of me wanted to be right. And not for the sake of truth. But for its own glory, for its own revellings in the pain and despair of others.

All my understanding of the world, has not stopped the growth of this overriding aspect of myself. I know of the psychological shadow, but it appears I haven't integrated it at all... Despite even getting over the damage dealt by my Narc mother, I have to find a way to get my own peace. Because its not in the hands of anyone else. Its not to be found in Truth, or the wider world.",24Apr2020,1

58,"TW: sexual assault 



The one year anniversary of my sexual assault is approaching. It’s not a date I had memorized or was planning to acknowledge but I got an email today from crime victims compensation that included the date of the “incident” and now it’s burned in my head... June 17th. 

I still have the dress I was wearing that night. They took the underwear as evidence but they let me “keep” the dress. 

It’s hanging in my closet and I’ve never washed it. 

I don’t know what I’m supposed to do with it? It feels wrong to trash it or burn it like my boyfriend suggested. Maybe I’m not ready for that. A part of me wants to frame it and hang it up. I’m not even sure why I would want that, it sounds like I’m glorifying it or celebrating it but maybe it’s a reminder of what I’ve over come. Is that crazy? Maybe I should just leave it in the closet. 

Am I supposed to do something on that day? Ignore it all and try to get my mind off of it or have a big cry session? 

What would you do with it? What should I do on that day?",24Apr2020,1
60,"Okay so I'm a male and this might be a little long so I apologize in advance.

I guess my story starts a couple of years ago.
When I was sixteen my older sister got married when she was eighteen to her childhood crush and as you can imagine my parents were thrilled. They moved in with us shortly after because we were moving to an area near a university that her now husband was going to and it made sense that they stayed with us. A couple months later my sister got a job and now she's quite successful. The thing is life became very different after the wedding. The only thing my parents could talk about for years was my sister and how proud they were of her. When we went out that would be the number one topic. If I went into the lounge I would be told to leave because they were having a private conversation, it got to the point were I disliked going out because I could predict the conversation and honestly it hurt. I felt like I was an Alien in my own home and because of that I started avoiding my family. Now I'm not mad I understand completely she got married and has a successful job. It's every parents dream. it's just tough to accept I guess. When it came time to do my G.E.Ds I didn't pass. Not to say I didn't study for them. I did and I did quite well. I just never got round to taking the tests. My parents... Well they didn't take that well. Whenever someone asks they just answer that I did them. I think I'm a bit of disappointment honestly. Now my parents aren't wealthy. They've made it clear that they would never pay for me to university and if I want a G.E.D I have to now pay for myself. I got my learners license fine. But my parents didn't want to pay for a driving instructor and if I did I'd have to pay for my own one and my dad didn't want to teach me how to drive. So two years pass and now I don't even have a learners. My parents and I argue often. I often add fuel to the arguments I'm not going to lie. My Dad and I don't really get along. He's not a bad guy. It's just we are like the sun and moon. He believes that you must work and happiness is a side thing and overall respect is everything. I believe that happiness should be the ruling factor and that one should look for happiness in everyday things. And to be kind is something to strive for. My dad has pretty much told me I'm useless and that I just take up space..... Honestly that hurt like you have no idea. He said it in the heat of an argument but... Still. I'm no better I recently said he was an asshole and I feel really bad about it. I have apologized. But he hasn't.
He says I have no say in anything that happens in the house because it's his house and I don't add anything. If I want an opinion I must contribute or leave. And if I could leave I would. The problem is I would need a job and also. My dog. I've had him for years and I can't leave him. My dad isn't very fond of him. He just puts up with him because my Mom and I love him. I can't imagine leaving him because I raised him. I can't just leave. And even if I could I have nowhere to go. I really don't know what to do.
I'm not a negative person. In fact I always find stuff to be happy about. But on the very rare occasions I do get depressed. Well that why I'm writing this.
If anyone has any advice, or has had a simular situation. How did you get through it?

If you've read this far thanks. I really appreciate it.
I might delete this... I don't know.",24Apr2020,1
61,"Let me clarify my situation. I am a male in early twenties. I have long time friends that I have been hanging out with more than eight years. Our friendship did not form through mutual interests or anything, it was mostly due to having shared the same classroom during our highschool years. We don't even have a common ground in our view of the world/life, at least not me. Even then, we have shared a lot of time together and have bonded in some way. The source of the stress is what we do to pass time together at our homes. We play games once or twice a week during the night. I mostly don't feel up to it since we play competitive games and they are tryhard about it, which I dislike. I am honestly not even sure if thats the only reason. I used get excited to play games together but haven't felt that way for several years. I kinda dread it. Almost everyday, I anxiously wait if they are going to call me to play games during the night. I am a person who can enjoy their time alone and thats what I want to do most of the times. I feel as if the time we almost systematically spend together has become a chore. And since we have been together for so long, I can't keep saying I don't feel up to it all the time but there isn't a single time I feel up to it. And let me tell you, they are quite stubborn and will try their hardest to make the game night happen. I feel like I am betraying them if I say I no longer enjoy the time we spend together but that is the truth. Maybe it is also because we don't share the same beliefs about the world/life but at this point, I just don't know. Our long time friendship is blurring my judgement about this whole situation and thats where I need your advice. What should I do? Sorry if this feels like I blurted everything in messy text but I just had to vent it out.",24Apr2020,1

63,"I've found that this is a very common theme in my life. Unfortunately throughout my life 95% of the time friends have wronged me if we haven't just naturally drifted apart. I give people so many chances, and after a while I just get tired of being the only one trying and I cut ties. It's painful and I do everything possible to keep friendships alive, but when I'm the only one putting in the effort, eventually it becomes too exhaustive to maintain. So I stop contacting them and they do too, until several years later and try to reconnect. I've had a high school ex who I ""dated"" for 2 weeks sophomore year try to meet up and talk when I was almost done with college. I've had another ex I broke up with, with plenty of explanation as to why I could not be with him, keep trying to contact me nearly 7 months after things were over wanting to meet up.

People from my childhood, also, which is so strange to me. Growing up I had a best friend who I absolutely loved, and there's still a soft spot in my heart for her. My mother remarried when we were in the sixth grade and we moved... and I never saw her again. We stayed in touch regardless until we were in the eighth grade, and then we just drifted apart. I went to college, she didn't. She got involved with some drugs and began dating questionable people. Our lives are completely different. She added me on FaceBook about a year ago and asked how I was doing and if my mother was still abusive towards me. She's the only person in my entire life (I'm currently 23) who knows about my childhood and who grew up with me.

The question kind of froze me and I blocked her. Not because I hold anything against her, but because my childhood from 5-18 was incredibly painful and traumatic. I worked so hard and have been blessed to have the life I have now. Today she texted me and asked if she had the correct number. After I said yes, she said hello and said she realized we're no longer friends on social media. She said she's sorry if she said anything that hurt me and wishes me and my family the best.

I love her despite me not responding. I realize this probably isn't healthy but I despise thinking about my past or even slightly being reminded of it. I've done a lot of inner healing work and anything that remotely reminds me of my childhood brings PTSD symptoms. Today I was at the end of a workout and I just started to cry because I realized I don't let anyone in and I every time I've showed or shared just a little piece of the real me, those friendships never lasted or I was outcasted. Her and I are completely different people and in different stages of life. Just from her social media I could tell a conversation between her and I could not possibly pass an hour, if even 30 minutes. I think we would bond over our childhood and being the best of friends each other could have ever had, but besides that there's nothing else left to be said.

I've had other childhood friends reach out to me as well in the past and I just can't get myself to reconnect with them. I'm so content with my life now... the one I've worked so, so hard for and fought for since I was a child holding on to the hope that things would get better.

Is this a normal thing where we easily detach from painful memories or people? Or is it common that people from your past also try to reach out to you? How do you feel when people from your past try to reconnect? I'm an INFJ, could this possibly have to do with personality type as well?",24Apr2020,1

My boss came to me Sunday  said that they were really struggling to pay bills, I was caught off guard and I’m dumb so I said ok. she said wanted to make it even between me and the other girl so all cash tips and credit card tips they take, and they give us $15 instead of $30 and just tack it onto our check at the end of the week.  I’m frustrated because the other girl gets too stressed out to work nights so I get the busy shifts. My friends at other restaurants get to keep all their tips.

68,"My ex gave a whole bunch of different reasons to all her friends as to why she left me but I'm 100% sure it's because I was depressed. She's the reason I can't even say the words I love you anymore. She's the reason I acted like I was an incel for the longest time and why I just can't trust a woman anymore. She's the reason for why I pushed literally everyone in my life away and why I didn't have love in my heart anymore at the time. I grew insanely homicidal at one point because of her. It shouldn't have done this much damage since we only dated for 2-3 years. 

I've been single for a year and I feel healed but I'm still scared of getting hurt like this all over again. What makes a relationship worth it?

72,"So lately a myriad of things in my life have been going wrong. First, I got a job offer rescinded due to COVID-19. I was so excited to have landed the job because I worked so hard for it and it was relevant experience towards my bachelor's degree. Not the end of the world but still a bummer. 

Then, about a month ago, my mom who is currently over seas had a serious stroke and is still incapable of speech or movement. COVID-19 border closures mean that I can't go visit her or be with her, so it has made an already difficult situation just absolutely horrible. My mom is my best friend and I can't bear to see her suffering like this, not to mention the extent to which she can recover remains unknown. I am devastated and have never been so sad in my entire life.

So now that you have gained some insight into some of the things I'm dealing with, I can get to my point. My best friend of 6 years whom I considered one of my closest friends has not once thought to text or call to see how I'm doing. I told her about my mom about 2 weeks ago, and she wrote me a sweet paragraph about how sorry she is and all that stuff, but she never once followed up afterwards. In over 10 days of me telling her about my mom, she did not text or call me once, which really hurt my feelings. It was this friend's birthday 5 days ago, so I decided to be the bigger person and wish her a happy birthday, despite being mad at her. After I messaged her first with the birthday wish, only then did she ask me how things were. I told her I was really struggling and that I've never been so sad in my entire life, and she sent some more supportive messages. I asked her to call over face-time to catch up and we agreed to call 4 days ago, but I ended up postponing the face-time and we never set another date. 4 days later, still no messages from her.

So... should I drop this friend? I'm shocked she hasn't been there for me. We were so close over the past 6 years. She moved away a year ago but we still remained close and I didn't feel like we became as distant as she's acting right now. If the roles were reversed I would constantly be asking her about her mom or how she was doing, simply because I care. I have a lot of support from other friends of mine who ask me almost everyday how my mom is doing and how I'm holding up. That being said, it makes me realize how shitty this old friend of mine is treating me.

We kind of clicked pretty early on and have always had a good relationship. Whenever I've been going through something I've always gone to him about it and he consoles and is very gentle and sweet to me and supportive about it. We've had so many good talks, too, about random things like our lives, music, etc., and overall, he's easily one of the best people to talk to that I've ever known.

Now that we're doing online school, we  obviously don't talk nearly as much. I'm in his online class, but we've only had one video chat at the start, and since then there hasn't really been many assignments. I've messaged him a couple times with school related things and he does answer back but I just miss talking to him. It made school so much easier to have him there and it almost feels sort of like a close friend that I can't talk to anymore.

She decided she need this and wanted to explore, especially now that she is moving to get her bachelors, so she broke up with me.

82,"My brother has three friends over at our house right now so they can all study together and do an exam. My parents and I have told him multiple times previously to stop inviting people over to our house during the pandemic, but all he says is that it’s still legal because he’s only got one person over and then says we should piss off. 

Right now him and his friends are on a call with their other friends to work on an exam together. I woke up an hour ago to find them already in the house while parents are at work. I’m assuming they don’t know what’s going on right now. 

I need advice on what to do, I’ve already talked to my brother aside and telling him he should stop. All he said was I should shut up so cops don’t come. Now I’m wondering if I should threaten to call the cops in front of his friends to get them to leave.

She knows my strengths and my weaknesses 

She copies my strengths (like literally jacked my personality/life. My friends say she talks like me, she copied all the things about me that HER friends said were cute (and then cut me off from her friends and bf), copies all the things I did with my ex bf with hers, etc.) 

But my weaknesses, no matter how many times I tell her it’s embarrassing when she tells people about how I skip around the house (psycho-motor issue) she will tell her friends/my friends/ a guy I like she will tell them that I do that!! 

She will point it out while I’m doing it and ask “why are you doing x?” “You keep doing x” but she knows what I’m doing and why because she says it to other people to embarrass me. 

I’ve done it since I was a kid and my siblings/other kids would look at me funny or even record. It made my dad (who was abusive and caused me to have this problem) really angry and he would point it out to other people because he thought the embarrassment would make me stop. All it did was make me feel more embarrassed and bring me back to those times like how this family member does

We've had so many good talks, too, about random things like our lives, music, etc., and overall, he's easily one of the best people to talk to that I've ever known.

Now that we're doing online school, we  obviously don't talk nearly as much. I'm in his online class, but we've only had one video chat at the start, and since then there hasn't really been many assignments. I've messaged him a couple times with school related things and he does answer back but I just miss talking to him. It made school so much easier to have him there and it almost feels sort of like a close friend that I can't talk to anymore.

I know this is such a typical high school senior attitude, but at the same time I'm scared of failing. 

My main main issue is with English, which at one point was my favorite subject. But I can't write for crap, and every time I think I'm proving my grades stay the same. It's not even about the grade at this point as long as I don't fail, but just thinking about the essay makes me want to avoid even reading the books were assigned because I feel like no matter what I think about it, I can't spell out how I feel about it. And I just keep putting it off and off. Not sure if i'm making excuses because I'm lazy to be honest. Maybe a little bit of both.

I'll refer to this young man as ""S"" from here on, S is a 20 year old young man, he has been diagnosed as having a mental range from 8 to 14 years old depending on the tests (Doctors haven't been able to pin point a single diagnosis on him, some say he has autism, some don't) S lives with his family and is taken care of, goes to school, has hobbies, lives a happy life etc. 
A year ago, he had a ""psychotic break"" and became obsessed with horror videos and disturbing sexual fetishes (vore, etc). His parents try to restrict access to that kinda stuff by using parental controls, but he's always able to figure out how to disable them. It's obviously not the right solution to this problem, explaining and making sure he understands that kinda stuff is not okay to watch would be better, but his parents haven't taught him much regarding sexuality. I'm speaking on behalf of S's family but I'm very close to them, so I'd like to get some tips on how they should go about this situation. I'm not very well educated regarding mental disabilities but I think some of his needs aren't being met, be it mental stimulation, something regarding his sexuality, I'm not sure. I'd appreciate any kind of help.

95,"Hello Reddit Community,

Allow me to give you some background on myself and my lifelong struggles with mental health. I’m a 17-year-old boy from a small but progressive college town in North Carolina. My mother is the fairly successful owner of a local Yoga studio, and my father teaches graphic design at the nearby university. For most of my life, I would’ve described myself as a pretty happy person. I’m an only child. Before Kindergarten I went to Sensory Integration and Feeding Therapy as I was an extremely picky eater (still am) and refused to do things such as remove my socks. I was suspected of having Autism, but have never been officially diagnosed. My parents have always been amazing and extremely supportive. As a child, I was fairly introverted. I was never one to start conversations but all through elementary and middle school I had a few close friends, though I rarely talked about anything personal. Interestingly, lying seemed to come naturally to me since a young age. I would lie to my parents, friends, and teachers whenever it was convenient and didn’t see anything wrong with that. Around the 6th grade, I began to rid myself of this habit, possibly, however, only due to fear from a brief “finding God” phase I went through. Despite never being raised religious, I began to pray, compulsively, eventually finding myself blessing myself several times each minute, mimicking what I saw my Catholic grandparents doing in Church. In the following years, I began to struggle with what I would later learn, are symptoms of OCD. I would become hyperaware of involuntary bodily functions (blinking, breathing, etc.) to the point where it would distract me for hours and prevent me from accomplishing much throughout the day. As a result, my grades began to drop for the first time and at my reaching out, my parents decided to take me to a psychologist for a few years. I realize now that I lacked the maturity to see his perspective, and, while I was truthful, I largely dismissed the exposure practices I was introduced to as counterproductive. In the coming years, these issues subsided, and for a period, I became hyper-motivated, almost manically so, to pursue a career in filmmaking. I wrote and directed several short films, of which I was extremely passionate about and received immense community praise. I seemed to be on point for a successful and happy life just as I was starting high school when the intrusive thoughts hit. Over the last few years, I have struggled with Primarily-Obsessional OCD (Pure O), in which the same set of intrusive thoughts have plagued me and affected my friendships, school performance, and most devastating to me, my path in life. For a few years, I was able to scrape by with minimal effort, receiving mediocre grades, and underperforming in regards to the high standards I had for myself while pushing the thoughts to the side and trying to disengage from them, which I thought was helping. Then, in January of last year, I met a girl who was a year younger than myself and was homeschooled her entire life, and we connected slowly but deeply. I never had an interest in romantic relationships. In theory, I had, but I’d never actually met someone my age who was slightly interesting to me. This all changed at this moment. We were both writers, she paints and had a history of participating in community and some professional theatre our entire lives. Unfortunately, we were both too inexperienced to handle ourselves at that time and a few months into our relationship, we decided to take some time apart. Little did I know that, during this time, I was developing a close friendship with another girl who we were both mutual friends with. I liked her a lot as well but never thought of her on romantic terms, however, the more I learned about her, the more we connected. We would stay up all night until the sun rose to talk on the phone about philosophy, and people, and movies, and books. This all took a less innocent turn when she expressed feelings for me, and, for a time, I was but in an awkward love triangle between two girls who I can 100% say I was equally in love with and was devastated to have to hurt one of them. In the end, I chose to be with my first love, and we are still together today, though I sometimes fear just because of habit. A very good decision that I definitely don’t regret. However, I wanted to savor my special and rare relationship with my friend who I felt understood me and genuinely cared about me in ways nobody else did. It is with both of them that I first disclosed my history of mental health struggles. I actually hosted at our high school with her a brief club for auditionees into an elite program in the theater department that travels to theater conferences around the world. With the three of us working together, we all made it into this program, called the Playmakers, and have grown closer due to that. Unfortunately, this last year has been a struggle. I haven’t been able to let her go because I feel a deep an individual, different connection with them both and love them both for different reasons in ways I’ve never liked anyone else before. Despite our struggles, the Playmakers have been my family this year and while many of my middle school friendships fell to the side, these people have been what motivates me to get out of bed in the morning and been there for everything. Unfortunately, my struggles with intrusive thoughts hit a peak halfway through this year, when I would break down in panic attacks during rehearsal and be a jerk to people often. When it came time to reaudition for the program this year, the other girl who I would still consider one of my best friends, and I had to take a painful monthlong hiatus from talking. During this time, I became very isolated, not making any new friends, while she did. We both reauditioned and both her and my girlfriend, as well as all my other best friends, were accepted into next year’s ensemble, while I was not...due largely to my poor academic performance this year as a result of my intrusive thoughts that I spend hours each day ruminating over. I meet with a therapist and do exposure work hesitantly, and take Prozac daily, but despite this, I seem to still be spiraling out of control. I’m so embarrassed to tell my playmaker family that I didn’t make the cut and am so jealous of what they get to do next year and the friendships they make. I have yet to fully accept that. But most distressing of all is when I sent an email informing my old friend about this, and her mother intercepted the email and contacted the school, who contacted the police, feeling as if by expressing my frustration to her in admittedly alarming, but truthful ways, I was influencing her negatively. So, currently, I have very, very poor coping skills for dealing with my nightmarish intrusive thoughts, my girlfriend and I are struggling and fighting often, and my best friend who I was once in love with and I have a pending restraining order from the court filed by her mother, and they’re all accepted into a program and family that I’ve been excluded from. After this, I hit rock bottom and decided to treat all my work with apathy which only made me more depressed and I’ve wound up failing most of my classes. How should I go about this? What do you recommend I do next to optimize my happiness and get my life back on track?  How can I amend these relationships? How can I accept the decisions I’ve made? I want to reverse time so badly to a year ago when I was a happy teenager who was on top of the world. I feel suicidal, although I know I would never seriously consider suicide, just because I’m too afraid of the unknown. Just curious? If you read all of this, you’re an amazing person, lots of love to you. I plan to post this on a few subreddits to see if I get varying answers. Sorry if that was too much information.",24Apr2020,1
96,"I'm a 27F who cannot tell people no. My husband has been encouraging me and trying to help me get better at this but I could use some more specific advice. When I say no to people I feel extreme guilt and I feel like it actively harms me to say no even to really dumb requests. For the last year I've been hanging out with this girl slightly younger than me. She cannot take no for an answer and has boundary issues. Our entire relationship seems to consist of me avoiding talking to her while she spams me with texts and messages on 2 other platforms. She messaged me every 10 minutes asking me to hang out and if I say I'm busy or working she just begs and begs until there's a specific time set up to hang out. If I set a time with her, she spams me asking if we can move the time up. If I agree she repeats the process. She begs me to skip work and cancel plans with other people and it's so exausting just getting texts from her that I really don't want to hang out. I finally told her that I'm not going to talk to her if she continues to beg me or boss me around. I don't enjoy spending time with her either because she lies about what time she will leave and I always spend about 2 hours asking her to leave. It only took about 2 days for her to go back to spamming me with messages asking me to do virtual hang outs.

102,"My parents separated like 2yrs ago and I honestly didn’t mind and I’m pretty sure none of my siblings did either. Before my dad moved out I could count on my fingers the number of times we spoke (excluding small talk). He called me and my siblings once a month since the split and over those two years he sent me money once for my retainers and hasn’t sent any money to the rest of my siblings, now all of us hate asking him for money and it makes us feel anxious because we feel like we’re ‘using’ him but like he doesn’t have much to offer other than his money and he doesn’t even give us that like you barely speak to us PLUS you don’t want to give us money? Pick a struggle.Just to add he has 5 kids one of which are special needs.You don’t provide any emotional support AT ALL so at least provide financial support.

I understand its selfish because there are so many kids who have absent fathers and so I’ve always felt the need to accept the little presence he does have in my life because I’m just so conditioned to believe bare minimum treatment should be worshipped of fathers
He’s literally living with his aunt and pays 0 rent. He recently got a new car and had not only the nerve but the audacity to send me a pic of it after he told me he couldn’t send my little brother £40 for some shoes he wanted for his bday. He’s been checking up on us everyday since the pandemic and its the same small talk, I assume his family pestered him to talk to us so my mum could get back with him.I could bet all my organs this man doesn’t know it’s my 18th next month. Honestly he’s just so annoying you’re a father of 5 kids you know NOTHING about like what. His sisters (my aunts) were under the impression he was sending us money every month (he lied) until a couple months ago when i told them that their brother never sends us money and so they have been offering to instead. 

Obviously Im not accepting any of it because they shouldn’t have the finical burden of taking care of kids that don’t belong to them. Plus they always ask me to convince my mum to get back with my dad because shes the best woman in the world but I always think, you people know how annoying and lazy this man is, do you genuinely believe my mother should put up with him?. Plus they always say ‘ik you miss your dad, if you want him back tell your mother’ like ma’am I didn’t even notice the first two weeks my dad left the house you could literally pay me to miss him and i would fail.

104,"So in February of 2018 my parents got divorced, and a couple months later they split and my mom got a new house. It’s nothing bad as they don’t hate each other and they have split custody over me and my brother. Fast travel a few more months later and my dad announces that he has a girlfriend, and that she’s moved in. I’m like ok I’m intrigued. So when we get to his house (I go back on Thursdays) I go up to my room to put my stuff away, and then I go downstairs for dinner, and then I see her. I instantly notice that she’s oversized (I have nothing against people oversized, it’s just that this will apply to the story later) I think, well ok she seems nice. So for a while I thought she was pretty chill. But then work started rolling in. And no it’s not your normal chores, where you clean vacuum and stuff, it’s full on home projects. These things don’t apply to me at all, and I’m forced to do them. If I try to say anything about it, I’m threatened to have my electronics taken away. Now it wouldn’t be a big deal if these “projects” weren’t as often as they are. They are almost every weekend. I would say that I have to spend an average of an hour of every day on just these projects. These weekends consist of 2-3 days, so it’s a lot. The biggest thing they’ve made me do (as well as my brother) is spend *6 hours* of our day doing sanding and picking up around the yard. Guess what, I didn’t give any goddamn crap about the sanding. That project was purely for cosmetic purposes, just like many of the other things they make me do. Like sanding in the house (that 6hr day was furniture outside) and staining furniture. And on top of these projects, I often have to do basic things for Evie (dad’s girlfriend) because she’s oversized (like I mentioned before.) Stuff like picking up things she drops, or getting her various things. Now a couple times there are things they ask me to do, that are routine stuff, that I wouldn’t usually mind, if I wasn’t being made into a slave. Stuff like cleaning a toilet, or vacuuming. That’s classic chore stuff, so I don’t mind it too much. But it’s just so much completely useless stuff, that it starts to get me feeling more depressed. Now I want to point out that I’m no rebellious kid, or non-hardworking. In school i have good relations with my teachers, friends, and then in sports I have good relations with coaches, and members of our youth baseball league (can’t do much with that last one now eh?) In school ever since 7th grade (I’m in eighth grade now) when we started letter grades, I’ve had straight a’s every trimester (that’s how my school does it.) so don’t think I hate the work because I’m just a teenager. Now because it’s been making me feel depressed, I often can’t hold in showing the depression while doing work. My dad and Evie have clearly noticed this and guess what, they did something about it. *they tried to give themselves* wait no, just Evie *a goddamn excuse* Evie has told us multiple times that she had a bad childhood. She was abused by her mom, among other things. Now normally, I’d feel bad for her, obviously, but I don’t, because of the way she uses it as an excuse to make me her slave. She has also said “I wouldn’t make you do anything I don’t think other teenagers are doing.” Absolute bullcrap. My friend has told me he doesn’t have to do as much work as I do. And none of my other friends, or anyone really from school have talked or posted about it. So I know for sure most of them don’t have to do all of this work. And probably the biggest thing I hate about doing this work is that it’s completely random. Say I’m playing with my friend, or I’m chatting with someone in-game. We’re going about our game, talking about not only the game we are currently playing, but about stuff in real life, whatever. All of a sudden “hey James! Come down here!” I say I’ll get down there in a second, because I’m usually in the middle of something, but a lot of times she will say in a raised voice, “No, now.” And then I’m forced to leave my friends, or whoever I’m playing with, no clue why I’m gone. The only time I’m able to tell them is when I’m in a call, usually only with my friend, so often leaving them clueless. That’s the part that makes me depressed. They’re taking me away from socializing with my friends, or just other people in that matter. Now don’t get me wrong, I’m a huge introvert, but I really like socializing with friends and other people (for other people, it’s usually those in-game people I talked about.) When we talk about stuff, it makes me feel connected to the world, which may not seem like a big deal, but I’m a strong atheist, and i don’t have many emotions, so it’s pretty hard for me to connect with other people. It’s not often, but sometimes I’m doing stuff alone. That stuff still keeps me away from being depressed and anxious (I might have it, I have the leg bounce sometimes, and sometimes I get anxious, but we don’t know.) So obviously I don’t get as upset when I get taken from doing stuff I like alone, but once it gets lengthy, (like it usually does,) that’s when I start to get pissed off, you can probably imagine how much more pissed off I’d feel if I was getting taken away from the socializing stuff. Ok so if you’ve gotten this far you are amazing, and Im sorry for making it this long. I would really appreciate it on any tips I could get from you.",24Apr2020,1
106,I’m gonna be a junior next year and i’m finally old enough to try out for the cheer team. I’ve been cheering since 5th grade and i love it more than anything. i even quit competition cheer so that i could try out for my high school cheer team. Tryouts are very soon and i’m so afraid of not making this team. This is also the only year i’ll be able to try out. there are like 7 spots and 60 girls trying out. i just need some advice on what to do if i don’t make it. i feel like if i don’t make this team im gonna hate junior year. i love cheer so much. it’s the only thing i’ve ever been really good at. thinking about not being on the team hurts my heart. this is my last chance to cheer like EVER.,24Apr2020,1
107,"I've had a crush on a guy at work for the past three years. The feeling has always ebbed and flowed, and I've been able to avoid making an ass of myself.

Since being on lockdown and working remotely, we were talking more often and getting into deeper conversations. Nothing even vaguely flirty, just the kind of stuff you'd discuss with a friend. I didn't think I said anything weird or uncomfortable, but he recently has pulled away a lot. The conversations became a lot more surface level and he never reached out first. I'm pretty miserable thinking about how I probably fucked up this perfectly nice friendship, though I'm not sure exactly how I did that. 

I feel like I should stop talking to him, but unfortunately, my role involves occasionally needing help on projects from his role. I don't want to seem like I only speak to him when I want something, but I also feel really fucking weird about being friendly now.

Should I stop contacting him unless it's work related, or is that rude?",24Apr2020,1

109,"My parents adopted me when I was a baby and I've always viewed them as my actual parents regardless of blood relation. 

I'm 24 now and lately I've had an internal conflict as to if I should potentially open a door and reach out to my biological mom. I have a lot of questions mainly about family history, siblings (ones she kept after me, I am the oldest), my biological father, medical history and so on. 

My concern is I'm not sure how I will feel once I open that door and if it's something that doesn't feel right I don't want to hurt anyone in the process. 

I haven't spoken to my adoptive parents about it. Reason being.. I have an older brother (he is also adopted and from a completely different biological family) who reached out to his birth mom and it made his relationship with our parents pretty awkward. Both my brother and I don't have the greatest relationship with either of them because they are very controlling and manipulative however we do respect and honor them because they raised us. 

I'm not really sure how I should proceed. If anyone has any personal stories or advice it would be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you!",24Apr2020,1
110,"I am 19 years old and I live with my grandparents. I have been living here since I was about 15. When I turned 17 I got my first job and had my W-2 and gave it to my grandparents and then after a while, they deposited what I got back into my bank account. Then the next year I gave them my W-2 and that year they decided to keep it and put it away for me just in case any accidents happened. I didn't really like the idea of it since it was $800 and I didn't know if they actually did it or not. Well, a few months later my car needed repair and they used some of the $800 and use it for that so I didn't mind but they never told me how much the repair was and how much I have left. This year they asked for my W-2 and I told them I am only giving it to them if I get all the money into my account and I want a receipt or something. They said sure we will do that. Well now I am here with still no money and I keep asking them and they keep saying ""Oh I gotta check on it"" It has been months and still got no update. I don't know what else to do.

112,"My university recently announced that it will be doing it's fall 2020 semester online/partially online (not too sure since it's an ongoing debate rn), and it has brought a lot of struggles with my registration for classes, my stress levels, and my parents. 

I'm an art major hoping to have a concentration in animation, but I plan on declaring my BFA this upcoming fall semester. I couldn't do it this semester because I was missing a class required for the portfolio review, and I didn't feel ready to submit it at the time. I finally registered for the class I needed and realized that it originally was gonna be a studio lab class (Photography class that requires a dark room). In addition I have a science lab I need to complete my GEs because I only have a lab and an upper division science class left. 

I was ranting to my parents about how difficult it was to register for my needed art classes because registering for those suck and I struggle to get into them due to late registration dates. I told my parents how I hope that my school does a hybrid option for the fall because I honestly have no idea how the class is supposed to go; also sick of during all my classes online. My parents lost their shit, they started telling me that if that were to happen I might as well consider myself dead and to not take those classes. I tried to tell them that I needed those classes for my major and that it would be stressful on me having to do online because I obviously wouldn't have a dark room in my house. They got so mad to the point of yelling and I had to keep saying that I actually need those classes. Also they absolutely would not let me take this semester off because education is so important to them. 

This is more or less of a rant because I'm still kinda heated. I understand that they are worried about the pandemic and our safety. I feel like I can't rant about things at times because then it becomes a heated argument and my parents and I are stubborn people. As a student, I'm just worried about my classes and how efficient it will be if my school goes completely virtual.",24Apr2020,1

I ended things 2 hours ago, and since then my mental health has already improved.

Her boyfriend is an absolute vegetable and all they do all day is shoot up and sleep and night he just goes around stealing shit. Literally anything he can get his hands on. Tools, bikes, clothes, ANYTHING and brings it all back to our house. It is fucking ruining our family home. 
They have moved back in recently as they were evicted from their apartment about 3 weeks ago, for who knows what. They were sleeping in a school until my dad was basically black mailed into taking them back in. 
My mum can’t take them either because she has an intervention on my sister for physically assaulting her last year. 
The cops have been around to my house twice looking for her boyfriend (we assume for burglary’s) and each time he has evaded them. This morning they arrested my sister for questioning but now she is back home.

128,"This is something that’s been bugging me ever since it happened and i just want to see what other people think of the situation. To give some context this happened to me my freshman year of college this past spring semester during a rush party hosted by one of the fraternities i was rushing. The party was extremely crowded with probably over 100 people packed into this tight party room, it was fairly dark with loud music blasting the entire time. There was obviously alcohol being served and a majority of the people there were drinking including myself. The party started at 11pm and this situation happened around 1am. Obviously it’s hard for me to remember what happened and i’m not even sure but i’m gonna try. I was hanging out enjoying the party when I asked to hit this random girls juul that was also rushing a sorority. While i was hitting it i started chatting her up and found out she had a boyfriend. The conversation continued (i wasn’t trying to flirt cause i knew she was in a relationship) and we got on the topic of real fur coats (the theme of the party was skiing so a few people were wearing real fur coats). It seemed like she felt very strongly about the topic saying things like how people that wear real fur support animal abuse and are horrible people. I personally don’t own any real fur coats but i know people that own them and thought what she was saying was stupid so i told her that it was extremely ignorant to say that a person supported animal abuse just because of an article of clothing they own and rudely told her that she sounded flat out dumb. I saw the look and her face and knew i made a mistake at right that moment... she started yelling in my face calling me disgusting and that i support animal abuse and  then stormed off. I was honestly shocked and just shook my head and thought nothing of it. About 10 minutes later i’m talking to one of the brothers asking him questions about the fraternity and 2 random girls walk up to me and start punching me in the face. I didn’t want to hit them back so i just put my hands up and tried to cover my face. One of the brothers pulled them off and they started screaming  that kid sexually assaulted  my friend,i was obviously shocked by that kind of accusation and asked them what they were talking about. The brothers in the fraternity were obviously concerned and asked her what she meant and she told them that i grabbed her friend forcibly held her against the wall and started touching her inappropriately. i asked them to go outside so i could explain what happened and told them the story of what happened what happened with that girl earlier and they said why would a girl accuse someone of sexual assault over fur coats. They also said to me that cause i has been drinking that i might had done it and not remembered, i told them i know there is no way i was drunk enough to do something like that and not remember. I asked them if anyone claimed to have saw me do that and they said they only saw the girl yelling at me and her friends punching me. I was just so frustrated and tried i told the guys believe what ever you want and ubered home. My friends that were at the party with me ubered home a bit before this happened and they couldn’t believe it when i told them the next day. After this i just rushed other frats and forgot about it no on texted me about it or anything. I ended up getting a bid from another frat and accepted it. About 4 days into pledging this new frat the executive board sat me down in front of my pledge class and told me they had heard about what happened and wanted to hear about it. I was caught off guard cause it had happened over a week ago and I was nervous being put on the spot like that in front of my pledge class. After i told them the story they asked me to prove my innocence and i told them isn’t it innocent tilI proven guilty and they told me it doesn’t apply in this situation. Some of the things i said to defend myself were “the party was extremely crowded if i was holding a girl against a wall wouldn’t someone have saw?” i even offered to pay for a lie detector test to prove to them i’m telling the truth. when i asked the executive board who told them they wouldn’t tell me so i’m not even sure if it was the girl who told them about this. They ended up dropped me the next day saying it would bring bad reputation to the fraternity if it was true. i asked around and not many people knew the girl that accused me she didn’t end up pledging any sororities. One girl i asked kinda knew the girl that accused me and told me that the girl has bipolar disorder and anxiety which she takes medication for i don’t know if this played a factor in the situation. A bunch of people in the greek life heard about this and i feel like cause i got dropped they think it’s true cause why would i have gotten dropped if it wasn’t true. I wasn’t sure if people believed me or actually thought i would do something like that to a women. This messed with me mentally and got me pretty depressed i felt like my reputation at the school was ruined. i’m transferring to a different school (not entirely cause of this) and still can’t believe this happened i don’t understand how what i said made to girl angry enough to want to ruin my life.

About 4 days into pledging this new frat the executive board sat me down in front of my pledge class and told me they had heard about what happened and wanted to hear about it. I was caught off guard cause it had happened over a week ago and I was nervous being put on the spot like that in front of my pledge class. After i told them the story they asked me to prove my innocence and i told them isn’t it innocent tilI proven guilty and they told me it doesn’t apply in this situation. Some of the things i said to defend myself were “the party was extremely crowded if i was holding a girl against a wall wouldn’t someone have saw?” i even offered to pay for a lie detector test to prove to them i’m telling the truth. when i asked the executive board who told them they wouldn’t tell me so i’m not even sure if it was the girl who told them about this. They ended up dropped me the next day saying it would bring bad reputation to the fraternity if it was true.

i asked around and not many people knew the girl that accused me she didn’t end up pledging any sororities. One girl i asked kinda knew the girl that accused me and told me that the girl has bipolar disorder and anxiety which she takes medication for i don’t know if this played a factor in the situation. A bunch of people in the greek life heard about this and i feel like cause i got dropped they think it’s true cause why would i have gotten dropped if it wasn’t true. I wasn’t sure if people believed me or actually thought i would do something like that to a women. This messed with me mentally and got me pretty depressed i felt like my reputation at the school was ruined. i’m transferring to a different school (not entirely cause of this) and still can’t believe this happened i don’t understand how what i said made to girl angry enough to want to ruin my life. I couldn’t remember/include everything but this was the best i couldn’t do.",24Apr2020,1
136,So I have been with a group of friends for about four years and they’re usually pretty toxic but I can deal with it and it doesn’t bother me.

139,"I'm just kinda in pain and I feel like I should do something but I am lost. Today I woke up just fine and did a workout and started my day. However I just had an urge to cry when I mentioned I have a  disability due to my disorder(brachymetatarsia/pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism) and my mom dismissed it, because I can still walk on my feet. This kind of hurt me. Being diagnosed with a rare disorder is difficult for me and having to explain why I can't walk sometimes because I'm in pain is even more difficult because it's hard to relate to. I missed about a month's worth of days if school last year because of it. Having to explain that to my principal was hard enough and she gave me a disability form to go to the doctor to get, but we never went to do it. I feel like my mom just gave up. I get that it's difficult to go to the doctor to get it done but it doesn't stop there. The director of Upward Bound for my school gave me a pamphlet to join a disability service that allows me to do workshops and have advice from other people etc. He said my mom needs to call the number and that's it and she never did. I kept reminding her and she always put it off. I'm starting to second guess myself. Maybe I'm just being inconsiderate of other people with disabilities to say that I have one.

141,"I am a trans male, 18 turning 19 soon, and am 24 weeks pregnant. 

I guess I'll just give a basic background. My brain is basically mush right now so forgive if it's not well-worded. So I hooked up with this guy on grindr and didn't use protection, irresponsible, I know. I've always been the type of person that doesn't care about taking risks. Don't ask why, idk. I thought for sure I was infertile because I was on T for years and never started menstruating again. I know that doesn't technically mean anything, but I've always wanted to get pregnant and have biological children so I figured I was infertile because I have bad luck. Which is also stupid. Ignore all the stupid shit I've done, I know my mistakes.

Well I told him in the beginning that I really didnt want anything from him and wanted to be the child's only parent because I didn't really know him at all and he wanted me to get an abortion. I was living with my cousin at the time and we were gonna figure it out together. I know now that telling him that was a big mistake. Because of this I didn't get any of his information, not even his last name, which I'm ashamed of. But it is what it is. 

My living situation with my cousin fell through, at least for now, almost two weeks ago, and I have been staying with my grandmother for the time being. I am looking into a housing placement for pregnant and parenting youth and am waiting to hear back, but it's actually looking pretty good so I'm letting myself be optimistic. Well I talked to bio dad and he basically asked me if I was expecting anything of him when the baby was born. I told him I don't know, because it's true I don't know what's going to happen. He brought up that I told him he didn't have to do anything and that this was only a hookup for him and that I was the one who chose to keep the baby (it wasnt really a choice for me because as I said before, I thought I was infertile and that I would never have my own children, which is something that I've always wanted. So I couldnt have aborted knowing this may be my only chance.) I don't remember how I responded to that but I just kind of deflected because I again couldn't make any promises or tell him what's going to happen.

Well fast forward to the next day (today I think, or last night idk) and we were talking when I asked him if he's told his family. Something I meant to ask a long time ago but I don't really like talking to him because he sucks. And he told me that he hadn't because they had ""a lot going on"" and were homeless up until two months ago. He also said that if they found out his parents would probably force him to step up and help out. And I was like okay........ well regardless of if you're gonna be involved, or dip out, your parents have the right to know if they have a grandchild. It is NOT RIGHT of him to keep that from them. They should have an opportunity to decide if they want to be in their granddaughter's life, it is not his choice to make. And he basically repeated what he said before and I repeated what I said but more aggressively. He opened it hours ago but didn't respond.

So basically I need advice on how to go about this? I've never been good at confrontation but I want his parents to have the opportunity to know their grandchild if they want to. They deserve to know she exists, I think it's so fucked up that he doesn't want to tell them. But I have no means of finding them because I don't know his last name. I just don't know how to go about it because it is a very delicate situation and I can't really force him to do anything over the phone so I'm stressed. I also want to be tactful so I don't scare him off because if I lose contact with him I basically lose my chance to meet his parents and for them to know about their grandchild which is just WRONG. Ugh I know I keep mentioning that but that's what pisses me off the most.

147,"Hey all. I really need some help with a roommate of mine/my husband's. I'm gonna call her M, just for sake of ease. This is M's first apartment away from her parents. M and husb went to college together, they and another roommate and I have a place in a nice area, and things are generally pretty quiet....as long as husb and I stay in our room or sneak out when we need something from the kitchen. 

M is a nice person! She's really genuine and friendly, but she kind of toes a line that I'm not sure how to ask her to stop crossing. She lives here, pays 1/3 of the rent (I'm not paying yet bc no job bc immigration,) and is a friend that I ideally would like to retain after husb and I move out in Feb. 

The line: she will not. Leave us. Alone. If we go out in the kitchen, the *second* she hears us, she comes out of her room--and immediately starts talking about things husb and I really don't know/care about. Minecraft is a big one, its most of what she does with her downtime. She bought it for us both for Christmas but talks about it so constantly and without invitation or much interested response from us that husb and I cant even fathom playing the game alone, let alone with her. She comes out when she *just* woke up, eyes barely open, to sit and stare at us until we leave. If she comes out in the middle of us talking to *each other,* she will 'wait what?' to insert herself into the conversation. I cook, husb cleans and helps, and she will sit there the *entire time* and watch us, and try to show us memes on her phone while we're trying to get things done.  

We have moved the TV (ours) and game system into our room, because *any* time we wanted to be outside of our bedroom, she would come out and just....not stop talking. If we don't acknowledge her, she'll sit in silence and stare. If I drop something, leave the fridge door open too long for her liking, burn food a bit, nick my finger with a knife while I cook--she *instantly* comments because she *watches me*. She will come out to sit at the kitchen bar and either zone out, talk ceaselessly, or watch husb and i like we're on the other side of a screen. We can't talk to each other (husb and I) because she *constantly* wants to be part of the convo with answering questions we ask each other, or doing the 'wait, what?' so we involve her in things that have 0 to do with her. Cooking and spending time outside of our room is starting to feel like an exhausting performance that is incredibly uncomfortable to maintain.

The other roommate takes hints like our tired responses or silence or sleepy faces as a sign that we need to not be around humans, but M just....doesn't. She doesn't take hints, and I don't know how to outright say 'please go away' without being rude. It's her house too, I know that, and I never want to make her feel unwelcome in conversation or contact--when we have the energy for it. When we do, its great--but it's every *single* time we go out there, and it's starting to grate. Husb and I both have mental issues that lead to extreme exhaustion and our 'energy limits' are pretty much just each other most days. 

I have gently been the one to go 'hey M? What you need?' But she just says 'I heard people and got excited', which makes this even worse. We're starting to resent living with her, and I hate that a lot--like I said, she's a really great person, she just does _not_ seem privy to social cues at all. It's getting to me, that husb and I have to literally sneak out to get food from our own kitchen. What can I do or say to make this easier on everyone? Any advice is appreciated. Thanks for reading!!

Tldr: roommate can't read social cues and husb and i can't leave our room without her immediately coming out to talk to us about things we have no interest in. She's a good person, so i don't wanna be mean, but something's gotta give.",24Apr2020,1

Recently, she's been using that as an excuse to treat me and our other friends like trash. 

She sometimes talks about them (to me) behind their backs, saying how they're embarrassing to be around because they aren't as popular as she'd hoped they'd be.

She even used the 'I'm depressed' card to justify the mean words she used to call them. Though I don't agree with her, I'm not the best when it comes to confronting people so I just left her be.

My wife is 28 weeks pregnant and is not back to work yet, and will work from home when she does.

Some agree with him but many say that the odds of catching it or bringing it home are very low, and that it isn't more dangerous for a pregnant woman than it is for anyone else. And even if I were to stay home, until when? The baby is only due in July and I don't know if the spread of the virus will have slowed down by then. I can't possibly not work until then.

153,"So my boss has made several awful comments and I was due to stop working there in May before the quarantine so I don’t think I’m going back. I had plans on going to the head store and reporting him in May so hopefully they don’t hire another girl or she’s at least warned. I found out after a few months into the job that he used to be a registered sex offender and no one told me.  But there’s speculation at our location if the owner even knows because of how my boss was hired (long story). It upset me because I would have reported it earlier but at that point I felt like I was too far in and was in a horrible financial position so I needed the job. This is also why I never really stood up for myself. My coworker did when stuff was said in front of him but my boss definitely made an effort not to say stuff with my coworker around. 

So my question is if I should still report it to the head office or has it just been too long and if it’s not how should I approach this. I live close enough to actually go to the main store and I don’t want it to be a phone call because I know the management there well enough to know that it wouldn’t be taken seriously. TIA y’all.

154,"In 2013, my little sister found a note that looks like it was written in the early 80s and it had mentioned that my Dad has either a one-night-stand or a full out affair with another woman and she became pregnant.  The note mentioned that my dad was the father, but to not worry about anything since she will take care of the child by herself. My little sister brought the note to my Mom and my Mom told my sister to ""put it back, never speak of it again"". My sister ended up showing me the letter since I am close to my Dad. I was shocked, scared, and pissed (as any respectable college would be finding this information out). 

A few years later, a family member messaged me asking about a person who reached out to her asking about more information about my family. I had no clue, but I told them that I recall seeing a letter about this whole topic, but I disregarded it thinking that I must have dreamed it up. Apparently this other family member brought it up to my parents and my parents told said family member to ""not pursue it"", never speak of it again, and to drop it. Rumor has it that my father said that there is a possibility. 

Flash forward to March of this year (2020) and I get a message from a person claiming to be my half brother. He explained how he is figuring this out, but I personally didn't believe him since hoaxes run wild in the world, so I thought that it was a scam and that the person must have been crazy.  So my cousin was doing Ancestry DNA stuff along with some other family members and they all have a connection to a random person. As it turns out this person happens to be my half-brother. 

I'm currently in shock that this is actually true and is happening in my life, but I want to ask my father 2 questions,  I want to know why this was kept from me and if they ever had planned on telling me. My father is old enough that he could easily have a heart attack or a stroke if I bring it up to him, but I feel like I have a right to know why this information was kept from me. I'm not mad, just frustrated. I've had my time to have anger and be mad, but now I just want closure on it all. Ancestry is very uncanny at accurately finding the info out. Plus my half-brother is a spitting image of my dad, so it's clear that he's related. I'm also fairly certain that my Dad will want nothing to do with him. 

  
TLDR: I found my half-brother, but I'm 99% sure that my dad will die if I tell him I know about it and/or will tell me that this guy is insane and not to pursue it (too late, it pursued me). Thoughts on what I should do would be great.

A while ago, in February, I commissioned an artist to draw a design for a tattoo for me. I came up with the design myself. It was finished, and he posted my design that he made on his Instagram. Fast forward to now, and the same artist posted a design that is EXTREMELY similar to mine for a different person. I guess they saw the post with my design and liked it. Some parts are even exact copies. Basically, there are just a few changes to what I originally commissioned.

I am honestly just a bit hurt because my design is very sentimental to me, and to have someone rip it off and put it on their own body weirds me out.

I feel used and taken advantaged of by most people in my life ( I seem to only get phone calls when people want things such as drives, money or a booty call). I'm just so sick of everything! I know people treat you the way you teach them to treat you, but is it too late for me? I just want to feel respected and appreciated. Anyway I just needed to vent. Can't do that IRL, might hurt other's feelings... :(",24Apr2020,1
168,"so i met this guy a month ago at a bar by my college, we came back to my place hooked up and then he left for spring break. we snapchatted a little bit, but once he got back he wanted to hang out all the time. i ended up getting very drunk and losing my virginity to him, and afterwards he said he didn’t believe it because i was “so hot”. since then we had been snapchatting and hanging out all the time. i have been friends with two of his friends (brothers) for almost 2 years and once he found out i hung out with them he would get really jealous and ask them what they were doing with me, but never mentioned anything to me. my friend told me guy would ask about me and my friend asked if i was a side piece or if he was trying to make me a main piece and he replied that he didn’t know how i felt. after sex, last week he asked me where we were going, and since it was so out of nowhere i didn’t give him an answer and changed the subject. last weekend we were at the same get together and his roommate was hanging around me (very drunk) trying to tickle and roughhouse. he seemed to get jealous and told his roommate he was taking him home. he then left without saying bye (which is super unlike him because he usually asks me to go with him). i texted him asking if he was mad at me and he said nooo and i asked why he was acting like that and tell me what i’m doing wrong and he said he just needs to be alone sometimes. i told him i totally get it and then he just opened that and left it alone. he then calls my friend i introduced him to that night (that has hooked up with his roommate that i set up) and begged to come over (presumably to hookup). we haven’t talked since and it’s been almost week. do i reach out, or do i just not say anything?",24Apr2020,1

171,So basically my friends mom is crazy. She’s a super religious Muslim and is making my friend fast for religious reasons. Usually this would be fine but the problem is she has a disorder where she gets terrible migraines and once got sent to the ER cause she couldn’t walk and they are triggered by not eating. Her mom also stopped her taking medicine for this recently even though she should still be taking this. Her mom has done other crazy stuff before and is borderline verbally abusive. If she tries to steal some food her mom will probably find out and punish her so she’s not going to do that. With ER’s flooded with COVID cases it’s not good for her to go there (plus her mom is still risking her safety). I want to help her and I’m scared for her but idk what to do.

My mum and sister threw a massive hissy fit and called me ""immoral"", unethical"" and ""cruel"", which I denied, claiming it was 'incidental' whilst admitting that I was 'inexperienced' at defecating in places that are not toilets or longdrops which led to me not remembering to bury my shit in the compost (I highly doubt there are many people who have shat in their personal gardens, let alone in vegetated areas accessible to people).

179,"Hi all,
I feel like this question is more suited for r/financialindependence but you can't ask these style of questions there so here we are. This is a throwaway account I'm using to ask this question as I'd like to remain anonymous. 

My partner and I officially joined the FIRE movement last year and since then I've been wanting to start a blog to document our journey. I mostly want to do this because unlike many others in this journey, we're not high earners. With both incomes combined, we make &lt;$60000 a year post tax -for now anyways... I've seen other blogs of people who are either experts and have attained their goal or others who are high earners and will reach their goals very soon. I feel like I can connect with those in the lower income bracket like us, tell our story to inspire them and they can also see, in real time, what's working and what isn't. If our content can help at least one person, that'll be great. 

I'm very passionate about this movement and I love writing but I'm have second thoughts about starting this blog because we are not experts in the FIRE community whatsoever. Would our content be of interest to anyone? Please let me know what you guys think.",24Apr2020,1

181,"Some back story: My mother was diagnosed with cancer about 11 months ago (she is currently set to pass away in a month or two). 
When she was first diagnosed I decided to do a Uni course that was close to home but one I didn’t really feel thrilled about (as I had just finished high school).
I started looking after my three younger siblings before our father came back into our lives. He was great at the start, supportive and such. But soon he started to change, became nitpicky, aggressive, and disrespectful to my siblings, mum and I. He’s trying to see a psychologist for it and still sometimes becomes the supportive person he was at the start, but it doesn’t usually last long.

I’ve recently gotten the opportunity to apply for my dream course, the problem is I would have to move hours away from the home. I wouldn’t start the course (by deferring) until Mid year 2021 which does give some time for thorough planning. Mum always says she wants our lives to go on after her death. The problem is leaving behind my siblings. I don’t know if I feel entirely comfortable leaving them with dad. I don’t want them to feel like I’ve abandoned them with someone who is fairly narcissistic. But I also want a life of my own, to have the possibility of accomplishing these goals I’ve had for years.

193,"
I am a 31-year-old female and have been working with my boyfriend (48) on and off. I help him out in some of his work projects, and he pays me.
He gave me his work laptop, not personal, and I was working from there. I remember I needed to search for a word meaning on google, so I opened up Mozilla and went to the google bar and when I began typing. His search history shows up, and I can see that he typed the name of this woman he went out a couple of times with (not a relationship nor nothing serious). They were just getting to know each other, but there was never a relationship between them.

They happened to have met in their work environment in August of 2016. They added each other on Facebook since then he talked to me about her a couple of times about how beautiful, precious, and supermodel looking she is. That she had this excellent management job in a luxury building residential on the beach, this is where they met. My boyfriend was one of the engineers working on building maintenance at that time. She was like the project manager.

I started feeling a little insecure because he talked so highly about her physicality. He told me she was a diva and was always flirting with every man in that building plus other negative aspects about her.

The times that he has mentioned this woman to me, he would always start with, “this girl is gorgeous, she looks like a model. All the women that lived in the building told her what an amazing coke bottle body she had. That all these rich men driving expensive cars were after her, sending her flowers, messages, etc.” Then he would start saying all her negative traits and why he did not like her anymore and that she was empty, was too much of a diva, and that he saw her true colors.


Another thing is they were about to have sex,They had promised each other to wait a little longer because this girl was very hurt and vulnerable at this time. They went out because her boyfriend had dumped her and right away married an ex from his past. One night they went out to his apartment they started drinking wine, dancing, and of course, they ended up kissing in bed, she was in panties and bra and he in boxers.He said they just cuddled. He was truthful because I found some messages between them in which is more than evident that they didn’t have sex.


To me, the fact that they did not make love is weird, like if something happened and he did not want to proceed. I don’t buy the whole “let’s wait longer” promise; otherwise, she would not have ended up in little clothing when they were together.

He told me that he was delighted that God took her out of his way. Nevertheless, he still has her on Facebook. For some reason, he always mentions the building where she worked in or thinks that some random person lives there. He always ends up saying it. He does not know in any way shape or form that I am aware that he has her on Facebook and that I know her name as well.

Now I found out he has searched for her on google on several occasions. What can I do to understand the reason why he is still searching for her. It does not even make sense because he has her on Facebook.

Why so much obsession with the building, with this woman, at least this is what I feel here. This seems as if all of this deeply impacted him in that particular moment in his life, and for some reason, he can’t get over it.


The way he talked about this woman sounds like if he has never seen anything better, which is ridiculous. She is pretty, but not anything different or special. I don’t get this at all, especially when they have never had a relationship or were even boyfriend and girlfriend!",24Apr2020,1

203,"So, I have some self-created problems that have been piling on themselves over the past 6 or so years. When I was 14 (20 now) I was really insecure about my identity and made up a bunch of things about myself that acted as ""barriers"" between me and everyone else. My rationale was ""I'll make up this half-fake personality, and then, at least if people don't like me, it's a 'character' they don't like, not the real me.""

I was homeschooled through highschool, and I was pretty lonely. I didn't intend to like... catfish anybody, I just wanted to feel cool. So I lied about my accomplishments. I lied and said I was older (16, so ""22"" now). I lied and said I was going to a prestigous college for engineering (when I'm so bad at math it's funny, though I had/have an appreciation for it). I took on a cooler-sounding name and thought I was trans (tumblr crowd.) but have realized I'm not (not knocking anyone who is of course) but didn't know how to backpedal on something like that in a ""correct"" way. (I've tried seguing into ""nonbinary"" but I think it just confused people more because they thought I was ""gay"" (as in, for other \[trans\] guys) but it turns out I'm just boyish and into girls... *yep*.)  I've lied about stuff like having my first drink, and being close to graduation to maintain the lie.

I made a bunch of friends online, good people I've had strong rapports with for six years now, which is kind of astonishing to think about because I've never had friends that long in-person. We voice chat and have deep talks and support eachother and send eachother Christmas gifts and play DnD, but they totally accepted this identity I presented. No questions.

Today, I have hobbies outside the net that make me less desperate for attention/approval - actually going to college and socializing face to face worked wonders. So I'm older now, and every day I feel sick of my own lies. I don't want to hurt my friends. When we were acquaintances, I didn't think they'd stick around so the lies wouldn't matter, but they did. I've wanted to stop pretending to be this ""character"" for years now.

I kind of have the urge to ditch all social media (and have gone on actual hiatus in the past, but I felt like being unplugged was actually detrimental because I like getting to interact with people from all around the world, y'know? it's a unique experience that being online allows) or to start a total blank slate - but even friends aside, I'm a digital artist, and art student, and have been building a mild following (\~1000 on twitter and insta) which would be hard to build up from 0 again. Plus, I'm starting to get published and I really wish I could connect my real name to my online presence so I could have a better shot in the industry.

This is the post in question. I thought it'd be nice to share my opinion based off what I know.
I didn't expect someone to get so aggresive about it. So I wasn't prepared for the name calling and stuff. He claimed I name called first but I don't think I did?

I don't want to sound like a dumb child but I really want advice on how to cope with it I guess? Thank you.",24Apr2020,1

207,"Hey everyone. I haven’t beed feeling good at all these last few days because since I’m home most of the time now because schools closed, I’ve had more time to think about myself. I’m 15M and I’m a sophomore in high school. 

Now onto my issue: I genuinely dislike showing my arms since I’m really skinny and I’m made fun of because my arms are so skinny. I’m around 137 pounds (or around 62 kg) and I’m 5’11 (or 180 cm). I don’t like the fact that I’m skinny. My mom teases me for it and it makes me feel horrible. I don’t have any motivation to gain fat or muscle mass at all. My girlfriend says I’m perfect the way I am but I just hate myself. I just want to look as good as I can for her. She likes me the way I am right now but I don’t like myself. I’ve always been made fun of for how skinny I am overall. My mom usually says how my little brother has more muscle and weight than me and it’s true. He was born what you could call ‘fat-strong’ or something similar. My dad has made comments on my weight as well in the past like “you got to be a man” or “you want to be a shrimp when you go back to school?” During a summer break. My girlfriend also jokingly said that she has more muscle on her arm than me and yea it’s true, so it really hurt. Especially since my mom made a comment about it before hand and another one in the morning. But my little brother is always calling me skinny in a very mean way and telling my mom stuff like “he’s so skinny because he doesn’t eat” like I’m not even there right in front of me. He’s only 2 years younger than me but both my parents are easier on him than me since I’m the oldest. Each and every comment made about my weight really hurts me, especially about my arms so I always wear a hoodie.

So does anyone have any advice on how I should chance my diet or start working out? Or how to love myself more? Any advice will be greatly appreciated.",24Apr2020,1
208,"Before I explain I want to mention I suffer from anxiety and depression 

Before the quarantine, me, my friend group, and this girl were ok with each other. Everything was fine until we had to go into quarantine and lockdown. We faced timed a lot in the first days of quarantine. But as the days progressed I started bottling up anxiety but what made it worse was the drama going on inside our friend group. In result of that drama, one of our friends left and she said some hurtful and heartbreaking things to me. Which made my anxiety grow, at the same time this girl I’ve been best friends with started leaving me on delivered more often and stopped valuing me equally to the others in the friend group. 

I stopped joining the FaceTimes after the drama and started to recuperate but I couldn’t let go of the fact that I would lose my friends and my girl best friend. another reason to why I stopped joining the FaceTimes was because I felt like I wasn’t funny I was loosing my sense of humor. I tried really hard to be funny but I just couldn’t cause I know I can’t fake positivity, I didn’t really have a positive aura around me at that time. So I decided to opt for a better position.

But, I’m lonely I am plagued by loneliness. I’ve talked about this kind of stuff with my friend group and my girl best friend and they all said it was ok we’re still friends it’s gonna be ok. I’m not sure, especially with my girl best friend, I love her and I don’t want to lose her, but I just can’t keep up, I can’t join the FaceTimes because of my anxiety, everything is mixed up. she doesn’t look at me the same way because of all the times I messed up but even though I apologized and she said it was ok. 

I don’t know what to do at this point, besides work on getting my dark humor back. please, tell me it will be ok.",24Apr2020,1

My friends from school (we all finished last year) are as sensible as 18-year-olds can be (we know not to do illegal shit but still do dumb stuff like any teenager), they always encourage me to socialize with them. Every time I get invited to events like hanging out or sometimes invited overnight for SUPERVISED drinking (by an adult), I have to decline because of my parents say that I am not allowed or they don't want me too because they ""had a bad habit of drinking"", or they interrogate me on everything that I will be doing with my friends (I have no clue what we will do) so it ends up being a no. Also, they keep telling me to ""go outside my comfort zone and try something new"", but every time they just say no and it's taxing on my ability to talk to people and make friends.  The only time I can seem to play with my friends is on the video games that we play. I can't tell them how I feel because they won't listen and just don't care. 

Things I know:

* The world is not safe at all
* The worst place for someone is a safe place (because they don't learn or experience anything new).
* Too much alcohol is bad            
* Dumb shit happens when alcohol is part of the equation
* If I don't do anything about my social anxiety, I will have problems living in the real world

214,"I have two job opportunities. One is an independent sales position staying where I am now which I don't mind. The average sales rep in this position makes $79K/year. I could keep my cost of living low and I think I'd be good at the job. The guy an hour north of me is in the $130k-$150k area. I'd be 1099 and my income is 100% dependent on my results. It's not MLM and costs me nothing to do.

The other option involves moving 1,000 miles away to manage an underperforming autoshop. My cost of living would go up a bit and I'd probably see $75k my first year with potential for $100k+ within a couple years. It's an area I've always wanted to live in.

I didn’t really have a childhood that prepared me for a lot of life , but I  feel like that isn’t an excuse for the nothing I’ve managed to do with myself. Up until this point though , I’ve definitely used it that way. Every day , I do nothing. I clean up , and read and excersize and stuff but I do nothing to better myself , or to justify my existence in any perceivable way. I know that this all sounds like me being whiny or overexaggerating but I’m trying really hard not to lol. I graduated in 2016 and I used to have friends and stuff but now I don’t. I have no family or friends ( except my best friend who used to have nothing like me but is now starting to get their shit together and I’m really proud and happy for them but I don’t wanna get left behind lol 🙃)  , no bank account , no money, and no job or prospects. No drivers license , I’m not in school. I live with my old , boring, boyfriend I ran away from home to live with when I was 17 and I don’t want to spend my life doing this forever. He pays for everything , which is nice , but I want to do my own thing now and also I don’t even think he loves me. Before He got me my dog a year and a half ago , I barely even went outside except maybe once a week or so. When I was in high school I was really really social and I miss going out and doing things with people. 

So I want to get a job, get a mode of transport , and move out. I’d also like to find something to do with myself , and make some friends. I already walk my dog but people don’t really talk on the street especially now that it’s corona time. I want friends that are Girls but I don’t know how to meet them. I feel like I’m pretty outgoing or I can be if I had a reason to talk to someone. I like playing dnd , I would be open to trying to do a sport , and I like dancing and hanging out , I play a couple instruments but I haven’t picked them up in a long time , I used to draw and I thought I was good at it but I don’t anymore. Lol. I feel like a lifeless husk. I want things to happen so I guess it’s really just a matter of me leaving my house but like I do leave my house every day.

216,"I'm just asking for some help in this situation. I'm really not sure what to do. My roommate, who has not drank alcohol for quite a while, drank 2 bottles of wine tonight. She has not been sick, although she asked for the garbage can to be put next to her. She laid down on the floor, during our ""party"" (it's just us roommates who decided to drink together and watch movies). 

Anyway, she said that she wanted to try to sleep right there on the floor where she laid down. I have no problem with this, but I dont know if this is acceptable to just let her lay there. She knows that I have a phobia of vomit, so I think she's trying to keep my feelings in mind. I know it's silly but it is a big deal for me. Anyway, I want to know what I should do in this situation. She is still very much coherent, but I don't know if I should just leave her on the ground there, or try to get her to go to bed. Is there any issue with just letting her sleep on the ground when she is quite drunk? Do you think she would be offended if I just let her sleep on the ground? She did specially say that she just wanted to sleep there, but I dont know if I should trust that. She might be asleep by now, but I doubt it.

223,"The reason why I ask is because I live right next to my alma mater that I recently graduated from, and this apartment complex community has a lot of young people, including myself, living here.

Now, there is an old man (70 yo+) that I share a wall with. Ever since I moved in about a year ago, he has been incredibly disrespectful to me and my husband. At the beginning, we would literally be watching the NBA at 9 pm (medium level) and he would POUND on our door screaming “God damn it knock it off.” He did it so much that my husband and I have an inside joke about it. Thing is, I am definitely allowed to watch TV at 9 pm after a long day of studying for my grad exam. I almost put a note on his porch telling him to learn how to communicate with people if he has a problem with them. I decided against the note. He has been living here way longer than I have and is friends with the owner of the complex. I decided to bite my tongue. The other people we share a wall with have never said anything.

Just recently, a young woman and her infant child moved in above me and the old man. I went to get something from my car, and saw the old man cursing out someone. Apparently it was her move in day and her mother came to help her move in. The old man complained about the noise (I was home all day, didn’t hear a damn thing) and IT WAS 3 PM and he’s telling this old lady to go fuck herself while her grandchild is right there, while she’s telling him to back off. After that, I lost any shred of respect for this man. Looks like he found someone new to bully here. If he quietly gave a warning, I’d have so much respect for him, but he chose to curse all of us out. Funny, at 6 am he wakes up and slams his door but we’re all supposed to just keep mum. 

Anyways, sorry for the long post, but I’m at a loss here. What should normal “quiet” hours be in an apartment complex where you share a wall? It’ll be 10 pm on a Friday and he will pound on the door.

I (M/21) have been attending a local college as a Digital Game Design major for three years now. I actually really enjoyed all of the DGD classes I took in my first three semesters of college, and working in game development is totally what my eyes are set on as a career. My parents and grandparents have been extremely supportive of me taking this path. My cousin six years older than me failed out of college in her first year and has been pretty heavily looked down upon by my family ever since. She’s been getting her act together slowly, but both my parents and grandparents have kind of pointed to her as “what will happen to you if you don’t graduate”.

The truth is, I have been thinking about dropping out for a while. My first three semesters were challenging, but I knew I was getting what I needed to get out of the classes in my major. The three semesters I’ve gone through since then have progressively spiraled further out of control. It’s not my GPA that was the problem at first. Really, I felt lost forcing myself through general ed classes and electives for the sole purpose of hitting an arbitrary credit requirement. I was getting the work done, but by this point I had taken nearly all of the classes in my major that I could take before graduation. I couldn’t stand knowing exactly what I wanted to pursue, but being completely unable to actually put work into it. Instead, I had to relegate my time to things that weren’t going to help me in my career in the slightest. Even worse, those classes left me no time to at least pursue those ambitions on my own time.

Some of the electives were fun at first, but I soon saw subjects that I found interest in (film/writing) turn into chores. Rather than freely exploring a subject I really wanted to explore, I was rigidly strung along a narrow path with demanding deadlines piling up each week. It quickly became a cycle of being driven away from completing schoolwork on time, and I started cutting classes frequently because of the stockpiling stress and anxiety I felt around assignments. I knew I had to do them, but no part of me felt any use in actually doing them. It looped like this often, and I miraculously got through those two semesters with solid grades. You would never have known how much those semesters were whittling me down from my GPA, but by this point college had more than began to eat away at me. 

My mental health was getting significantly worse from enduring an education I didn’t want to pursue anymore. I’ve battled a lot with mental health for the majority of my life, and withour hesitation I can say that this semester has been the definitive low point of my life. To not spend too much time on personal things (this post is already getting way too long), I made some mistakes that caused a close friend to leave, and another friend of mine took his life in February. That was the first major death I’ve had to go through in my life, and as I’m sure you could expect it was really difficult and weighed down on my mental health even more. There have also been some other things going on at home that have made it hard for me to feel comfortable. February through April are just historically low times for me to begin with, and with the craziness in the world from COVID? It’s unreal. Keeping my mental health in mind right now has been difficult, and I’ve been having suicidal thoughts on the worse days. And yet, there’s still online classes to get through, despite all of this.

I couldn’t do it. I started off the semester shaky as it was, but the switch to online classes was the finishing blow. I started blowing off every class, every assignment. I stopped reading my emails, and though the weight of the stockpiling missing assignments weighed on my mind every day, I had to try distracting myself from it all for my own health, which continued to deteriorate. At the time I’m writing this, I’ve failed every class I enrolled in this semester. Through a culmination of familial/societal pressures, a loop of task aversion and guilt from aversion, failing classes, the poor state of my mental health, and generally feeling lost and hopeless going through college currently, I’ve finally come to the conclusion that I want to drop out. I’ve been forcing myself to try and walk a path to success that I don’t think is right for me, and I want to finally take the leap and walk my own path.

I don’t want my decision to sound like a kneejerk reaction, because I understand that it’s not worth throwing three years of progress away because of three shitty months. In reality, this semester has served as a mandatory wake up call to me that I am not happy. I’m not happy going to college and pretending it’s right for me. I know from the bottom of my heart that I’m not made for college. The education system never truly meshed well with me since middle school (I sometimes even contemplated dropping from high school). I really tried to lie to myself to convince myself otherwise for the past few years, but I truly do believe I’m not compatible. I need to walk my own path to success.

And I still do have ambition! I still want to get a job in the gaming industry, and plan to work on setting myself up for that immediately following dropping out. I have a couple of small games I’ve wanted to make for a while, but had no time because of college. My plan going forward for the next few months would be to start one of those projects and put time into developing it every week so that I actually have something to show when looking for an entry-level job. Also on the subject of jobs, I do have a part-time job that I could easily pick up more hours at (my boss has regularly left the offer of picking up more days on the table), so it’s not like I’d be lounging around like a degenerate running up my parents’ bills. 

But how the hell do I tell my parents ANY of this? After all the money they and my grandparents have spent, their ongoing pressure, and the general stigma around dropping out, I’m truly fearful they won’t respect or even acknowledge my decision.
I would be willing to pay rent to live at home and pay for my own food, phone, etc. until I could afford to leave. I would maybe even consider leaving home for a little while to let the situation cool down if it explodes like I’m worried it might. But with coronavirus, that’s not a possibility. My part-time job is also closed currently because of corona, so I couldn’t realistically sustain rent at the moment to begin with. There’s also the issue that I’ve never told my parents anything about my struggles with mental health. I’ve bottled it for years at this point, but if I’m explaining my decision to drop out to them, there’s no doubt I’m going to have to talk about that too. My parents have always been pretty hard on me when it comes to education and when they think I’m being lazy and not trying, they get furious at me. They want me to “set a good example” for my two younger brothers who are still in high school, and considering their view of my cousin, I don’t think they’re primed to take kindly to my idea of “following my own path”. I made the decision that I’m going to tell them tomorrow before this gets even further out of hand, but I have absolutely no idea how to approach such a sensitive topic.

From the bottom of my heart, I appreciate anyone who took the time to read through all of this so much. I’m sorry if this came off overly melodramatic, but it’s the truth of what I’ve been feeling. Please give me some advice lmao

227,"Starting from the beginning, a girl replied to my Instagram story saying ""omg you're so cute"" and I said thanks. A year passed and I ride the metro bus from school with her. We dont interact we're just riding the same bus. I subconsciously get into skateboarding because that girl likes skateboarding. And I ask her about where to buy one and she helps me out. And for a good 2 weeks we didn't interact again besides that. But she asked me if I ever found a good skateboard. And I told her that I was building my own longboard which I was. From then it just sprouted into normal text small talk. And we kind of got to talking on a regular basis. And eventually I hang out with her in the halls during lunch period and I remember her wanting to give me a hug during that time and she said I was a good hugger. And she wanted me to walk her back to class. But with all this she was being very coy about it so I was playing it safe with all this so as to not creep her out or make her feel uncomfortable. One day while we were in the halls with her friend we were joking and suff and somehow we ended up in the bathroom with the lights turned off. Not knowing what to do and not wanting to fuck it up I just stood there awkwardly until the bell rang(which was only 2 mins).Up until December we kept talking. Then she just stopped talking to me.

I could list a million reasons as to why I think they hate me but its 12am and I'm too lazy to write. This has been bothering me all week and before I do anything I might regret, I wanted to hear what other people thought. Maybe it is all in my head, or maybe it isn't just want to know- should I leave? Delete my account and never come back? Or should I stay, and keep pretending that everything is okay?",24Apr2020,1

235,"I work as a dominos delivery driver. My manager and my general manager got into a dispute where the manager asked the owner to sit in on a meeting with her and the gm because she was worried about losing her job if she confronted the gm on her own. 

A few days later the gm comes to me and tells me the manager is being demoted, the gm knew I was friends with the manager so she told me personally. 

The next day I call the gm to talk about it and try and change their mind over the decition because the manager in question is very good at her job. It doesnt work, shes still demoted. 

The next time the gm and I are alone in the store they ask me to talk to them and tell me that they were disappointed in my call because they thought I was calling to ask for a promotion and instead I stood up for the manager. 

They tell me that they want to promote me to be a manager, they say things like they want a manager who wont speak out of turn and who will be a slave to the store. I'll have to make sacrifices like working 60-70 hours a week. They tell me that if I agree they can help move my career forward. If I move they can get me transferred to a different store, etc. 

They emphasize that they want me to be loyal to them and not the manager who I stood up for. And that it doesnt matter that I've only been there for 2 months or that I'm not experienced enough in my job, they can do good things for the people who are loyal to them. 

I told them I was interested in being a manager but I felt it would be inappropriate to ask so soon after being hired. They said that it didnt matter that I was new.

239,"So at the beginning of March my school schedule changed and I am taking computer science.The class is pretty hard and it is a required course. 

I was struggling and I’m the type of person that it takes a lot for me to ask for help, especially academically. It became especially hard when my school became online for the rest of the year. 

So I went online and I found solutions to my code hs assignments and copied and pasted them.  If you aren’t familiar with code hs it’s this really fun coding site(NOT)  

My teacher found out, and I don’t believe I was the only one that was doing it. I’m pretty sure she found out for these reasons
A- I failed this little quiz 
B- Teachers can see if you’ve copied and pasted on stuff.

She did send me an email and was very chill about it and mentioned that if I needed help she was always there and she would give me credit if I redid the assignments. But there’s so many I haven’t gotten to it. I did send back a very very apologetic email. 

She had a baby, meaning we have a new teacher. She mentioned that she would update the grades. 

This new guy is alright, he helped me the other day with my code, I think that he still knows that I’m struggling. We’ve been emailing back and forth a lot lately, school related purposes of course. 

Code hs has these little quizzes, and I took one today and I failed it, 5/15. Not good. 

I’ll be honest, I have cheated still, but not copy and pasted. 

I emailed him that I failed it and I asked if it was going to be curved. But he never got back to me, does he suspect that I’m cheating?

I was greedy

She didn't deserve anything that happened.

Not to say she isn't without her flaws, shes manipulative and very good with it and played me for a lot of things too.

My mother always gets mad when I don’t want to hang out with people or join in with things like youth group or whatever. She thinks that I am a narcissist and believe myself to be better than everyone, she yells at me all the time about how I am not better than everyone and how I should stop thinking that way because it make me look bad. 
That’s so far from how I actually feel. I feel so below everyone, so unworthy of love and affection. I can’t even put it into words. 
I need my mom to understand but I don’t know how to tell her. She doesn’t want to talk about mental health, as if it isn’t real.

242,"My ex and I met in September of 1999. We were teenagers. I fell for him instantly, according to his friends and my sister he felt the same way. He got into drugs and was in and out of jail for 4 years so I walked away in our early 20's. I ended up marrying someone else, so did he. Then he got a divorce and met someone else. I ended up getting a divorce and dated but nothing ever felt right. We ended back up together in 2016. He promised he had changed, he was off drugs, he had a kid with a woman who hurt him pretty bad but their relationship was over, and he wanted to try with me again now that he had changed. Things were wonderful, he even talked about moving into my house and us trying for a baby. Then he disappeared after a year and a half. He said nothing to me for 2 months. I found out he got his daughter's mother pregnant again during some drinking binge. When he finally talked to me about it, he said he wished he could change what happened but he felt the need to be with her over me because of the kids. He promised me that he never meant to hurt me and that he never lost feelings for me but the kids came first but he would never marry this woman. I accepted it and just laid low because I was still hurt but I understood why he would want to be there for his kids. He then proposed to her 6 months later. I lost it because he had lied to me again about her. I blocked him and was trying to keep my mind off of him. I saw 2 different therapists, dated, hung out with friends every chance I had, worked extra shifts, and even took up more hobbies. Then I met my most recent boyfriend via a dating app. At first he seemed great. He said he didn't have any kids, no crazy ex stories, he had his own place and income, and lived near his mom (not with her) so he could help her after she had a stroke. He really seemed like a wonderful man and I had won the relationship jackpot. A few dates in he said he was curious if we knew the same people so he started talking about his longtime friends. When a mutual friend of ours came up, I was super excited. This friend he mentioned is like my brother and I talk to his wife all the time. That was when he said ""so you must know xxxxxx......"" while smiling. He knew my ex. I asked how close he and my ex were, he said they just gamed on occasion, maybe see each other a few times per year but not close. So I asked if he was ok that I had been with his friend. He said it wasn't an issue. A few of my friends said they thought it seemed fishy but I wrote it off as a coincidence.

Jump ahead 10 months. My ex and the woman he cheated on me with had broken up and he needed a place to stay so he showed up at my boyfriend's place. That was when everything started to fall apart or come together so to speak. My super sweet boyfriend started talking about my ex a lot. I would say that all I want to know is if he is ok because his break up was rough and my boyfriend would start telling me that he thinks my ex still has feelings for me. Then my boyfriend started telling me that he could cheat whenever he wanted and gave me specifics on who and when he could have done it. It hurt and I asked him if that was what he wanted. He said no but that still really hurt me. A week later he told me my ex was his best friend and he probably should have told me. THEN he said my ex started calling me the chick his best friend was ""banging"" to my own sister and it just escalated from there. I finally broke up with my recent boyfriend because all I was doing was crying from what felt like emotional abuse with the cheating threats and making me feel like an object instead of a human being. It hurt so much to do it but I couldn't get past everything he said to me over the last month. I talked to my sister last night, she said my ex never told her his best friend (my boyfriend) was just banging me and that my ex still loved me but was so ashamed of what happened when he cheated that he can't face me. I am a wreck. I have been trying so hard to get past this and he just keeps looping back into my life one way or another. I feel so torn. I am not planning on dating anytime soon nor can I hang out with friends because I am a high risk of getting COVID-19 due to my job so I don't have anyone to really distract me from this.

There was a shooting Monday. Guy was popular. Sheriff dept posts a shooting update on their page. I read it and the comments. I don't like anything..i dont comment on anything.

Later that day I receive a message from them with the same shooting update. Along with it they wrote ""Hey Chris, please let us know if there's anything we can help you with.""

Im like wtf that's weird. My page is so private and discreet. I dont comment or like so i dont know how they found me. I delete the message and go on with my day.

Tonight I see they messaged me AGAIN with the shooting update with the same message. I respond "" Why do you guys keep writing me about this??"" They look at the message but don't respond. 

This is so random and giving me anxiety. My page says another city..i live in another city so why/how would they contact me?? My friends list is private. I dont post anything. I saw no one else make posts about being contacted.

It cant be an automatic message because of how they wrote my name it wasn't identical to my fb name so I know someone hand typed it. I deleted the fb and blocked them from messaging me.

Can y'all tell me how tf did they find me and why tf do they keep messaging me about this damn shooting??

Dude that got shot is REALLY popular. Many family and friends. Im a random fake page that doesn't even troll..just observes. Shit is freaking me out.

Is this normal protocol?? Also I've looked at other stories on their page since then but I only got written about the shooting.

250,"Hello dear reader,

Hope all is well, and that your life isn't facing any extremities. Considering all that's wrong in the world, maybe this scenario isn't too serious.

I am in a college group project, with a group that's somewhat responsive. Well, that is responsive with everyone but myself. To make things clear, I haven't done anything to warrant any stigma. I contributed towards the project on time in acceptable quality (more than other team members).

Today, the group was very communicative discussing a potential meeting. There was even someone who couldn't make it and received kind support.

Meeting time

Someone in the group chat asked for the meeting ID, which was given immediately. As I went to join, I noticed it was password locked. It was at this point I asked for the password.

No response - meeting in session but I guess I'm not invited

To this minute my ignored message sits at the bottom of the group chat. This pattern is getting disheartening, because I can't think of a good reason why. I feel like there is a guy in the group who doesn't like me and I'm not sure why. He tends to ignore me (frequently, when I directly communicate with him) and attempts to one up me any time I contribute.

During their meeting and afterwards I did about half the project. To give a glimpse of my personality, I'm dreading the fact someone's going to claim credit for my work (it has happened every semester so far).

Guess I need some peace of mind.
What should I do?
Be the bigger person and do nothing?
Confront them with an explicit explosion?

If you read this far, it only feels natural to thank you.
So, uh, thanks and best wishes",24Apr2020,1
251,"Hello reddit, this is my first ever post. I honestly don’t know how I can deal with this anymore so I’m seeking for advices. I apologize in advance if things are out of place and don’t make sense, this is very hard for me to type.



A little back story.
I had an abusive relationship with this guy (we will call him Jack) back in 2015, he would say the nastiest things to me, cheat and then accuse me of cheating when I found out, demanded all of my passwords and he would get really angry if I changed them, had his friends hacked onto my social media etc. It was to a point where I almost committed suicide. I was 17. It was one of the best day of my life when I was finally able to break up with him because I tried to break up with him many times before but he would make a lot of fake accounts on social media just to harass me and say bad things. This whole thing left me with a lot of trauma.



Now, it has been 5 years and Jack has not tried to contact me until a month ago. He somehow found my facebook and sent me a whole paragraph saying how he is sorry and he would like to be friends still and wants to pay back. I thought he had finally grow up, so I said I do not want to be friends with him and I hope he carries on with his life and treat his next woman nicely. I also told him that the relationship caused a lot of issues for my mental health. He replied saying he is sorry and he didn’t know it would do that. I stopped replying, he would change the chat settings and stuffs to try to get my attention but i ignored all that. Two days later, he made another account trying to talk to me, and since he didn’t take no when i was being nice, I went off on him. I was really pissed off that he is doing the same thing he did years ago. I’m also feeling really anxious and creeped out because he would not stop messaging me. I talked to my current boyfriend but he just told me to not give Jack a response because he is looking for a reaction out of me. Jack finally stopped after I said stop harassing me for a numerous times. And I thought he finally got it.

Today, Jack found my instagram. I didn’t have instagram when we were together so he must have stalked really hard to find me. He sent me a paragraph again saying he thinks we can be good friends again someday, blaming how he treated me on an online game we both played, that if I visit a state near him he would travel to see me or he would just transfer to my university. The last time he messaged me I was hostile but the sweetness balances it out etc.. at this point, I am honestly scared. He lives in the east coast and I live on the west. I tried to not give him any response but he kept making accounts to harass me again. I told my boyfriend about what he said, my boyfriend was pissed off but he doesn’t think there’s anything he can do to help with this situation. Which I understand because it’s a problem from my past and it is not fair to drag him into this. 

What can I do reddit? I even threatened the guy that I would report him to the authorities if he keeps trying. This is so draining and I’m so scared. Please help.

They geniunely think I am a good friend. One time they told me they had a fear of rejection. And now I feel like I can't reject them.

269,"My brother is pretty much the star member of his school track and field team. He broke records and ran races and got some interest by some colleges.

But because of the whole coronavirus situation, school was cancelled and now we’re studying at home. Obviously that means he can’t do track and is missing out on a lot of scholarship opportunities.

He’s kind of gotten over the fact since he was so bummed out about it, but he keeps telling us that he wants to go to a school that can’t give him scholarships anymore since track is done. 

He has some other schools in mind but they don’t have the reputation or have a solid sports team in general. So obviously the first choice is the best choice in his eyes.

But this schools really tough and expensive, and while he’ll definitely do well on the track team, he definitely won’t do well in academics since his grades aren’t the best to begin with and he needs all the time he gets to focus.

We tried talking to him about community colleges in order for it to be less expensive in the long run, but he really wants to do track as soon as possible again.

How do I go about telling him to be realistic? I’m obviously not trying to get between his passion, but if he goes to a school with a ridiculously high tuition with barely any scholarships, how are we supposed to support that?",24Apr2020,1
270,"Hey, so I wanted to give an quick intro about myself. I'm 25 years old, graduated university with my BA, worked my way to a full-time job, and found a room that I can afford rent. When the COVID-19 hit, I lived in a place that was the epicenter of the virus, my housemate didnt believe in it (so I didn't feel safe living in that place b/c he's probably not going to sanitize the areas enough, the housemates share one bathroom, I share the house with a nurse and I can't imagine being around my housemate's loud kids 24/7 especially now i'm WFH x__x). So I decided to leave that rented room vacant for now and move in to my boyfriend's parents house. Here's a little history back then a few years back when things were normal: when I lived with my parents, we constantly got into fights. After I moved out, our relationship improved immensely. That was because I was able to balance having my freedom and independence living on my own while still being able to visit them almost every weekend. I have been living free from my parents for almost a year now.

I grew up with an strict filipino mom that still believes in very traditionalist ways. Just to give an example, I have a friend who is my age who moved in with her boyfriend and is raising a child. She looked down on her for moving in with her boyfriend before marriage even though she's obviously happy! There were times before where I have lived with my boyfriend for a short duration and never has she accepted it. 

For this pandemic, I moved in with my boyfriend because his parent's house was quieter, bigger, it was closer to my job, and I trusted that his family was taking safety precautions to protect themselves against COVID compared to my housemates. As for my parent's house, it's quite full. My grandma, cousin, and aunt share one room, my parents share one room, and my two sisters have their own rooms. The only room vacant is the family room that opens to the kitchen, so I don't exactly have privacy. I also just prefer to live with my boyfriend. And as I said earlier, my relationship with my parents is a lot better when I don't live with them. 

I'm fine visiting my parent's house once in awhile but she clams up everytime I move back in with my boyfriend. She has this expectation that ever since the COVID-19 hit, everyone my age has moved back in with their families and compares me to them, yet there are also so many others who continue living with their housemates, live in their own apartments, or are also living with their boyfriends. I wish she would understand that I could still show I care by visiting but not moving in, but she berates me about me moving in with my bf a lot and told me she's ashamed to talk about me with the family. I offered that I could visit in the weekend, but she literally told me she rather not have me visit because she didn't want me to be a reminder to the family that I live with my boyfriend. So she chooses to save face over me visiting. It's like she cannot be satisfied with meeting in the middle. I either move back in or I don't visit at all. 

Idk. Though matter what I say, she chooses her traditional views over actually listening to me. I know this is a sticky situation to ask advice on, but I also wanted to reach out to the individuals also experiencing this just to know that hey, i'm not alone.",24Apr2020,1

I learnt from research that California is preventing people from being kicked out of their Apartment until May 31st due to COVID19, so he should be able to stay even when he can not pay, thankfully.

He has yet to find a job even after constant applying.

274,"Hello, F20 here. Just a little about my situation: I'm living at home since the college apartments are home and I come from a 2nd generation Asian family. 

I'm having trouble gaining personal freedom from my parents, especially now since I am stuck at home. I feel like their strictness has  affecting my relationship with them in a negative way. 

The trouble is that I basically can't do anything by myself: I cant drive by myself, can't go to the store by myself, can't visit people or go to other people's houses, can't go to the doctors or make appointments by myself. When I try to, they just tell me no in this tone that basically sounds like the ""are you kidding me"" tone. It's not like I'm going to buy a unicorn from a man in the forest or anything. Im just trying to do every day things that young adults need to learn how to do. 

This trend has continued since high school whenever I've had to come back for vacations. I think this led me to not want to interact with them because I'm afraid that I'm going to say something wrong and they're just going to discipline me. I think this is also why I dont really call or text them when I'm in college and they dont really hear from me weeks at a time. 

I personally thought maybe that this was only because I was considered a teen, but I still get this behavior as a 20 year old. I feel like if this keeps happening, I'm just going to stay in my college town during breaks and move straight into an apartment once I graduate and get a job. I know this will make them extremely unhappy, especially if I decide that this relationship with them seems overly toxic for me. I dont understand why they let me have so much freedom and not even care to text and ask about what I do at college, but once I come back home, I just can't do anything without their permission/assistance. 

I know they're just overprotective and want me safe, but the world is a wonderful place that I want to be independent in. I can't keep being sheltered forever. 

Any advice or your thoughts? Maybe I'm just looking at this the wrong way. Anything is appreciated.

TLDR: my parents' overprotective nature is now straining my relationship with them and I want to be independent",24Apr2020,1

276,"I’m a 16Y/O student. I don’t see a future for myself. I don’t have any aspirations, any desires, any idea about what I want to pursue as a career. I feel always feel disappointed whenever the question  “What do you want to do when you graduate?” comes up. Not disappointed at the person asking, but rather, myself; because the moment they ask that question, I always have the same response. “What DO I want to do?”, “What will I be doing in 10 years time?”. 

These feelings of uncertainty, insecurity, and fear have taken over my mindset and I just want to go back to a time where I didn’t have any responsibilities.  Everyone always says, “You have time to decide what you want to do. And if you ever want to change what you’re doing, it’s perfectly fine.” But such words feel so empty, as if it were a memorized speech to make you feel as if you aren’t already a failure. 

I used to be headstrong but now..? Now I rant about my feelings on the Internet, never telling an actual soul about my feelings in person, never building an actual connection, no bonds. At some point, I started to give up on myself. I let go of any expectation of what I could achieve and I just stopped doing academic work. I found no reason to continue. I closed my eyes and accepted the waves wrapped around me. I felt no surprise at disappointment anymore. I accepted failure. I never strived for perfection anymore. I don’t know why I’m like this; maybe I do know why, but WHY? Rhetorical question, I know.

Only at night, I lay in bed and miss the connection we had. I miss being in his arms, playing with his hair, and being so close to each other. I miss the feeling of comfort, I miss how welcomed I felt with him and his family. But when I wake up, I want all of that but with a relationship, I need to be theirs and only theirs and if not I feel cheated on. But I don’t want a relationship with him because he doesn’t deserve me, and he will just take advantage by not appreciating my worth and pushing me away again. So I’m stuck 

A little background info... we were together for 9 months, and this was our second break up, he was the one breaking up with me because he needed to focus on himself and didn’t see me as a priority in his life. I understood and hoped for the best and still wished to be his friend. I give him all his stuff back a couple days after the breakup, I was totally over him and I knew my worth. He kept messaging me asking to hangout and how deep down he regretted dumping me. I said we needed to stay strictly friends... but after 5 days of talking it became friends with benefits. I was secretly hoping that because we were friends with benefits, soon he’d want me back as his girlfriend. I was dumb, that wasn’t the case at all, and he was getting all of my love and care without the commitment, so yesterday I told him I was done and I wanted a real relationship and not this half-assed relationship we were doing, he played the victim and screamed at me because I didn’t want to have sex anymore. I felt like shit and still feel like shit from what he said to me. It’s really over now and he wants nothing to do with me. I feel so down and sad because I want to still be in his life and I miss the comfort but I know he is a toxic and manipulative person but he’s familiar and it makes things so much harder to deal with. I’m obsessing over when or if he will text me again. I don’t want a rebound, I need to be loved. And I don’t know how to do that...",24Apr2020,1

279,"I've held an account with my cable service provider (Atlantic Broadband) for over 10 years now, every single year at my current residence. 

The first couple of years the TV/internet package was under $100 and for the most part, it was decent value. 

As most cable companies do, prices go up over time, and that was the case here as well.

However, over this past year I've noticed my bill has increased by a margin well over $100, and it's only going up every month.

I'm currently paying over **$330** every month for TV and Internet (which I believe is highway robbery).

I've even called Atlantic Broadband in order to try to negotiate a more reasonable deal.

In response, they essentially threatened to raise my prices if I were to opt out of the ""package deal"".

To add insult to injury, the internet (100 Mbs) is always giving me lag spikes during online gaming sessions (which makes it unreliable).

I can't use my own Modem or Router because Atlantic Broadband doesn't let me, I have to use their equipment and pay the rental fee monthly.

I can't switch providers because in my residential area, they hold a cable provider monopoly.

I can't get Google Fiber (Webpass) because this building where my apartment resides was built prior to 1995.

Therefore because of poor internal building wiring, that's not possible either.

Well jeez you may ask, ""Why don't you just cut off the service?"" 

Unfortunately, I can't turn off the service because my parents watch TV more often than not.

Since they're both retired and at home most of the time, it's not fair to them if I take that away.

I'm currently helping my parents pay for all the bills, and that includes cable.

If it were up to me, I would completely drop my cable provider and live off my T-Mobile Hotspot.

Especially since I've been unemployed for over a month now due to the pandemic.

Given these circumstances, it's a complicated situation all around.

&amp;#x200B;

Is there anything I can do?

Could I have the building internal wiring updated somehow?

Can I get rid of this local monopoly?

Or can I even simply negotiate a lower price?

280,"I grew up with a Chinese father who has always been abusive. In many ways, I see him as a child. He gets upset anytime people have different opinions with him and often thinks of it as talking back. Growing up, he always called me stupid and told me to shut up. I never really agreed with him which resulted in me getting yelled at. Fast forward to today, I am attending university this fall so I don't think I will ever be returning home to see him.  In Asian culture, from my experiences, this is a very common thing. I strongly dis-agree with these practices: thinking men are better than women and believing being abusive is okay. I never understood why people can't just sit down and talk things out logically without the need to be uncivilized or abusive. 

Now that you know my story, I wanted to ask what people think about this: a few days ago my mother had to do something for my sister and it resulted in us having to wait 5-10 minutes longer to eat dinner. Because of this, my father got upset and started to talk in a rude way to my mother. Tired of all his crap, I told him there is no need to say such mean things. He told me it was none of my concern and I should shut up, so I responded she had a good reason so it wasn't like she was just making us wait. My father got upset and I told him there is no need to yell, just eat dinner. Now he's upset at both my mom and me. I don't really care that he is upset at me, that is the least of my worries, but my mother, someone who has the biggest heart in the world, is sad that hes mad at her. Now I feel bad because she's sad. I just hate how poorly he speaks to my mother.

1. Would you let someone in your family be so rude and mean to another?

283,"Hi, I’m currently a 8th graded worrying about his future.  It’s one in the morning and I can’t sleep.  Here’s my story with some questions.

Throughout elementary I partook in advanced side courses select students where selected to participate in.  It’s sixth grade, my physical and mental state is healthy, I’m placed into a double accelerated math course recommended by teachers in elementary.  Nearly a month after this occurred, contrary to how I felt, I was persuaded by friends and family to drop out of that class into the only other available class being a normal class.  At the time I was unaware of the chance I was given and the decision I made.  That year I was bullied into a place of anxiety and depression.  At the time I was 12, I was placed on Zoloft.  My life had fallen into shambles from there.  I move through the summer wasting my life away inside the house.  

The start of the next year I was bullied beyond belief.  I had been pushed to the thoughts of suicide at the age of 12.  I had been put into an accelerated math class and accelerated science class.  In science I maintained an A average and I enjoyed the class.  In math however, I nearly failed my first quarter with a D.  From that point I’m, I was placed into a normal math class.  At that point, I felt that my future had turned to dust. From there on For the rest of the year, I barely passed all my classes excluding science.

The start of next year (8th grade) seemed bright and I was hopeful to set the right path.  I failed all my classes except for biology, I felt shattered.  I had so much potential and my life was perfect; I threw it all away because of some small bad decisions.

Now here I am, at home struggling to make it through online classes.  It’s nearing the end of 8th grade and my choices for classes are coming up.  I doubt I could achieve getting into chemistry or advanced English, and I will likely just be in normal maybe even remedial math.  I hoped for a brighter future but now I feel it’s just fucked.  I dreamed of getting into Cornell to study entomology but I feel that it’s all been thrown away.

What can I do to set myself up on the path to Cornell at this point?  What can I do to get into those advanced classes so late in the year?  How can I be sure if My future?

284,"This requires a little bit of context, sorry if this gets long:
 I was forced into a relationship, by a friend I no longer have contact with, with a boy (I am a lesbian) for about two years. 

I broke up with him as soon as the aforementioned friend moved away, for several reasons: He just wasn't someone I'd normally even be friends with. He was rude and immature, and had a habit of just randomly yelling, which kind of sets off my auditory issues. Even when I was with him, I felt more like a trophy girlfriend than respected.
However, after that, he insisted on being my friend, and despite my attempts and pleas for him to leave me alone, he just kept coming back. I wanted (and still do) to try find better friends that have more similar interests to me, and I felt like he was weighing me down. 

So, yesterday, he asked me for two hundred pieces of art for free (I am an artist with commissions open, this would have cost him 4k at least), for a hobby game he was making. I finally snapped at him and told him that the only reason I let him stick around was that my mother wanted me to be friends with him (I'm a little scared of her, we do not have the best relationship), and told him was was wrong.

Indeed, I had tried to help him previously, but he wouldn't change for the better. He was apparently distraught, and got his mother involved, who called my parents, who now think I was bullying him for no reason and refuse to listen to me. They called it the 'ultimate form of bullying' (I have been beaten up several times before at school and am still trying to get rid of the trauma, I would never wish the same upon anyone), and punished me by taking away most of my electronics until they think I'm suitably punished. 

I don't know how to get my parents to listen and to try fix this. I admit, telling my ex that was probably a bad move, and I was pretty harsh, but i don't want people to think I'm a bully for trying to get rid of a toxic relationship.",24Apr2020,1

So now I'm jobless and don't have any interests, I feel like I've stagnated and like my life is spiraling but I know it isn't.

Since this quarantine has started, I've just lost all motivation to do anything and everything just feels numb to me. I barely talk to my friends anymore and when I do it feels largely meaningless. Like I'm going through the motions to keep the relationships from dying, but it feels like they're dying anyways. I'm giving basic responses and try to act like everything is normal, but it just all feels empty. Texts pile up and it feels like a slog to get through them. I feel worse because many of them are having a hard time too and I can't be there for them. 

I've been doing school work at the last minute because my school has given us the option to do a credit/no credit grading system and I know I can put in minimal effort and still pass. Because I don't put in effort, I don't know the material and because of that, there have been quizzes and tests that I've cheated on by looking up the answers online. I fucking hate doing that, but I do it anyway because I feel like I can't do anything else. It feels like there's so many assignments due and concepts to learn and I don't feel like I have the time or the energy to do them. That sounds counter-intuitive since it seems all I've got is time, but it's how I feel. The days go so much faster now than they did when I was living at school. It feels like time is slipping through my fingers and all the days blend together. One minute is 10 am and the next it's midnight and I've barely done anything. It takes me longer to do everything and it seems like there's more to do.

My sleep schedule is worse than ever and it feels like I'm eating worse as well. Like I'll stay up till 5 am and wake up at 11 or 12 pm, eating periodically. I haven't gained weight, but I feel like shit. My mom has noticed, but it feels like I can't stop. 

The things I've loved before have become hollow and empty to me now. All I do is watch videos and listen to music or play games because it helps me forget. I want to stop and get better, but it feels like I'm being sucked in. I liken the feeling to slowly sinking in quicksand. I know I'm sinking, but I can't do anything about it because when I flail around to try and escape, I just get pulled back in and eventually I just want to give up. It's so much easier to just lay back and let myself be engulfed by the warm sand. It's almost comforting in a dark kind of way. 

Sorry that was long and it sounds like I'm being a whiny POS, but I just needed to write that out and get it off my chest. I feel a little better after processing through this a bit. If you've read this far, thank you. I really appreciate you taking the time to hear me out.",24Apr2020,1
292,"So, my brain in some amazing way managed to get rid of most of the basic emotional reactions - anger, sadness, hapiness, excitement, love.

293,"I recently broke up with my boyfriend of 2+ yrs. I am originally from the Midwest, but I was living in VA and taking online classes. However, since we broke up I have been planning on transferring to a different school as the only reason I was living in VA/taking classes online was bc of my boyfriend (plus I would love to live on campus). I generally decided that I would like to live in Minneapolis as it is not too far from my family, but still a pretty big city. 

So, following my breakup I started flirting/making out/ hanging out with a guy friend of mine. Nothing too serious, just casual. But, when I started looking at colleges I realized one that I was very interested in just so happened to be the school this guy goes to. This college is the most affordable private university in Minneapolis, but it is also very small (about 1k students). I really don’t want it to seem weird if I apply to this school. I feel like if I apply there it will seem like I’m going there for him? It’s definitely not, but hard to avoid that look I guess. The last time I moved was for a boy and I just really want to avoid that. 

My mom suggested pretending like I didn’t know he went there, but I’m not sure that would even work lol. Any advice? Should I even worry about it at all? Should I tell him straight up or just try to avoid the school?",24Apr2020,1
294,"So my bio dad died when I (17F) was a baby, and my mom remarried my stepdad when I was in kindergarten. He's been a major father figure for me ever since. 

My boyfriend has said this is my fault, and he's probably right. Anyway, I frequently forget to bring a towel/clothes to the bathroom when I shower. This usually means I have to make a run for it back to my room. My room is directly across the hallway from the bathroom. Takes me three steps to get there. Yet everytime it happens, my stepdad seems to be there and somehow sees me without clothes. Obviously he's never seen for more than a second. It could just be a coincidence and I'm looking too deep into things. My boyfriend says I'm to blame because I forget. 

However, tonight my mom drew a boob like this: ( • ) on my stepdad's hand. This ended up leading to everybody drawing cartoony boobs (weird bonding activity, I know). Later, when my mom was in the bathroom, my stepdad commented on how anatomically correct my drawing was, and that he'd like to see me make some anatomically correct drawings of a male and female from the front and side. He said he wanted to see how well I could draw and not to tell my mom. Presumably because she's a bit sensitive about dirty jokes etc and she thought my boob drawing was a bit too graphic. 

I ended up drawing the positions he asked for. He seemed surprised that I used references from online, as he was expecting me to do it from memory. The drawings featured smoothness where genitalia might be like any normal anatomical drawing. He said I should focus on drawing genitalia and that he would tell me why later. He wouldn't do it tonight because it was late and he was about to go to bed. 

I was uncomfortable drawing genitals and I told him as much. I don't remember what he said in response. But a few minutes later, he came back into my room and said he was trying to think of difficult things to draw aside from genitals, so he told me to draw ears and hands. 

I should mention that all the while he was asking me to do these drawings, he kept stressing that I shouldn't tell anybody. Like, over and over again. That really made me very uncomfortable because I've read that sexual predators tend to tell their victims not to tell anybody about stuff.

I could be looking too hard into things. Maybe he just really likes drawings and the bathroom runs really are just coincidences. He has bought some paintings of bodies in the past (nothing graphic. Just like classic bodies wrapped in cloth but you can still see shapes). He's been a father for me since I was so so young and has never done anything that would suggest he's a sexual predator until pretty recently. He's a deacon at my church and is a very devout Christian if that attributes anything to his character. He also tells dad jokes a lot and hates brussel sprouts.",24Apr2020,1

296,"Hello, I’m a 25 (turning 26) female who is preparing to take up a second degree this year. I have always wanted to take up fashion design ever since I was young but that time my mom didn’t want me to study outside of my hometown (during that time there was no fashion major being offered in school unlike now). My initial plan was to study fashion abroad but since we couldn’t afford it I can only do it here in my hometown. My goal is to work in a fashion company for experience first and ultimately create my own fashion brand in the future.

However, since I’m getting older my family told me I should take up something practical like nursing since they think fashion won’t get me anywhere here in my country. I was actually thinking of doing exactly that (thinking it’s probably best to give up my passion for practicality) but then I thought I probably wouldn’t be happy working as a nurse even if I have a stable job with a stable income. Also, nurses in my country are a little under-compensated and I would have to work abroad to have a really good salary, however it would take me years of experience first. The one thing that really worries me though is what artists or creative people would feel like giving up art and working at a job like this? Would one still be happy and satisfied?

299,"So, here is the story....

My wife and I have been together for over 14 years and we've known each other for longer. For about 10 of those years, our sex life was was pretty great. 

For all of my life (at least as long as I can remember) I've suffered with depression and anxiety. At one point losing so much weight, my doctors were starting to become very concerned. I have since pulled through that time in my life and am much better (although this COVID stuff is a really buzz kill). When I met my wife, I wasn't in as bad of a way, but it did gear dark for me quite a bit due to work and life. My wife has been there for a lot of it. The good and the bad. She is a wonderful person. A loving mother. And I find her extremely sexy. A soul mate. I'm constantly telling her how sexy she is. How cute she is. How much I appreciate her. At night I make sure to touch her as she likes to have my hand on her.

During that time, there were periods were I would be disinterested in sex. It was difficult for me to get in the right frame of mind. We argued over it. She felt I didn't love her (even though I did try reassurance) or didn't find her attractive. I tried to fix it. Put on a happy face. I would say that most of the time, I was extremely interested in sex. The disinterest was very much the exception. But, she felt she needed to tell me how she was feeling. So, I tried to adjust. The relevance of this will become clear in a minute.

Over the past 3+ years, she has been disinterested in sex. She has initiated sex four times in the past year. Of the past 3 years she hasn't touched, brushed against, looked at or shown any interest in my little soldier. None. 

One day I kind of had it (this was about 6 months ago). I wasn't sure how to approach the subject. She caught me thinking and acting funny and kept asking me what is wrong. I finally let up and told her about the no contact. She claims it's not me, it's her. She finds me attractive. But, zero sexual drive. After that, she did do stuff with me once. But, I get the feeling it was guilt sex for her.

Over the past few months (8 maybe?) she has been having menopause symptoms. She talked to the doctor and she is in fact menopausal. Her sex drive has diminished to zero. Maybe less than zero. Even though I am told she is still attracted to me. When I ask if she wants to have sex, I get a verrrry unenthusiastic ""Sure."" Which in turns makes me feel like crap. It wouldn't be so bad if it happened every once in awhile. But it happens. Every. Single. Time.

She is unable to take any medication like estrogen. She has a blood mutation that causes blood clots. For example, when she started birth control when she was younger, she ended up in the hospital for several days with a huge pulmonary embolism in her lung. So, those types of drugs are out.

I've brought her disinterest up twice, but she shrugs and says ""What am I supposed to do?"" I bring it up after she gives me her ""Sure"" answer and ask why say ""Sure"" when the real answer is ""No?"" She is just saying ""Sure"" to ""Keep the peace"" I think. Not that I've ever gotten angry about it. I haven't. I think she is just trying to not argue.

So, she now has menopause going on. And now I'm getting resentful. I know I shouldn't get angry with her as she cannot help it. However, when I was depressed, I also could not help not having an interest in sex. Yet, I was asked to change my behavior, see a therapist, etc. How is one uncontrollable condition different from the next? But here we are. With over 3 years of disinterested sex (my bouts did not last nearly that long even if you looked at a cumulative total... not even close), I'm resentful.

I don't want to be resentful. But, I am. 

I really don't know how to handle this. She doesn't seem to even want to research viable solutions. The response I got was, ""Well, I want to the doctor and there is nothing he can do."" And that's that. Yet, I was asked to do a slew of things to try to ""fix"" myself so I was interested in sex. At least, that is how I feel.

I don't know how to handle her in menopause. I'm sure she loves me. But, man, 3+ years of this so far. I don't know if there is anything I can do to spark her up. I've tried a bunch of different things. It is starting to wear on me. Does she really find me attractive? Why was it alright for her to tell me to fix myself, but now the shoe is on the other foot, it doesn't seem to work that way. How can she get in the mood again? I'm lost.",24Apr2020,1
300,"In my lit class, it is out of 415 points with 400+ (96%) being an A (4.0). Certain assignments were listed out on the syllabus weighing a different amount of points. My prof never sent an email saying she was mitigating the points to 400 but she did Bc of moving online and having to eliminate certain participation activities (the participation section was 115 points on the syllabus but was never specified what criteria applied to it) (also this is what she told me in her response back to the email I sent her). She also kept the scale the same. So basically now you need a 100% to 4.0 while I have a 99.5% (3.7). She offered EC stating it can bump up our grades to the next level. I didn’t do it Bc at the time I thought the grading was the same. With my 99.5% I felt I was in the clear (keep in mind she never changed the syllabus/informed us). I sent her an email basically asking for an explanation as to why only 400 points were in the grade book and if my final grade could be changed to an A in any way and she said no. Many of my classmates who have done the extra credit were able to make a 4.0. But because it’s technically optional there is no way to 4.0 the class unless you did the last minute optional assignment. I also noticed inconsistencies with the amount of points each assignment had in the grade book versus what they were listed as in the syllabus. I already had sent her an email questioning her about strictly the points and if I could get an extension on the EC. She basically said no and that grades were already finalized.

307,"Recently I discovered what *learned helplessness* is, and I feel like this accurately depicts how I've been living the entirety of my life. I'm 23, I'm still in college for about another year, I still live with my parents - mainly because I actually don't have the money dollars to move out...plus covid19 now - and I've known for a while now that our values don't line up. The things that I would like to do, or would like to have, generally doesn't sit well with my parents. As far as I'm aware, they weren't bad things either (i.e., Going to prom, staying the night at a friend's sleep over party with no boys attending, going to an after-school event, wearing makeup when I got to high school).

I remember there was a time in my childhood and teens that I would really try to get my parents approval on the thing I wanted to do or the thing I wanted, but I was forced / repeatedly aided to ""make the right decision"" and reject my own proposition. Eventually, I didn't bother asking for permission, didn't even consider going to events, and didn't ask for any material wishes anymore.

I cannot pin point exactly when I stopped fighting to get what I wanted. Since entering college, I changed the approach to just telling them I'm where I'm going. If they say no, I turn around and just don't go because it's not worth the 1+ hour discussion on my life decisions. I know when I give in to my parents, I disappoint all my friends and I disappoint myself. I know this is not the way I want to live, nor should it be.

Yes, I'm an adult and I'm embarrassed that this is what I'm struggling with. I think a large reason is that I want to make my parents proud of me, but I feel it's at the expense of who I am and who I want to become. This is a fairly broad question, but how would I go about changing this feeling that ""I can't"", or that my life isn't mine?

Now I know this doesn’t affect only me, but it’s crazy to think that those things coincidentally happen to me, who’s superstitious about bad luck. 
It’s very easy to run into problems for me, but 2020s just been a bad year. When I turned eighteen I started using my social security, but for some unexplainable reason some places still accuse it of being invalid or wrong. I still can’t use it for certain things. A few days ago I went on a whim and spent extra money for a shirt, but didn’t look good on me. Just a few days before I returned clothes for my mom and they accepted it, now all of a sudden they wont because of the virus. It wasn’t much of a inconvenience though. Last Friday I was supposed to have gotten $800 in unemployment, but my bank rejected it for some reason and NO ONE can explain why or where the money went. It went to a debit card and I got it in the mail but the card says it had $0 on it. And today while I was on the interstate my motor blew a rod and I almost wrecked. This was most hurtful to me because I just bought a completely new interior decoration that was over $100 worth of items, now useless. I hold true faith in karma and stick to being a good person for that.

What do I do? I filed for unemployment but wasn’t gone from work long enough to get anything.  I didn’t even get a stimulus check because my bank info was wrong. I’m super worried about my finances and my coworkers finances but I cannot sleep because I am so worried about what’s going on. 
Do I tell my boss what I know? I was around her all day for two days. We are a retail store with many elderly customers. We’ve been super busy since we reopened this week. A lot of my coworkers are 50+. 
I just don’t know what to do. My work has fucked me over financially and I’m in such a bad spot but this is too serious. I really could use some advice right now.",24Apr2020,1
319,"I'm 28 M and long story short my life experiences have given me a very grim outlook on romantic and even sexual relationships to the point where I avoid them completely. They're too much work, they're volatile and I would honestly just not commit to anyone emotionally since it will likely end in disappointment anyway. 

So I never want to get married in a conventional way and naturally never want kids either. I'm not going to see a ""therapist"" either because this is something I do not want to fix. I would however like to find someone else who also has no interest in ever being in a romantic relationship and marry them just for the economic benefits. It would have to be someone I get along with on a platonic level I think. We wouldn't have to be best friends, just more like life long roommates. 

So my question is how would or should someone go about finding someone like this? Would it be ideal to potentially search for asexuals or aromatics who would be interested in this sort of union?",24Apr2020,1
320,"Yesterday, I finished a game that I just loved (FFVII Remake) and now I feel, for a lack of a better word, empty. It doesn't help that we're all staying indoors due to COVID-19, but I've been trying to distract myself with homework, other video games, and working out, but, even then, my mind just returns to how good that game was.

321,"I know that this post is pretty long, but I really need a second opinion.

Towards the middle of last year, I befriended this guy who I thought was a pretty chill person initially. As the months passed, we grew closer and decided to move in together at the end of this summer. Throughout our time as friends however, he slowly began to exhibit some very strange behaviors that have recently started to get on my nerves. At first, I've tried brushing it off, but it's been getting harder and harder as time goes on.

Here are some of things he does:

1. The slightest things are enough to set him off. Even just kindly offering help or asking him nicely how he's doing that day is enough to send him into a screaming match with you. It has brought me to the point of feeling like I'm walking on thin ice whenever I'm around him. I've started having to carefully monitor everything I say to him because I'm afraid that if I say one thing out of line he will flip out.
2. He goes through several mood swings in a day. He can be calm and happy for one minute but will all of a sudden become angry and impulsive in the next minute. Then, he'll be indignant and passive aggressive for the next hour until he sees something that makes him excited. You'll never know what mood he's in, and it's a gamble on what side of him you'll be experiencing.
3. If he's angry, he needs to make a show of it. He's even gone as far as to be openly hostile towards people he doesn't like even when they're being harmless.
4. He's butt heads with almost every single person he's ever somewhat been close to. This includes mutual friends and family members. I know it's natural for friends to occasionally butt heads with each other from time to time, but this happens so frequently and so regularly with him. I've butted heads with him several times within the past few months, and he's even butted heads with people who I thought he was really close to and never had any issues with in the first place.
5. He almost never communicates anything with me or anyone in general, which makes the previous examples even more frustrating. He'll get angry at you but won't tell you why he's angry at you. It makes me feel bad because I want to know what have I done that's put him off so that way he can at least lay down some boundaries, but he's practically brushed me off every time I've asked. He doesn't even tell me that he doesn't feel comfortable talking about it but instead tells me to practically go away.

I want to make it clear that I am not writing this to paint him as the villain of this story. I love him as a friend, and he can be a joy to be around. However, his recent behavior exhausts me emotionally, and I want to be there for him emotionally; however, every attempt done so results in him pushing me away. I don't know if I've done something that makes him not trust me. However, I can confirm that he does this with everybody I know, so I really don't think it's me.

And it's brought me to this point to where I'm developing second thoughts on moving in with him. I thought it was a great idea at first, but now I'm not so sure. If I get emotionally drained from being in the same room as him, then will it be worse for our relationship if we live in the same space together? I don't know. I want to maintain our friendship, but I also want distance as well. What should I do?",24Apr2020,1

323,"I (19F), could seriously use some advice about a friend of mine.

At the beginning of April, my state held a presidential primary. My dad volunteered to work at the polling station behind my house since most volunteers had understandably dropped out. Around dinner time, I went over to vote and deliver my dad some pizza for dinner. While there, I ran into a friend (18M) of mine that I'll call Dave, whom I hadn't talked to in a while. He and I started talking, which was great as I hadn't seen him since Thanksgiving. Suddenly, he got really serious and asked me to walk outside with him, I did, and once we got outside he told me that the reason I hadn't heard from him in a while was because his phone had been taken away. I asked him why he didn't have his phone and he revealed that he had been arrested and lost his job. Knowing my friend, I figured that he had been arrested for Weed or something like that and his parents, who are very strict, had taken the phone as punishment.

Dave told me that when one of our friends, Luke, came back in May, we could all meet up and Dave would tell the two of us what happened and why he got arrested. I said okay, and gave him a hug and told him everything would be ok. I went back home fully assuming that he had been arrested for weed. You know what they say about assuming.

After a little while, I still couldn't' get the conversation with Dave out of my mind. Something wasn't sitting right with me. I started thinking and realized that Luke probably wasn't coming back in May, he's camping out at a friend's house close to his college because he couldn't afford to return to our town on such short notice. Luke was also planning on not living at home this summer because he had an internship lined up. Realizing this, and realizing that I wouldn't be able to wait that long to know what happened, I did something REALLY REALLY REALLY stupid. I looked Dave up on our State's record system. I KNOW I shouldn't have done this, and that it was a dick move, but something felt genuinely off and I couldn't stop myself.

What I found is bad. Literally the last thing I would expect from Dave. He's being charged with 9 counts of child pornography. I broke down crying, and eventually told my parents what I had seen. My dad is a lawyer, and he looked at the available records and what exactly Dave is being charged with. If Dave is found guilty, he's facing up to twenty years in jail.  My dad says that based on both the number of felonies and the severity of the felonies, Dave will likely get the full twenty. 

I'm freaking the hell out. I desperately want to believe that there must be some sort of misunderstanding, or that Dave had some underage girlfriend he didn't tell our friends about, but all the evidence is pointing towards it not being a secret underage girlfriend. I feel sick to my stomach and just want to cry. All of this makes sense with why he couldn't have his phone, in my state, if you've been arrested for anything like this, you are not allowed on social media of any kind or to be in contact with any minor until you've either been found innocent or served your time + some. 

A few days ago, his mom reached out to me on Facebook. She's always liked me and encouraged Dave to hang out with me more. She wants me to come over to their house, or have Dave come over to mine so we can talk about Dave's new ""situation"". I told her that I was incredibly busy due to online college (true), but she wants Dave and I to meet up ASAP. Part of me wants to meet up with Dave so that he can tell me that he didn't do these awful things and that its all a big misunderstanding, but I also know that there's a very real possibility that he's going to tell me that yes, he likes looking at little kids and that he is being arrested because of that. I don't know what to do. My dad says I have to know exactly what I want out of my relationship with Dave, and if I'm willing to remain friends with him if he is in fact, a pedophile. I wouldn't call Dave my best friend, but we are close. I've known him since we were in diapers and we were friends on and off through the years before the above-mentioned friend, Luke, reconnected us. We have yearly new year's eve parties at his house (save for this year, I was abroad) and hang out whenever I'm home. He was one of the first people I came out too. I hate the thought of losing him, but I also hate the thought of being friends with a pedophile. I feel like I would somehow be condoning his actions if I stayed his friend. I don't know what to do. I don't want to abandon him, but I don't know how I can do so without seeming like I'm condoning his actions, assuming that the charges are true.

Should I go meet up with him (somewhere we can social distance), or should I just leave it for after his court date or whenever Luke gets back into town? 

Another question, should I tell Luke what's happening? My parents are split on whether or not I should tell Luke, as on one hand, I should probably let him know that our friend has been arrested for child pornography, but on the other hand, if Dave isn't guilty, and there's something else going on, it's probably best for Dave to tell Luke himself. 

I'm in serious need of some advice, please let me know what I should do.",24Apr2020,1
324,"Due to divorce and other life circumstances I'm (m27) moving in with my mom again. Only catch is she'a moving to a state I've never lived in because a family friend is renting us a house for a really hood price.  
Right now I'm a mess. My ex is an ally not an enemy thankfully so I don't have to war over ever little thing in the divorce.  She's a lesbian and I'm a man so it's a mutually beneficial divorce (yes she should have told me earlier but it's very complicated and she thought she wanted to stay with me for a long time) but it means I'm starting completely over. 
Our relationship was very toxic and my mental and physical health has suffered. I'll be pursuing therapy once it's financially feasible.  I'm considering taking this as a soft reset on my life. Before we had ""our plans"" and now I get to have MY plans and I'm overwhelmed with where to start (other than working out because if I'm gonna lay around being sad I should at least do some crunches or some shit). 

Also my mom is retired, she's talking about getting a job but ideally I'd like to support us enough that she has the choice not too.  I watched her work us from homelessness to being an average lower class family and she deserves to rest now. On the other hand I don't have a degree and she would be willing to help me get there.

I would do so much just to be friends with him again or just to get to know the present him. I managed to find his social media but no matter what I can’t build up the confidence to text him and reach out to him- I have no clue what to say (what would I even say :/ ) and even if I do reach out and he actually replies (which would be a good start) im so scared we wouldn’t continue talking after that - i would want to text him daily cause all i have on my mind is him but what if im just gonna be annoying him :( the other day i googled if it’s possible to like someone u haven’t met and seen in 9 years or so and all websites said that I only like the image of him I created in my head but like i know that no matter who he’s become id like him again (not because of looks just because it’s him) also I’m just 15 and im wondering if this is love cause people say teenagers don’t know what love is but this kinda sounds/feels like it- thanku so so much ❤",24Apr2020,1

333,"I’ve been feeling suicidal, and I’m getting close to really just ending it.

I keep telling myself that I’m strong but everything is so hard.

I grew up in a household where my mom pinned my siblings against me by babying me and treating them differently. I never had friends growing up, so I never knew how to really act with friends and always stepped over boundaries because I was knew it growing up. I have abandonment issues, and been dealing with depression and anxiety. I’ve always just wanted friends, somebody that I can be there for.
I had a 5 year long relationship where he 
1. gaslighted me and used my hearing disability against me while doing so.
2. Pushed me hard into a closet door 2 months after major surgery (VSG surgery)
3. Punched me in the face for practicing funny voices in the car, when he could of just told me to stop.
4. Caused me to miscarry, physically by elbowing me hard (He didn’t want it, even if I was happy but scared of abortions)
5. Would constantly scream at me if I told him something I didn’t like

It’s been messing with me mentally, and makes me confused about my current relationship, but I know it’s in my head when I worry and I try not to let it affect my current relationship.

Right after my ex, I met a guy who I fell for, he only talked to me (I found out) because he likes finding chicks who are overweight and destroy more of their self-confidence. His ex, because I always wanted a friend and befriended her, but she used me for money, because I was that nice to help her out, and I ended up escorting, which I’m embarrassed about, because it only lead to me being raped by somebody who I didn’t know. That only happened in August of 2019, it’s still fresh.

He gave me two names, one for online, the other in person. He pretended to be a stranger and had me by the throat, and raped me in a ditch at 4am.

I interpreted that as a “no” and didn’t really pursue things much further.
However, one time, the first time I ever got blackout drunk, according to J (my roommate) and A (another girl on our dorm floor), I put my arm around you and I was whispering to you. According to J you seemed unsettled afterwards. The next morning I asked you what I said, and you said I didn’t say much. Maybe I was too drunk to be coherent.

342,"I (19F) have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety. My parents know about this, but they don't know the full extent of it. I currently have a new therapist who I've been talking to for 3 weeks. She is great and awesome, and I feel like I've found a match! 

While I was away at college, my depression and anxiety got much worse and there was a solid month where I couldn't get out of bed unless to go to the bathroom or eat a small snack. The only times it ever ""went away"" for a little while was when I was asked to take care of my roommates dog while she was at lab/volunteering/etc. (the dog was an ESA). Having the responsibility of that dog helped me in a way of ""Okay I need to get up to take care of the dog, then I should probably go to class or do something somewhat productive today"". Because taking care of the dog and just animals in general makes me feel better, I think an ESA would be beneficial for me. I'm just worried my therapist will think different when I feel like it could help me, especially during my bad weeks. My dad thinks in a few weeks I won't even need my therapist but I definitely don't feel like that's the case. I tend to hide both my depression and anxiety pretty well, and therefore come off as being fine on the outside. I have been working on improving myself. The therapy is helping, I've been getting outside every now and then. Being at home is a bit better since I'm around the family cat, but being at college by myself (albeit with a roommate) just wasn't helping me at all aside from those rare moments I got to interact with an animal of some sort. 

I plan on talking to my therapist for quite a while more before approaching the subject of ESAs and animals in general. My anxiety is just throwing me for a loop right now. I have brought up the idea of an ESA to my parents and they said they want me to see a therapist, exercise, etc., pills if need be for a few months before bringing up the idea again and then maybe we could talk about it. Just a bit frustrating because I've been working at my depression and anxiety for quite a long time now and the only thing that has really worked is being around animals. I haven't tried pills yet, but like I said, would prefer not to.

\## My history with the doctor

(Because I know it's unfortunately relevant to the reactions doctors often give, I feel it's necessary to preface this with the information that I am 28, Male, white, and live in an affluent area in the California SF Bay Area.)

I got a new doctor about a year ago after changing my insurance benefits at my job and I have only seen him a few times, but since the first time I visited him he seemed condescending and judgmental  with everything he said. I would ask questions and he seemed to respond as if I was challenging his knowledge in the way that I'm sure some people tend to do when they think they know better...but I don't think I know better.

I had gone to him for the first time to get refills on medications I had been previously prescribed, and he ordered lab tests for thyroid and lipid panels along with warily giving refills for my existing antidepressant/antianxiety meds and my ADHD medication. These labs came back with me showing as hypothyroid and having high cholesterol, so at my next appointment he prescribed a thyroid medication and gave me instructions for a bunch of dietary changes he wanted me to make. He also ordered another panel for testing 1 month later.

A week after that appointment I lost my job, lost my insurance, and was a complete mess in pretty much all aspects of my life. I never got the lab done and I forgot to refill prescriptions for over a week after they ran out, at which point I kind of panicked because I wasn't sure how to start up again on the medications. It was another few months before I finally went back to my doctor to get more help and ask about how to start back onto my meds again properly. 

At this appointment he chastised me for not properly continuing my medications (specifically the thyroid medication that he prescribed). When I explained that I didn't have the money to pay for them and I wasn't covered by insurance he shot back that I should have borrowed money from friends. He then asked if I had gotten the lab results back and when I told him I never went to the lab he lectured me on not being able to help me if I don't do the labs he orders. I again attempted to explain that my entire life fell apart and I didn't have the finances much less the mental bandwidth to properly follow through with things like this. It's hard enough for me to follow through with this kind of thing when I'm doing fine in the rest of my life, as that's one of my major issues that I've been struggling with. He then asked if I had made the dietary changes he asked, and I explained that I had cut out cheese entirely, but I wasn't able to do much regarding the others. He again lectured me about how not making these lifestyle changes meant he couldn't possibly help me.

It felt like the entire session was him scolding me for not being able to follow through during a hard time, and every time I would say ""I know, I understand that it's important"" he reacted as if he was offended and I was brushing off his comments or downplaying the ""severity"" that he was telling me about. It finally came down to ""look, I'm sorry that I didn't properly follow through and I know that it's a problem, but I need help knowing what to do from this point forward, and I'm concerned about getting back on my medications."" He assigned me another lab test and refilled prescriptions.

I once again never ended up following through on the tests he ordered, partly because after not doing it immediately my anxiety went through the roof. I continued to think ""if I do this late and go in am I still going to get lectured about not doing it in a timely manner?"" and I got so stuck on worrying about his response that I never did it at all.

Since then I've run out of medication again and I'm afraid to go see him again because I'm afraid that all I'm going to get is another scolding and no compassion or understanding for the challenges I have and how those are affecting my ability to follow through. It's been half a year and I still have not seen him again. I ran out of meds two months ago.

I developed a chest cough about a week and a half ago, but I had otherwise experienced no symptoms. I chalked it up to allergies because that is my standard allergy response during this time of year anyway. I understood the possibility of COVID19, but after a week with no other symptoms I wasn't too worried, and was practicing all precautions I could to prevent anyone else getting sick. I live alone and I have only left the house for groceries when necessary, wearing gloves and a mask, washing hands, etc.

The past couple of days I have been experiencing tiredness, and just today I started to feel weak and have a very very mild fever (98.1 F, my body temperature readings are usually between 96.5-97.5 F, so it's technically a fever based on my normal readings). I have no shortness of breath or any other symptoms.

These new symptoms are getting me concerned that I should probably be tested in order to ensure that I don't further contaminate others or anything like that, but I'm afraid to call my doctor to ask about what I should do. I'm terrified of what he will say based on the rest of the events that have occurred between us. I'm afraid that he already thinks I just ignore all of his advice and finding out that I have not followed through on further orders will worsen that. I'm afraid that he will see my request for testing based on very mild possible symptoms of COVID19 as me thinking I know what's best for me and expecting me to not actually listen to him.

What do I do? Who do I talk to? I still have no insurance, I'm not any urgent health situation where I feel it is absolutely necessary for me to receive any immediate care. How can I get help with this immediate situation without having to confront the entirety of my past with this man?",24Apr2020,1
347,"Ive been working at a hardware store that rhymes with knome peephoe for about a month and a half. Due to everything going on with the pandemic we have been closing early and have had a TON of online orders. Since we have so many, the workers who are around after 6 pm are tasked with going and getting whatever was ordered and staging it in a certain area for the next day when it was going to be picked up. I have become pretty buddy-buddy with a handful of coworkers who are my age (20). Tonight one of them asked me to help him and another guy prepare a huge order consisting of almost 60 big lumber boards, which required us to go to the storage area outside to get to the pallets of lumber. When a manager came to unlock the door for us, he asked what I was doing. I told him that they had asked for me to help them, to which the second coworker responded “No we didn’t,” which was a lie and got me in trouble. The manager told me to “get to work” and that we “have too much going on for you to be dicking around.” I got to work doing my own thing for a while, admittedly very irritated that a coworker screwed me over and got me in trouble by saying I wasn’t asked to be around when I was clearly asked by the other coworker to help out. About thirty minutes later, the two coworkers as well as a third coworker (who I was probably more friendly with than any other coworker) walked by jokingly asking me to help them and laughing. Then, when the guy who got me in trouble was leaving, he walked past me and said “look at you, doing some work. Don’t work too hard” in a very smug tone. I called him a dick. I am extremely upset for several reasons. First of all, I was thrown under the bus and he lied. Second, they came by and laughed about it, showing that they thought it was funny. Then, he made that snide comment later on. It is extremely upsetting that my coworker decided to randomly screw me over for no reason, and that it was just a joke to them. I know that if i try to bring it up to them they won’t take me seriously, but at the same time, I’m too upset to just let it slide, especially since he made that snarky comment. At the same time though, I know that if I try to tell the higher ups about it, I’m just gonna be seen as the whiney tattletale, since they clearly think they’ve done nothing wrong. So, r/advice, what should I do?",24Apr2020,1
348,"First, throwaway account

Here’s what happened. My school has shut down because of the Coronavirus and has switched to doing online work. If I’m gonna be go honest, this is 20 times more stressful than regular school. I’m a regular worrier, but I’ve never had any effect of it, nor have I been this stressed. I have so many things to do, and because I have less time in the day to do things (longer mealtimes, later start, time with family and chores, so I can’t devote as much time to work as before. There’s also way more work. I have to squeeze six classes into 4 days with less time than school, and definitely more work than regularly. I don’t have six video classes, but my teachers usually record lectures and things and have us do notes. So because of this, I’m very stressed about the work. Also adding to that, I’m not very good at concentrating. I don’t work as fast, and it’s very repetitive and boring. It’s just a bad combination. Cause of this, I’ve been losing hair, not visibly, but they fall out noticeably more often. I don’t want this to keep going, what should I do? I tried telling my parents, but they care about my learning and still say I should do it.

352,"I don’t have experience with having romantic feelings with people. I never have, and never pictured I would. At least until 3 years ago. 

I didn’t notice the guy at first, like at all, but one day when I was hanging out in class too long after it got out I heard him talking to the professor. For some reason, him talking about something random that I was interested in, hit me like a pile of bricks. I started sweating, my heart started beating, and I just got really warm. I was freaked out by this and avoided said kid. 

I never even talked to him, besides basic conversation. I’d dream about talking to him for the next year. Summer break hits, I miss seeing his face. A year later we became actual friends, but I didn’t tell him how I felt. I didn’t feel like I needed to, I just liked being around him and didn’t want to scare him away, and he made me feel this overwhelming happiness I haven’t had with anyone else. 

This year, I switched my classes to have them with him like I did the past couple of years. I was so excited to see him the next day that I would have trouble sleeping at night. Just walking by him or making eye contact or speaking made my day.

354,"This has been weighing on me heavily. So when I (F18) was 17, a junior, I sent my first and only nude to this guy that was a senior. Let's call him Carl. We were good friends. It was stupid but I trusted him because he sent me some back. We eventually stopped talking, no fights, we just fell out of touch. 

Now after he and I stopped talking, I deleted his stuff out of respect. Then, I started dating this one guy who we'll call Todd. Things were great with Todd but I was heavily depressed and after some time, I told him I needed space, because I didn't want to break up with him but I needed time to think and breathe. He didn't understand what I needed, or I didn't make myself clear I don't know but he didn't give me space and I ended up ending things between us. He was very hurt. He didn't talk to me for months and unfollowed me on social media and stuff. 

A year passes and I'm a senior now, Carl is gone to another state and Todd is off to college. As I said, Todd hasn't talked to me for a while (and I respected that, leaving him alone). But then I get a text from Todd telling me that Carl sent my picture to this guy Matt and he doesn't want to get involved he just thought I should know. 

Matt has graduated at this point but we never liked each other and he was always a bit of an asshole to me. So I was horrified and humiliated and really sad because I didn't want Todd to think of me in that way. 

I texted Carl and he confirmed, I asked him why and all that and I ended up blocking him. I texted Matt next and he says he'd delete it if I have sex with him. He's saying all sorts of shit about how he's masturbating to it and I went along with it trying to get him to delete it like an idiot because I was so upset. I ended up blocking him. 

Is there anything I can do to fix any part of this? I want to be friends with Todd again but what if he thinks horribly of me now? and I want to get some sort of revenge/justice on Matt/Carl but how? I thought about emailing the university that Matt goes to because we're going to end up going to the same one but I don't know if I want the police involved?

359,"Background: 19 and just finished my first year in college. Thinking of moving out with my friend, sister, and sisters boyfriend into a 3 bed, 2 bath house. I'm very happy with the house. I'm conflicted on whether or not this is a good move. (Im currently living with my parents)

PROS
I gotta move out eventually, so why not now
This is probably the cheapest option in comparison to an apartment (350 rent)
I'll actually feel like an adult
It'll make me move on to the next 'phase' in life and same for my parents
I'll probably learn alot about ""real life""
It'll be fun to hang out with Noah
Way more freedom obviously, my mom won't breathe down my neck
I can have friends over
I can have boyfriends over
It's only 5 minutes away from where I'm currently at (so im not going to an unfamiliar area)
I have no summer classes and all my classes are online next semester. So I can work more hours if I need to
I only have 3 more years of school, not 4. Which is still alot but this is better than moving out after highschool

CONS:
350 rent + utilities is way more expensive than living for free
Utilities will probably be around 50-60 additional. Groceries could be like another 100. All in all its like 500+
So 500*12 month lease is total cost of 6,000
I should limit my college debt, and this doesn't help
I'm kinda afraid my mom will be lonely. Of course she has my dad but like she's very much overprotective and attached and I think this will be hard for her to have no kids in the house (but also I can't live here forever)

FINANCES:
I have 7k saved 
I made about 700/month after taxes when I was working 20 hours. but I can probably get more hours
My tuition is 12k per years. But my scholarships pay half. So I got about 6000 per year to pay (or take out in loans...)",24Apr2020,1

Hello reddit ! 

I have big socials problems and I don’t know if I have done the right things.

I have cut contact with old friends after a shitty party where I had way too much alcohol again, so after an another conflict “you said that and this explain yourself !” I just stopped answering. 

I am a coward with conflict, I always just ignore the problem until it’s gone. I need to stop doing that…

I know this is bad but as I said I hate conflict, I don’t want to talk to these people anymore to see them. If I want to resolve my alcohol’s problem, I need to stop seeing them.

1 month later they (she more exactly my oldest friend) send me a “how are you ? You left so early you asshole (I left at 9:30 a.m because I was feeling so bad and ashamed yeah I know I am a cowards).

2 month later a “how are u”.

And 3 month later (now) a : “I want you dead by covid I hope you didn’t suffer too much we want to see you at your funeral. What have we done to you?”. I blocked the one who send me this but without answering. I am freaking afraid about my family’s health and the COVID so I wasn’t feeling good at all. 

Yesterday I turned 20 yo. At midnight she posted a strange video with picture of us on my facebook “happy birthday”. I haven’t blocked her on facebook so… An another friend message me with a happy birthday I want you to explain… 

I send them a last message “thanks but I don’t want contact with you anymore, good continuation” and erase my facebook’s accounts (too many memories with us on it it’s hard for me to see this).

I don’t want to explain to them because I was drunk and don’t remember anything… I was near a ethylic coma I think… I want to stop this way of life. 

Now I am freaking afraid. 

Do I have done the right things ? 

I have alcohol’s problems when I am partying with them, I feel so depressed around them, I have bad ideas because she told mean things…. I should have told them (the group) that I don’t want to see them anymore earlier I know… 

What can I do to feel better right now ?  I am 20 yo now and I don’t want to keep my teenage problems with me as an adult. I want to change for the best. And I can’t grow up if I’m still stuck in my fifteen’s. I have known these person since I am 12 yo so it’s hard.

I am in college and don't really want to settle down and limit myself or him to having fun and meeting other people, also, as I mentioned before I feel like I might be a rebound, and lastly, I am not really attracted to him.

Obviously it's not the best of times considering lockdown/quarantine whatever you want to call it, although I feel like there might still be some possible ways or if not ways after it ends.

I know it seems like a simple-answer question but i'm honestly not sure. I spent a lot of time out of school so I don't really have that much experience with things. I just think saving up money from now onwards could help me financially in the future and also contribute to an ambition I have of wanting to visit the US or even one day, possibly living there.

374,"Sorry for the long story... 
I think a lot of people turn to gaming when life isn't treating them well, so did I. I met some awesome people on there I still hold dear to this day. 
But 1 guy stood out.
Our friendship started out as a scam, not in any harms way... The other part wasn't honest about himself, eventually telling me the truth that she was actually a he. 
The good ol' catfishing. 
Anyways, after establishing our friendship after the first big lie, he only became more and more valuable to me as a friend. 
He lived across the world. 
No matter what life threw at me, he was always there for me and vise versa. We've tried to ldr I think twice but it was always of very short life, simply put it didn't feel comfortable.
I was in a very bad place mentally, often I would confuse adoration with romantic feelings but would quickly snap out of this when put in the romantic position.
I've felt bad for this and still do, feeling like I lead him on.
He's seen me go through multiple relationships, and always supported me even though I was well aware he still had romantic feelings for me.
I can frankly say, I had completely friend zoned this guy, yet he still clung to me like I was his happily ever after.
3.5 years ago I met my current boyfriend, unfortunately I was older than him so we struggled often with dedication and 20/80 effort.
I broke up with him because I felt like I deserved more than just that.
In this short period of time (we got back together after a month or 2), I decided to think about myself.
So I booked a ticket to go visit the guy I friend zoned (by the time we met face to face for the first time, we've had been friends for 7 years talking every single day of those 7 years). 
Naturally, this decision sparked hope for my friend, him thinking it was finally gonna happen: him and me.
I made it very clear to him, that after 3 years being with the same person, I was anything but ready for my next romantic connection because I was hurting and I still loved the guy.
So I made it clear I did not want that.
The welcome was very warm, I stayed with him at his parents place with my own room to save money on a hotel.
While being there I met an awesome girl, she became one of my best friends.
I could tell the guy I visited did not like this very much, as he felt I came to visit for him so all my attention should go to him.
Throughout the trip we hung out as a group of 4. Him, me, the girl and her boyfriend.
Throughout those days as well, I would often feel like I was being stared at, and each time I would catch my longtime friend staring at me intensely, without looking away when caught staring.
I told him multiple times that made me feel uncomfortable, but he continued to do so.
As more days passed, more about his behavior started to irk me.
He tried to touch me unnecessarily, tried to drink from my drinks even though he had his own, stood outside my bedroom door the second I told him I was awake asking if he could come in, most likely told his parents we were romantically involved so I was allowed to stay there, pretended to be asleep so he could eaves drop on me and my new friend, on the last day he tried to help me find the lock for my suitcase by going through my suitcase about to touch my underwear, I had to stop him and every single day still staring at me despite being told multiple times it made me feel very uncomfortable. On the last day I was genuinely happy to go home.
After getting home our contact deteriorated, mostly from my side. I've tried explaining all of this to him, but the way he brushes it off makes me feel upset he doesn't seem to grasp what he did wrong at all.
Part of me feels disgusted he didn't respect my boundaries, but part of me wonders if I should just give up on this 7 year friendship like that or if I'm overreacting.
Please help me out!
Thanks.",24Apr2020,1

377,"Background for context: 

My aunt inherited my grandmothers african grey when my grandfather passed away about 5 or 6 years ago after the people who inherited the house didnt want him. He is about 30 years old now, and i dont think my aunt never really wanted him in the first place, so now that I have my own place, and birds are one of the common pets I'm not allergic to, she offered to give him to me, along with the cage and food and stuff.

The thing is, he plucked some of his feathers out, my guess from either the stress of the move, the change in faces, or possibly nicotine withdrawal because when my aunt got him, he wasnt in a room full of cigarette smoke anymore, so his belly kinda looks like tiny thanksgiving turkey. 

Now I grew up with this bird, he is older than me, but I've never actually held him, or had any interaction with him or many other birds other than a scratch on the head, because he was kept in a cage most of his life. If I got him, I intend on taking him out of the cage and letting him wander a little bit to explore. 

I just wanted to ask for some advice on what you guys think, primarily I'm wondering if it a good idea. And ask if you guys have any suggestions to possibly make the transition as easy as possible for me and the bird, in the event I do get him.",24Apr2020,1

Her logic is that she is ""planting a seed"" and that giving God ""10% of your income"" is something we should do to give glory to him. 
I haven't questioned her yet but I'm about to just straight up ask: ""Mom, why would an all powerful God, need human currency from you in exchange for blessing?""

379,"Okay so I won’t make this too long. But basically I was friends with a girl for a few years.

I was very emotionally vulnerable and she’s super abrasive and a little controlling.

I eventually grew a pair and stopped standing for it, but she used her “strong personality” to meddle wherever she could or make me back down.

She set my boyfriend and I up (he and her husband are best friends) and after a few months of me being with him, we stopped being friends. Mostly because she told me I was too good for him, he didn’t really like me (because he didn’t want to be my boyfriend and marry me after THREE DATES), then she told him I was depressed and anorexic (I’m a very average size and have never had an eating disorder).

She goes on and on to everyone about how I’m so highly emotional and our friendship didn’t work out because she just “doesn’t care” enough about people’s feelings.

Here’s the worst part. Our town is extremely small and EVERYONE LOVES HER. It is so hard for me to make friends because she literally makes me cry every time I see her and everyone is friends with her.

Every time I see her she puts me down in such a backhanded way, nobody would even notice. Little stuff. Girls know what I mean. For example: a song was playing and everyone was talking about how sad it was. I said “it really is”. In front of everyone she looked at me and said “oh really, what’s the name of the song?” I knew it but I was drunk. Then she whisper-yelled to me the name across the room. Another is me stressing about work and school because I paid all my own bills and she said “oh it’s fine, your parents can just pay for it while you’re in school, right?” KNOWING they were tight on cash. She came to a party we had and I had a panic attack (which sucked because it further proved that I’m just emotional) and she kept yelling at me to calm down. When I got so mad that I left, she turned to everyone in the room (who barely knew her) and said “She just hates me but I don’t know why, I set her and her boyfriend up together.” as if she was responsible for TWO YEARS of a relationship together.

I don’t even think she’s jealous of me because of my boyfriend, she just loves attention and he doesn’t like her anymore after seeing how she’s treated me.

Her husband is my boyfriend’s best friend so I’m going to see her, obviously, even if I am limiting contact. I am emotional but I am also a big supporter of kindness and consideration of how others feel and she just isn’t. But having everyone I meet love her to death is just killing me. Because when she gets close to people she tells them terrible things about me that make them not want to be my friend. It’s even worse when she meets one of my friends, because it just discourages me to know they hear such terrible things.

I control my own reputation, but if you go into meeting someone hearing that they’re a depressed anorexic emotional girl, you will pick them apart.

Her best friend even went as far as to tell my boyfriend I couldn’t come to her wedding and then tell me it was because I had a crush on her husband......who I did not know personally and only interacted with once to say “where’s the napkins?”

I am trying to branch out but I live in a very rural area, my friends here are just it. It’s just really hard and I don’t know how to handle it. I am struggling.",24Apr2020,1

386,"My apologies in advance if this seems like I'm rambling..

I've been feeling really down lately, and I'm not sure what's causing it. I'll start by saying I already made an appointment with a therapist, and should be getting a phonecall within the coming week to see when they have time for me.

So about two weeks ago I almost made a terrible mistake, I went outside in the middle of the night with the intention/thought of ending it all. Now, I didn't actually get as far as almost trying to kill myself, because after about 10 minutes of walking outside I had a moment of clarity and was able to realize that there are a lot of things in my life that make me happy, my friends and family most of all. I could see all their faces in front of me while I was sitting outside and it immediately made me realize I did not want to harm myself. This whole thing really scared me, and it's obvious to me that there are apparently things I still haven't worked out yet in my mind. 

So yeah, I went outside with the intention of killing myself. I wasn't planning on telling anyone because the day after I honestly felt like I could never do something like that to myself and the people around me, I don't want to die... But after two days I decided maybe it was better if I told someone, so I called my best friend (who I'll call F), and told her what was going on. She asked me to come over and I explained to her what was going on, but I don't know why I am feeling this way, there's not really any reason for me to be depressed. The only reason I can really think of is the weed, I've been smoking weed for the last 8 years, almost daily, and I've been noticing lately it's been making me a bit paranoid? Maybe paranoid isn't the right word, but when I'm high I seem to get stuck on negative thoughts, especially at night. I've had been thinking about quitting for some time now but after what happened two weeks ago, and following F's advice I quit and haven't touched it since. She also told me it could help writing down my feelings, try to go to bed earlier and above all, seek professional help. Which I've all been doing, and over the last two weeks I had been feeling a little better mostly. 

Now two days ago, me and F got into a fight because apparently she has been feeling angry at me for the last week or two. Last year I had a really bad trip on acid, I had feelings for F, and I wasn't honest about it towards her or myself, this caused a lot of issues between us because I lied about it. She was there during the acid trip and beforehand I knew I shouldn't have taken anything but I thought fuck it, and still did. After the bad trip I got really depressed, and following her advice again I seeked help with a therapist. The idea of talking to a professional seemed really nice, but in the 4 sessions I went all I kept hearing was I needed to stop smoking weed, I just wanted to talk about what I was feeling to someone, but all I kept hearing was ""Quit smoking."", which obviously was good advice, but it just wasn't what I was looking for at that time.. I stopped going to  the sessions, and didn't stop smoking weed. But I honestly felt a lot better since then, I was happy about life, I knew I would most likely go back to school this coming schoolyear, and I enjoyed seeing my friends often and being with them. 

So the reason F is mad at me is because obviously I dropped a prety heavy bomb on her two weeks ago when I called her to tell her what I did, and she's mad because it all could have been avoided if I kept going to the sessions last year. She feels like I never follow her advice, and as if I'm not taking it seriously. But I have been following all her advice, I just haven't been talking much about it the last week because of something she said, she felt like she was my therapist and because of that I did not want to keep dumping everything on her. So I mostly kept my mouth shut, and because of this she feels as if I'm not taking it seriously and as if I'm just gonna let it go back to the way it was. I was just trying to think of her.. She has a lot on her mind at the moment as well, with school and all, and it felt like the right thing to not bother her with everything, every time I feel bad about something. And now, because of that, she's mad at me... I really am doing my best, I'm doing everything she and my other friends have told me. What happened two weeks ago scared the crap out of me, because it's not what I want, and I'm doing everything I can think of to make me feel better. I've stopped smoking, I try to go to bed earlier and wake up earlier, when I wake up I actually get out of bed and make my bed, I write down what I'm feeling and I immediately called my doctor to make an appointment with a therapist... But to her it was too late, I only started taking it serious after I went out with the intention of killing myself according to her... But I never had that intention before, the thought has been crossing my mind every now and then, but I've never wanted to die. What doesn't help is that on that day, I wrote a letter to her, telling her how much I appreciate how much she has done for me in the past, and thanking her for being there for me whenever I needed her, I made the mistake of telling her it was a goodbye note or whatever.. It wasn't meant like that, I just wanted to write something nice down for her, so whenever she was feeling down she could read the letter and hopefully feel a little better, but when I told her what I did I said it might have been a suicide note. I don't know why I said that, because it completely ruined the letter and its intention. So yeah, I realize she isn't my therapist, and she defintely isn't the answer to all my questions, she is just the person I feel most comfortable with, and now I've lost her.. Some pretty hurtful things were said two days ago when we were arguing, I know it could all have been avoided if I had kept going to the sessions last year, and if I had quit smoking weed then, and it is really unfair of me to keep going to her whenever I feel bad about something, she isn't my therapist and she isn't my mom... I just didn't know it was weighing this much on her, it had been bottling up for a while and now it all came out at once. And like I said, she isn't the answer to my problems, and she can't fix it for me, that's something I have to do myself, but just her company and talking to her via whatsapp gave me joy, and now I've lost that... And I'm really at a loss, I just don't know what to feel. I feel angry at her and myself, it feels like I'm just being dropped like that, but I also feel guilt and shame over dropping all this shit on her. 

I really just don't know what to do anymore...

389,Wise users of Reddit I need your advice. Recently I've been trying to get in touch with friends I distanced myself from when I got engaged. Some history: I was in a relationship with a guy for 5 years before we got engaged. I moved in with him and started a job in the same town. He started to get verbally and mentally abusive but I didn't have a choice because of my job - which didn't pay me well enough to move out. He started to get physical and made me message my close male friends to say that I was going to be blocking them because he told me to. I did what I had to do and the abuse stopped for a little while until it didn't. I got a slight salary increase a year after we got engaged and was able to transfer to another town and get a small place for myself. It's been a year of getting my life in order but now that I have I've been reaching out to old friends and so far it's been a positive and encouraging response. There is one person who I can't get through to. He hasn't been on Instagram and Facebook in 2 years but I see he's been active on Twitter. One account was accessed in November of 2019 and I can DM him. The other account is more active and was accessed 08 April 2020 but I can't DM him. My question is: what do I say? How should I go about getting back in touch with him? If I DM him on the less active account what should I say? If I tweet him on the more active account others will see the messages so how should I Tweet him? Thank you in advance 🌼,24Apr2020,1
391,"I’m a 19 y/o male in college. So a month or two ago I had an horrific panic attack experience that has changed me ever since. I bought two lsd tab, at least I think they were lsd. I have ADHD so being the impulsive person I am I just took two of them. Everything was fine for a while but when it kicked in after about 30 mins i had this feeling that I was going to die. It might sound dumb as hell but for some reason I felt like without a doubt I was going to die. I had this weird sensation in my throat that I can only describe as broken chicken bones going up my throat. It would happen every 2 secs or so and when it did I saw these weird ass colors. Almost like the typical trippy colors except on the outside of the color I would see animals appearing to be crushed. My heart rate at the time was all the way at 175. I was completely outta it. My arms were doing weird shit by themselves and my body kept feeling weird but the only time it stopped was when someone talked to me about something else. But my family didn’t pick up on my hints and just stared at me like I was crazy so it made the whole situation worse. 

But after all that happened i felt paranoid for a the next month and a half. Having been able to think straight. Everything that happens to my body sets off alarms. I used to smoke weed literally everyday but now every time I do it my heart rate rises to at least 135. Sometimes when I try to go to sleep i get subconscious thoughts and sometimes the thoughts aren’t in my voice.

393,"For the longest time, I’ve always been that one friend who will offer a hand, help others, and trying to make them feel happy. Tell me where I feel like I can truly relate to someone is by sympathising with their pain.

I have a live the best life, but I haven’t lived the worst either. I had a lot of family deaths, two of them that directly change my life permanently. And although it was so tragic to lose them, in a certain way, I’m thankful to have felt such pain. I’m thankful to have felt such pain because, and God forbid, if Someone so close to me Would have lose a family member, I know exactly what the person would want when they grieve. And I’m not saying 100%, but a significant amount to put my hand on the shoulder and tell them that things will be OK, and that I would help them and comfort them until they become stronger and better again.

But for example, since I’m a guy, I will never be able to truly understand the pain that women go through in womanhood. I will never know what it would feel like to hurt when they pop the cherry, or menstrual cramps. In a strange and bizarre way, I truly wish I could feel the pain that they feel. I hate seeing how constant this pain can get for them, while I’m over here doing just fine.

It really pains me so that I can’t feel the pain they feel, to feel and understand. The reason why I want to feel it so desperately is because I know what it’s like to walk alone when something painful happens. It’s a dark world  where you have to try to find The light at the end of the tunnel. I just want to be that one person who understands, and to offer a hand to walk down the long road and back into comfort.

Gets the point where I kind of mentally tortured myself to try to understand, and to try to feel what they might feel, like loss, arguments, dejection, loneliness, and sad.

I have no idea if it’s survival guilt because of my Dead family members, Whether it’s the so deep empathy I feel for my fellow humans, or myself mental sabotaging mindset, but i cant stand it anymore.

TLDR: I use pain from my experiences to feel sympathy over empathy, and I feel guilty if I can’t feel what they feel

I almost never refuse him, because he's a little older and I feel bad for him. There are people there older than him that work much harder than he does, but I digress. Simply put, I almost never ask for anything in return from him, I just help to be nice to him. Today is the first day I have ever asked him for a favor, and all it was was to adjust the equipment to slow down, as it was leaking muddy material (which today is my turn to shovel, it always leaks just not usually this bad) so that I wouldn't have to shovel as much.

His response, was no. We have been in a  reverse situation plenty of times, where he has asked me to slow the equipment when it is his turn to shovel, and I have always happily obliged him. This is my breaking point. It turned what is normally 20 minutes or so of shoveling into an hour and a half, and I'm going to have to do it again in a few hours before we leave. Keep in mind he gains nothing by getting more material out except a higher ending number of tons of material put out. Just the number. No bonus, no pizza party, no praise from our superiors, just a higher number to write on our board. I am fed up of him watching me do his work for him, or our work in general. Tired of him taking advantage of so many of us, and our supervisors do nothing. I have had multiple meetings with them about his behavior, and they have had talks with him that result in slightly better work from him for a week before he goes back to his old ways. 

I am done. He is an alcoholic who drinks multiple beers on the way home. I know because that's all he talks about is fishing and drinking beer. So, I'm not used to revenge, but I've had this idea for a few months now where I call him in for drinking and driving on the way home, but today I might actually be upset enough to do it. My question to you Redditors is this. Is that too much? I for sure will be refusing to help him unless necessary from now on, but I want more than that. I know karma always comes back around and he will get what's coming to him one way or another, but is this a justifiable response, or am I overthinking things? Open to other suggestions as well but keep in mind I have talked to him, our bosses, and my coworkers about him, and I have tried taking the high road and just being overly nice. Thanks Reddit, stay classy.",24Apr2020,1

396,"My parents split when I was 9 or 10 and I primarily grew up with my mom's side of the family and saw my dad's side every couple of years or so. I was never close with my dad's mom, but recently she's been reaching out and we have an ok relationship. 

I'm currently 24 years old but I had dark times in my late teens/early 20s so I have a late start in life. I'm going back to school (online) in a few months to get my life together. My grandma is offering to pay for college in full. I'm currently in my mom's hometown in a different area in the country but my grandma desperately wants me to move in with her. I am apprehensive about it though, for a lot of reasons. I'm very much at home here in my mom's hometown. I love being in a province but just an hour or so away from the nearest big city (I'm a city boy). My grandma's town... not so much. I don't like the place tbh. Im not close to my dad's side of the family. My grandma's house creeps the fuck out of me. She's Catholic with a lot of religious statues all over the house though her house is, to be honest, a lot nicer than our house by a mile. I grew up around animals, specifically dogs, but my grandma hates pets. Also, she doesn't have wifi. 

On the other hand though, moving there would get me closer to her and she doesn't have a long time left. My family on that side is also pretty well off and we have some pull in most areas so that's also a big bonus. She already prepared a car for me to use while I'm there too. I feel like moving would help me restart my life. 

I'm leaning towards moving but I'd have a few demands if I do. 

I'd need my own room with a lock cause I don't trust the people who come over. My cousins are infamous for stealing from my grandma. She feels guilty cause they lost their dad (her son) at a young age and she spoils them. They don't live there but they're over a few times in a week with their hellspawns. I need to protect my things and have the peace of mind that they'll still be there when I leave and come back. I'd also need WiFi to be set up before I move. My school would be all online and I'm also planning on starting a business buying and selling sneakers and I'd need the internet for that. And, most importantly, I'd need to come home 2-3 times a year for family events, especially when my sister (not related to them), who I'm super close to but works overseas, is in town. That part is 100% non negotiable. 

Any advice? Should I even move? How can I bring this up over the phone? Last time we called and she brought it up, I just told her I'm still thinking about jr. Her place is about a 2 hour flight away from where I am so the next time we meet would probably be when I actually move. Ideally I'd want to stay here but I understand how moving would be beneficial for both me and her. 

And before you ask... No, she's not asking me to move there to take care of her. She has a maid that lives next door and a houseboy who does the cleaning. She's rich enough to afford a caregiver if she wanted to. 

Any advice would help right now. Thanks and stay safe.",24Apr2020,1
397,"I learned cycling very late (around 8-9-ish) and I've never really liked cycling in traffic. I always get stressed because I'm afraid of doing something wrong or looking like a complete idiot.

398,"Hi. I'm 18 and currently in college but I hate every single thing about it. I've tried looking into every subject but none of them interest me and I absolutely hate the thought of having to be a corporate slave for the rest of my life. My last hope in an enjoyable education is university (chance is pretty high I'm getting accepted this summer) and even though I don't have alot of hopes of it being good, I'm still gonna try at least 6 months of it.

The thing is if I don't like what I'm learning in university I'd have no other secure path to go to. That means I will hate every secure path in my life and this is putting me at a crossroads: either I finish education and have a boring 9-5 slavery job and hate every single thing about it with a burning passion. OR I drop out of all that shit and pursue what actually interests me (writing, music, anything creative)

I really can't afford to stay in school. I can't morally accept living at my parents house without giving them the feeling I'm actually going somewhere in life.

My plan is pretty much this: I finish this year of college and get accepted into university next year. After finding out it's just not for me I'll drop out, get out of my parent's house and find somewhere cheap to live like a storage unit or an abandoned place. I'll work a job 2/3 days a week to pay food, water and other necessities while I use to other 4 days working my ass off to create masterpieces. I'll be able to learn survival skills beforehand so I don't get myself fucked up by bad hygiene, hunger and stuff. I'd be forced to survive, adapt and chase my passions at that point so I'm not too worried of being homeless for the rest of my life.

Should I do it? Would it be stupid? Would I survive?
Why shouldn't I risk everything if the biggest risk is not risking it at all? I don't ever want to be a corporate slave.",24Apr2020,1
399,"I went through my daughters phone tonight and I found messages between her and a 50 year old man named Roger (fuck it I’ll say his name I don’t care, I’m pissed). There was nothing sexual there or nothing of them meeting up or anything as he lives states away from us. But I saw him telling her that in exchange for her company over text and over the phone and stuff, he’d send her money. They’ve been talking for about 3 months now that I saw and have video chatted and called a NUMBER of times. I genuinely believe that nothing happened sexually but he has her send regular pictures of herself and tells her how beautiful she is and it’s disgusting. I looked on her Paypal and she’s received nearly $1000 from this man over the course of 3 months. I don’t even know how to talk to her about this because I’ve never dealt with it and I don’t believe it’s technically illegal. I don’t know what I can do about this old creep preying on young girls and my daughter. How do I discipline or help her understand that it’s wrong? I don’t think in terms of the law I can do anything as there is nothing sexual there (a blessing and a curse). He’s some cop that lives in Idaho and we live in Minnesota. What can I do? What do I do with the money that she has in her account? I don’t feel right letting her use it but I don’t know what to do with it. Any advice?",24Apr2020,1
400,"I know this is a state where I have tried to work towards for years. I'm the only child and maybe cause of the person I am, friends become family and when a friend does something nice or sweet I immediately start giving them a piece of my heart and I start trusting them. Now there are people who have stayed with me and have been nothing but great but there are some friends who were either toxic from the start or throughout the years, due to change, they start treating me differently. I've had a lot of friendship breakups and the majority of the time they never tell me why. So I naturally blame myself since I'm the common factor and I beat myself up for it. 

It was in high school and university when I found friends who would talk to me or tell me something I did or said that was not acceptable or nice. I'm pretty honest so when I feel upset or I don't like something and if it's worth saying I will tell my friends but most of them never did so I did not really learn nor realize what that friendship taught me. But as we grew older  I appreciated my friends who did not sugar coat things and I saw myself learning. It also gave me the opportunity and motivation to keep myself in check. Make sure I was not being toxic or unreasonable. 

I also had this bad habit of begging friends to stay, even when they hurt me tremendously, when they shredded my heart and broke my trust, I told myself. *'Oh it's alright they are having a difficult time as well, they were good friends once so I'm sure they will just realize and treat me well again'* 

Yes, I know I was desperate and just so naive. I was always that friend who took a step forward, I was the one texting or calling them first, I was the one initiating meet ups. I mean there's nothing with taking the first step, but imagine you're the only one making an effort for 4 to 5 years. You're the one asking them are you ok but no one checks upon you. It's tough and heartbreaking. I cried a lot for 'friends' who would not even take 2 mins of their day to just text me, who would not bother to show me they cared. But I went on, caring for them, loving them. I had 4 great friends who would do anything for me so why was I still clinging onto other friendships when I should have focused all my time and energy on the friends who cared and loved me. 

Over the years, all these breakups and such led me to a journey of self-love and healing. I won't go into detail but as much as I'm happy about how much love and respect I have for myself. They way I went from clinging onto relationships to not bothering as much or just letting go of people is a little scary to me. I mean I'm happy and thankful but it also scares me a little. I used to be sad and I would take time to kinda mourn and heal but now, if I feel someone or a relationship is not treating me the way I want to be treated (with respect and love) I talk to them and try to figure things out but if it continues, I simply let them go. Does it mean I care less? I mean I don't feel like I care less but such a drastic change scares me. Is it alright to be this way as long as it makes me feel like I'm taking care of myself and my mental health?",24Apr2020,1

Not because I didnt want to talk to somebody I just dont want to brother them to turn away from everyone else to watch me sign something to them.

I usually have to show them my ID, which makes sense these days and then answer about 30 questions about why I am not going after guys my age. At first I figured because I am a very confident women and have big goals in life. A lack of daddy issues and gold digging was a surprise to them, I thought.

406,"I had sex about a month ago with my current boyfriend. We didn’t intend to have sex at first, and soaked instead (in case this is unfamiliar lingo, this means he was inside without protection but there was no thrusting). We did decide to have sex shortly after and used a condom. However, we were interrupted and had to stop. He never finished. 

That was the last time I had sex. My boyfriend and I are both in quarantine because of the pandemic. Naturally, I’ve been very stressed about the state of the world. My mental health is extra unstable right now and I’ve been very anxious almost every day. On top of this, my classes started online and I’m having difficulty adjusting. I’m monumentally stressed. 

So... when my period was late, I wasn’t concerned at first. Stress can mess with your cycle. I know that. I wasn’t bothered. But my current cycle is now at *50 days* and I’m starting to get kind of worried. A typical cycle for me is about 40. 

I know that precum can contain small amounts of semen. Though there was no thrusting, he was still inside me unprotected. Alternately, wholly shit I’ve never been this stressed out in my life. 

Thoughts? Should I be concerned? If you’ve had an experience with a delayed cycle due to stress, how delayed was it? When should I rule out stress as the cause?

The last few days, the thought of an unplanned pregnancy has made me even more anxious. It’s keeping me up at night. I’m just a ball of nervousness right now and I realize that if anxiety *is* the cause I’m only making it worse by adding on worry about pregnancy. 

Extra side note (sorry this is long as hell) - I’m 20 years old. I’m a college student and still live at home. So, while I realize that the wondering could be resolved by simply taking a pregnancy test, I know that this would mean discussing my sex life with my mom and I’m not super stoked on that. Based on the replies to this, I may do so anyway, but the pregnancy worry is new and I’m still hoping it’s not what’s going on here. 

[TLDR: “soaked” unprotected and then had protected sex a month ago but it was interrupted and boyfriend didn’t finish. Period is over a week late. However, the current state of the world is insane and I’m incredibly stressed out. which may be the reason for the delayed period.

407,"I’ll try to keep things brief. I was basically employed about 7 months ago for a position as a software engineer. Given that my company lacks proper documentation for the software that I was monitoring and developing (which honestly surprised me given that the company that currently I’m working for is a HUGE), I had to ask a lot of questions. The current program manager was the programmer lead for the software that I’m currently maintaining so I bugged him a lot when issues arise as I had no clue on how to handle them without betting on my chances. To be honest, even with 7 months gone by, I still feel like I do not know the whole framework well enough without uncomfortably bothering with him questions given that I’ve actually also been working some other bigger and more major systems. Today while asking him regarding for an issue, he gave me the answer I wanted and added, “also I just got off the the business today, and we’re both talking about how great you are, so keep up the hard work.”  I was honestly a little taken back because I sensed a little sarcastic undertone coming from him. I replied “just trying to learn, will try my best.” After that, he left me on seen and the day went on. I don’t know if I should feel butterflies in my stomach or if I need to read between the lines.

408,"Since the coronavirus, many of my uni's tests have moved online. My sister is a year younger than me and is doing some of the same subjects that I did in my first year. I was a high achiever while she's not. I've helped her get scores on some of her tests that she couldn't have got otherwise. I'm conflicted on wether to keep helping her for a few reasons. 

Pros: She works hard and doesn't use my help as an excuse to stop studying. The subjects are not ranked so her mark shouldn't affect anyone else's. I can relieve some of the stress going into the exam since she will require a lower score in it to get her desired grade. 

Cons: It's unfair to those who don't have anyone to lean on. When I was a student, I probably would've been pissed off if people did this since I had no one to help me. Likely breaks university rules.

Today I replied the wrong thing when she tried to talk to me, I said it in a bad tone and she has been giving me the silent treatment for the whole day now.

I avoid talking to her, she complains that I never talk to her, when I do try to talk to her more, she nags about how shit I am as a daughter, never do chores, isn't doing anything with my life, waking up late, I like to bake, she complains how selfish I am that I always make stuff she can't eat (she's on a keto diet) 
she'll find smtg to nag, I hate talking to her. That's why I don't.

I always do the basic chores but she somehow gets mad at me not mopping the floor or washing the dishes, which I sometimes forget a thing or two when washing a big pile

Everytime she got mad, ill feel so bad about myself, why am I not good enough, why do I keep making my mom angry, why does it happen to only me.
I learned to vent my problems to my friends a few years ago to find out this isn't normal, and it can be called abusive, a friend told me to keep a list on the things she did to me, so I won't forget it easily and hate myself over how much I piss my mom off. I can show it to u guys if u want but its very long.

I think having so many years of my life getting treated like this made me so tired of her and I get annoyed way too easily with her, I know she loves me but i know what she did to me was inexcusable.

412,"After all, the monster may or may not even be real.

The story is about this teenager named Sarah. She has a close friend named Malachi, whom she is deeply in love with. However, no matter how hard she tries, he never falls for her, even when he seems like he is. Eventually, she passive-aggressively breaks off their friendship, tired of mixed signals and a broken heart. However, since that day, she keeps catching sight of a disturbed man with wide, bloodshot eyes and a toothy smile. The more she distances herself from Malachi, the more often this figure stalks her, and she begins to wonder if making amends with Malachi to rid herself of this nightmare would be worth the constant heartbreak.

I don’t want to give away what happens in the end, (although I will say it’s not a happy ending,) but I worry that Sarah’s actions and mentality in the story might make her seem unlikable or unidentifiable. Then again, perhaps this would work to the story’s benefit by making the monster, i.e., the smiling man, more terrifying.

We share a bathroom with his sister and she always complains to their dad about it being dirty and messy, yet she’s always the one making the mess. When ever she goes out she makes a mess with her make up everywhere and her hair in the sink from brushing it. (side note: what aggravates me is that shes afraid that she’ll catch the coronavirus but still goes out go see people and brings people here? and she complained about someone coughing with out covering their mouth, but she does not even cover her own mouth when she coughs??? confusing...) But you would never hear my boyfriend and i complaining about it. I would also always clean up after myself out of respect considering im living in someone else's house. I also noticed that she keeps using my shower items such as body was, shampoo etc, all my items are used up in less than two weeks...

I don’t know why but she acts like a child, always asking her brother (my boyfriend) and her dad to make her food. Like she comes down stairs to the kitchen and starts groaning “im hungry... im hungry” until someone asks her what she wants to eat. Its like she doesn’t know how to do anything lol. Also, my boyfriend and i always split groceries equally because we both know that its not cheap. We also don’t have cars because our parents dont trust us to drive their cars so we walk to the nearest Grocery store thats 15-20 mins away, and we cant carry as much groceries because it does get heavy. it sucks because his sister has her own car but doesnt even bother to come drive us there, or pick us up even though its like a 5 min drive... Yet alone she refuses to help pay for groceries but decides that whatever we bought is hers to eat, so food runs out pretty quick... 

Another incident was that a bottle of lysol disinfectant fell on the ground and spilled right in front of her and she just looked down on it and left it there... this makes me cringe so much man... like just pick it up.

I finished my exams last week, so I’ve been just cooking breakfast, lunch, dinner for my boyfriend and I because I have nothing better to do and because he still has school. one night i was cooking and she had the audacity to come up to me and say “can you cook me food.” I was so close to snapping at her, i had enough of her attitude. She’s 24 years old, doesn’t know how to clean up after herself, cook, doesnt know about reciprocating or equality... i need help, i dont know how to deal with this and I’m just getting more upset.

next time she does something should i say something about it? is it okay for me to say how i feel?",24Apr2020,1
419,"We had a note put through our door from a neighbour about having a street party in our small road inviting the street to get together (I assume at reasonable distance because they come across as very sensible). They want to have music etc.

Prior to COVID I was avoiding clubs and loud places, even shopping can be a sensory overload because the lights and noise exacerbate my symptoms for several days.

Sometimes when he comes online I get to talk with him. And in the middle of the beautiful ongoing conversation he sometimes tells me that he needs to go for breakfast, lunch, dinner, etc and sometimes he feels sleepy and tells me that he will talk to me after that. He sometimes also tells that he is doing something and he will talk to me later. After that last message I keep on waiting and keep on checking my phone continuously for his messages. But he never does. Most of the times he only replies to the messages I have sent. I know he loves me a lot but I don't get why he does this. It may be that he uses and checks his phone less frequently but I am not certain of that. I keep on waiting for his messages. It makes very very happy whenever I see his messages.

I send him a lot of messages daily. Now I started thinking that I disturb him a lot. Now before sending him a single message I think a thousand times. I think that he would feel annoyed by my messages. It may be wrong but it is just a thought. One day I asked about this to him. I asked ""Do I disturb you so much because I send you a lot of messages?"". He was shocked by seeing this. He told me that he never have and that I care about him a lot that now I started to have such doubts. He told me to get it off my head. HE told me that how could I even think like this. The day before that he slept early and I did not talk to him on that night. He thought that I asked him that question because of this reason.But I denied it. He asked me what mistake I found in him and what led to that question. I told him that he is the perfect one and he has no flaws. But he is very nice. He loves me a lot. He cares about me a lot. He cant see me being sad.

He then on that night in the middle of the conversation told me it is already late and we should sleep. Then I thought that I am disturbing him again. I told him sorry for that. Then he told me that it was his mistake that he brings about the topic of sleep every time. And that he realised his mistake now. But I told him that it was never his mistake . He told me that he does not give enough attention to me. If he had given enough attention to me I would have not thought like this. But I again told him that it was never his mistake and he should not blame himself. After that I told him to sleep and we both slept.

But next day he does again the same thing. He talked to me twice and got out by telling me that he need to have breakfast/lunch. And that is 100% true. But I do not understand why he just talks to me at those times. Why does not he talk to me when he is absolutely free.

Now what should be my next move? I want him reply me fast. And I don't want him to go away in the middle. Obviously I cannot ask him directly these things. What should I do?

**tl;dr I think that my best friend does not give me enough attention. But I deny it in front of him and I do not want to ask him directly about it.**",24Apr2020,1
423,"Hello,

You probably know the drill by now, throwaway account, intentionally vague for anonymity, etc. Anyways....

I'm stuck in a bit of a messy situation. I will begin by providing some information about me. I am a college student, 19, and about to venture into a very interesting journey. I was born into an upper middle class family. We were nothing out of the ordinary. This all changed during my high school years. My guardian had founded a company several years prior that had done quite well. I (my family) was suddenly wealthy. With this sudden influx of cash came the spoils of those riches. Throughout high school I was given a brand new $120k vehicle, private education, and anything else you could ever ask for. My sibling(s) had their college tuition paid for, no need to work during college. This remained so for me as well, up until recently. 

I'm not going to lie, I'm really spoiled. My freshman year of college, I was given a penthouse, a new vehicle, and several thousand a month in spending money. As you can imagine, life was great. Actually, it really wasn't -- it just looked great. After a year of fucking around on my parents dime, I decided that I would stop my horrific spending, and hopefully make something of myself. I went back to University last semester and got rid of the penthouse, locked away my money, and lowered my expenses to 1/10 what they had been in previous years, and started a company. I was finally making something of myself. I was able to achieve very high grades over the last year, and am proud of myself for that, and would like to continue in my path through higher education. Now that you are caught up on my background, I will proceed in explaining the current scenario. This will be followed by a list of options, which I need help choosing from. 

Over the last few weeks, my life has turned upside down. My guardian(s) assets were seized by the federal government (white collar, ***don't fuck with the feds***). With this came arrest(s). I have done nothing wrong, and my accounts are fine. However, I am currently strapped down with payments that I cannot afford, and family member(s) that need to be bailed out. bail(s) are/is in the millions. I am also on the hook for $20k in tuition, payments on properties, and an expensive legal team. My sibling(s) and I are the only ones who can access money. But we can only sustain payments for the next two months. Luckily I can defer some payments due to coronavirus. I have $20k that I have immediate access to, but this is not nearly enough to sustain for even a month. My sibling(s) have roughly the same amount that we are pooling together.

1) One path I can take would be to go full force on my business, and pray that something works out for me and I can pay my tuition bill. 

2) I have some friends in high up places that may be able to set me up with a job, but I will have to forego a degree until I can afford to pay off my tuition. 

3) I suck it up, and find a way on my own through traditional means. 

4) I fucking pray.

426,"So lately, I have been questioning my friendship with my friends. I don't know but it's been different, especially now that they have another person in their lives. My close friend group has five girls but it's still hard to feel close on a personal level. No one was in a relationship except for one of my friends until last year. Now, three of them are in relationships and the other two have potential relationships.  I always tried to be there for them whenever they needed someone cause I value our friendship. Now. I feel that my feelings of trying to be close friends isn't validated the same. Whenever I talk to them on the phone or in person, they always talk about their boyfriend or what he said or did. Is it selfish or wrong of me to just want to talk about other things for once? I just feel that they prioritize the guy over me now and I'm just a back-up when the guy isn't there. Same with my roommate, I went to the store to accompany her. She mostly talked to her girlfriend on the phone talking about what to buy and I just followed behind her. She was looking for a cat bed and I gave my opinion on what I thought looked cute. She didn't say anything and picked something else and asked her girlfriend on the phone if she liked it. Another time, one of my close friends in a relationship asked to come over so she can see her boyfriend; that way her parents don't found out she is secretly dating. I felt happy because sleepovers are fun but then she told me that. She literally told me on the phone ""You know why I'm coming right?"" and I answered ""Because of him"" and she said ""Yeah cause he texted me saying he wanted to meet"". I don't know, I like being their friend and they have definitely helped me in tough times. But I just feel they prioritize relationships over friendships. Should I find new friends or cut them off or just be distant? Is this normal thing that happens or am I overthinking this? If so, how do I get over it?",24Apr2020,1
427,"I(15M) am a smart kid. I know that. I'm not trying to say I'm a genius, but I'm smart. Everyone around me knows it. I do consistently well in class, and would be one of the best in my class in most classes. I'm Irish and I'm in third year. I don't know the American equivalent and I don't really care. But this year we have two very important tests, the mocks and the Junior cert. 

How our school system works is that we are in secondary school for 6 years, and on the third and sixth year we have Nationwide test called the Junior cert and Leaving cert. There are also mocks for these tests, that happen towards the middle of the year. You do them, get graded, and they are kind of an indicator on what you should study. Depending on how well you do in the Leaving cert, you get points which will let you get into college and stuff. The better colleges require more points. The problem comes with these tests.

My parents are lovely people. I love them to bits and wouldn't wish them to change at all. But I always feel a pressure to succeed academically because they want a good future for me. I don't want to dissapoint them but I have some sort of a problem with tests and studying. I never get high marks in subjects that I know I'm good at. Studying doesn't help. I find studying incredibly hard to do. Even with nothing to distract me I find it incredibly hard to revise. I am much better suited at researching things and doing things like projects and school work. I completed my mocks and got pretty bad results in most subjects, especially the one subject that im not good at, which is Irish.

I made this post because I'm at a point where the Junior cert is cancelled, but there dividing percentages into a test that each teacher makes for the class when we come back, the work we done before the pandemic and the work we did during it. I want to know if anyone else had a certain problem with testing/studying and how you got over it. I don't feel like I can bring this up with my parents, as they will most likely say that I just didn't study enough for my mocks.

429,"I just officially ended a 10 month long relationship and even after putting so much work and effort into it, I ended up gas lighting it as always.

So for starters, my SO always told me about how controlling and selfish I can come off at times. But she also agreed that it was purely from good intent so we mostly never argued. But she told me that sacrifices at the end of the day are countable and she felt like she was being taken advantage of and thats completely understandable.

I always either end up blaming myself or lashing out at her because I'm an extremely unattached and defensive person. 

But I never even understood how to look at things from an 'us' perspective, Is loving someone at the end of the day just accepting as they come? Is pleading change out of respect at the end of the day always looked at as complaining? She used to drink for a while (not heavily about twice or thrice a month) but we used to have constant arguments about this because I don't like drinking.

We always end up having dead end arguments. So how do i look at things from a different perspective? How do I find a 'solution' if that even exists that is. How do i look at things from an 'US' perepective",24Apr2020,1

She thinks my boyfriend got the refund to his account, even though the holiday company never had his card details (she doesnt understand this no matter how much I tell her, she just straight up does not understand that money cant go into an account if they dont KNOW THE ACCOUNT DETAILS)

When I confronted her with ""did you open \[my boyfriend's\] letter?"" she said ""oh yeah, I was confused, I thought it was mine and someone was knocking at the door and I was pre-occupied and I wasn't looking""... so she threw every lie in the book at me literally all at once, lol.

446," 

Soooo I am a bit of a dilemma right now. I've never been in this type of situation before, and I don't really know how to handle it. I really need some solid advice, but if you want to help i urge you read through all of this to understand every detail.

**Our Friendship Begins. (February)**

I met this girl about 3 months ago. Beginning of February. She was friends of friends. We started talking and things were well. She was a genuinely nice person to talk to. But something that really caught my attention was how caring she was, and loving she was. I liked that.

At first, I didn't have any feelings for her. I really did just see her as a friend. However, as things progressed I slowly began to develop feelings for her. I personally don't find her SUPER attractive, I always thought she was just kinda cute, but the more I got to know her I fell in love with her as a person and now when I look at her I see a beautiful person with no flaws. So in the middle of March, I confessed to her. It didn't go the way I thought.

**The Confession. (Mid March)**

Reason why I confessed was because I thought she liked me too. She was talking to me A LOT. She became really close with me. And I felt it too. She was just \*too\* caring and loving towards me. Even when I told my friends the way she was acting they told me she's totally into me and encouraged me on to confess. So one night I confessed that I liked her a lot, but not in the friend way. We were texting since of the whole quarantine thing, it just had started. She took a while to respond but then said she didn't know what to say. She said she really likes me too, but not sure if her feelings for me were actual love or not. She doesn't want anything to be ruined between us, but insisted that she was glad I told her and she just needs to get her things figured out.

**The Aftermath. (End of March)**

I was obviously disappointed, but I wasn't super disappointed about it. We continued being friends and all was well. Since quarantine had begun, we really only text and call. The rest of March was nice. We continued being good friends, texting pretty much every day. It was clear that she was happy, and I was happy being her friend. However, i really couldn't help but continue to have feelings for her. But I was able to bury it in me and hide it.

**She Gives Signals AGAIN (Beginning of April)**

At the beginning of April, that's when things started to get real weird. Not only did the amount of texting ramp up even more, but she became even MORE loving and caring, but in a way that was really strange. We were easily sending 50-100 messages a day. Then she slowly started saying ""I love you"" more and more often. She started giving me signals I haven't seen before. She started saying she's happy I am in her life, shes glad we met, I mean so much to her, I am special to her, etc,. I started thinking that maybe... maybe she ""figured things out"". I started telling her the same things in return, saying I love her too and what not and she seemed to be accepting of that knowing what I confessed a few weeks ago. Then last week came.... oh boy

**The Wasted Incident (Last Week)**

I made a mistake. A big one. I got drunk. Yeah. You know where this is going. I was hanging out with my friends on a Discord call while drunk and they were telling me to shoot my second shot. So I started texting her, and I never really said anything. I told her I was drunk, and she thought it was cute and funny because I was being really loveable towards her. But then as things went on towards the end of the night I began playing games with her. I was messing with her busting her ""balls"". She didn't take it too well. She ended up calling asking what's going on and she was confused and well... We both ended up crying in a call. I was drunk and emotional. She was upset. But she insisted we'd talk about it the next day.

The next day we both felt emotionally burnt out. We both felt empty. We talked a little bit. She felt empty with no energy, and so did I, but both of us for different reasons. I was empty and drained because I began to realize the mistake I made while drunk. I was irresponsible and was being a dick to her. She was drained because of the games I was playing with her. But over the next few days things got back to normal for a bit. She eventually said she forgives me and that she knows that I actually care because she can tell I felt regret for what I did. However, after that things right now are iffy...

**Radio Silence and Confusion (Present Day)**

Things recently have been really weird and strange, and frankly I don't know what to think of it. While she claims she's forgiven me fully for what I did I feel like it's still bugging her. You see, the days following the incident things went back to normal for a while. Texting a lot. Lots of I love you nonsense. But at the start of this week (Monday) she's been texting less and less. And it's noticeable. Since I see that she's really not in the mood I have been holding back too to try and give her space and time to think. However, this morning I finally asked what's going on. I voiced my concerns and asked why she has been distancing herself. Her response was... confusing.

She told me that she promises it's nothing I did. She's in a weird mindset right now, and she's distancing herself from just not me but from everyone else too. She reiterated that she loves me so so much and im special to her and doesn't want me to ever leave her life. However, she has made many great friends recently and all of them are showing lots of care for her including me and she doesn't know how to handle it. She insists that this phase won't last forever though....

**What now? Stay Friends, Move on, or Make a Move?**

So with all that context, let me explain my feelings about all of this. First and foremost, I should say that she is a Hopeless Romantic (she's stated this herself). I looked it up and it basically means someone who values love over anything else, and they have a super big heart and is super loving to everyone. Explains why she has been super loving to me, and more than likely just be loving to me as a friend.

Secondly, my feelings for her have gotten out of control. I think about her 24/7. I \*love\* her to death, but not as a friend and I can't change that I really can't. I wish I could so I could leave that all behind, but she is perfect in my eyes. She's the best human I have ever met, and am glad she's in my life. However, I fear she doesn't share the same feelings with me, but who knows.

**I \*could\* stay friends with her**, but it would be really really difficult for me to view her as a friend. I really don't want to leave her because she has been scared I might leave her, and I promised her that I won't and I really don't want to break her heart. So staying as friends is in the realm of possibilities, but hard.

**If I move on,** it would be hard for me for the first few weeks. I'll feel very empty. She's become a part of my life and daily routine, and removing that is like removing a key subject in the big picture and it wouldn't feel the same without it, However once I have readjusted myself I will be able to move on, but lose a great person in my life in the process.

**Biggest risk is making a move though.** I already made a move once before, and she definitely remembers it because the night of the incident I told her that theres something I want to tell her but don't know how and she asked ""Is it you having a crush on me"" which I said no, but it shows it still is on the top of her head. It's still fresh. So if I make another one, it won't scare her away because thats just not the type of person she is, but it would be really awkward and I am not sure if the risk is worth it.

They said that I'm probably going to go tell my dad and that he spoils me too much.( My dad is not amazing either, and he does have anger issues, but he doesn't cause me as much stress or trauma as my mom).

449,"I’m writing this at 4:09AM PST so try to forgive my grammatical errors but, here we go:

I don’t really want to continue living. It sounds selfish to say considering the family I have left, but it’s just rough man. I guess the best way to describe it to you guys is to go from the beginning, it’s primarily two reasons.

I was a middle class kid growing up, had mostly everything I wanted by achieving things like graduating high school, going to college etc; My life was turned upside down when my best friend, my father died. His birthday had just passed- two day’s later he died, and I just felt so, lost. My dad was one of the biggest role models in my life and him passing overnight shoved me into adulthood, something I was not ready for what-so-ever. That’s reason number one, it’s been over a year since and I just don’t think I’ll ever recover because I constantly hold grief in my heart that I never got to experience the feeling of buying him a Christmas gift with my own money, as he passed before I got my first job. (I was 18 when he passed) I mean hell I never even got to come home from work and he’d be there and it’s just little things like that, constantly picking at me and my heart.

Reason two is my ex. We had been dating for four years with only two major arguments, one of them resulting in a brief breakup. The day he was admitted to the hospital, I called her, and talked and she as able to somewhat calm me down. We ended up getting back together and, we had been great until a couple days ago. She said she was contemplating the relationship, and was just wondering if she could better herself with me being there. I just don’t really understand what that means because I’ve poured so much into her you know? She had a rough childhood, polar opposites of me, I’m not going to get into specifics because it took her a long time for her to open up and tell me the details and that’d be an invasion of privacy but- I’m amazed at the woman she’s become from that rough background.
That’s why it hurts too, I’ve helped her become the woman she is, she suffered from so much, social anxiety, depression, mood swings, and for four years I helped her, her improvement was astounding and I felt like I actually mattered to someone in their life. I’ve been going through a rough patch currently and idk her news just really blindsided me, because I felt like I needed her now, and i feel like I still do. I just don’t know why she has to better herself at my expense, why would I have to be gone, out of her life romantically, for that? She told me she wanted me to be in her life as a friend and I honestly told her I couldn’t do that, as it would hurt me even more than her being gone, pretending that I’d be okay with that terrible situation, either way I’d be in a lose lose. With quarantine going on too, I feel even more alone than usual, talking to my friends don’t help, video games don’t help, I even lost my motivation to me a photographer so now i just feel like I’m drifting around day by day waiting to suddenly die.

450,"**I am M (17), suffering from moderate depression and sometimes feeling worried that I am not doing the right things for my own well being, in regards to my social relationships. Other times I feel relaxed about my behavior and relationships. I came to Reddit because I can't exactly google it too easily.**

**Girl (A): Very much introverted yet assertive. Is fighting a war within her own life in regards to mental health and family. Just context for better advice.**

**Me: Emotional, and reasonably extroverted yet indecisive.**

So my situation involves a Girl (A) and myself, we each have known each other for over a year now through school. I've had strong feelings that haven't shaken for this whole time and only recently have I discovered the magic of opening up to those around you. Throughout the last 2 months (ish) I opened up to my family about depression, and discussed feelings towards (A) to her. So a lot has been happening with therapy, anti-depressants, school work and my social life. Anyway, (A) and I talked about things and I need to note that she never explicitly stated she held any feelings back, instead implied it heavily (e.g. making moves physically and verbally like talking about cuddling and cute date ideas). We ended up talking daily and the chats we had were really energetic and full of life which made me beyond happy.

I also need to say that she said previously she doesn't want to officially date, but instead try things out and see how they go which has happened and things worked out really well between us. So I don't really have a word for us apart from 'mutually?' attracted peers.  
Then, quite randomly our chats started getting quieter to the point I just get left on seen or even unseen (replies to other group chats but doesn't open DM). I try to never ever assume ones situation over messages and how they are emotionally coping as of that time but the inconsistency of conveyed emotions is really taking its toll on me emotionally. As inconsistent, I mean that some nights she sends an overwhelming (but lovely) amount of affection, other nights she will completely ignore me.

**My main dilemma is whether I should bring it up or leave it**, I don't know what she may be feeling but I also think I need to set boundaries for myself as I spend nights really emotionally hurting. I know I am quite sensitive, I try to never show it but this gets to me on a different level most nights. 

I want only the best for her and myself, and I may just be having a hard time accepting that she may not have feelings back, but I need some other perspectives that aren't as love driven as mine. I find her gorgeous and unbelievably smart, she often doesn't see what I see, but I have very strong feelings towards her.

453,"Hi there,

I'm considering doing an undergrad in artificial intelligence ([https://www.jku.at/en/degree-programs/types-of-degree-programs/bachelors-and-diploma-degree-programs/ba-artificial-intelligence/](https://www.jku.at/en/degree-programs/types-of-degree-programs/bachelors-and-diploma-degree-programs/ba-artificial-intelligence/)) and then the MSc in Banking and Finance: [https://finance.univie.ac.at/en/studies/master-banking-and-finance/](https://finance.univie.ac.at/en/studies/master-banking-and-finance/) .

And then afterwards doing an **MSc in Banking and Finance, CFA**  or maybe an MSc in Business Informatics (possible already checked).   This is all in Austria, but I would like to hear a US perspective as  well.

The job that I'd like to do  is analyzing and working with financial data. Trying to implement  machine learning algorithms for example to optimize sales or expenses.  However, I'd also want to look at the data and be able to make  judgements, i.e. should based on the data mining we've done, launch a  product like this? Etc. Eventually moving into a more management  positions later in life.

I want to  to know if I'm making the right choice and not shooting myself in the  foot by going for an AI rather than a normal Computer Science. The main  differences are:  
\-In AI there is almost no hardware courses (I don't care about CPU architecture etc, so for me it's one of the main reasons)  
\-In Comp Sci it's more broad, so there's for example media formats and very theoretical computer stuff  
\-AI  in contrast is a lot of math and statistics (I think more than 60 ECTS  minimum) and then applied machine learning as well as a little bit of  sociology (AI and society - yes it's kind of irrelevant for a job) as  well as of course programming and software development (I'll be taking  those electives).

So the way I see  it is I get to skip a lot of the theoretical computer science stuff  that I won't use in job, even as a normal programmer (you won't be  making compilers for instance). And I get to focus on what I enjoy more,  working with data and learning how to implement machine learning  solutions.

How does the undergrad  tie in with the MSc/CFA/Business Informatics? Well, both options are  very qualitative and with a lot of math skills behind me it'll surely be  a lot easier to do. Statistics especially will come in handy when  working with for example the evaluation of companies and assets.  Meanwhile, from the Masters I'll get the knowledge on how to read  financial data and interpret it. This will help me when implementing or  analyzing machine learning models, because I know how the models work as  well as how finance and investment works.

The  main thing I thought is that most business degrees are generic and the  market is flooded with them. Plus they teach little practical skills,  i.e. a lot of these leadership management and even economics courses  aren't as useful as they seem. Rather, experience would be the best  teacher when it comes to business. So I thought I'd rather focus on  skills that are rare and interdisciplinary (Math, Statistics,  Programming and Machine Learning)

Thoughts? Am I making a good choice?",24Apr2020,1
454,"Hi Reddit.
So, this is the third time this month I've gotten sick, even though I'm taking a lot of precautions. I don't have a diagnosed immunodeficiency, but I do have health problems overall and have gotten sick more frequently than my peers for as long as I can remember.

My mother is in charge of a care centre/home for people who are trying to sober up from alcohol and/or drug use. While it is a quite small facility, people are technically free to come and go as they like, and a lot of them do. Some of them are high-risk, but don't seem to care much about the situation. My mother's co-worker is also high-risk, and he (as well as another worker) has requested they start using face masks while working, but my mother thinks it's a significant overreaction. She says it would be ""weird"" if they started using masks. As they can't have hand disinfectant (alcohol) in the facility, and people refuse to practice social distancing, I worry about this being a recipe for disaster.

Especially now that my mother has symptoms of a cold, and refuses to stay home (because no one can fill her position) and my father is coming home after a full week of work in my country's most infected city, I feel like I have to talk to her about this. What can I show/tell her that could possibly change her mind?
My country has extremely relaxed regulations about this, so there is nothing legal I can do as far as I'm aware. But this isn't okay. She putting me at risk, she's putting her co-workers at risk, and putting her patients at risk and I'm NOT okay with it. Please help. Any advice is appreciated.",24Apr2020,1

458,"I almost never use reddit but figured that there is no easier way to seek advice than here. I also feel the need to Express my thoughts. Sorry if it is confusing, I don't understand the half of it either.

For a while now, my father has wished to transition, male to female. It's been just fine for me and practically everyone who knows him, but his wife is very angry about it.

Now to tell you more about my father, he is a hard working man who has been truthful to my brother and I. My step-mom however is the opposite. She quit her job 10 years ago and has always lied to my family.

She has stolen money from me. my brother, and my father. She has been a heavy opioid user ever since I was in middle school and has almost died due to overdose.

Whenever any sort of conversation about my father's transition is brought up between the two of them, she goes into a bathroom sobbing and forced herself to throw up. And it is super hard for anyone in my house to sympathize with her due to how long this has been going on for. We just see it as a repetitive process of her not getting her way.

And to explain my parents relationship with one word as of now. it'd have to be 'toxic.' They both love each other but my step-mom is extremely manipulative and asks questions like, ""do you even love me?"" to both my father and my brother and I.

There have been events at my house that my step-mom has claimed to be robberies. Mind you we live in a quiet neighborhood, primarily elderly that is right next to a school and down the road is the police station. And after each of these events, nothing would be stolen but my step-mom would have small bruises. I have had several people in my life tell me that she could've caused self-harm in order to get more medications.

Another event like this occurred recently after one of the conversations about my father's transition. She couldn't handle it and decided to take her keys (but not the car) and run off somewhere and soon she came back, her hoodie torn up and scratches on her skin that don't line up.

So my father is in the process of divorcing her because of how agonizing it is for our whole household due to her behavior. But he's having trouble doing so because of his mother's will. Before she died she gave 1/2 the house to each parent. And he doesn't want there to be a legal battle over the house.

He wants my brother's and I to be safe. And even wants her to fix her life up. But she is in complete denial of everything and believes that her and my father need counseling because ""he's ruining everyone's lives.""

Thanks for reading if you did, I just need some kind of advice I can give my father.",24Apr2020,1

461,"I have serious trust issues and they’re getting worse. I can’t cope anymore. I have been betrayed so many times and it’s created very severe trust issues for me that have complicated my relationship. My current partner hasn’t cheated or strayed to my knowledge. In fact as far as I know he is 100% faithful and loyal and says so all the time as does all his family they always say it’s one thing he would never ever do he just isn’t that type of person at all. The issue is I’ve been betrayed before and not just by ex boyfriends I mean by my dad my sister my whole family basically. Hidden truths, lies, back stabbing, trying to deliberately hurt and betray me. It’s caused me to have really bad trust issues. 

When I don’t care as much about someone I’m fine in the beginning I didn’t care about anything because real feelings weren’t there I was so calm and chilled out because I had my barrier up. As soon as he got past that barrier my trust issues festered severely. I am actively trying to fight them off I really am I know it’s not healthy and not fair and I am NOT accusing him of cheating on me all the time etc I’ve asked him maybe 2-3 times if he is but with valid reasons behind them I.e. him becoming increasingly distant with me and being on his phone constantly at all times and hours. 

He’s a transparent person and has told me I can go through his phone. He set up my finger print so I can go on his phone and he has access to mine however I haven’t ever breached his trust and done it. The issue is I have realised how bad I’ve got because his phone is linked to his iPad which we both use. I was on the photos as I had taken screenshots when online shopping and had seen he had taken selfies of himself. He isn’t the type to take pictures. They’re just normal face pictures but they’re labelled under snapchat (I found them under all and then checked the individual folders and they was saved on snapchat) and my brain went crazy thinking he’s sending girls pictures of himself on snapchat. 

I KNOW this isn’t right I know it and honestly it makes me feel so low and so horrible that I want to know how to stop. I need some advice on how to change this. I want to make it clear I have purposely not been on his phone I refuse to invade his privacy unless I have solid evidence or a very distinct gut feeling that something isn’t right and feel it’s my only option. But I just don’t know what to do. He took a couple selfies with himself pouting a bit and I automatically jump to him sending it to other girls. I need help. This isn’t normal or fair to him or to my mental health. 

Side note: I tried therapy twice with two different therapists (overall 20 sessions) and was just told that I have a lot of worry and anxiety. Nothing was done they didn’t really help in anyway so I’m at a loss as to how I can help myself now. I don’t want to ruin this.",24Apr2020,1

I am 19 years old living at home with my mother father and 2 younger siblings during quarantine. I am an essential worker and still working. 
My mother began having an affair about 8 months ago. My father found out and it destroyed him mentally. He stopped eating and sleeping and became anxious depressed and contemplated suicide around christmas time. He confided in me and I supported him through all this, however he did not confront my mother, as she has been struggling mentally for a year now. A month ago, I confronted my mother as I saw how much my father was hurting. She claimed she didn’t cheat and at the time I had no physical evidence to prove she did. My father recently found a note hinting towards suicide written by my mother. He also found evidence of her cheating and plans on confronting her. I am petrified that my mother will not be able to cope with myself and my father knowing about her affair and that she will attempt to commit suicide. My father is also an essential worker so is not at home during the day. I have been trying my best to support both my parents during their mental challenges. I am afraid that my father will blame me if anything happens my mother (he is still in love with her and is happy to continue their marriage if she stops the affair.) I will also blame myself for pushing my father to confront her due to me worrying about his state of mind. A year ago I began to recover from chronic depression self harm and suicidal thoughts and came off antidepressants before christmas and I am petrified that I will not be able to stay clear of such thoughts and stay positive and able to support my parents through their mental struggles.

I also dread anytime my phone receives a phone call or text message as i’m afraid something has happened. I am struggling and I don’t know what to do for my parents if both become suicidal.

Hello Everyone!

A while ago, in February, I commissioned an artist to draw a design for a tattoo for me. I came up with the design myself. It was finished, and he posted my design that he made on his Instagram. Fast forward to now, and the same artist posted a design that is EXTREMELY similar to mine for a different person. I guess they saw the post with my design and liked it. Some parts are even exact copies. Basically, there are just a few changes to what I originally commissioned.

I am honestly just a bit hurt because my design is very sentimental to me, and to have someone rip it off and put it on their own body weirds me out. I just want to know if there is any way I can resolve this. Would it be helpful to talk to the artist? Or the person who ripped it off? What should I say if I do talk to them?

Any advice is appreciated, thanks!",24Apr2020,1
468,"I created a creative concept around two years ago which got me a lot of media attention and interviews plus large projects with big companies earning me around £5k-10k on just one project. I also managed to gain a large social media following of 20k followers.

Everything was great!! However, when I started making money I noticed my creativity of the project started to disappear.. it became way more focused on how I can earn more money and gain more followers. Because I had also seen several people do a similar concept and be invested around 1 million+ in their company. So it became a sense of desperation with the feeling of ‘why am I not growing as fast as these people?’

I started to not enjoy the project. It became very very toxic. I would work on it every day, be thinking about it all the time but in a negative way because I couldn’t work our how to grow. I was stuck on 20k for several months. At the same time I started to see lots of people copying my concept because the program I was using was accessible to everyone. But I had twisted it in a different way and now people started to do the same thing. 

In the past week a very very big pioneer in the creative industry reposted some work of one of the people who had copied my concept. Their visual work is worse then mine and their concept is one that they copied from me. They gained loads of followers from it and opportunities to collaborate with companies and artists I admire ! It really hit me hard. I had spent the past two years working really hard to grow and work on projects and keep my concept going and all of a sudden these people who copied me start gaining rewards from my ideas and taking them away from me.. who was the original source of the concept. On top of that everyone is commenting on their profiles things like ‘you’re on to something here’ and ‘this is purely genius,  you’re about to blow up’.

I know I can probably go into fight mode and message lots of brands and companies to do collaborations to get more of these eyes on me and create great videos to make it clear when I created this work and just to add more great visuals to the project.. but I just feel SOOO drained. I don’t even want to go out of my way and do this anymore. I was in the middle of a two week break and really enjoying taking a step back and then this happens and I’m just feeling overwhelmed with pressure again. 

But then I kinda feel like a loser or a feeling of I’m giving up when I could really turn this around and gain even more opportunities as I did before..

But I wouldn’t be happy. But at the same time if I took a step back what would the point of coming back to it anymore ?? Especially with all these people copying me and taking the opportunities and originality away from my project. But then if I didn’t come back Id feel like these past two years were a waste and I’ll have a random social media account that I grew but don’t use.

I’m just confused with how to move forward. My mind is all over the place and i just feel extremely drained.

(This is a bit of a vent so it may drag on)

She has a slight hoarding issue, which we believe may be psychological due to her past (she used to move around a lot when she was younger, so never really had a stable childhood in one place and had to leave a lot of things behind); this hoarding issue has possibly lead to my accumulation of OCD. I try not to not blame her for this, but it really upsets me when she doesn't consider how other people in the house feel when she buys new things. She recently bought ANOTHER gigantic clock for the kitchen (over 2m wide). There are already 4 clocks in this one room. It isn't just me thinking she is hoarding, as my dad also thinks she has an issue. Whenever I confront her about it she victimises herself, saying I am being mean to her and rude, completely dismissing the fact that she has a whole room in the house to put her junk in, which was previously the spare bedroom. Her efforts are not helping my dad either, who has been having a rough time at work and has been facing severe stress issues. 

Furthermore, I also feel like I have been disregarded as her 2nd favourite child. My brother who is currently working away is older than me and has already achieved a lot in his line of work. If you look around our house there are (I've counted) merely 2 photos with me in. But there are dozens of pictures of him. 

In addition, she does things to purposely upset me. She sometimes acts like a child and says inappropriate things (my dad says her mother used to say the same stuff to her).

473,"I'm a black F, and am in my late years of high school,  coming from a traditionally African American family. I have 5 brothers, all adults and moved out of the house (one recently passed away). Now I only live with them and no other sibling in the house. We're close, and I feel incredibly blessed to have them, but.. I'm very ashamed to talk about my mental health around them. My mother immediately gets defensive, and acts as if having a mental illness is some type of taboo. She once embarassed me in public for bringing up the fact that I MIGHT have depression, or some type of disorder that makes me procrastinate severely. My parents want their children to be perfect---I'm anything but. I USED to be a straight-A student, but I'm not anymore. I've never been the most social, or smart. And they always have something to say that triggers an insecurity about my physical appearance.. how I don't have the ""butts that black girls should have"". My mother always points out how a celebrity is too fat or too skinny. Again, my mental health or MAYBE mental disorder is ignored. When I would try to defend myself, they would restrict me from certain things, like my phone or game system. 

When I started to draw and showed a passion for drawing at a young age, they initially didn't support me. It was only when I got better and even exhibited at a small local gallery, that they were ""proud"" of the route I chose. It's like as I get older, I become more aware that my parents are more like siblings. Again--usually, we're close. My parents usually support me. And I should point out the fact that I am incompetent in some aspects of my life (my mother washes and braids my hair, and I'm just now learning how to cook for myself). They expect me to continue to live with them when I go off to college. They expect me to deal with my MAYBE mental issues without a therapist or medication. And yes, my mother is an anti-vaxxer, not so much my father. I don't know. I'm even afraid that I someone I know will stumble upon this one day. Who knows what will happen next? Is this all because I'm their youngest, and only daughter?",24Apr2020,1
474,"Bit of backstory for this, me and my current girlfriend are both 18 and have been together a year but I had a relationship prior to this one which was badly toxic, mentally and somewhat physically abusive (Let’s call her Karen cos what’s not a better name). My sleep is really bad lately I’m going asleep between 3 and 6 am and waking up around 12-3pm, i also kept waking up today, well I woke up before and my girlfriend told me I had said in my sleep Karen’s name followed by some mumbling. I don’t remember having a dream about her or anything but I’m worried my girl will be annoyed with me I did say sorry but I think stuff like that sticks with someone and she’s a really understanding person.

477,"Since the virus outbreak my classes and my exams have been moved online, so I have been staring at my computer screen for an average of 10 hours a day for three weeks now. My classes are over but my exams are this week and the next, so I don't really have a choice since all my notes are on my laptop, but I'm getting frequent headaches/migraines and my eyes hurt because of the screen which makes it really hard to focus.

I don't have time to re-write all my notes by hand at this point, and wearing my glasses doesn't really help (I'm near-sighted). Painkillers helps with the headaches sometimes, but not with the actual migraines. I also have a blue light filter on my screen, so I don't know what to do anymore.

479,"Hi, so a friend of mines has a switch (normal full one) and I recieved a switch lite for my birthday in December. I didn't want a full switch unless it was an AC version which I thought for a while would come out when AC came out and I was holding out for this.   


I however, wanted to get pokemon to play with my boyfriend so we got the switch lite together as my birthday gift, still incase the AC switch came out.   


So now I have both and the AC switch is retailing at crazy prices so I intend to keep that in my home and use the lite for travel (eventually) i.e. on planes, trains etc as I did like to travel a bit before the current situation.   


However, a friend of mines has asked to buy my switch lite for his gf, at a second hand price. I would be more than happy to let her borrow it during the quarantine period as I know AC has helped me a lot during this time and our friend group BUT I know that AC you cannot transfer the save data between consoles so if she bought her own switch after she would have to restart. So in this instance id feel more like ok selling makes sense to them BUT they want specifically a second hand switch while I thought they were just struggling to obtain one and have sent them a link to in stock switches near them.   


So, the lite is retailing at £200 and I wouldnt want to sell for much less than that in the first place as its basically new. I don't know how cheap he wants to buy it for but if its less than £180 I don't think I can say yes as I would be buying a lite again for the retail price and have a net loss. Myself and my boyfriend bought it together for my birthday because I didn't feel like I could spend the £200 on it in the first place. So I see where they are coming from in wanting it cheaper but it would mean, I would have to have a loss too.   


So really I feel very guilty and would like some moral advice, I have told him it was a gift and he backed off. I have suggested he can borrow it but have told him about the save data not being transferable (sadly) and I have another layer of guilt because he earns a few thousand more than me and is on furlough for 100% pay (80% gov and 20% his company) while I am still working and I know his house bills and such come to a lot less than my own. I know him and his girlfriend are saving for a mortgage but so am I ... so I feel like overall it would hurt me more to lose out on money here than them. But I feel extremely bad for this thought too. I feel very selfish and I honesly would love someone to kind of tell me if I am being that way and maybe what they would do in this situation. :(",24Apr2020,1

I never had amazing relationship with my parents, especially my father, but when I got to university I moved out of my parents place to live with some friends. 

Now I'm in my last uni year but due to all corona situation my all classes got cancelled and now is online, my part job is closed to .. So, I had no more choice than to go live with my parents again. I mean I have no boyfriend to live with, rent is super expensive and without my job and classes there is no much point to live there..

But living with my parents is hell. My mother is super controlling. I'm not a child (25F) but she keeps telling me what to eat, when to go to sleep and basically what to do 24/7. You say ""no"" and she doesn't get it, she keeps repeating it. She ""knows better"" about everything. 

My father is the worst. He has real anger issues, so my parents always argue about something and I can hear everything because our house walls are really thin. He is always angry about everything - politics, prices, neighbours and basically everything. We don't have any normal conversations, every time he  ends up shouting about something or talking with super raised tone. 

If there was no corona virus, I would never come back living with my parents. But the worst thing I don't know how much this would continue and how everything would be after. Quarantine is really strict in my country. So, you can't even go anywhere to run away from being at home. I go out once a week to do shopping for family, that's it.

486,"Due to coronavirus, my boyfriend's house is safer to quarantine than mine, so I've been here.  He lives with two sisters, his mom, and that's it. My boyfriend's sister's boyfriend's mom just died due to the virus, and my boyfriend's mom's boyfriend just succumbed to cancer. (still with me?)

I stay in his room a lot, I don't hang out with his family much. We have conversations when we happen to be existing in the same area, like when my boyfriend and I are in the kitchen making food, or if they catch us outside when we're playing with his dog. We're on nice terms, we get along and have nice small talk, but we never once have just like, hung out. Just for background on my relationships with them.

Especially because I never just hang out with them, I don't know how to approach talking to them about it? But I want to be there for them and I want them to know that I feel so badly for them and I'm not just completely in my own world in my boyfriend's room. I have to acknowledge it somehow.

My best idea for a segue into acknowledging their loss is by giving them gifts, which would also be something to help them feel better / cared about at the same time. However, I don't have a car, and my boyfriend's car doesn't work, and we're absolutely not about to ask any of them if we can borrow their cars. Besides, I don't want to be around them until I am prepared to acknowledge their loss. 

So, if I did give them gifts, it would have to be something done in my boyfriend's room with what's already in there. Unless my boyfriend goes and gets something close by with his bike while I stay in his room.... But it would still need to be created in his room. I can't just straight up buy something because it wouldn't mean anything.

My only thoughts so far is something to do with artwork. I have my sketchbook and art markers but I'm no Picasso. It's not like I could just make them nice pictures of the lost family members or something. Oragami seems extremely stupid.... help me out here please :( I've been up all night thinking about it but now it's 8:38AM so I'm running out of time to figure this out....

I am posting looking for genuine, unbiased advice. I need to know if I am wrong for how I feel and how I plan on going about things if his mom has no where else to go or if I am justified. If I am wrong, please be kind and let me know how you think I should go about this. I’m open to suggestions. I’m open to change. I want this to work, but at the same time I feel I have to set some serious boundaries because I just cannot deal with her.

Please bare with me, this may be long but I’m going to try to remember to include all details I can so you have the correct picture of what’s happened and what I fear will and can realistically happen.

When I met my bf on New Year’s Eve, he was living with his buddy and buddies gf. His mom and her two teens moved in with them. His mom is separated from her husband (not my bfs dad) and lived with her parents before taking the 4 hour trip to move in with my bf, his buddy and his buddies gf. My bfs goal was to help her get back on her feet as this was the first time in like 17 years she was “doing it alone” and with two kids, now 15 and 17.

After about 2 months of us dating, my bf and his mom and the two kids found their own house to rent. About a month later, in April 2019, I moved in. My bf wanted me to continue to goto college to become an RN and to save any money I made for our future, but I did help buy household groceries because I felt that was only fair. It was all good at first, if not a bit crowded with 5 people in a 3 bedroom house with 4 pets (my one small dog came with me). His mom and sister had the master bedroom with their own bathroom, we had a tiny bedroom and his brother had his own room.

It wasn’t long until problems started to arise with his mom. They let their dogs pee and poo everywhere. It was pretty gross. Their steam cleaner broke so my mom gave me hers to keep there. If I didn’t steam clean the carpet, or stay on the kids to do it, it didn’t get done. Same went for any household cleaning, really. Please keep in mind it wasn’t my dog messing in the house, it was theirs. The house would get gross, quick. I can handle messy, but pee spots on top of pee spots littered the floor with poo marks from where poo was picked up but not cleaned. The smell was awful and I was honestly embarrassed to have anyone come over. And sometimes poo would have sat there for days in a corner. You could tell because it was hardened.

Not only that but throughout living there with them, if my bf and I were in the bedroom with the door closed, I cannot even count how many times she just opened the door without knocking. Keep in mind I was 31 and he was 29. (Now 32 and 30). A few times she just missed us being intimate. Even after we had talks with her about it, she would still do this because she “forgot”. Trying to get alone time in that house was hard. We could be having an intimate moment and it was a night I cooked dinner. The dinner would be done and sitting on the oven top and instead of checking the kitchen herself, his mom would yell for us or (rarely) knock on the door and interrupt our time. It felt like dealing with a teenager who you couldn’t set boundaries with.

Anyhow, about 5 months after dating my bf his moms car gives out on her. She kept asking me to take her to work each morning even after my bf told her no because she had to be there early in the morning and I worked 2nd shift and would be asleep. She asked to use my car and come bring it back when I need to goto work and I told her no. One thing lead to another and I agreed to help her by going in on the loan. I was added as an owner of the car too, but I didn’t him find that out until more recently. Keep this in mind for later.

While all this is happening, his mom is talking about her then 16 year old daughters bf moving in, in a few months, when he turned 18, as well as my bfs 80ish year old great aunt moving in. I was very against this as there just wasn’t the space in this tiny home. I was trying not to be pushy because while I lived there, it still wasn’t my house and I hadn’t been around any of them long. Her daughters bf never moved in but the aunt almost did, she stayed a few months, then her and the mom had a falling out. The falling out was over something I agreed with the aunt about. I actually happened to really like the great aunt.

So, his mom was doing the online dating thing, still is. She was talking to some guy who lived overseas (turned out he was cat fishing her) and she wanted him to move in after about 2 months of talking to him. The Aunt didn’t like it, I didn’t like it, my bf didn’t like it. She was pissed at all of us, told the aunt off, told me she was a grown woman and could do as she pleases etc. he never ended up moving in, obviously. But he was the first of many men catfishing her and causing us all issues.

My bf and his mom split the bills for the house. He paid the rent and she paid all the other bills(electric, water, internet, both his and her car insurance, cell phone bill) which was equal to the rent. Except she kept adding to that, which was more than she could handle. For example, new expensive mattresses, and having to use my bfs credit to do it because her credit is shot to hell. Over $3k in mattresses. 

Come to find out she let the cars insurance lapse so many times I cannot keep count, for both her and my bf. I urged my bf to get on his own insurance and he eventually did. I didn’t put two and two together as soon as I should have about her car insurance. I am on the loan and title of the car. If she doesn’t have full coverage car insurance on a financed car, that puts me on a big hook, not to mention if she gets into an accident I could potentially be sued. We have a falling out about this, because I feel I have to protect myself. 

All while this is happening, she isn’t paying her share of the bills, power/internet/cable/cell phones get cut off. Bailout happens. I have to put it on my credit card because I can’t afford months of her not paying upfront ($1000 for power) as well as a $500 internet/cable bill she hadn’t paid. I’ve had to pay her cell phone bill twice of $120, but only because my bf was on the plan at the time and he absolutely needed his phone for work. I often wonder where all her money goes If she isn’t paying a single bill, as it seems. (And yes my bf helped me pay the credit cards down. He did his best on both ends)

Anyway, we get all her bills caught up for her so she is at square one to start fresh. She still lets her car insurance lapse. And again, at the time, I didn’t know I was also an owner of the car on the title. Keep in mind I am also making car payments of $180 so my credit doesn’t take a hit. At this point I’ve made as many car payments as she has on a car she claims is hers only.

Also during this time, she drops and breaks her phone screen. My bf and I have mutual credit cards we needed to pay down from all the debt we had on there from helping her. At the time, he was using a Walmart bank card thing for his direct deposits. His mom had access to this account and “thought” he has given her the ok to use the $300 he had in there to buy herself a new $270 phone. He didn’t give her the okay, she said she needed a new phone and his response was, “okay?...”. As in, that has what to do with me? (He back tracks now and feels bad for her for misunderstanding him because she also “needed” the phone for work which is bs. Al she used her phone for us talking to men) He gets paid weekly. He had no money for gas or food that week. Of course I helped him but at the time our finances were separate, I had my own bank account. After this we opened a joint account and our money went into that account where his mom had no access. They had gotten into a fight after she spent that money, he told her basically he can’t keep doing this with her, how he needed new breaks for his car that he hasn’t been able to afford. Etc. because he keeps having to pick her up off her feet. 

During all this time, she makes sure she has a gym membership and is going to the gym to lose weight for the men she is talking to online. She is very overweight. I find this frustrating because I feel like we are bending over backwards to help her while she isn’t doing what she needs to be doing to help herself. Going to the gym, hair down and nail salon while we pay bills you’re supposed to be covering.

November 2019, just before Thanksgiving, we find out I am pregnant. He tells his mom that he is saving a set amount each month for his child and no one will change that. I guess she accepted that challenge.

Things get rough, she had lost her food stamp income because she got a higher paying job a few months back, plus was “working” a day shift at her old job since she has a 3 day weekend each week with her new job (1 hr days 4 days a week). My bf and I don’t have enough money to feed everyone, pay all these bills and afford our gas (at the time he drove over an hour to and from work in a gas guzzling car and I drove 45 mins to and from. Together we spent about $600+ easy in gas and he often had to buy lunch out as he works construction) She is bitching that she is sick and tired of hearing that her kids are hungry while we are doing our best to keep everything afloat. This was an attempt to make him feel guilty. She is good at doing this and it works often.

Now, his mom called out of work all the time. At least once a week it seemed. I never could understand it. If you’re hurting on bills and have no money, don’t slack and expect others to pick up the pieces for you. That’s my mindset. She had “taken” about two weeks off work with no pto cause she had already used it up during the holidays, supposedly, and said she had diarrhea and couldn’t return to work until it was gone.. I was annoyed because I knew what that meant. We would have to spend more money we didn’t have because she just can’t do right. In fact my bf and I had a fight that morning because I was talking to him about her never being at work anymore and bills were due with the car that I’m financially tied to. I forget what he said at this point but it turned into a fight between us and he stormed out to work.

At this point my bf and I have been together about a year. I continue having the same talks with my bf on how things need to change with his mom and that I can’t keep doing this with her. He agreed but we argued plenty because he can’t just “toss her out”, especially since she has his two siblings that he won’t allow to be homeless. I told him they can go stay with her parents. Granted they don’t want to deal with her either. 

That night my bf and her get into it over something and she breaks down and tells him that not only did she get fired from her full time job(which is obviously why she hadn’t been going to work), that she had also given her last whole paycheck to some man online to “get him home” from the military. She has no money and can’t pay anything (nothing new there I guess).

My bf called me while I was at work to tell me this, I worked 2nd shift then. He was upset and did the whole “please don’t tell me you told me so” because I had been telling him for months this wasn’t right and She needed to be more financially responsible because we can’t keep this up. I often voiced how I felt she should be doing more to help her own situation so him and I could detach and start taking care of ourselves and our own family. Needless to say, I freaked out because I didn’t know what to do and I couldn’t take it anymore. We couldn’t keep dealing with her and we had a baby on the way. This wasn’t working. Not only that but I’m pissed at how she guilted him about her kids being hungry when SHE gave her entire paycheck to some man, all while we were doing the best we could. This lead to him telling her that she needed to get her own place and we would be getting our own place.

Luckily after she got fired, the job she worked at 1 day a week hired her full time.

His mom gets an advance on her tax return January of this year, a little over $1k, because she is flat broke from being fired and giving her money away. She states she got insurance on the car (she didn’t really, come to find out via the DMV). I don’t know where any of the money went because yet again, the power was being threatened to be cut off and the internet/cable was due and she couldn’t pay it. The car note was due and she couldn’t pay it. We had to pay over $1k for the power bill again and $400 for the internet/cable because she let both go for months, again, without paying. These went on my credit cards. Her and I had it out about this. I asked her where all her money was going if all these bills are months behind and hadn’t been paid on since the last time my bf and I paid them and I’m having to pay her car note so it doesn’t effect me. She gives some bs about how she can give me a list but she will need to write it up. I tell her she needs to get her act straight with the car that I won’t allow myself to be negatively impacted because of her inability to do right financially. She basically tells me I can take her to civil court. Again, this is before I knew I was also an owner of the car. After this fight with her I went to the car loan place and got the documents showing not only am I on the loan as the main person but I’m an owner of the car just as much as she is.

So he had told his mom we are getting our own place and she needs to do the same. He tells her not to worry about any of the bills but to save her money up(including the advance she got on her taxes) to find a new place to stay. Especially since the lease was up at the end of February. We moved out February 2nd and paid all the bills up until she moved out of that house at the end of February plus our apartment. She didn’t pay any bills all this time except her cell phone bill, I even paid the car note. Yet she only had enough for a $400 down payment on an income based apartment. She needed a $500 deposit for the utilities because she has past due utilities on her credit and doesn’t know what to do. I find a local church that gave her $250 toward it, we ended up having to give her $250, money we didn’t have to cover the rest. 

Again, this should have been something she was saving for whole we were paying all the bills via my credit card. But I did it because if she didn’t get the utilities on, she couldn’t move in to the apartment and she would have no where to go and I didn’t want her moving into my tiny apartment. My bf talked to me a month prior before she found a place and while we were looking for a house to buy at the time (that fell through so we got an apartment) on how there was a real possibility she may not find a place in the time given and she would need to stay with us. I told him no, that I cannot live with her and that instead of paying us back with her tax return money to use it all to move on and get a new place. He agreed with that. Before his mom found this apartment, he had told her that her and the two kids could stay in our second bedroom (our daughters bedroom) until she found something. I wasn’t happy about that because I knew how it’d play out and to be quite frank, I didn’t want to deal with her shit anymore. But she did end up finding a place. Luckily.

During this time she doesn’t have car insurance on the car and is seeing this man who is partially staying with her. He seemed nice but was using her, waiting on her to get her full tax return apparently. Anyway, we come to help her move with my parents truck and trailer (my parents live 2 hrs away so we had been driving 4 hours total at this point). 

The house we all used to live in and rent was utterly trashed. Even more animal stains on the carpet, if that’s even possible. Trash everywhere. They’d been smoking in the house, ashes from cigarettes all over everything. Being pregnant, I hated going into there and smelling the smoke. I was disgusted at the state of everything. But I did it. I just wanted to get it all over and done with.

We figured between my parents truck, the trailer and “her” car we would get it all moved quickly. Turns out she was letting her new bf use her uninsured car that day to drive an hour away for physical therapy. He never returned until the next day, even though he was supposed to come back that night.

My bf and I had a big fight that weekend. I told him I was done paying his moms way, helping her out with gas money as much as we did, for her to pull this crap with the car. I can’t even begin to tel you how many fights we have gotten into because of her. While he sees her shit and understands, it’s still his mom and he feels obligated to take care of her and his siblings. And I get that, but at what point do you not allow yourself to be taken advantage of?

So anyway, after we finished helping her move That weekend, my bf already laid into her about the car situation. I basically told her, again, nicely, to get her shit together, get the car insured, or I will do whatever I had to do to protect myself financially and legally. I had found out I was part owner of the car and let her know it. She said I wasn’t and I showed her proof. She told me she didn’t like feeling like I was her mother regarding the car and she couldn’t have that and I essentially told her I didn’t give a damn, she was messing with my life and credit, and I felt that was messed up considering I was just trying to help her. I’ve let her know more than once I am done. I have a baby on the way and I can’t be worried about her messing my life up financially. She told my bf if I took her to court that she was screwed. I have screenshots from the DMV website of her not having insurance and continue to monitor it to ensure it stays insured. The moment the insurance lapses we will have an issue. I’ve already decided I won’t make anymore payments on the car and if it is repossessed, so be it. I’ll take the hit. But Ill also try to talk to the loan company and explain the situation and tell them if I can take possession of the car from her I will in order to keep a repo off my file. Though currently she is still driving around on an expired registration and she owes $110 before she can even renew it because she let the insurance lapse so many times and for so long that they fined her for it.

Anyway, She finally got her actual taxes back early/mid March, though it wasn’t as much as she planned on.(the tax advance was a small portion of what she was supposed to get back that was supposed to help her move, hah...) She did put insurance on the car and paid the car note, this I know for sure. I have no idea what else she paid except her cell phone bill because obviously that works. Money disappears with her. 

The car loan people call me wanting their payment early April 2020. The note is due on the 1st of each month. I tell them to call his mom, she uses the car, wants to keep it, she can pay for it . After I get off the phone with them I text her and basically let her know we aren’t paying the car note anymore and ensure that she can pay it plus the insurance. She said she is fine she doesn’t need us to pay for it. But that she wants to do a deferred note for the car to the end of the loan.

Fast forward to this past Tuesday the 21st of April and she comes over to our apartment(she now lives an hour away from us) while my bf is at work to get her ram for her computer. We talk cordially. I already know she can’t make the car payment and wants to get it deferred and it’ll be added to the end of the loan. The auto loan place will allow it because of the virus going on. That’s fine. Whatever. So again, I know she can’t afford the car payment this month. She tells me how the car insurance is due, how she has pushed back the due date for her cable/internet, how rent is due and she is two months behind on her power bill. I have no idea how she can’t pay any of this while still working. Behind on one bill? I get it. But all of them? Lee in mind she also has food stamps returned so she is able to feed herself and the kids.

This worries me because if she can’t afford her bills and gets kicked out of there (maybe not now because I don’t think anyone will be kicked out due to the virus, but in maybe 2-3months) I cannot live with her again. I can’t deal with her under my roof. She lives an hour away and whenever she calls my bf I feel anxious, like I’m waiting for the “now what” moment of her needing more from us than what we are able to give.  So I call local churches and charities in her area who are willing to help her financially like I did when she needed the deposit for her utility. I give her the information.

The next day she tells me she was laid off from her job because of the virus, but has filed for unemployment. She also hasn’t gotten her stimulus yet as it keeps getting sent to the bank where she got her advance on her taxes.

No idea on if she has done anything with the charity information I gave her. I’ve asked her if she was able to get in touch with them and she hasn’t replied to me in over a day. She is always on her phone. My mom tells me not to worry about it, I did my part to help.

I just cannot stop worrying. Our baby is due early August 2020. Our second bedroom is filling up fast with her stuff. We don’t have room in our small apartment for 5 people, 1 baby and 4 animals. Our lease won’t even allow any of that, especially the animals as that’s limited to 2. But at the same time I know he won’t allow his mom and siblings to have no where to live, I get that. But I can’t deal with it.

So I guess my question is, after everything that has happened and the way his mom operates, am I justified in this? If push comes to shove and he feels he has to move her in because she has no where to go (she CAN goto her parents, or even a hotel), me telling him that he is forcing me to do what she should be doing, moving out and back in with my parents because there will be no rooms for me and my daughter in my own home. On top of that letting him know we have been down their road with his mom and I’m not doing it again.

I feel bad for feeling this way because it’s his mom and siblings, but I can’t deal with her anymore like that. He knows that already because I’ve stated more than once I cannot live with her. I hope it doesn’t come down to her being kicked out of her apartment and him offering our place.

What do you guys think? I just want your honest opinions? Am I looking at this all wrong? Am I wrong at all?",24Apr2020,1
496,"Hello, 

Due to my current situation, I felt like reddit is the only place I could turn to for questions like these. 

I have a couple issues I’ve identified with myself: 

*I try to “read” people very often, more than I should. The problem is that many times I have been right about certain assumptions of people but I think this is unhealthy because this leads to manipulative behavior or me thinking I know what someone else is feeling/thinking. I want to know if I can fix this deep rooted behavior?

*The second issue, which I think is pretty connected with the first, is that I am very insecure about how other people perceive me. With every social interaction I try to know what the other person is thinking so I can respond “perfectly” and I brood over what I could’ve done to respond better. I’ve caught myself just running constant scenarios of conversations which I also think may not be healthy behavior.

So I guess what I’m looking for advice on is how to give less of a fuck in social interactions and stop beating myself up for a conversation not going exactly how I planned in my head?",24Apr2020,1

500,"I don't even know how to start this. All I can say is even ""she"" is concerned. (I'm 23 Male)
So, I guess you could say I have an imaginary friend? I feel like it might be more that I'm personifying my conscience. Her name is Sophie. I couldn't tell you what she looks like, even though I can ""see"" a face. The most I can say is she's a ginger with glasses (a preference of mine). It would make sense that it's just an imaginary friend. I work at a local grocery store stocking and replenishing the shelves. I tend to work the late shifts so when I get up no one is home and everyone is asleep when I get home. I really only see my family on my days off.
The first time I noticed I was ""talking"" to her was when I was working in our dairy box alot. There's really no one to talk to when you're doing that. An occational customer or coworker. Other than that, it was about 8 hours of the refrigerator units humming. There is a speaker in there but you can't really hear it. It's all in my head. I don't talk out loud to her.
It's hard to say what we even talk about. I guess we just shoot shit. The weird part is she ""acts normal"", I guess? What I mean is she won't follow me around if I'm in one location. Say if I'm in our dairy box, she'll sit by the door or on top of our milk pallets and ""talk"" to me.
The part that has ""us"" concerned is she does kinda seem to be my thoughts. She wants me to find out if she's normal, which seems like it's my thought coming through her. Can't afford therapy so here I am.
She doesn't give me violent thoughts. Actually the opposite. If a customer pisses me off or if something upsets me in general, she's usually the one talking me down if I'm not doing it myself. If I'm up late (like right now) and I'm having trouble sleeping, she'll help by ""humming"" a lullaby and telling me to just focus on breathing, calm down.
There's also a time I HATE thinking about. I have no idea why, but a few months ago when my older brother was still living at home, for a few nights when I was trying to fall asleep, I for some reason just had these thoughts of getting a knife a cutting his throat. It scared me and still does, I'm shaking just thinking I had the thought. They were too vivid. My imagination is too vivid. I LOVE my brother, he has always been there for me and would always try to come see me when I was in the hospital. We weren't fighting either. I hate that I even had the thought. Even in the thought I would break down crying as he... Yet everytime I would try to think of something, ANYTHING else, my mind would just go back to that thought. The weird part is Sophie helped. The first night I had the thoughts, after the sequence restarted due to me trying to think of something else. She was there. Couldn't see her face but I knew it was her. She couldn't stop me, but I heard her. ""This isn't you. Stop. Anon. Think of something else again."" and after I... she would sit there ""holding"" me as I wept. Telling me over and over ""this isn't me"". I don't know why I could feel her.
 I sat there awake in a personal hell just having this thought on repeat, but one if the times, she found a way to ""help"". I had grabbed the knife and was heading to his room when I could feel her holding my face just telling me calmly to stop. It didn't work, but instead of holding me, she seemed to shame me. ""Look at him! Look at you! You enjoy thinking of this!? Seeing the look of betrayal on his face!? Watching his bleed out!? This is you!? This is the anon I know!? I know this isn't you! STOP!"" I had dropped to the floor sobbing and I colud feel her hold my face again. She just calmly said ""you can see me focus on me. Focus one me. Focus on me.""
... it worked. For some reason thank god the thought didn't repeat. I swear I could feel her put her head to mine. ""Just think of me"". I could hear her humming, telling me to calm down and just fucking breathe. Weirdly enough she seemed to almost hijack my thoughts. She kept humming when I could hear a piano playing the same indescribable yet comforting tune. Then, from a third person I could see us. White void with a marble floor, she was in a dress, I was in my night wear. She was still holding my head to hers, I had my hands on her hips and we were just swaying. It helped. Again she just kept telling me to calm down and breathe. I was able to fall asleep. It only happened when I was trying to sleep. I didn't dream about it and couldn't tell you why it was so vivid or why it was the only thing I could think of. It happened the next few nights and everytime she would let it happen once telling me to ackowledge the thought and tell me it wasn't me, then she would take me to the void to dance and I would fall asleep. I haven't had anything like that happen since thank god.
I know this isn't normal, but am I okay? What should ""we"" do about her? Should I save up to see someone? Is she just my conscience?",24Apr2020,1

507,"Short version: 

So I've been co-writing a novel for the past 3 years, and yesterday I had a fight with my writing partner. I want to change a detail of the book that isn't working, and have been trying to do so for the past 4 drafts, but she insists that it's fine and we don't need to change it. She has talked me out of changing it multiple times but I still believe it isn't working. The problem is that we are both very stubborn (our parents joke that she's the unstoppable force and I'm the immovable object) and basically, I can't argue with her. How can I explain this to her without devolving into a full-on verbal war? 

Long version/rant:

 This started when I finally got my mom (a PROFESSIONAL AUTHOR) to read the latest draft of our book, and asked my writing partner to postpone editing until we had her feedback. She got mad, saying she didn't want to wait around for my mom anymore, which started the whole thing on a sour note. 

I then told her we needed to change the detail, which was how we approached magic in our story; she wanted to do something like Buffy, where people know what's going on but ignore it because there's nothing they can do, but I thought that was unrealistic in our world and wanted to change it so people either magically forgot about what was happening or actually acknowledged it and did something about it. 

When I tried to explain this to her, she said that I was just agreeing with my mom because I always agreed with her (I really don't) and that just because she's a published author doesn't mean she knows everything. She also said that our beta readers didn't have a problem with it, so therefore my mom's opinion was invalid. Our beta readers were high schoolers. My mom is a PROFESSIONAL AUTHOR. 

I knew she wasn't going to listen to me, so I said I'd head over tomorrow (that's today now; wish me luck) and have my mom explain it to her. She then said we were ganging up on her and not giving her a chance to express her views. She has been pushing her side of things for all eight drafts of the book! Isn't it about time I get a chance to talk?

Also, it's a bit hard to explain, but I felt like she was being emotionally manipulative. Not in a huge way, just kind of trying to get me riled up so I couldn't argue with her. I noticed it and kinda backed off, told her I just wanted her to listen, but it still basically worked; I couldn't argue with her. I don't think she was doing it on purpose (she has a history of being emotionally abused by her other friends, and as the saying goes, hurt people hurt people) but it still kind of shocked me. 

I've known this for a long time, but she basically cannot separate herself from her writing. She's always been terrible at taking criticism, and although she no longer flips out over every single negative comment she still has a hard time accepting when we need to change something major. She also expects us to submit this novel to PitMad on June 6th, so as to start looking for an agent, but there's no way we can have it finished in time. But that's a separate issue. Basically she has unrealistic expectations.

How am I supposed to argue with her? I can be the immovable object and stand my ground, but never in my life have I been able to change her mind when she was this set on something. I've been considering just writing a full-on essay on the topic instead of trying to argue with her. What am I supposed to do?",24Apr2020,1

I’ve noticed a lot lately that my younger sibling seems to think everything is their fault, and they never acknowledge their own feelings. They are in high school and don’t have a lot of work right now, so my parents have given them a lot of “extra” stuff to do. It’s simple stuff like chores/learning a language. They feel really bad about being upset about those things since everyone else in the house has college or work. Admittedly, I think my whole family is at fault for creating those feelings. They were complaining about why they were the only one who had to do these things, and we all said we were working full time. I realized after the fact how unfair that was (we are not entitled to their time) and subsequently apologized for participating in that attitude.

Now here’s where I need advice. Every time I have a conflict with them, they don’t have a conversation about it, they just slip down into profusely apologizing (for really small things) and taking blame for things that either don’t need blame at all or aren’t their fault. I feel like I can’t raise any issue with them because I am reinforcing these feelings for them which really concerns me. I am afraid they are going to end up in a bad situation some day. I try to make myself super available for them to talk to since I suddenly moved back into their space, which I feel terrible about. But let me explain an example why this is so challenging.

Example: they were upset because I made a too much noise during a graded dance class. They were playing video games during that 40 minute class period (I’m not saying their hobbies aren’t important or that they shouldn’t have uninterrupted time to do this, but it wasn’t critical that the house was silent). I spoke to my family and we tried to find a different place to take my last few classes but the house is small and there wasn’t any. I noticed they were really defeated and have since had trouble talking to me about issues after that. I feel like in every situation to them, there is a right and a wrong answer and their side is usually the wrong one.

Example of how I’m afraid I’m reinforcing those habits: I was taking an exam yesterday when they got excited about something. They were well aware of my exam. I called down to them to be quiet for 20 more minutes (I actually just said their name to remind them that I was still working, and they knew how long the exam was). Afterwards, they apologized more than a few times despite me asking them not to. I explained hat I felt bad that I paused their excitement, and that I wasn’t in anyway mad, but that if I hadn’t said something, they wouldn’t have stopped. I tried to make it not adversarial but it still seemed to seriously reinforce these notions they had. We also conflict a lot over pet care, as our dogs bark a lot. I try to let them know my class schedule each day and that I would help in between (again because I think they deserve uninterrupted time for their hobbies) but there have still been tons of time where the dogs barking in the house or whining at the door has interrupted my classes. I can’t raise these or any issues with them.


TLDR
How can I resolve conflict with them (because we will have conflict, we’re living in a tiny house with other siblings, multiple pets, and our parents) without setting them up for low self esteem? I want them to know that their opinions, arguments, and emotions are valid. I also want them to know that I respect and value their time. But right now I feel like I can’t talk to them without solidifying their anxieties about confrontation. 

Thank you for reading all the way to the end!",24Apr2020,1

The problem isn't that I don't know what to do, it's just that there are so many things I could do, it's like it's flooding my system. So, I wanted to ask some strangers, what they think I should do because I can't figure it out and it's hard to find help. I get that this might not fit the subreddit but I didn't really know where else to ask for this kind of advice, so if you want, please let me know some things that could suit me in my professional career. 

Thing about me: I like helping people, and it's what I want to do. 
I'm really good at reading people. 
I want to live in a city.
I work well (and probably best actually) under pressure.
I'm good working long hours since I never really have any kind of sleep schedule pretty much ever. 
I'm mildly disorganized.
I'm pretty creative, i do art and stuff.
I really suck at asking people personal questions since I'm always afraid I'll offend them.
When I'm not helping people or doing something I can get really messed up and just sort of like stop, ya know?
I'm really, really indecisive, hence this post.

They'd managed to get into my friend's FB account and sent me a message with a link to 'facebook' where I had to sign in, and it was one of those stupid 'you've won a reward' things. I immediately changed my FB password and 10 minutes later I got an email that someone had tried to get into my Facebook account and requested a password change, which I reported. Just to be safe I also changed my email password.

I don't know if this is related because I can't remember if I have my phone number attached to my FB account, but I thought I'd include it anyway.

539,"

For starters I have slight adhd and severe anxiety. My sisters boarder line autistic with adhd add odd and sensory issues the worst being oppositional defiance disorder (look it up) my father has anger issues and my mom isn’t the nicest of people in this situation. 
     My dads a pastor who’s work life is slowly taking over his personal life and the stress of being a new pastor to this church and having to deal with the affects of covid has sent shock waves through his ability to not cave into his anger. He is always touchy and anxious. Yells is aggressive. He scares me. He’s never physically hurt me. But has come close. One day he got mad and threw recycling bins in my direction missing me by about 5 feet. Still traumatic that he would even do that. I digress, in the past he has spanked my sister too hard or grabbed her in a non loving way. 
     My sister who I mentioned had all sorts of mental illnesses. Worst being her adhd and Authority defiance disorder. This makes her super volatile to anyone who tells her anything of what to do. She screams and throws things and hits people. Today in anger she broke a key off a school issued computer from my school. This costs $500 to replace if she breaks the computer. My mom got really mad and yelled at her. Screamed at her. Then my sister screamed back even louder and said she wanted to get a weapon and cut my moms head off. Then when she realized that she would have to pay for it with her money that she cares more about then anything in the world she said she wanted to kill herself. What? I sat there eating breakfast quiet. Then about two seconds later my mom is stress eating and screams at me for not putting something away. I forget to do this because of my adhd. I physically can’t remember. I hate it. This is just an example of this morning. Things like this happen everyday. 
     Then my mom. These days everything I do is wrong and everything she does it right. She says the same things over and over. Then when I tell her those don’t help she goes, “WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT ME TO DO HUH? YOU THING YOUR ANXIETY ISNT HURTING ME  TOO? GIVE IT TO GOD YOU NEVER READ YOUR BIBLE JESUS CAN FIX YOU I CANT GIVE IT TO JESUS AND STOP MAKING MY LIFE MISERABLE!” This is pretty horrible because she has no idea what I do. I don’t share my bible studies with her. There’s a reason. I have a deep relationship with the lord. She has no idea. How do your think I’ve made it through 15 years living with you? She yells at me then 5 mins later she comes to me and goes I’m so sorry your having a hard morning. Do we need to talk about what you did? Idjdndjxjd what I did? I’m sorry was I not the one desperately trying to get you not to yell at me or my sister so you don’t have another meltdown? Once she got so mad at my sister she started hitting her with her own stuffed animals. Hitting her. I had to intervene and literally pin my own mother to the wall screaming and crying to get her to stop. Then she told me the only reason she did that was to protect me. Therefore justifying what she did. 
       Finally there’s me. I have clinically diagnosed’s severe anxiety I take medications every day. I also take medications for adhd which help. My parents don’t really know what it’s like to have anxiety. They are both extroverts who are over confident in some areas and not in others. They both scream at me when I have panic attacks and when I forget about things. I am currently trying to find a therapist but it’s hard. I have been to tons and we just moved making it harder. My mom wants a Jesus therapist, which I get but most are not good. They go just pray about it! I’m so sorry your going through this! Wow super helpful. This all puts my mental health in the gutter and I am trying the absolute best I can to be nice to my family. I know they are struggling. I know It could be worse. I am not a victim. I will get through this it’s just hard to see the light. When your parents careers are dedicated to god yet they are full of pain and sin in their personal life it’s hard. I am glad I have kept my faith through this. I have questioned many times. It’s been hard. If you’ve read this whole thing thank you. It’s hella long I know. Trust me theres more. Reach out if you have had similar or at all similar experiences. I need someone who can understand. Thank you.",24Apr2020,1
540,"I'm in my last year of highschool and I decided to ditch the razor. I hate shaving and any form of hair removal so I just quit it altogether.

me-a magical leprechaun dancing into a meat grinder who else?

i’m sorry if i dident do a sentence correctly or if my grammar is off i don’t really care what the sentence looks like now for the story

so me a G are pretty good friends and I kinda think of her as a tomboy in a way...but weirder like yesterday she sent our group chat a photo of a working pregnant barbie toy that can give birth.....what.....the.......fuck.......aside from that pretty trust worthy and recently she’s been sending me more messages to me then group chats she could be talking to other people the same way but i don’t know. she has also invited me to see lei mis with one of her other friends i’m also friends with her this i don’t see weird since i love musicals and she knows it so maybe she was just being thoughtful? but she also went as far as joining a musical company  i’ve been in for years i tell my friends a lot about this place because they have made some seriously amazing upgrades to the studio and stage i mean the only thing separating the boys and the girls change rooms (there is none btw it’s just one big room backstage) is A SEE THROUGH CURTAIN but that’s for a difrent post 

so my real question is.. is she interested? she never liked these things before and every time she texts me or a group chat with me in it if she says something that she knows i would be interested in  she puts it in caps i have no clue if she’s interested in me and i’m not picking it up or if she’s being her normal weird self thanks in advance

543,"Hey all first time posting on here but I just wanted to get some advice on a problem we've been having with our neighbor. So first off I want to say I've never directly interacted with this person, I've only seen them MAYBE 5 times since moving into our condo but let me say that they are. not. friendly. We've both tried to say hi since we live in the same building and we get dirty looks and silence as a reply.

So here is the issue, my boyfriend and I are quiet homebodies, who live in a condo on the second floor of a three story condo building. We bought the condo back in September of 2018 and the neighbor in question has been here only a few months longer than us, they moved in in January of 2018. (According to what I found on google) 

We have an 11 month old puppy, who's basically full grown and weights 30 pounds. He is a very low key pup, he barks on occasion and chases the cats every once in a while but otherwise he is very lazy and just wants to be near us/cuddle all the time. That being said, the other day I didn't realize how late it was before playing fetch with my dog, it was about 10 at night. Our lovely neighbor, who lives below us, started banging on their ceiling and yelling at us to ""quiet down."" We understandably stopped immediately after, and I was embarrassed to realize that it was indeed pretty late and thought nothing more of it. Although with covid and quarantine time seems to go right out the window! 

The problem is, now they feel the need to bang on their ceiling and complain ANY time we play with our dog. It happened again yesterday around 6:30pm. My boyfriend had just brought the dog in from an unfortunately lengthly walk in a heavy rain and after toweling off our dog he did zoomies around the apartment, as dogs are want to do, for less than 5 minutes. Our dog settled down on his own without any issue, almost immediately tiring out and laid down in his bed for a nap, and a few minutes later our neighbor was banging on their ceiling again. 

I can understand the time before when it was genuinely late at night, but 6 in the afternoon is a perfectly reasonable time for a dog to be making a little noise. He's a small dog, and it was a very rainy day, we usually take him on a lot of walks but yesterday was miserable out and even our dog didn't want to be outside. That being said, he's also well, a dog. He's gonna run around and play in the condo, that's just what dogs do. I've checked out the condo contract for this place and while there is a clause about excessive noise, ie. don't play the drums, play loud music, etc. our dog is not making an excessive amount of noise. It's no more noise than we make when we're just walking around. We usually try to get him to stop running in the condo anyways because we don't want to promote him chasing our cat, but he's not a loud dog.

So is this something I should try to confront the neighbor about? I feel we're being attacked for simply owning a dog, and don't know what our neighbor will try to do to further their complaints. We are not the only dog owners in the building, I know of at least 3 other dogs, 2 of which are much larger than ours, but this person is clearly not a people OR dog person so I don't know that a calm conversation will even get through to them. 

I should also say that this is a person who complained to my boyfriend for ""stomping around and being too loud"" when he was simply walking around the condo. The condo we are in was previously used as a vacation home and they are clearly not interested in having neighbors living above them, something they should have taken into consideration when they bought a basement level condo... There are other issues that I could go into that are definitely their fault, and we are currently pursuing, but this one is the biggest one because our dog isn't going anywhere and neither are we. We just want to live our reasonably quiet lives with our reasonably quiet dog. 

Thanks for the help with this! I really appreciate any suggestions or advice! I don't want to start a war with this person but I do want to stop them banging on things every time we play with our dog!",24Apr2020,1

554,"Long story short, my fiancé (M22) and I (F27) are trying to throw together a last minute wedding on Sunday May 17th. We have the opportunity to get married in a church by a pastor who's a family friend and we'll adhere to the limited amount of people and live stream the wedding for both families to be able to see.

The problem is finding a wedding dress because sizes are never consistent and I don't know if I can just order one online and get it altered later?

I live in the Central Florida area so there is some say that shops may be able to open up soon if our state starts to ease on certain restrictions... I'll try to do some virtual appointments but I'm at a loss as to where to begin searching.

I'm 5'3"", thick build (not obese, but definitely not skinny, I do still have an hour Glass figure but it has become a bit more pear because I was lazy with weight and always assumed I'd have time to lose it again before this type of event but that's life haha. Most of my weight is in my stomach and thighs. And I do have a decent sized chest (40DD) to understand my body shape)

I love the ballgown or mermaid/trumpet style dresses but also could look into A-line. Definitely want some sort of short sleeves to help support the girls. Definitely want it to be white and would like some lace design on the top. 

I understand with such a short timeframe I'm limited on options... I just want to find a nice dress that's also affordable. (Preferably under $2K, even more lower $1K and under is even better)

Does anyone have any idea where I should start looking? Normally I'd go to David's Bridal but their stores are closed. I'll probably do a virtual appointment but I'm kinda worried about not being able to physically try anything on before purchasing it.(Has anyone done a virtual appointment before? How does it work?)

I yelled at my brother there was a fire, then I called the cops. Here's the thing, everybody basicallwatched. I feel shitty, but I had my kid. Like I really was scared and i know you're suppose to do something more but two kids ran out right away, the first was already out, the second came out shortly after.
 A third child hid in the closet and ended up passing away because the fire fighters couldn't find her. The house went up quickly.
Here is the deal, this guy is basically a burn out and everyone there knows he really didnt save these kids but he is saying he went into the house and he didnt. He is getting a lot of news publicity on it and the thing that annoys me is that I know hes a bad person who steals, uses drugs and just commits crimes.
Yet I dont want to confront anyone but it's making me genuinely angry. These kids more or less saved themselves, they were all under 8 and the one who lost her life people could hear yelling for help.
I just have this feeling like what if someone ran in there before the cops came, what if someone would have found her then and now this guy is lying about so much. I feel like since he was in his front yard he should've caught it way sooner and seen the screaming kid before I did. I just feel guilty about it all and how this guy is using this. I also think it's important that people know those kids ran out themselves, I know it doesn't change how horrifying it is. These kids are good kids and the parent was reported a lot but CPS and the police fail a lot of children in the community, including this RV guys and my own siblings, but the point is these kids had been taking care of themselves and faced with a dangerous situation, they had to handle it on their own. I hold onto things like this very badly, I dont know why. How do I let this whole situation go? I dont useFacebook, I  see it in the news multiple times a day since it did just happen two days ago.

557,"I am a young office worker. I am about 2 years into the job, and mostly like it here. I have a university education, and career (and non career) aspirations for my life. For the most part, it's been fairly smooth sailing, and everyone seems to like me.

There is one coworker, Helen, that I basically can't stand. She came from a relatively obscure background - she was a manager at a Starbucks, and then worked her way up from an admin assistant position in my industry. She got promoted into being a manager of my middle office department, but was an absolutely horrible boss (bully), so she kind of got re-assigned to a new position where nobody reports into her. 

Currently, I work closely with her. She is basically the senior analyst on my little portfolio. Honestly, she is no longer outwardly mean, or anything like that. At the same time, I find her to be extremely draining to work with. Not 'quit my job' levels, but more just very irritating and demoralizing.

These are some of the behaviours I speak of

* She really has no idea how to divide tasks. It's a constant push and pull - I have no idea what I'm supposed to be doing. IE, she will say ""why don't you lead XYZ spreadsheet,"" and then she will work in it all day. But then, she'll make it seem like I am shirking responsibilities cause I didn't do it. 
* She has no concept of work life balance herself. She will be emailing us between 7:30 AM - 5PM sometimes. We are now working from home, but when we were at the office, I've never seen her take any type of personal break at all. No lunch break, workout, etc.
* She can be extremely demanding. IE, she will email us for 4 different things right at the first thing in the morning. Keep in mind we have actual responsibilities with customers, etc
* She just like...puts too much effort in. I'm pretty business minded myself, but she will absolutely fight tooth and nail over $300 with a supplier. Keep in mind our business has millions in annual revenue
* She is very territorial. She tries to micromanage everything, and gets mad if she's not included in discussions. She even treats people with \~5 years experience this way.

Honestly, I think her personality mainly comes down to 2 things:

1) She isn't educated or wise enough to realize how much she *doesn't* know. She is very proud of herself for working her way up a back office job at a small company. So she ends up being very high on herself and experiences.

2) She doesn't really have anything going on in her personal life. No husband, no kids, no real hobbies that I know of. So this is how she gets her sense of identity.

This person truly gets on my nerves...I just have this sense of dread when I see them calling. But at the same time, she hasn't really done anything bad to me in a long time.

558,"I am a very small person that has rarely exercised in her life. I’ve recently picked up Just Dance on switch for nostalgic reasons and I am thoroughly enjoying it, but there are a few things I can’t do because my legs are too weak. 

Yesterday I tried the dance to the song Rasputin and it involves a LOT of bending low and kicking your legs. At one point you’re down to a squat to the floor and kicking your legs out very fast and I feel like I can’t even do one. I am able to bend that low but as far as kicking my legs out it’s a no go.

559,"I Have reason to suspect that I'm being targeted and harrassed by a cyber stalker, and evidence points to it being my abusive ex or his new partner.

Background- At 18 I was in a mentally and physically abusive relationship with a man, which lasted a year before I finally left him.

Now, about 4 years on, I am experiencing online harassment and catfishing which has been going on for over a year.

I'm Gonna explain why I think my ex is behind this, and I'd like you to help evaluate the clues with me to tell me if it is him or not, or what could be going on?

It began when I strange Instagram account followed me and began liking and commenting on my posts, it also followed my boyfriend and sister. This account had no name or face on it, all the pictures were just random stuff like landscapes. I Went snooping and discovered that the account was following some people I know of including a few women who've dated my abusive ex, including his current partner. I Went on to the insta page of his current partner and found that a couple photos she'd posted matched the pictures on the strange profile. This lead me to believe she's made this profile to stalk her boyfriend's exes.

To find out more, I sent her a few anonymous questions on Ask.FM. I Asked if she's ever looked up any of her partner's exes online, to which she responded, 'Who of us hasn't?😅' I Also asked if she's ever catfished anyone, to which she admitted she has 'in the past' if she 'needed to find some information'. These responces solidified in my mind it was probably her.

I Went a further, deciding to add her in snapchat to see how she'd react. When I did so, she added me back, and messaged me, 'Hey, who's this?' I Didn't respond, and a few minutes later she reached out again something like, 'It's okay if it was just a random add, I don't mind meeting new people😊' After which point I just removed her.

Not long after those messages, maybe a few days or so, I get added on snapchat by guy friend I hadn't spoken to in a while. Now I need to provide a little more background, early on in the relationship with my ex I ended up sleeping with his best friend and he found out. Yes, I know how awful that is, I was wrong for it and am fully remorseful. But, it happened, and it's somewhat relevant. My ex (Then bf) chose to forgive me and stay with me, though it damaged the relationship irreversibly. Anyway, this guy who adds me on SnapChat is the friend who I cheated with. I Did have some friendship with him after me and the ex split, though we weren't as close. I Was suspicious when he added me due to the fake account on Insta. I Told him about it, and gave him a test to see if he was real, I asked what town I was from? Initially he gave the wrong answer, he said the name if the town my current boyfriend is from. When I said he was wrong he said, 'Wait, but I thought moved in with your partner?' I Descided to class it as a pass as I had been staying at my boyfriends so much I could see why he'd assume that, plus how would my ex's new-gf know where my boyfriend is from? I Carried on talking to this account for a couple weeks, it seemed legit. Until one day I sent him a pic and he asked, 'What's that ring?' Referring to the one I always wear on my right ring finger. This sparked suspicion as he already knows about that ring. This is when I finally realised this was catfish, and I blocked the account.

Things were quiet for a while. The Insta was still sporadically active, but didn't exactly bother me. One day I started using  YOLO. For those who don't know about it, it's an app paired with SnapChat which lets you receive and send anonymous messages. I Got a lot of things sent to me on there, and what was strange was that most of them, in a round about way, related to my ex or past relationship, asking question connected to stuff only my ex or his family would know. For example, someone asked if I'd ever called 999, to which I said no, but I'd been involved in an incident where someone  else had to.  (That incident was when the police were called when my ex and his brother had a fight in their flat) the person kept asking more questions about it. Also someone was asking if I'd ever cheated, and whether I'd ever been in an abusive relationship? When I said yes to these things they delved for more detail.

Around that same time, I got a friend request from an old school friend on fb, and she also added me on SnapChat. After not long I discovered both those accounts were not actually her. I Had the fake account on my SnapChat when I was getting all the weird questions, so that explains that.

Then, there was one incident outside of the internet. I Went for a walk recently and while I was resting on a bench a black car parks behind me, rolls down it's window, and is just sat there for like 5 minutes as if they're watching me. I Don't know is it was related to all the other stuff, but it triggered my already severe anxiety and made me scared to go out again.

Now the most recent event, after multiple fake account adding me  a fake account was made of myself. Someone inormed me there was a Kik account using my name and picture. I Messaged the account asking why they were doing that, and also contacted the police. The account did not reply to or even open my message, the police couldn't do anything.

I Was now starting to question if my ex's  new partner was really the one behind this, it seemed that way at first but with all the other stuff it didn't make sense. I Descided to send her some more anonymous questions as I had before. This time I asked, 'Have you ever tried to message any if your partner's exes'? And 'Have you ever pretended to be someone else online?' To the first she said yes in the past if she's had reason to, and to the second she confessed some story about making a fake FB when she was a teen to add her crush. I Then asked if she's aware there's an Instagram using her pics, to this she said, 'No???' I Told her the name if it and that it's likely her boyfriend behind it. When it done that she said she actually does know the one I'm talking about now, that someone had told her about it long ago as it also took some pics off her friends account. She said she'd reported and blocked it at the time, and asked why it would be her husband? I Sent a message explaining that 'someone I know' had been harassed recently by a lot of fake account and i wouldn't be surprised if it was her man. She said she doesn't know why he'd do that, and asked whoever this is to DM her. Of course I didn't, and I stopped sending her stuff after that.

So, at least 4 fake accounts have added/followed me, and one has been made of me. Considering everything I've said, does it seem like someone is targeting me, could it be my ex or his partner, and out of them who seems more likely? If not either, who could it be and why?",24Apr2020,1

565,"how come some people tell me to model, and some call me ugly.

girls say that im prett af, but also some of them just, i dont know, i just dont get that vibe. honestly, it almost feels like they hate me, its so weird.

like for example, the first time at uni, i got all the attention from girls, and yes it did feel good, but overtime, as they started to get to know me, they stopped giving shit about me. its so weird. i mean no matter how bad your personality is, how it can affect your looks?

btw, i dont got any type of unique physical features that some might consider attractive and some ugly, (like adam driver) im more conventionally attractive

im like James charles, but more masculine.

but then i dont feel like it and feel overlooked everyday

in public for example.

well yes i do get attention, but sometimes i feel like others dont care. im not saying that they should, but i dont feel attractive basically. or maybe they do but they dont look

i've always got attention from girls. but i got this weird thing with certain of them. some of them start liking me only after i look at them, well i dont mean stare, but i just make a brief eye contact. and BAM, they're into me. i have experimented with it wayy too much. and i dont get it. again, im not really trying to boost my ego, but yes i do want to know if its because of looks or no. i have had girls like me without even me knowing that they existed too, but what happens in this case? its like they feel flattered that i look at them. Do they just enjoy having my eyes on them (well not really, cuz again i dont stare at them, look at them briefly) or is it cuz that im attractive basically?

i do have some other issues tho. when at home, i always record myself, just to get the idea of how others perceive me. and it changes dramatically too, i feel buttugly sometimes, but like a god other times. like, as i said at public for instance, i always feel ugly, FEEL, i dont think that i am ugly, but always feel that way.

We would play ""games"" and well they always were like that. I am older than him. 4 years older. I won't elaborate on this, since I really can't.

I cannot get over my self hate, I feel so disgusted at myself that, eventhough he doesn't look affected by it and even initiated those ""games"" I still can't even talk to him to this day. I can't have a good relationship with him because I get so disgusted by the memories...
I may try to excuse myself in my age, the hormones, the loneliness I felt back then (got bullied for many years), the depression... But I cannot find anything to hide myself behind. I am just aware of how sick it is and I face it, and try to improve, move on... But I just can't.

My brother loves me, he doesn't hate me for what happened, he probably hasn't  forgotten though, but he looks up to me and talks to me a lot (at least tries, I always answer rudely), he is really sweet and is really amazing with me. He tells me he loves me before going to sleep sometimes (he is very emotional with everyone in our family) and I just can't say it back because I get disgusted at myself. I know I am hurting him by not moving on and being mean to him as a response, I don't even sit next to him and hardly ever talk to him because of this whole trauma.

And I found out that my ""friends"" have made fun about my body shape, I felt deep shame, I hated going to school my school is a shit hole, I was really insecure, even when I walked I had a lot a anxiety about who was watching me from behind, Even when I climbed the stairs I would feel anxious, I didn't play and run that much, and I started hating myself.

And then this happened:

There is a girl in our school who has depression, we were close friends, and one day her mom phone called me and I could hear her crying in the background(crying+shouting), and she and her mom came to our home middle of the night and stayed at our place, she has had a mental breakdown and I felt sorry for her and her mom told me to keep an eye on her at school(if she does something to herself or others report and try to help), which I did, so 2 months goes by and there was a boy in our class who started to pick on the girl, pulling her hair, taking her stuff and hiding them, etc..., the girls' mother has gotten to know and she called me and asked me, so I told her that it was true, and she later snitched on me telling that I told her about the whole thing to the whole class(she has visited the school to speak with the principle about the thing and the principle came to our class with her and she told in front of the whole class that I told about the thing to her ) and after that the class started to hate me , i mean everyone , and no one talked to me, and eventually i could not take it and i stopped going to school, so now i have no friends ,very insecure to walk even on the streets, feeling lonely , moody almost everyday about my self the way i look and that i lost the friends i have",24Apr2020,1

That's why I thought about getting a double belly button piercing. So I can wear two piercings at the same time. I just love the thought of having a pierced belly button with jewelry in. That's so hot in my opinion. The fact that my belly piercing could bulge through the shirt is also hot af. As you can see I really love belly button piercings. Having a double belly button piercing would be so great. Ladies, what do you think? Would it play a big role for you? Would it be a hot surprise if your bf or date has a belly button piercing? I mean so many girls have a belly button piercing. Why can't boys have one too?",24Apr2020,1

601,"Hi, I don't know if this is the right place to post this, if not, please make me know and tell me where to do it, thanks.

So recently a friend (male) got mad with another friend (female). They both are in our 5 person group of friends (me included) and both had a mental illness, my female friend has anxiety and my male friend has depression (it's not diagnosticated, but it seems like it and I'm very worried). The thing is he got mad with her because ""she didn't talk to him right in the face and talk at his back"", anyway, a silly and misunderstood problem where both of them are wrong and right at the same time. It's very complicated, he blocked her on the social media so she can't talk to him or apologize. These days I continued telling my male friend that everything could solve if he tries to unlock her, but he didn't want to. But today, he told me that ""my theory was wrong"" because he has unlocked her and she didn't do anything about it. When I talked to her she told me she is very afraid of talking to him and was very anxious.

I can't either blame or be mad at the two of them, my male friend has passed through a lot of things where people treated them like shit and around 2 years ago he started to get more and more depressed. We, his friends, are very worried about him and wondering what to do, if call someone, if it's very soon if we need to still try to help him through media, etc.

About my female friend, she has anxiety, recently she's having school interviews, and adding the trouble between her and our friend, is making it worse.

The only way to solve this is that they talk, she told me it was a misunderstanding, and he won't see it from another point of view more than ""I can't even trust in my friends"". This is a conflict between them, and I or my other friends won't solve it if they don't cooperate, but now she is afraid of talking to him. I don't want to press her or make her anxious, she can talk to him when she feels ready to, but every day he seems more and more affected by this and I'm really confused about what to do.

It's there a way I can get them to talk without hurting or pressing anyone? Please give me advice, if you need some kind of detail please make me know in the comments, I don't have the greatest English and maybe there are some things you didn't understand, thank you for reading.",24Apr2020,1
602,"I already posted this in another subreddit, but i'm not sure if this fits better here.

So, where do I start... About seven years ago, I met a girl in school. Let's call her Sarah. It was love on first sight. At least from my side. She friendzoned me and after about two years I finally got out and she became my girlfriend. For about three months. Then she dumped me. She changed the school and we lost contact. We were 15 back then.

Even though I never really got over her, I thought that I won't ever see her again anyway and kind of ""forgot"" her. Still, she was on my mind every day.

Two years passed by and I met another girl. Let's call her Mary. Mary and I got in a relationship real quick after meeting the first time and we still are since two years. Mary is perfect. I love every aspect about her and I didn't even think about Sarah that much, only from times to times it came to my mind.

So, heres where the real struggle begins. Last summer, coincidentally, I met Sarah again. She hit me up afterwards and we went for a coffee a week later. Since then, I can't get her out of my head anymore. We meet us from time to time and text sometimes. I always think about her, want to spend time with her and... I don't know man.

I am so confused. I have a perfect girlfriend, i love her, she makes me happy, everything is good. Whats the matter with me? Why am I still so attracted to her?

I didn't want to speak with my friends about it because I feel really uncomfortable. Even this post feels like I am cheating on her. it's eating me up rn.

what can i do to make this situation better?   
is mary the right one, if i still feel this way for other girls?",24Apr2020,1
603,"Hey, all. I'm in a bit of a spot, and feel selfish but also desperate. Thanks.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a preschool teacher who is not a special education teacher. I have been a pediatric CNA, but that's different. Anyway. Lately at work, I've been given my least favorite group of kids (2 year olds), but on top of it, all of the other teachers are now giving me all of their special education kids. They hand them off to me and literally say, ""I don't want to deal with this kid. You take him."" We have four special education kids total in our school who are currently attending in the pandemic, and their ages vary. One of them is 2, two others are 3, and one is 6. All are for the most part non-verbal or entirely non-verbal. Two are autistic and the other two are very developmentally delayed (the 6 year old has the mind of a young 2 and one of the 3's is essentially like a baby). All are in diapers. 

I've been barely able to handle the 2 year old and the 3 who's like a baby all week, on top of taking care of several other children. I'm okay with the 3 year old, because he was my student until very recently. However, now the autistic 3 year old is being put in my class. This child is very violent, and (for example) pulled out a little girl's extensions yesterday quicker than you could yell ""NO!"". All three of these kids destroy the classroom (pulling things apart, dumping out supplies and toys, even taking the wall apart, flooding the class from the sink and toilet). They don't want to do activities/can't understand what we're trying to do. One's out the door trying to run, another is flooding the classroom, and the other is screaming flailing and dumping out all the toys in the room. This is constant. 

What do you do? I need help, but nobody wants to. I was given the autistic 3 year old yesterday, and I begged that teacher not to give him to me because I was already in way over my head with just two special needs kids + the other kids I had to take care of, but the teacher shrugged and left him with me. 

I told my boss after being in the room with them for two hours and literally just sitting there crying (my boss was on break and wouldn't answer her phone) and she chose to interrupt and yell at me about restocking the gloves in my room. She then said I needed to ""multitask better"" in regards to stopping them, and short of being in three places at once I don't know how to answer that. I'll be diapering a child and these children are doing what I mentioned. All I can do is yell. I try to give them something to do while I diaper, and they don't do it and destroy the room. The other children are yelling at me to do something while I'm elbow deep in a poopy diaper. Other times, I'll be trying to conduct an activity (like playing with wooden puzzles) and the special needs kids will just throw the pieces absolutely fucking everywhere, grab the other kids' puzzles (which makes the kids scream and cry) and throw their puzzles absolutely fucking everywhere, too, and its three separate kids doing it. I'll try to sing with the kids, and the special needs kids will start screaming and tantruming in the middle of the group, flailing and hitting everyone. Then my boss will come yell at me. 

It's to the point where, I tried to tell my boss about these problems and how everyone's giving me all their special needs children and I can't handle it physically or mentally, that I had a mental breakdown and had no help. She didn't help, and chose to yell at me about something else. 

I want to leave this job. But, with the pandemic, I likely won't find a new job for a long time, especially since I want to leave the teaching profession altogether. I've had enough. This is the last straw for me. I've worked in four preschools, and the same thing happens. 

What do I do? I don't know. Please give me advice. I'm going to be going into that classroom today at 1pm, which is when the worst of it happens. I'm going to lose my mind. Nobody is going to help me. I might get the fourth child today, since there's apparently no bounds. I'm terrified. I even have a plan in place that if it gets way to much, I'm gonna walk out the door and walk to the hospital and call my boyfriend to come pick me up. I'm about to cry just thinking about it. I used to love teaching. I'd bring my guitar and we'd all sing educational songs that I made up for them. I used to love it, seeing those kids teach their parents the songs and see them singing them as they went out the door. It made me so, so happy. Like it was my life's calling. But I can't deal. I can't even sing with them anymore, and I'm terrified to bring my guitar to work for fear it will be grabbed from me and destroyed by a kid in a tantrum. My specialty was 3's and above, especially 4's. I'm so sad. I'm just so, so sad. I was even working with this school to create a program where I teach kids guitar. That's it, I'm crying. I'm just crying, and I don't know what to do.",24Apr2020,1
604,"Hi everyone. This is going to be a bit of a long post, so there will be a TL;DR at the end. Also sorry for formatting, im on mobile.
(Trigger warning towards neglect/abuse) 

Here we go. So I'm a yong teen, and for the past 3 years ive held an awful grudge against my dad. When I was 11 my parents first got divorced. Growing up I was always ""daddys girl"" and followed him around and looked up to who he was. I wanted to be just like him. And trait wise, I am. My mom always tells me i remind her a lot of him, except with only the good qualities. 

My mom kept me and my younger (by 15 months) brother home from school the day we moved out. I helped gather stuff and pack things. I had my first ever panic attack that day. We already had an apartment we planned to move in to. I found out later my mom never told my dad that we were moving out that day, she had only warned him if things didnt change she would. The last trip, we took both our dogs and left. Things really changed after that. When we would go to his house for visitation (Every other weekend, as well as dinner on Tuesdays and Thursdays) he would say that we were better off with him, and that he was going to come over to the apartment and take both me and my brother, as well as our dogs. We used to take our dogs to the house with us, as they were puppies and sometimes my mom needed days off to go out. That stopped after he threatened to not give any 4 of us back to my mom. 

One day I walked out of my room to witness my dad beating my brother. It happened a few times after that. Neither of us said anything at first, so CPS was never involved. 


TL;DR: My dad caused me physical and mental health issues due to emotional abuse, neglect and mild sexual harassment, witnessing him abusing my younger brother, as well as his own ego and pride. How do I get over the grudge I have against him?",24Apr2020,1
605,"So I (M, 20) know the title is a bit iffy, I don't mean to offend anyone by saying being less masculine than others is a bad thing as a male, but personally I feel like I really need some manning up.
Obviously we're in the middle of a lockdown, and I miss my girlfriend as is, however recently her pet died and she was very close to him so understandably she is shattered. Here is where I want to improve. I think I'm overly attached to my partner to the point where I find it hard to spend time on my own. This has become apparent to me these past few days, as she is grieving and isn't up for talking much (which I obviously understand). I just want to learn to be fine on my own. I want to be strong for her so she knows during situations like this she doesn't have to worry about me but can focus on her struggles. I want to find happiness within myself, not only from her. I want to do this because I know if I smother her, I will actually push her away.

So in short I'm looking for advice on how to be independent from my girlfriend. I'm looking for advice on how to love myself, how to appreciate alone time and how to be more relaxed when she's having her own alone time.

If it's any important, my entire childhood I was basically brought up by my mother. My father wasn't really present as much, thus I never really had a male figure to look up to and learn from. A few years ago this has changed and my family is strong and together, however it just feels a bit too late to learn how to be a man now, and even if it's not too late, I just don't know how to begin.",24Apr2020,1
607,"Hi everyone. I made a throwaway account because this information is serious and I believe it will be an embarrassment to my family and other social medias. I believe my son has child pornography on his computer.

My son is 22, autistic, somewhat verbal and is not able to get a job. His health is slowly declining and he has not left the house in weeks. I encourage him everyday to get outside but he is a hermit and lives in his dormroom in my house. I can’t force him to get a life because he has autism.

My son lives below us, inside our basement. His room is an absolute atrocity and his clothes lay around and I believe he defecates inside bins. His room is absolutely disgusting. His carpet is stained with god knows what.

All he has down there technically wise is his desktop we bought him in 2017 on his birthday, his phone and some miscellaneous stuff. 

Last week, I went downstairs to check up on him and ask him what he wants to eat for lunch. I found him on his computer masturbating to young looking cartoon characters with Chinese text. Also he had his phone on his lap and it looked like naked children or something engaging in sex acts. I immediately closed the door in shock. I called my other son who’s 27 and he didn’t even care.

The next day, I went down again and on his computer he had folders with names like “Emily’s collection” and “My little vagina” and “Hardcore collection 2018”. I didn’t bother to open them because I value his privacy but this is super concerning, because I don’t know what’s in those folders and what he has on his computer. He’s always rude to me also and hasn’t come upstairs for two weeks.

610,"Hi Guys!

I have a problem hoping to get some perspective on something.  I'm a male in my 40's, married with two small children.  Last October I joined a running club and met a number of different people.  I seemed to get along good with one of the girls in the group.  Shes also 40's, married with small kids.  Anyways, we didn't see each other much, maybe only 3-4 times between November and February.  However, our running group all added each other on FB and IG so I had her on social media.  In our few times meeting up as a group, I got along good with her.  We had great chats for the hour or so our group was in session.  I learned she lived very close to me, and our families seemed to have a lot in common.

Now, before I go further.. Cause I know what ppl might be thinking... I never saw this girl as more than a potential friend... I'm happily married but since I work so much and so does my wife, we don't have many friends in the area.  I saw this as an opportunity to make friends with new people, because she seemed very cool.

Anyways, once our state got locked down from Coronavirus I messaged everyone in my running group just wishing them good health.  She responded enthusiastically and we chatted for 5-10 minutes over text.  We both agreed when this lockdown is over, we should hang out (both of us and our spouses).  I thought it was a good conversation.  Anyways, 10 days later I messaged people again, and again she replied enthusiastically.  Again, we chatted for another 10 minutes or so, and again agreed we should meet up after the lockdown is over (us plus spouses).  I chatted with her one more time after that (so 3 times total in about 6 weeks).  At this point there was nothing unusual.  She seemed pretty cool and I looked forward to getting to know her and her family better.  

Last week my family was out for a walk.  There's a very small park 2 blocks from my house - it's probably not even a park, just a small grassy area and pond.  We never see really anyone there as there's no equipment for kids to play on.  We like to walk through it often though.  So we head over there and who do we see there?  I saw my running group friend with her kids.  I thought it was kinda strange because she lives maybe 2 miles from me and there's lots of parks near her house that are bigger.  Although she knew this park was close to my house.  It might have just been a coincidence, but seemed a bit odd.  Anyways, we stopped and chatted with her for a few minutes, but my kids wanted to walk to their friends house so we didn't have more time than that.  We said bye and it seemed like kind of an awkward conversation between my wife and I, and her.  Anyways, that night I sent her a message saying it was good running into her and perhaps we can schedule a time in the next few weeks where we can all meet up at the park again, and with her husband.  I saw she read my text, but she didn't reply for 2 days.  When she did reply, it wasn't her usual enthusiastic self.  Very short answer and didn't answer my question about meeting up.  I thought this was odd because she seemed like she really wanted to hang out as a group in our previous few chats.  Anyways I messaged her again reiterating it was good seeing her, and maybe this weekend we could all get together for a walk.  I haven't heard back in two days.  

My question to everyone is, do you think I offended her somehow?  I read back over our texts and can't see anything where I might have offended her.  Also, I thought maybe she got the impression I was interested in being more than friends... However, I never made any insinuation to that either.  So I'm a bit hurt as I was looking forward to perhaps making new friends, but it doesn't appear she wants that anymore.  Anyone have any insights?",24Apr2020,1

613,"Bear with me, good hell this is stupid long... 
Limerence has a (?) attached because I wouldn't classify my situation as such? I got married right before I turned 19. This guy had just gotten out of a two year relationship, I ended my 10 month relationship, and we were together for 8 months before we got married. *Since I was 14, there was guy A in my life who I always crushed on. He is friends with a family member of mine. He went off to the military years later and our timing was never right for me to tell him how I felt. He got married so I let him go and built my own relationship. Two weeks before I got married - he took leave for an event my family member had. Seeing him brought me back but he was still married so, I let him go and let it be. I was about to get married.* Our first year of marriage was rough, his brother lived with us almost immediately. We almost got divorced because it came down to me or him and my husband kicked him out. Months later his friend moved in with us because he was getting a divorce. I got pregnant right before he moved in and he moved out a month after I had the baby. He, too, was a hard room mate to have. He was much nicer than the other but I still missed having just my life with just my spouse. And having my own place! Both move in decisions were discussed - my husband wanted to help and I didn't want to seem unsupportive. There were good intentions behind it... Roommate #2 moved out and it was just us and the baby. We went on a group date with my family member, and Guy A and his second wife and new child, and those feelings were still there. Obviously not acted on. But I've always had a place for him in my heart. Six months later my spouse joined the military. *Before we got married he expressed his desire to serve, I told him I couldn't do all of the distance but I'd support him through school or something else. He took that. Unfortunately our marriage was him doing a lot of job hopping because he wasn't passionate about anything. We hit a point where I had to settle for the military because I wanted him to be able to support us and be happy.* He was gone for 6 months. I dealt with post partum depression, being a single parent, working from home full time, and completing a full move out from one place to another, without him. That built a lot of resentment and created a lot of distance because we couldn't communicate often and I was alone. When he got into the second part of training where he could talk more he chose other things over me and my kid. His priorities were off. But I was always his cheerleader because that's what he needed. We got orders to move across the country - he came home for a week to help me load up and we left. I left my entire family that I'm super close to. Within two months of this move, my father passed away. Guy A was close with my dad. Due to the military being how they are - my spouse was unable to come with me when I last minute drove home to be at my dying fathers side. Guy A was there for my family member and for my father. He even stayed overnight with my sister at the hospital so she could sleep and he could take care of my dad. He gave me a hug and told me he's always here for me. It was exactly what I needed. I then found out about his second divorce. He was leaving his baby mama, they had been together for three years. *My husband eventually flew in but we had been so separated the last year that I didn't find comfort in him. Just stress. I expressed to him I needed more from him, especially as I grieve. He helped with our kid but that was it. I began talking to guy A. I told him I've always had feelings for him. And that I'm grateful he's been in my life. We talked off and on as friends. The tension between my husband and I was strong. He was not the support I needed while dealing with this. He flew home and rarely checked on me while I stayed in the state to sort my dad's affairs on my own with our kid. That made my heart hurt. I felt so alone. I talked more to Guy A as he was there for me. When I returned home, I told my husband that I had been having an emotional affair with guy A. That I needed him ( my husband) to need me. Or want me. That I had felt alone. He said he hasn't been there our whole marriage and he doesn't blame me. That he gets where I'm coming from and he's glad Guy A is here for me... Not the response I expected. I continued talking to guy A. I then had to go back to the state to settle more affairs and told my husband I would have someone else do it if he wanted me to stay. That I wasn't really in our marriage and needed to work on it. But he told me to go. So again I went with our kid out of state for another two weeks. Guy A and I saw each other more and built on this relationship. Things were great. As great as I always thought they could be with him. I called my husband twice and told him I hadn't stopped talking to guy A and I sobbed. I told him I was lost and I needed him (my husband) to need me. To say anything that shows he cares. And he just said he's also checked out of our marriage... So Guy A and I kept talking. Then things went physical. Started with kissing and ended with sex. I came home and told my husband. He, again, apologized and said he's sorry that he hurt me to the point that I'd go so low as to cheat. Because he knows I am not that person. My mother was and I despised her for it. But he didn't freak out. He said he should probably tell Guy A that he doesn't hate him and they're still friends! Super weird! So I spent the next two weeks asking him if he had been talking to anyone else. Because his reaction isn't normal. And he swore up and down he hadn't. He put me on a mental roller-coaster that he wanted to try and loved me, didn't want to try and I didn't make him happy, wanted to try, wants divorce, loves me as a person, not as a spouse. Back and forth. Meanwhile, Guy A would check in on me but we didn't talk nearly as much. I never lied about it - I told him we hadn't cut each other out. I didn't trust my husband so I checked his phone and discovered that after he got home from my dad's funeral, he began messaging with a friend of his from school. He called her his dream girl and they talked about sex. Even planned a meet up at a hotel when he took his leave for the state a month later. I was upset. Because he lied. AND this communication happened when I was out of state, alone with our kid, grieving my dad... He was unaware of Guy A and I communicating and at the time of their talking, our emotional affair hadn't started. It hurt a lot. I confronted him he denied it at first and then admitted it was a mistake and said he forgot about it that's why he said there was no one he was talking to... He said he cut it off and told her he wanted to work on our marriage... Even though he didn't do anything about that. Obviously I didn't believe him about any of it and my trust was broken with him. We had many talks after this, when our kid went to bed, and his answer was always that he wanted to seperate. I kept fighting it - because he kept changing his reasons and throwing out excuses. I didn't want to get a divorce when he isn't thinking clearly. I know him well enough to know that he wasn't. Every day it was different. Until one night I sobbed and told him my dad had been gone for two months to the date and he hasn't even asked me how I'm doing or tried to make housework, parenting, or anything easier on me. As if my dad didn't die and I'm fine. He held me as I cried and told me I don't make him happy and he's sorry. WRONG TIME. I told him it was a dick move. So that night I packed up my things in the house and the next morning he woke up and I was packing up our kid's stuff. He asked if he could help. I said no. That afternoon I told him I don't understand how he can disconnect so easily but that I couldn't keep doing the mind games. He said he didn't make up his mind and he doesn't know why I'm packing... That was rough. He's so indescisive. The house remained packed up for a week. I had a panic attack, the worst I've ever experience with throw up and out of control breathing and uncontrollable crying. My brain had been overwhelmed and overloaded. So I cut out Guy A completely - which hurt like hell. Blocked him on everything and just let him go. Although, he was my sanity. He always asked how I was coping - if he could do anything for me. And always told me if I chose to work on my marriage- he'd respect it and leave me be. He never spoke bad of my husband and never wanted to hear about any problems we had. He made it adamant he didn't want to be the reason we got a divorce. Which - essentially our marriage had been struggling before the military even. But involving myself with guy A really made me tap out. He has always been a comfort to me. And having him interested in me, had always been something I wanted. So here I am - no contact with Guy A. My husband and I trying in our marriage... A decision I thought would be easier than it is. I feel sick to my stomach every day and haven't felt peace. He's been helpful, he's been trying, but I just want to go back to my home state and focus on me and my little girl. And if Guy A happens to be in the picture, then so be it. How do I make myself want to be with my husband? How do I convince myself that this is best?

619,"Hi everyone. This is going to be a bit of a long post, so there will be a TL;DR at the end. Also sorry for formatting, im on mobile.
(Trigger warning towards neglect/abuse) 

Here we go. So I'm a young teen (f), and for the past 3 years I've held an awful grudge against my dad. When I was 11 my parents first got divorced. Growing up I was always ""daddys girl"" and followed him around and looked up to who he was. I wanted to be just like him. And trait wise, I am. My mom always tells me i remind her a lot of him, except with only the good qualities. 

My mom kept me and my younger (by 15 months) brother home from school the day we moved out. I helped gather stuff and pack things. I had my first ever panic attack that day. We already had an apartment we planned to move in to. I found out later my mom never told my dad that we were moving out that day, she had only warned him if things didnt change she would. The last trip, we took both our dogs and left. Things really changed after that. When we would go to his house for visitation (Every other weekend, as well as dinner on Tuesdays and Thursdays) he would say that we were better off with him, and that he was going to come over to the apartment and take both me and my brother, as well as our dogs. We used to take our dogs to the house with us, as they were puppies and sometimes my mom needed days off to go out. That stopped after he threatened to not give any 4 of us back to my mom. 

One day I walked out of my room to witness my dad beating my brother. It happened a few times after that. Neither of us said anything at first, so CPS was never involved. It got worse and worse. My brother developed anger issues, and at one point broke something of mine. When I got mad at him, my dad began to yell and scream at me, as well as freak out at both of us. He hit my brother again. I ran into my room crying, locked the door, and called my mom hysterically talking about what happened. She came and picked us up, as well as the dogs. We still had to go back, but after that incident he would go out to ""get us dinner"" and wouldnt come home for hours. At 11-12 years old I was forced to use the oven/stove as well as the grill in order to make me and my brother food or we would have gone hungry. I later found out he would spend hours stalking my mom before going to the store. There were nights at midnight that we would go crying over to the neighbors house because he wasnt home and I was so stressed i couldnt make us food.

My dad moved out of that house a year later, said he was going to ""start fresh"". The new house he bought nestled in a humid valley, surrounded by trailer parks full of druggies and drunks. We still had to go with him, because there was no evidence of child abuse and our dad had conditioned us to not say anything with threats and scare tactics. The minute you walked into his new house it smelled of mildew and mold. The back porch was rotting, it was infested with roaches, but somehow the realtor (who was a close friend of my dads) convinced him to buy it. He never cleaned it, renovated, removed the old furniture, he just moved right in. He told me when I would visit that it was my responsibility as a girl to learn to clean the house, cook, and wait him hand and foot to become a ""good housewife"". We had to stay there for weeks over school breaks and weekends. 

The following year i began to have serious asthma issues, as well as hallucinations and depressive episodes. My dad would knock it all off as my moms fault, that it was her who was causing my issues. My mom immediately got me to a therapist and psychiatrist, as her father was schizophrenic and she was worried i was showing early signs. It turns out i had a severe anxiety condition as well as early asthma and depression. My dad told me several times my conditions werent real, and that a true woman didnt deal with mental health issues. He also began to pressure me hard about being a ""perfect woman"" and that i was too curvy and not skinny enough to be attractive. He would routinely grab my butt while i was cooking and stand behind me saying how good of a housewife i was getting. I told my mom, finally after it going on for weeks, and CPS got involved. Again he denied it, and said my mom was grooming us to get us taken away. They asked my brother who was around all the time, and he said he had never seen it happen. I still had to go with him.

Christmas break came around and we had to stay with him for two weeks. I know this might sound petty, but my dad who makes hundreds of thousands a year got me and my brother $20 because he ""didnt have enough money"", when my mom, who makes barely minimum wage, saved to get us hundreds of dollars worth of things to apologize for the actions of my father. When winter break was over, i had my first bout of Pneumonia. To date I have had it 6 times, which it has only been a few years, and the doctors told me the first time that it was likely caused my permanent damage to my lungs due to black mold. We did our own mold test at both houses because my dad denied that it was his house, and only one came back positive. His. He had professionals come to see his house, and when we asked for the results he told us ""it was none of our business"" and refused to give us any copies, but that the results were negative. By this time, I was old enough in my state to refuse visitation. I did. And so did my brother. After years of taking care of him and trying to shelter him from my dads abuse I finally got him out of the situation. 

A few months after, my dad completely renovated the house, got it sold, and moved in with his new girlfriend. He didnt tell either me or my brother that they were getting married until 6 months after they got engaged. I found out through a Facebook post. After that, I told him I never wanted to talk to him again, and cut off all communication with him. I got a new phone, and set up to block anybody who isnt a contact, which he isnt. I still hold a grudge against him, and every day i struggle with my asthma, anxiety, depression, and health/mental issues caused by his actions. Every time they effect me, I cant help but hate him, and I end up going into a depressive episode. I cant see a therapist, my mom doesnt make enough money to have us covered by insurance, and we already spend too much on my own, my brothers, and my moms meds (which we all need, none can be cut). What else can I do to help myself..?


TL;DR: My (now estranged) dad caused me physical and mental health issues due to emotional abuse, neglect and mild sexual harassment, witnessing him abusing my younger brother, as well as his own ego and pride. How do I get over the grudge I have against him?",24Apr2020,1

it’s my second time taking it. i’ve tried really hard, did weekly tutoring, was doing well all in all until COVID-19. i lost access to the desktops i’m used to doing stats at and my tutoring sessions. there’s no online lecture for it. i tried extra hard for the first couple of months because i need stats to graduate, but now, i haven’t really tried and the grade dropped to an 85. i’m worried if i take the exam, i will fail the class by not knowing how to do maybe half of the problems. if i fail, i won’t be able to graduate on time.

I’ve been really assessing these past couple months of quarantine and honestly I’ve felt a lot better mentally than ever before. Like before all this, I was always stressing about not dating much at the age of 26 years old and generally anxious over dumb shit. I’ve kind of realized that I really like quarantine as it made me really reflect on the shit I used to trip about. The problem is when things go back to ‘normal’, will this happiness fade again? I live in a city that is obsessed with appearances and that has NEVER been me from the start. I don’t take out loans for a car I can’t afford, for a house I can’t afford or clothes I can’t afford. Which ultimately took hits at my confidence in the dating pool since superficiality is really high in this area. Granted, I’m planning on moving out of this city if I ever find a job in a more liberal/relaxed place. Has anyone ever felt this before too? Like a feeling you just don’t belong?",24Apr2020,1

Currently I'm looking for a very specific class to take and I don't know where to begin to start searching. Specifically, I'm looking for an intro/ early intermediate level heritage Chinese class. Its difficult to find because I'm looking specifically for a heritage language class, which is taught differently from traditional chinese classes (in a heritage class, students usually have previous exposure to the language through family, and so the class will focus more on reading and writing, and the class progresses at a faster level).

632,"***First of all this might be triggering for some, so I apologise!*** 

This happened to me a few years ago and I keep coming back to it in my mind and feeling awful about it. I just really want to know if I have a right to feel the way I do, or am I really sensitive?  

What I'm about to tell you happened with a man who is no longer my friend. (I am female btw). But before this had happened another girl I knew of had accused him of rape, but she was thought to be a liar because he comes across as being ""such a nice guy"". 

Okay so... after a night out a few years ago my flatmate and I invited our friend to sleep on our couch because it was taking ages to get him a taxi and he was a bit drunk. So we all got back to the flat/apartment about 3am and we set him up on the sofa and we went to our rooms to sleep. So, fast forward to the next morning around 10am. I had gone to sleep with a sort of long t-shirt thing and no underwear (because i was alone in my room and didnt see the need). Anyway, I woke up and at some point, I have no idea when this happened, but he was in the bed beside me. Not only that but he was trying and partially succeeding to insert either his fingers or his penis (I'm not sure which because i was lying face down) into me. I froze for a bit, and then got up and ran to the toilet. He followed me and banged on the door a bit. I eventually came out and he pushed me up against the wall and attempted to kiss me. My flatmate came out at some point, and told him to leave. He text me about it a few days later because my flatmate had told a few friends and it got back to him that others knew. But he said he was drunk and didn't remember it. But it was the next day, he hadn't drank alcohol for probably over 8 hours by the time that had happened and he didn't seem very drunk when he followed me to the bathroom. 

Now, I know what he did is wrong. But for a short time after this I still remained friends with him, so I dont even know if he realises it was wrong. 

Now I've had years to think about it I feel really awful. I feel sad for my younger self who actually felt like I had to stay friends with him after and tried to brush it off as if it was nothing. I know its not the worst thing that could have happened. But I feel deeply confused about how I should or how i am allowed to feel about it. He's still friends with people I know so he pops up on social media from time to time and I feel really weird when I see his picture. I always wonder if he knows what he did was wrong. And I often feel that maybe if he doesn't realise what he did, do I have a right to be sad about it? I know its a very strange way to think about it. But I feel deeply guilty that I should maybe not feel the way I do because it could have been a lot worse and he might not have meant it the way it happened. Ahh I don't know. Anyway I'm looking to see if people think I should or shouldn't feel guilty about how I feel towards him and about what happened. Or if theres anyone who can relate to how I feel?

Thanks everyone, much love x",24Apr2020,1

634,"I really don't want to go into detail, but I've been having suicidal thoughts every single day for a while now. This isn't anything new, I've dealt with this before, but right now it's at the point where I'm seriously considering it and soon. Nothing really significant happened, it's just my depression sinking. Even on the good days, I have suicidal thoughts.

Due to covid, I can't have sessions with my therapist unless it's over the phone, which just doesn't feel the same. It doesn't feel as private with my family around and it just doesn't feel as genuine, for lack of a better word. Because of this, I haven't seen my therapist since February. Even if I did continue therapy sessions over the phone, what would happen if I told my therapist what was truly going on? I just don't trust it. He's an amazing therapist, but I don't trust anyone. Being locked in an institution would be a financial burden on myself and would just kill me mentally. How would I come to face my family after that? They don't care that I'm depressed or suicidal, they care about their reputation. Their adult child, who barely has any responsibilities and hasn't had a hard life, can't even handle being alive.

Not long ago, I reached out to someone asking if they knew anyone I could buy a gun and a small amount of ammo off, to ""protect myself"". They said yes but I'm still waiting for a price estimate. I'm sure everyone reading this knows my true intention for when I receive this gun.

Every day, I would try these small exercises that I had received from my friends and therapist, in an attempt to help my mental health temporarily/in the long-term. Nothing works. I am also unable to get antidepressants for obvious reasons at this time, so I'm basically fucked and I am too impatient to wait until the quarantine is lifted as I've been waiting literally my entire life.

636,"Background: 19 and just finished my first year in college. Thinking of moving out with my friend, sister, and sisters boyfriend into a 3 bed, 2 bath house. I'm very happy with the house. I'm conflicted on whether or not this is a good move. (Im currently living with my parents)

PROS

I gotta move out eventually, so why not now

This is probably the cheapest option in comparison to an apartment (350 rent)

I'll actually feel like an adult

It'll make me move on to the next 'phase' in life and same for my parents

I'll probably learn alot about ""real life""

It'll be fun to hang out with my friend

Way more freedom obviously, my mom won't breathe down my neck

I can have friends over

I can have boyfriends over

It's only 5 minutes away from where I'm currently at (so im not going to an unfamiliar area)

I have no summer classes and all my classes are online next semester. So I can work more hours if I need to

I only have 3 more years of school, not 4. Which is still alot but this is better than moving out after highschool


CONS:

350 rent + utilities is way more expensive than living for free

Utilities will probably be around 50-60 additional. Groceries could be like another 100. All in all its like 500+

So 500*12 month lease is total cost of 6,000
I should limit my college debt, and this doesn't help
I'm kinda afraid my mom will be lonely. Of course she has my dad but like she's very much overprotective and attached and I think this will be hard for her to have no kids in the house (but also I can't live here forever)


FINANCES:

I have 7k saved 

I made about 700/month after taxes when I was working 20 hours. but I can probably get more hours
My tuition is 12k per years. But my scholarships pay half. So I got about 6000 per year to pay (or take out in loans...)",24Apr2020,1

640,"Everyone around me, including my own family, has always seen her as a negative and dramatic person. When I was little, I remember everyone joking about how it didn't matter what restaurant you would take her to, she would end up saying something negative about it. 

I moved away from her for a long time after having moved to another country; now, I moved back to the country I was born in. I live with her again because she is one of the few family members I have here. She was the one who suggested I live with her, so I accepted it. I did not know she would be this dramatic and difficult. Because I lived in a different, more westernized country for a long time, I became culturally different from her. I guess she is not used to it. 

Over the past few years I have lived with her, I have gotten into heated arguments with her because she tends to severely overreact, and I feel I cannot even show an ounce of negative emotion towards her without her berating me. For example, I am working from home, and she talks to me... I cannot answer her for one reason or another because I am focused on a task, and she mutters under her breath, repeatedly, that I'm disrespectful. I confront her about it, tell her that's an unfair statement and I am just working, and she proceeds to tell me a bunch of stuff about how I am basically an ingrate, and how I'll have problems with in-laws eventually because of my behavior, how I was raised wrong by my own mother (who I believe is a very wonderful person). I honestly tuned out the other crap she said because I had to work and just did not want to bother with her. She was basically just insulting me and my character. She also resorts to saying statements like ""you'll be sorry when I die."" Correct me if I am wrong, but doesn't this count as emotional blackmail?   
All this came from the fact that I didn't answer her statement for a few seconds. I tune her out and I don't say anything at this point because it is the only way to cope, but it does not mean it does not affect me. Anything I say will be taken irrationally and she will escalate it and make it about her. Her reasoning for being ""right"" always goes back to her being older. 

If she is not picking a fight with me, she finds some way to be upset about something. She is a very negative person, almost always crying about something. She is almost always complaining about something in the house, and even my own family members. 

She has gone through domestic violence as a young woman and grew up poor; she's been through a lot and has never been to therapy. I believe she has a lot of unresolved issues, and it's caused her trouble when dealing with her kids and now, me. She also has hoarding tendencies which severely bothers me. I basically think she needs to seek help for her traumatic experiences, but she does not believe in therapy. Suggesting it to her would also be taboo.  

But... she also did care a lot for me when I was growing up, acting like another mom, and she still cares for me today by cooking for me, etc. She shows care in that way. But my perception of her totally changes because of how she treats me as a person. She tries to control how I should and should not feel, almost always keeping in mind her feelings but never mine. I can never have an honest to goodness conversation with her about emotions. 

Anyway, I plan on moving away soon for multiple reasons, career prospects, etc... but she is certainly one of the reasons why I feel I have to. My plans to move are obviously being halted by the current situation. 

TL;DR: My grandmother is overdramatic, picks fights with me, insults me over minor reasons, and I believe uses emotional blackmail. She has cared for me growing up and acted like another mom, is nurturing through her actions. Otherwise, she does get emotionally manipulative and extremely negative. Is she as toxic as I think she is? While I am waiting to move away, what do I do when she acts up and picks fights with me, sometimes insulting me?",24Apr2020,1

642,"I know, super cliche. I don’t plan on attending college. My plan is to become a real estate agent, eventually invest in real estate once I have enough money saved to begin buying properties. I watch Graham Stephan a lot and he’s my inspiration. I’m sort of trying to fall into his steps.
I am conflicted because I don’t know whether I should begin my journey right away meaning as soon as I turn 18, get my real estate license and just focus on my career and making as much money as possible OR if I should maybe spend 2 or 3 years traveling.
Will those years push me back? Is it better that I focus on my career very early on?
I have people telling me I should travel while I’m young but then people like Graham who I look up to advise to work first and then travel later in life.
If I were to travel, I would go to Australia and get a working holiday visa and after probably travel SouthEast Asia + New Zealand.
I’m 16F for anyone wondering.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

646,"The chain of events began in February.
TLDR: fiancé left due to a her bipolar manic episode, our mutual best friend sexually assaulted me in my own bed, I knots died of kidney failure, the mutual best friend killed himself, people are blaming me for his death, i don’t know what to do 

My fiancée stopped taking her medications for bipolar disorder, went into a state of mania, called off the wedding and literally moved and left me in our home that I can barely afford with our 6 pets that I struggle to take care of alone. 

She left right after I lost my job and had a falling out with a good friend. She left while I was struggling with serious health issues and had my license suspended because of a seizure. 

I could not/cannot drive, due to COVID19 I have not be able to work. I am living off of a very small inheritance.

My best friend was also her best friend. They knew each other for 10 years. I was in his life for the 5 years that her an I were together. While in her manic state she was paranoid and told him that if he continued to be my friend then she would not talk to him. He knew eventually she would calm down and chose to back off and we continued to hang out. 

I was struggling to cope with everything. We would go to bars and hang out and I would vent and cry and do best friend things. He has ALWAYS said he fate was suicide. He’s stated many times in front of me and my ex that he wanted to shoot himself and commit suicide. He’s stated for years he has always been suicidal and he’s been hospitalized previously. We both tried to help him but he did not want help. He said he would never actually do it because of his family and friends but that he thought about it all the time. 

When she left me and cut him off, he started telling me that he would kill himself if I wasn’t in his life. He would always thank me for being such a good friend because he didn’t know what he would do without me. Then he started making weird comments but not TOO weird. He would compliment me a little too much when we went to bars to drink. I didn’t think much of it. 

About a month ago we got wasted (alcohol, Xanax, cocaine.. anything I could get my hands on), we came back to my place, I began throwing up and having a panic attack, sobbing over my ex, I couldn’t calm down. Eventually he called my mom at 2am who talked me into calming down. He said he would help me get in bed and then leave. He didn’t leave though. Let me say We have slept in the same bed before. After partying just put on the office and both knocked out on opposite ends of the bed. We’ve always had a strictly platonic relationship. I’m gay. He’s straight. So that night it wasn’t weird. I am leaving out some details to keep this as short as possible but I blacked out and woke up face down with him on top of me naked. I don’t want to say any other details. It was horrific. When I woke up and was able to say something, he noticed and literally RAN out of the house. RAN. I  called a friend completely distraught. He urged me to confront him via text. I did, he responded telling me I asked for it. I was devastated. I told him he knows what he did and blocked him. 

That morning I called my mom to take me to the hospital because I could not calm down or stop throwing up. I ended up being admitted for kidney failure. They told me I was probably going to end up on dialysis. It was fucking TERRIFYING. The doctor told me in front of my mom to maybe have my family come see me because the situation was getting worse. I texted my ex since she had only left a few weeks prior and even in her manic state I hoped that she would see me. She did not respond. It hurt so bad. Somehow I did not end up on dialysis and 4 days later I had made enough of an improvement for them to send me home with strict conditions. They sent me home earlier than they normally would because they began admitting people to that unit for COVID19 and they were discharging as many patients as they possibly could to make room. 

When I got home I could not sleep in my room or on my bed. I stayed in the living room. I moved the spare bed to the living room and I was unable to even go near my bedroom where it happened. It was hell. I confided in a total of 3 people and I asked them to please check on me because I was a disaster. I asked them to not tell anyone especially my ex because she was unpredictable and I wanted to handle this information when I was clear headed. One of those 3 people went directly to my ex and then proceeded to tell everyone. Nobody believed it. Only one person continued to check in with me and support me. I received a text from my ex’s aunt telling me I am a liar and I was never in the hospital and I was lying about being raped for attention and that I’m a piece of shit essentially. 

It broke me. 

On Tuesday this week I got news that he killed himself. It was incredibly confusing to even begin processing this. I didn’t even process anything else yet. 

The few people who did check on me, I just responded asking them to please check on my ex instead. I had my best friend of 15 years by my side at this point and I was terrified of people blaming me. I didn’t want anyone contacting me especially if they did not believe what he did to me. 

I feel like I killed him by confiding in others. I do realize it’s irrational but my brain is broken right now. 

I decided to unblock my ex’s family just in case something happened and My ex was jolted out of mania or worst case ended up in the hospital for her mental illness. However I received a text from her aunt again calling me a killer. I blocked the family again. 

I don’t know how to do any of this. I haven’t even dealt with calling off the wedding. I haven’t dealt with facing death. I wish i would’ve just died from the kidney failure. I don’t even know why I’m alive. I don’t feel suicidal, I just wouldn’t mind if I died 

Any advice is welcome. I’m lost. Every time I say ‘this can’t get worse’ it gets worse.",24Apr2020,1
647,"In the fall of 2019, my neighbor got a cat for his young son, and I started seeing her hanging around my house. I thought she was a stray so I fed her, until one time my neighbor came over to help with the yard and confirmed it was his cat. My family and I were fine with it, until when the weather got colder, he kept her out of the house. We put some blankets over a chair so that she could be protected from the wind, and we asked the neighbor about why he hasn't taken the cat in. So he says that she's an indoor-outdoor cat, but he then continues to say that he didn't want to take care of her anymore, butt out of my business. This made my family upset and sad because she's a very loving cat and comes up to us for pets. He still fed her luckily, as she rejected any food we gave her. Fast forwards to spring time, and she's always sleeping on our driveway and follows us around. The neighbor does not seem to be letting her in at all and isn't feeding her either because she is getting thinner. For the past several days I have been feeding her meals, and she's been eating them very ravenously. At this point, he doesn't let her in nor feed her. Today it was rainy so I finally decide to take her in, dry her off, and feed her. She is not my cat, but she certainly acts like it. She seems very happy in my room, but I also have a dog (who she tolerates) and another cat (that she does not like to be around). Do you guys have any advice on what I should do?

648,"So i wasn't sure if I should be upset or im overacting now but im just confused and a little hurt. So i have a best friend, and we have been the closest ever for years. But lately, she's been acting off, and i already know its because she made a new group of friends so I'm not always around her.

So around close to the end of 2019 i was heavily depressed and was cutting off things in my life and making changes here and there. And I decided that i wanted to book a trip abroad with this friend as a treat for working hard and being in college. At this point, she was the only close friend i had left because I cut off a lot of bad people. (long story)

We went to said trip to bali and it was great until it wasn't. Towards the end of the trip she was ignoring me and was moody, so she we didnt talk for three of the 11 days we were there?? im not a confrontational person so i let her be, and come to me when ready but still made the effort to talk to her while out. but on a trip abroad in Bali she would rather call her work friends back home then speak to me, its just what??

We ended the trip surprisingly on a happy note. Then while flying back home, we were talking, and I was just saying that i wanted to fix 2020 and be happier and more social and hang out and be livelier me since I've been a mess and have kept to myself for a while. We hadn't hung out a whole lot until the trip, and i wanted to make plans to hang out once home, but she was off. I basically said ""oh I can't wait to do this and this after school"" and she flat out was like "" we probably won't see each other for months"", shutting down hanging out with me. Then saying bye at the airport was awkward again and im just lost.

Fast forward to like late Jan and early Feb and we talk really rarely and she's always out with other people which is cool, but at this point, shes ghosting me sorta which ill admit hurts since i consider her my best friend. the ghosting lasts for weeks until i snap and she apologizes and says its school.

So i'm like okay its fine and try to have a convo, You see my phone broke in Bali, and i had to use her phone to take all pictures of me and scenery ( im big into photography these days and I wanted to make a photography page outta the pics i took). So i then ask her for said pictures because they are important to me (and she knows about the page), one because i have no pictures of this amazing trip and i can't even show my own family and two, because i was going to start a page with said pictures.

She ghosts me again, then posts pictures of the trip and tags someone else in the pictures who wasn't even in Bali, and now I'm just fucking confused. because of what's happening in the world i cant just pull up and ask what's wrong, and I feel wronged and I'm sick of being a weak person who can't say anything.

What should i do regarding our friendship, and about the photos that I took? I don't want to end a friendship not knowing what happened?",24Apr2020,1
650,"Hi, I’ve been going to counseling off an on for many years, so I’ve met with many people, I’m in college now and it’s been rough so I got a counselor through the school. Honestly we never really clicked so it just felt sort of painfully awkward, which I know happens, so I just figured I’d stick with it. Talking with my friend I realized it’s actually really not a great situation. I’ve been speaking with him about how I’m trying to stay positive and he just keeps bringing up really negative situations in the world right now that are bigger than me, and don’t have anything to do with me. And when I try to change the topic back to me he does it again after a few minutes. He also keeps talking about how down he’s been, which I get a little is okay but I’ve found I’ve been trying to give him advice because he keeps complaining to me, it’s very uncomfortable. On our last appointment (on zoom) he asked how classes were and I mentioned it was hard to understand the expectations of my professors because they all post very differently on the website so it’s hard to know where to find the information. He suggested I reach out to my colleges Academic Support Center to learn the site and I explained that I understand it, it’s just my professors use it differently. I appreciated the attempt at a solution and tried to move on with the conversation and he said that the staff in the academic support center don’t have anyone to help and their job relies on it so I really should go to them. I tried again to explain I don’t need their help with this and he then brought up that I’m one of the only reasons he has his job right now. Then checked that we are meeting next week. It made me feel really pressured and uncomfortable. I think he means well but it’s been making my anxiety and depression worse every week after my appointment, I’m coming to him because I’m already struggling with a lot of pressure and it’s honestly really adding to it. I only have a few weeks left but I guess I want to stop counseling, but I really don’t know how. I also really don’t want to talk to him about why, it’s extremely uncomfortable and I’ve given the situation many changes. I’m feeling pretty lost with what exactly to do and it’s giving me lots of anxiety :/  Has anyone been through something similar?

So this is obviously NSFW

Long post TLDR at bottom 


So me (m22) and my partner (f23) had to move home to a not so kind house hold about a month ago. My parents house 

So my parents are just after getting back together after being separated over cheating issues.
I suspected my mother had gotten involved in a sex group or swingers group during the summer.

So today there were ""fixing the beams"" in the crawl space above one of the bedrooms and when I went to collect the mail 2 big boxes from a sex toy website were there.

Now my normal reaction would be it's none of my business, espically since I'm only home till we find a new place and got locked down here.

But now they've locked up a bedroom down stairs installed something into roof and have been in there giggling and locked everything up. 

Now they told me regardless of lock down I need to be out for a night, so they can have a party in a couple of weeks time.

Now based on what I heard from the friends they brought up to help them install what ever they are after creating a sex room and installing toys and swings.

Me and my partner are very open and sexual people but obviously not with my parents or even in their house.

But my issue and questions to the community are how should I approach loving here and how should i approach the issue of nobody entering into my current bedroom during her party which based on conversation between them and their friends it's going to be a huge sex orgy party.

Realised I rambled a bit and again I'm sorry mods if this was the wrong place.

TLDR  temporarily moved home and got locked down with my parents, who are currently after building a sex room to have an orgy with their friends.

I have a tough time truly caring about other people and letting them in (emotionally). If someone shares bad news with me or expresses that they feel in some sort of negative way, I don't really care much. I don't really mind fucking other people over to get what I want.

I'm also not able to sustain positive feelings toward a person for a very long amount of time. Whenever I do feel liking or love towards another person it's short lived, and I usually go back to either feeling either nothing or resentment towards them.

I still care if someone is in pain as a direct consequence of my actions, though. If I hurt someone I will feel guilty and sad.

I haven't been this way all my life, and there was a time when I was younger when I genuinely cared about what people had to say, but now I just view them as objects.

My life feels kind of colourless without being able to connect to another human being. I feel like I'm missing something, like something's broken inside of me.

657,"Hi all, I am not really sure what the goal of the post is but here we go.

I bullied my little brother when we were little kids. I used to tease him a lot, verbally abuse him, and I also hurt him physically. I remember regularly making fun  of him when he had friends over. I remember accidentally kicking him in the face and giving him a horrible nose bleed which to this day makes me feel like a piece of shit for doing. I remember closing the door on his hand accidentally (we were playing tag and I was running away from him so I closed the door and his hand was there, it was a stupid accident, but I still feel bad for it as I understand it added to his trauma). I remember playing shot for shot with him until a fist shaped bruise appeared on his arm. 

Looking back on it now I know I did it because I was being bullied at school and had no friends, but as a child I don't think I was even aware of what I was doing. I think when I was a kid I thought abuse was normal because I was being treated so poorly at school. I didn't understand why what I was doing was wrong and how it affected others which is ironic because it was happening to me. I had 0 sense of self awareness. I even began to become a bully myself at school when I called a kid fat to his face (he was overweight at our age) and understandably it made him feel horrible. I got sent to the principals office and got taught a very harsh lesson on treating others how you want to be treated. It was the first time in my life someone had truly explained to me the monster I had become. It was an eye opening moment to me and I still be ashamed about it. I would apologize to this person today if I ever knew how to find him. 

I went through a lot of abuse and social isolation in my life that has brought me to near suicide several times. I'm not trying to garner sympathy here, but instead I am explaining my journey and how my life has changed me. Longer I was abused, the more I was forced to learn how to become more human. The more I was abused, the more I understood how abuse affects the victims. The abuse has changed me into a much more gentle person than I was as a child.This translated to me treating my brother better as we got older. I can't say for sure when I stopped abusing him because, as horrible as it is to say, being the abuser allowed me the privilege of not having to remember the trauma I have inflicted. It's much like how my former abusers likely wouldn't remember much of what they did to me. Anyways, my guess is I stopped at around the age of 13. 

Today, I am 27 and my brother  is 24. We have a fairly decent relationship. We get along pretty well and have even lived together as roommates for several years supporting each other. The reason I say fairly is because we do still get into arguments, but I never make fun of him, I never abuse him and I always have his back. I do my best to be a good brother to him today and I have apologized several times for the way I treated him as a kid. He hasn't completely forgiven me. I don't know if he ever will and I don't really deserve it anyways.

Now that the background is done, here is the reason I wrote this post. Lately he has been dealing with a lot of emotional issues, mainly anger and resentment. He says it's because he is envious about how most people he knows never had to go through trauma like he did and that their lives are all the better for it and his is fucked up because of it. I see him going through the same journey I did because that is exactly how I felt several years ago when I was suicidal. He attaches a lot of this pain to how I treated him as a kid. I understand how his trauma regarding me is deep because his home was supposed to be his safe place and I ruined that for him. As I've said, I've done my best to be a good brother to him since we were teens and I also understand how the past will never change. 

The problem is, he is currently in a lot of shitty situations that are for the most part very self-inflicted. He is blaming all the poor decisions he makes on me and the trauma he endured. I understand that he is in a lot of pain that I have caused. I also understand he resentment because I also went through a similar phase of blaming the trauma I went through for my shitty situation in life. The big difference is I was his abuser and he couldn't get away from me. 

I want to know how I can help him, if I can help him. I don't know how to get his forgiveness, and frankly, by this point I don't expect it, nor do I feel like i'll ever deserve it. I want to see him succeed and flourish. I don't know how to get him to that place, if I even can, and if I, as his former abuser is even the right person to help. He has seen several therapists and he is still looking for one he likes. I just want this to stop holding him back and i don't know what to do to help him do that.

TLDR; I bullied my brother when we were younger. I did my best to be a good brother since.

660,"Hi Reddit! I'm a first-time poster here, but I digress.

So I am a college freshman (19) who's majoring in Political Science and to be frank, this year blows balls. I failed my first semester for a handful of reasons and put on academic probation, and this semester, I had to withdrawal from all of my classes because I knew I was going to fail again because of the sudden switch to online classes (I just can't do online classes).

That really sucks too.

I know many of you can relate to being rather successful in high school and then falling off when you hit college so I told my therapist and academic advisor about my struggles. They told me that a lot of students struggle their first year as well, but when I see other freshmen doing well with straight A's, I wonder if there's something wrong with me, you know? And that thought hurts because I got in on a scholarship and showed a lot of potentials to do something great.

So I spoke with my therapist once more, got tested for ADHD (the results aren't back yet because of the virus, but it's looking pretty positive) and reached out to the disability office to see what they can do. I got the usual, ""We can give you extra time on tests,"" and, ""Let's get you set up with a tutor"", but the classes I take don't have tutors for it. I don't think the test option would help because my professors already give us enough time for tests and I don't have any testing anxiety.

Okay, well shit. 

I'm starting to think that traditional college just isn't for me. I started looking into community college to get the right credits for an art degree to then transfer to a larger college for game design since I am actually passionate about it, but do you guys think I should keep trying at my current university? Or maybe pursue a trade like culinary? Any words of encouragement would really be helpful right now too... I feel like I'm letting down everyone who believed in me.

661,"So for some background information, my mum hasn't been in the best place for the last few years. She has depression and almost killed herself a couple years ago, and is currently on the verge of a divorce with my father. About a year ago now she discovered all this like chakra stuff, which started out as a simple hobby and healthy coping mechanism, but now has evolved into much more (eg waking everyone else up at 6am with loud ""healing"" music, spending the household funds on biweekly trips to northern island and a month long trip to Peru (although because of the virus it got cancelled, but she's still yet to be fully refunded).
It's gotten to the point where it's weird, though, like the other day we were on a walk on a hill near my house (we live in the middle of nowhere -It's safe), and she randomly started hugged a tree, and when I asked what was wrong she said, crying, that 'she's the only one who understands me'. It's actually scaring me a little.
As well as this, during the lockdown she's discovered all of these conspiracy theories, and genuinely warns everyone around us that this virus is to do with 5G, and how she's forbidding all of us to get vaccinated when it comes out (though no one takes her too seriously anymore). 
She's also started to lose her temper really easily, too. Earlier today, I was in the kitchen doing some chores while she was cooking something, and I happened to have a song stuck in my head, so asked to play it. She said no, so I started humming it quietly. After a while, she put on some ""healing"" music (which, may I add, is the worst music ever to be forced to listen to. And she plays it on max volume). So assuming shes ok with music, I ask again to play this song. She completely snapped at me, and revoked my internet access between 8pm and 8am. (Like this was completely unprompted). She also regularly gets annoyed at me for the tiniest things, too, like calling me a ""heartless bitch"" when I didn't make her a cup of tea with her sandwich (which was only because when I was slicing the bread I cut into my finger and had to stop the bleeding). 

Anyways, sorry for the longpost. I just really don't know what to do. She is losing her mind and she takes it out on others and I'm getting worried about her...",24Apr2020,1

I suffered with eating/mental health issues and was way more negative and insecure. I’m afraid that living at home will revert me back into my old ways. It’s also weird to think about having a real full time job and coming home to my mom after spending 4 years being so independent.

I’ve already made plans to move there so I can’t back out but they’re starting to get impatient that I’m not already in the area (my employer) they said that if I don’t start by a certain date after getting hired then corporate will count me as a “no show” and terminate my employment.

I was thinking of sending him a text that went like this: 

Hi, (Employer). I just found out that due to the virus, there are only two flights a week from the closest airport to (redacted area) to the area I’m at in (redacted). The soonest my aunt can get here is next Sunday. Is there any way my start date could be moved to the following weekend? I’m so sorry for all of the confusion surrounding my start date. It’s been hard having to coordinate with the bridge being closed and the virus restricting travel. If that’s not possible, I will find a way to get there by next weekend like what was originally planned. Thanks again for your patience and I’m sorry for the inconvenience.

670,"Hi this is kinda long so bare with me.

We’ve been friends for over 2 years and I met him my freshman year of college (I’m a junior now). It was obvious he was interested from the beginning but long story short we talked, eventually kissed, he hooked up with another girl, I asked him what his intentions were and he said he didn’t want a relationship at the time (this was 2 years ago). We left off on good terms and remained as good friends. Sophomore year came along and he made the effort to hang out here and there but we never got physical.

Summer going into this school year was when things started to change. We began to Snap a lot and he would tag me in things on Facebook. Immediately when classes started in August, he asked to grab food (which he has never done during our 2 years of friendship). This became a consistent thing throughout the year along with other things such as: complimenting me (he has never done that before), asking to hang out more, buying me coffee several times, bought wine, cooked for me (specifically bought me steak once), asked to go to the city and FaceTime over winter break, he remembered my birthday and even bought me a bottle after I jokingly asked for one. All of this happened from August-March. The past 2 years, he would hookup with other girls when we were at the same party together. This year, however, we were at 2 parties together and he stayed by my side and would tried to get with me. At one party, I was getting close with another guy and I knew he got jealous but just didn’t say anything because, well, he really couldn’t when he has been doing the same thing to me last year. At my birthday party, I got really drunk and apparently flirted with one of his friends. The next day, his friend told me that he looked like he didn’t like that I did that.

Anyways, in March, because of COVID19 we all had to leave. The day before we had to leave, he asks to hangout because he said “this might be the last time I see your face.” We hang out, he pays for my coffee, and we go back to my room. He eventually asks if I wanted him to kiss me and I say no. He then asks why and I say “I’m bad at this stuff” and I just say the cheek. He kisses me on the cheek and eventually kind of makes out with my neck. Eventually he leaves and I go to the bar with my friends later that night. I then get a text from him saying he’s coming with his friends too. I dance with my guy friends and then I see him hooking up with another girl. I get mad and I know this is immature so I found another guy and eventually I’m sitting on his lap (we never kissed or anything).

I like him but I don’t know if he was just trying to just hookup or wanted something more. We’ve always kept in contact since freshman year but now we haven’t talked in about a month. I’m not sure if I should reach out because I don’t know if he still has feelings for me.

So, did he just want to hookup or wanted something more? tl;dr: This guy is giving me mixed signals and I don’t know if he wanted to just hookup or something more.",24Apr2020,1
671,"Hey, I'm a 23F who is feeling pretty anxious from being cooped up, especially now that my partner is back to work after recovering from pneumonia. I'd love to start exercising regularly but the honest issue is, I'm extremely anxious/neurotic, very out of shape, and have absolutely zero equipment: also I live in an apartment....in Spain. Thus with the *situation* I'm not allowed to leave except for groceries and doing exercise outside is prohibited. I also don't have pets, so no ""walking the dog"" excuse. 

My history with exercise is minimal: 

* I took a weightlifting class in high school and enjoyed it, excelled. I tried it two years ago alone in the gym and had issues with form and fears of increasing weights due to the lack of guidance/a partner, but overall did alright. I also did ultimate frisbee with friends for fun. 
* I have tried yoga multiple times, I do not like it as I am not flexible, find it difficult to follow along, get bruises on the floor and it actually *really* angers me when I cannot follow along to the point where it just ends up frustrating for me. 
* I don't mind stretching (ej trying to get ""splits"" or whatever, which I have never been close to in my life lol) but it hurts and apparently requires intense exercise beforehand to be loose and not injure which is where the issue lies.
* I would like to try dancing but I am so unskilled (I have never taken a class in my life) that I feel I need guidance. I have tried following multiple dance videos from tiktok and youtube and can't follow along to save my life; I am very uncoordinated and they never seem to explain what they are doing!!
* [I tried to follow this routine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bleOTMDa3_4) but could only get 8-10 minutes in before tapping out and I also slammed my knee less than a week into it trying to do that ""high plank to down dog"" without sufficient strength and falling and had multiple bruises on my elbows from planking, which made it painful to continue. My friends told me to use a towel and I may actually try that again if I don't get other ideas but I do find it somewhat dull. 

I'd love some ideas: does anyone have any beginner routines (ej on youtube or something) with no equipment that are relaxing, fun, and simple enough to follow? I am at a very nice weight (57-60kg) and love my body even though I'm super unfit (26.5% BF) so the point of exercising is entirely for mental health and to not be laying in bed in my free time when I'm not cooking/cleaning/studying.

674,"I went to go see a car that ad was listed up with 113,000 miles and upon arrival, I noticed the dash was a bit cracked, I asked the seller why, he told me he bought it like that. I didn’t think too much of it being that he was being extremely nice and (which I thought also honest) to me and allowing me to test drive the car and check it out. I inspected the car throughly and found a couple flaws which I didn’t mind investing my money and fixing on my own. I finally went through with the purchase and let him count the money afterwards he told me he had signed his part of the title and told me where I have to sign. (Once again me not thinking much about it and him being extremely nice, no red flags yet..) I drove the car all the way home to find out the title says 188,555 miles, I contacted the seller ASAP &amp; he tried to convince me that it wasn’t a mistake on his part, that the dmv computer must’ve been wrong and that they have the correct mileage of the car and that I can easily get it fixed, as I found that odd being that if he knew it was wrong, he should’ve fixed it himself before attempting to sell. I asked him for a refund and that I would return the car the same way I received it to avoid any confusion and problems, he then try to tell me that we can’t do that because I already signed off on the back of the title and that I’m “legally” the owner, I told him that’s false and he can easily pay for a new title at dmv being that I never transferred it to my name or anything. He refused and told me that he wasn’t trying to scam because if he was he wouldn’t had done it at his address and he also provided me with a copy of his DL. I explained to him my frustration and how if he doesn’t comply to give me my money back, I will involve Authority, he took that as me threatening him and told me to not come to his property etc etc, and left the group chat, 

Today I went out my way to involve authority and explained everything to a detective and he in fact ran the vin and everything, &amp; he told me that it was in fact not 113,000 miles and that the dash is wrong. He tried contacting the seller himself and seeing if he would like to return my money and I give back the car, he told me the seller refused being that I signed “warranties” and knew what I was buying!! I have proof and messages that I showed the detective that he clearly advertised the car as 113,000 and I never signed anything but the back of the title (which he took photos of to keep for his “record”) I’m assuming he’s going to try and forge my signature on warranties, he also lied about the price that I paid for the car on the back of the title stating that I paid $3300 when I really paid $4600 and he stamped that I paid him taxes which I didn’t being that it was a “private sell”.

I’m waiting for the detective to make the report but I’m so frustrated and want help and answer to this situation because this guy is clearly lying and for some reason not afraid to take things to court being that he’s completely in the wrong and I have lots of evidence/proof of him trying to list it as the miles that was shown on dash and trying to convince me that the miles coming up with the vin and title of the car are incorrect.. please help and what can I do ??",24Apr2020,1

677,"6 months ago my husband and I went plant based but I honestly don’t see myself doing this forever. I don’t mind cooking plant based at all but when I try to buy snacks or something, the options are very expensive and don’t contain much. It comes out pretty even because we save money on meat but idk, it’s just so hard to find and so small in portions.

Before we went plant based, I wanted to be vegetarian because I just don’t like meat. I LOVE cheese and sweets though. My husband was against the idea of me making it a lifestyle since he is big into working out and thought he needed meat for protein.

After conducting done research though he decided going plant based would actually be better for him and I agreed to it. In this experience I’ve found out that plant based saves a lot of food waste since soy milk lasts forever and we use flax eggs. I’m glad I tried it and I plan to be mostly plant based still.

However, occasionally I’ll want something with cheese in it or some dessert that’s already been prepared that I don’t have to bake from scratch and I don’t think the life style is sustainable for me.

I want to be mostly plant based but occasionally lacto-vegetarian. I told my husband that yesterday and while he had said he didn’t care if I don’t want to be plant based, he told me today that it bothers him and ordering things he can’t have is tempting and he didn’t want to break diet. We both have low body fat percentages but my husband had a certain look he wants and being plant based makes dieting easier.

I really don’t want to make him quit the diet. I’ve had several crazy temptations myself (Big candy covered cakes brought into work with my favorite Kit Kat’s!). I know that me choosing to eat something he likes will make him upset.

I don’t want him to break diet. It makes him happy and I plan to continue to make plant based food in the house. But occasionally I want some bad things and I can’t eat them outside right now.

Do any if you guys have a relationship with a mixed diet? How do you deal?",24Apr2020,1
678,"So this girl who is on this training course we're both are doing found my LinkedIn profile so she sent me a connection request there I accepted. Just to add I've never actually met her in person. She had a few questions regarding the material on the course which I was happy to answer for her, which I did. 

She frequently started to ask more questions each day regarding the nature of the training course and started to ask a few personal questions which I happily answered. Then she gave her number to me on LinkedIn.

So now we're using WhatsApp to message each other, and she starts asked a few more (personal) questions regarding my culture as we both come from the same culture &amp; country, and we had a full blown tirade about our country and everything that is wrong with it. So we had a call last week with the training organisers and they had a little 'get to know each other' session where each individual on the course submitted a truth and a lie in the shape of a truth, each individual then had to guess which was the truth/lie submitted by the others. So it was her turn, I commented that No. 1 of her answer was the truth (turns out it wasn't...) And she sends me a message immediately after saying that she could not believe I got it wrong. 

After that call session ended she started to ask a few more other questions and messages which IMO were subtle hints/flirts. She calls me 'Man' and 'Dude' frequently either I'm reading the messages wrong or something but I genuinely don't know what to make of it. So any advice would be appreciated in terms of whether I should ask her out or something. Thanks! :D

To get straight to the point, I have no clue what program to go into.  

I've been accepted into a medical science program and computer science program so far.  I'm hoping to get accepted into a biomedical engineering program, so fingers crossed.

I've been talking to a lot of my friends online and they all seem to say the same thing which is ""What the hell do you wanna do?"" and to be honest I don't exactly know either.  

To talk a little more about myself, at school the classes I love the most consist of chemistry, physics, biology, math and computer science.

The reason I love computer science and math at school is because I get to work with my friends and solve problems together.

I’ve grown up with it in my life and if I’m honest it did give me a good moral compass that I’m grateful for.

These shrines have gardens that look beautiful and people from all over the world come to visit but I didn’t want to do that because I have other things I want to prioritise in my life but I feel like my parents don’t see that. They want me to go because they feel it will be the experience of a life time but my gut feeling says otherwise.

Cut to yesterday, I find out she already has a new boyfriend -one that she met 2 months ago- and that shit hit like a truck at first. I got over that pretty quickly because I realized “why should I listen to someone tell me about all the negative things about me (because around the end she started saying that I was a terrible person and all I did was hurt her, although her words, practically verbatim, were “you didn’t give me enough attention. You didn’t text enough, you didn’t say I love you enough, you didn’t put things down to focus 100% of your attention one me enough,” maybe I just didn’t have a lot to give because being ripped away from everything I love to do is draining) even though they don’t even have the decency to wait more than 4 weeks to start dating someone else (which I’m kinda concerned about the timeline of this because she asked me, WHILE WE WERE DATING, how long someone should wait after breaking up with someone to get into a new relationship). The problem arises from the fact that my best friend is still friends with her, even after everything she’s done. Mind you, this is someone that I’ve been very close with for many years, going through the obligatory ‘thick and thin’ as you might put it. He only became her friend a few months after we started dating because I introduced them. It sucks because the guy who I’m supposed to call my closest friend can’t even console me while I’m grieving about this breakup. To me it’s weird for him to be her friend and I sure as hell wouldn’t be her friend if the roles were reversed, but I don’t know if it’s over stepping boundaries to say I don’t want you to be her friend. I’ve asked a lot of people in my life including friends and family and they all pretty much unanimously said I should stop being his friend. Does anyone have any advice or viewpoint that would help with this decision.

Even if it doesn’t matter, I’d like to absolve any bias in this by saying that I can be a bit arrogant sometimes, and around the end I had become really depressed (which doesn’t make me right) because of the situation, so I ended up being really short.",24Apr2020,1

693,"So my girlfriend is starting a job in early August and one of the things she told her job (she's going to be a nurse) is that she had a 4 or 5 day vacation planned in September. Since she's within her 90 day of starting, they said she's welcome to go but it's unpaid, as she can't use any PTO. 


I decided I to be a sweet little dumbass and figure, ""hey I'll plan us a surprise week long trip in December since she'll have PTO to use then."" I did the math and she would have accrued like 5 days PTO which is more than enough since she only works 3-4 days a week. 


When I revealed the surprise she was over the moon as this is the first time we've ever done something like this, but now weeks later she's expressing major concerns about how it looks taking 2 vacations within the first 6 months of her working even if the first one is unpaid. She hasn't requested off for this new vacation and is nervous to even ask. The trip is mostly refundable but I'd still be out a bit of money that I'd rather not lose. I'm also not convinced her trip in August won't be cancelled (Disney world) because of COVID-19. 


Should she at least ask her work for the time off? She's anxious that since she hasn't started yet because she really loves this job she'll be going into. Should I just cut my losses or do you think there's a chance her work would be okay with it if she just asks?


Also, I'm not going to cancel until I know for sure her August trip isn't cancelled. I'd hate for her to miss both trips. I have until the week before we go to get the majority of the money back. What would you do in this scenario?",24Apr2020,1

(F19) For as long as i remember i’ve always had an issue with my boobs. They are small (hardly any to basically no under boob) and they aren’t proportional. i weigh about 125 and i have big ribs so i just look so weird without bigger boobs. I think about this everyday and it really is ruining my life and my relationship with my bf as well. If i had the money for a boob job i would get one in a heartbeat but i don’t and i feel so out of options here. Every time i talk to someone about this they just tell me i’m being negative and i just can’t think like that but it’s literally so hard not to get upset and constantly think about especially when i have to look at myself naked sometimes. I know i have body image issues (i’ve dealt with an eating disorder in the past) but i cannot seem to shake the idea that if i had bigger and more proportional boobs that i would finally love myself and look more womanly for myself and bf. He says he likes my boobs but realistically i know he’d rather be with someone that actually has normal ass boobs and it really intimidates me because all the other girls he has been with have actually had nice boobs. I just feel like this issue is getting in the way of every aspect of my life and continues to ruin my day when i dwell on it. Any advice would really help!",24Apr2020,1
695,"So my parents are apart of a very unified religion that is very accepting of all other religions and beliefs. I’ve grown up with it in my life and if I’m honest it did give me a good moral compass that I’m grateful for. These recent months I’ve wanted to just do my own thing and not have to put time into these religions activities. I do reckon they help the community and enforce unity in the world but I kinda just can’t be bothered anymore and my parents want me to participate in these things. 

They want me to go to another country for a year to look after shrines that are important to the religion and I’d be meeting a lot of other people that help look after the place too. These shrines have gardens that look beautiful and people from all over the world come to visit but I didn’t want to do that because I have other things I want to prioritise in my life but I feel like my parents don’t see that. They want me to go because they feel it will be the experience of a life time but my gut feeling says otherwise. In the past I sad I’d go because my mum started getting really upset that I didn’t want to go and I was pressured into saying I’d go but now I’m retracting that and saying that I don’t want to go and I have about 2 days to respond to a call that confirms whether I want to go or not. 

Recently I received a message from my mum saying “I am not forcing you to go but I cannot pretend that I’m not deeply saddened that you don’t want to” it’s messages like these that I get make me think “I’m I doing something wrong” I kinda want to focus on my goals like getting my first job and getting a car because I’m still living at home and want to become independent with my own house and stuff like that but it feels like my parents just don’t understand that because their views say that you should value bringing unity though service rather than materialistic things. 

Can anyone here offer advice on how should I go about my decisions? I believe what they’re doing is out of a kindness and I love them so much but my ideals just don’t line up with what they want me to do and it’s making me feel bad",24Apr2020,1
697,"Since I was a kid I’ve always had straight A’s. All the way up until my freshmen year of high school. A little bit of back story, in elementary school I got bullied really badly. It got to the point that my parents pulled me out of school after they found a suicide note in my bedroom. I was 10 at the time. 
At the end of my 5th grade year we moved to Alaska and I continued to be homeschooled until 8th grade. I started 8th grade in a public school because I was feeling trapped inside my house. I didn’t have any friends and I think that was really when I noticed my depression. Anyways on the first day of 8th grade I met my best friend Devin. Her and I were literally inseparable. I don’t have to words to explain how much I loved her. At the end of 8th grade we moved again, this time to Virginia. 
In Virginia things went fine. I made some new friends but I really missed Devin. We FaceTimed but it just wasn’t the same. Freshmen year I also fell into an abusive relationship. My parents loved this guy but what they didn’t see was the times he threatened to kill himself if we broke up. The times he tried to forced his hand into my pants or up my bra. The time he pushed my against a tree and put his hand around my throat because he was mad that I hid his water bottle.  The only way I got out was because he moved. I started to slip back into that depression without Devin, without someone I could really be myself around. My grades were falling. I went from a straight A student to a B and C student which was fine, at least I was mostly passing. But then on July 13th of 2018 Devin committed suicide. After that I really didn’t care anymore.
 Sophomore year I barely scraped by. I was an average C to D student but again I was passing technically. I was dealing with Devin’s loss and the left overs of the abusive relationship. I felt worthless, I felt disgusting. And then after a while I just didn’t feel anything. Nobody noticed. I had struggled with eating disorders in the past but the summer after freshmen year and into sophomore year is really when the binging and starving myself got bad. And again, nobody noticed. I felt selfish if I brought it up so I just let it go on. Then at the end of Sophomore year my cousin killed himself too. After that I really did care or feel anything. 
Junior year I was stuck in classes that were way too hard for me, especially which everything going on in my head. I tried to switch out but my school councilor gave me the run around and I could never get ahold of her. I had D’s and F’s the whole year, I couldn’t keep up with the work. Then around January my parents split up, I don’t think they have been really happy since I was 7 so it wasn’t that much of a shock. I wasn’t at school for almost a whole month because my depression had just gotten horribly bad. I spent hours just staring at my ceiling. They split up because my mom had an affair and now I’m in New York with her and 4/5 of my siblings living in my uncles basement. We left right around the time everything shut down because of Corona. It was all really bad timing and I had no computer to do my school work on. I just now managed to get a laptop but it’s to the point that I’ve pretty much fucked myself over. My mom has completely checked out. She’s constantly on the phone talking to friends, outside smoking, in her room taking a nap or driving back and forth between this other town that she’s trying to get a job in. I’m raising 4 kids that I didn’t sign up for. And I can again feel myself slipping. I don’t get up until noon, I rarely eat and if I do I’m binging. I’m an accidental  high-school drop out and I don’t know how to fix that. 
I guess I’m just wondering what my options are? I want to go to culinary school after high-school and I don’t even know where to start. 

P.S. I’ve asked my mom several times over the past year to get me some help for my mental health but she never has. I can’t make myself an appointment because I’m a minor. I know o have some issues but I’m scared of going and them telling me I’m fine and that it’s in my head.",24Apr2020,1

702,"Dear r/advice, i need your advice (allow this joke mods, I just thought of it :D)

I am a final year undergraduate student studying geography and I am a week away from the biggest deadline of my degree. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*Incoming more of the geography specific section\*

I am looking at how land cover has changed since 2000 in Thimphu, Bhutan (the tiny little speck of a country you can find between India and China). Since its a very small country, not much work has been done recently (The last academic paper I saw on land use change in thimphu was from 2007) on land-use change in the city and I thought it would be cool to do some research on my city. To keep it as simple as possible, I need to use satellite imagery and carrying remote sensing and GIS processes on it to determine the land-use change patterns. It has taken me around 2 months to do all my data processing because 1) I have never done analysis like this before and I am not familiar with the programs 2) Since I have to work off campus, I have had a lot of problems with the software and licensing, internet/computer issue. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have recently finished my data analysis and all the land cover change statistics but I found out that all the stats which I have produced are very very much wrong. I have followed the methodology which was used by researchers in the field and I have done a lot of reading up on the processes on remote sensing. From what I have deduced is that the quality of data I was using was just not great for the type of analysis. (My results say that there has been minimal urban growth, when infact the city boundaries have tripled between 2000 and 2019)  This is quite out of my hands as the data I have is the best I can get non-commercially, which I have been told by the geospatial division of the National Land Commission back in Bhutan. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a bit overwhelmed to say the least. As soon as I discovered it, I did inform my dissertation advisor and I am still waiting on a response from her. What I am thinking of doing and what most of my friends have told me is to include all of the results which I have so far and then in the discussion section, just talk about what went wrong and offer explanations as to why my data was incorrect. I think that is the most logical solution, but I am still quite worried. I think that me not being able to produce the correct results will come off as me being lazy and not putting in the time and effort to this research. Many papers which have carried out land cover analysis in Thimphu have been able to produce the expected results and the fact that I have not been able to reproduce similar results is making me very very worried.

&amp;#x200B;

so r/advice, i know the best thing to do is to wait for an answer from my supervisor which I am doing atm. Is my dissertation less valuable because I haven't gotten the proper results? is there a chance that I fail my degree because I haven't carried out the methodology properly? am I overthinking? are you all staying safe during this pandemic?

I apologize in advance for my grammar. Poor mental health has caused me to perform poorly at everything. Although I've never been diagnosed with anything I'm sure I have some severity of anxiety/depression or who knows what.

So I'm jobless because the stupid coronavirus had to hit at the best time, I'm living with my parents, and I'm failing college with the risk of losing a scholarship and I may have to pay back and I haven't told them. I have practically no friends and I don't even get along with a big part of my family. I feel like I'm alone and needy of love which I hate to admit. I'm pathetic. The worst is I've been just watching movies and jerking off to porn almost daily for the past year. I was good at highschool back then because I never put in effort and was able to pass all my classes fairly easy. Fast forward a coue years later College classes are very difficult. Dropped all of them and now feel guilty and ashamed. 

WTF do I do know? This is coming from someone who had big goals and expectations for myself. I saw myself above the average person and the rest of the crowd but now I'm worst than your tipical Joe. I barely take care of my body, sleep deprivation, bad sleeping habits, sometimes I overeat and others I don't have any hunger. I don't shower, or brush my teeth, or wipe my ass after taking a shit but sometimes I do to stop people from thinking otherwise. I use the same clothes amd bla bla bla.

what now? I don't know what to do and sometimes I think about ""what would happen if I were to die"" I know that's not an option I like. There are many things I want to do but my motivation and energy is below the rug. Sometimes my brain thinks about the easy way out (suicide) but I come to my senses and calm down.

I'm a teenage girl, I weigh 14.5 kg less than the average for my age. I'm on the 2nd percentile. I've never been a big eater since I was little, but when I got to about year 4 I began to worsen. I think it's because people always used to compliment how skinny I was. I wanted to stay that way. Or maybe I just can't eat. I used to skip breakfast, throw away my lunch. I got caught and punished badly. It didn't make me eat better. I just hid the food better. 

We had to eat in a hall with the whole school, it stank of fish and nuts and baked beans, three things I hated. (baked beans make me throw up  and  I just don't like the others). Eventually I was allowed to eat in the library with friends instead. I began to eat about half my lunch.Still no breakfast 

 Then I went to secondary. There were no dinner ladies to tell my parents, and there were plenty of easy to access bins. I haven't eaten all of my lunch ever at school since j joined secondary. I don't eat breakfast on school days usually either. But I'll put a little cereal in the bowl so my parents think I did. (I'll have to remember to not let them see my reddit ever!) I've been trying to put on weight so I always eat a bit of lunch or a snack

On weekends, I eat lunch because I have to. there's nowhere to throw it away without being caught. I usually eat breakfast (unless i can get away without) but i refuse to eat it with people. Since I was little I've always eaten my dinner. 

But I have a rule to help me put on weight. I don't want to be too skinny. I always eat at least two meals on weekends (I'm including this corona lockdown as weekend) so that I a don't get in trouble and b am eating. 

but yesterday I forgot to eat breakfast and lunch. I had no appetite for pudding after dinner, which is a rarity so usually I love it. I felt full and sick at the end of the day. Today I had a small breakfast, half my lunch, a small (tiny) snack and my dinner. But I'm worried I'm going to stop eating again.

I should have known it was too good to be true but I’m young(18) desperate, and don’t have a job right now. I told him to break down how this would work, and nothing sounded illegal or that suspicious to me at the time. He said money would be put in my account and it would come from them. Once it’s in my account we would split it. He also told me that he didn’t need my bank info which put me more comfortable for some reason. He only asked for my name and address so I gave it to him thinking nothing of it. A few days go he picked me up with another dude and gave me a check for $2700. It looked really legit with my name and address and even had a signature from someone on it. Now because I literally never use checks I had no idea people could write whatever the fuck they want and cash it without ever having the money. So they drive me to my local bank (because I dont even have a car) and I deposit the check unaware of what a bad check even is. The bank teller deposited the money into my account after two days. The same day the money was in my account, the dude on snap hassled me to immediately withdraw the money from my bank in cash so they can get their “cut”. We go to my bank and withdraw the cash no problem. Keep in mind this is 3 whole days after I deposited the check and the bank still didn’t tell me there was anything wrong with the check. When I get the cash they basically rob me for it leaving me with nothing. If that wasn’t bad enough, later that day I get a call from my bank FINALLY telling me the check is bad and that my account is negative and I could risk charges. However, if I could get the money back there wouldn’t be any issues. They couldn’t tell me this BEFORE I got robbed for the cash I need to clear my name?!?

715,"Let's start from the beggining. I was an usual teeneager from Russia, I learned in a normal school, my biggest hobby and passion were videogames, and I had the dream, of becoming a game developer. I read books about programming during school breaks and my free time, also I tried to create somethimg in Unity, but I've never finished a single project. When i was 16 my problems started. I became unable to attend all the classes, after 4 classes i just felt totally tired and just waited in a corridor. Principal insisted on me going to home education.

I've found an Internet school. But my willpower wasn't enough to complete all the tasks, so focused on my profile subjects and barely touched others. Sometimes I recieved some tests on paper from my normal school, but I managed with them using the Internet. Final exams were only about my profile subject, so I've passed them succesfully. During my online school education I was spending all of my willpower on it, I didn't have any more for game development.

Now I'm 18 and learning at the online game development courses. It looks like that courses are desighned for working people to study at the evenings(2 2hr lessons in a week + homework), but for me it's the main occupation. I've tried do do something else, such as making my own projects (none of them were finished), videoblogging (I always was giving up during scenario creating or voicing), freelancing (i tried to get at leat one job for me, but failed), but I couldn't force myself to do it for a long time. I still spend all of my willpower on learning (but even with it I sometimes skip my homework).

The problem is that when I start doing my homework, or working on a project that I abandoned some months ago, or any work, I feel strong disgust to what I'm doing. I can't resist it for more than 10 minutes, so I just give it up and go play some videogames, watch YouTube, browse Reddit, etc. Sometimes I am productive and can do my homework for example, but this is really rare.

So my productivity is really low, I feel shame, because I had great ambitions of becoming great game dev, of making the world better(my abitions are not limited by videogames, I also want to contribute to organizations, that want to make the world much better, such as Project Venus), but I just can't beacuse I'm too lazy.

Almost all day I'm procrastinating: playing games, watching videos and movies, browsing the Internet. I wan't to do something great, something useful, but I just can't overcome myself.

716,"I'm not even sure how to write this. This is difficult to explain and talk about because I (F, 20) haven't really opened up about it to anyone close to me. I also feel embarrassed to talk about it.. which I'll explain in a moment. 

Throughout my life, I've had this really vague, hazy memory from summer camp when I was very young. The only two things I can really recall from this memory is being backed into a corner by boys at the camp and one of them taking off their pants to expose their penis. I've just walked around with this memory for years.. feeling weird and uncomfortable about it, trying to figure out if it even happened, wondering *was it a dream? where did this memory come from?* At this summer camp too, I remember being extremely close to one of the older boys at the camp that sometimes acted as camp counselors to the younger kids. Maybe he was about 13 or 14? My parents always told me that I was his favorite camper and I was always with him when they went to pick me up (it was just an all-day camp, not overnight) and that I had a ""crush"" on him. 

Almost a year ago, I ate too much of a THC edible and was just having an anxious high. I was with my best friend and my cousin. I don't remember a lot of what happened, but they later filled me in. I just remember having this brief, vivid flashback. Like I was there again. I remembered the camp and the counselor and the boy/s. I remembered them touching me and making me touch them. It felt so real during the flashback, the panic felt so real. I started sobbing. My best friend and my cousin kept saying that I kept telling them that the camp counselor touched me.

Since that vivid flashback, I've been trying not to think about it but it's really been on my mind a lot the last few months. I have struggled with an anxiety disorder and depression for most of my life and sometimes those anxious thoughts flare up and remind me of the flashback and it makes me feel disgusting and sick to my stomach. I haven't told anybody else. I feel so embarrassed because I can't even really remember it so I feel like I have no right to even be so distraught about it. 

During my life, I also feel uncomfortable viewing myself in a sexual way unless I am very, very close to my partner. Sometimes intimacy gives me this panicked, sick feeling in the pit of my stomach and I don't know why. I also feel very attached to my childhood things. Comfort items that I can't let go of. Sometimes I feel like I can't move past my youth... like I am stuck in this in-between and my mind won't allow me to move forward... like something is holding me back. I feel so frightened. 

I just don't know what to do. I feel pathetic and embarrassed, to be honest. I am staying with my parents for a long time due to the virus and I want so badly to talk to my mom about this but I don't even know how to begin.",24Apr2020,1

723,"We’ve been friends since high school and we’ve always been very close and always shared interests and hobbies and hung out all the time. We’ve been the closest people to each other for so many years. 

We’d got into doing music together for awhile and we would make songs together and put it out there but we never really did enough with it. We were directionless and didn’t have the drive to get anything competent out of it. 

He reconnected with someone he roomed with at college and was the butt of every joke and I’d hear all these cringe stories from when they lived together but apparently he ended up being a successful salesman &amp;  into influencer culture and has a lot of money and hanging out with him and seeing how much money he had has changed my friend and now he thinks he’s amazing. He even said he kinda hated how successful he turned out to be. 

Over the past year and a half or so he’s been getting into being financially successful. Every time I saw him he had a new dropshipping idea and he would ramble about his new interest in investing in the stock market. I always thought it was cool and interesting even though at times it seems he was shoving it down my throat and giving unsolicited financial advice. 

I started suspecting that even though he loved me he just thought I was a loser. I’m not business/success oriented and don’t make that much money. He would make backhanded compliments like “it’s actually respect that you’re living in the moment and have no plan or something to fall back on” 

Last month he told me he was done with music and he’s selling some gear and he’s more into photography now (also the successful guys hobby) and it made me sad because I liked playing with him and I felt like we lost something we had together but I understood we all change and get into new things. 

Now it seems like he doesn’t really like talking to me anymore and he’s been promoting the influencer friend on his Instagram and I feel like I’m just being jealous and petty and I understand that sometimes people in your life might hold you back and you can outgrow friends. I’m not mad at my friend but he got too caught up in the ego of success to even value me as a friend.

Am I just being petty and he’s moved onto better things in life or is he being egotistical?",24Apr2020,1

She also has a kid and we’ve kept that aspect of the relationship for the future, should there be one. But after all this I don’t think I want that future with her and upon realizing this it’s made my chest feel like it weighs three times as much because she and I both love each other a lot but we can’t seem to see eye to eye very often and I don’t think this is going to work out anymore.

also, during this quarantine we have phone sex a lot like masturbate together and stuff, sexting etc and when i’m about to cum he ALWAYS leaves like “im going to the bathrom i need to cum” and many other reasons and im really sick of it. i have been acting weird with him because i am really really sad and he asked me to promise him it was not because of him and i did, i am very ashamed to talk to him about this and im afraid he will freak out if he finds out my promise was false and stuff, he really really hates lies.

735,"Hi, I’m (19F) currently attending community college and live at home with my mom and younger sister. I absolutely loved this situation until some people decided to ruin my life and reputation. I feel absolutely hopeless and helpless and reverting back to negative habits I thought I left. 

My friend (22F) who also attends the same college as me is actually a year ahead and is transferring to a University in the fall. We met this year and became super close (she was the first person I told when I got hospitalized) and she suggested I move out with her and her boyfriend (I’m good friends with him) and we all get an apartment. She’s going to a University about 4 1/2 hours away from home so it isn’t too bad. The hopeful plan is I move out there, finish my time at this community college online, and transfer to the same University (I actually love the University and was considering transferring there anyways). 

I was super excited but now I’m just not sure if I should. I’m scared to leave my mom and sister, but honestly who wouldn’t be? I feel as though people “rely” on me at this college but that’s also part of the reason I want to move out. I’m only 19, but feel as though this life isn’t really mine. It’s for everyone else, but me. I don’t want to return on campus to this community college once everything is safe again. I don’t wanna see majority of the people I used to. I don’t feel safe there, but I can’t just live my life away at home. 

Also, all the people I pretty much feel safe around at that college are moving away and transferring in the fall so I would be alone. I could just tough it out, but I know me and I know my mental health. I want to get better, but I don’t know if I can while living here. 

So reddit, should I move out?

TLDR: I don’t feel safe in my town anymore and I have an opportunity to leave but I’m unsure if I should take it or just tough it out and wait.",24Apr2020,1
736," This may be a little long so excuse me for that but once you see the situation you'll agree all the details needed to be covered for one to understand. Basically me and this girl met online 4 years ago and started talking. We would message each other every single day like it was a routine and clearly were into each other and still are. We still continue to talk everyday to this day and I don't see signs of it slowing down. The longest stretch of time we went without contacting each other was a two month period where I decided we needed to cut each other off because we were so obsessed with each other but we both had partners in relationships. We have both had multiple partners during this 4 year time period but still continued to talk to each other like we were dating. Whenever we tried to stop talking it would only last a few days at best except for the 2 month period I mentioned earlier. We love each other but also realized that it was toxic to keep this up, the last time we took one of these ""breaks"" was about 6 months ago. Keep in mind we have never actually met each other in person. I know I feel like an idiot for not asking her out all those years ago but how was an 8th grader supposed to just run off to meet some girl, and it would have been even harder to do this with each of us having a partner. She lives about an hour and a half away from me so it's not like the drive would be ridiculously long. We have never told any of our friends about the other which is the main reason why I'm asking for help on here. When I tell you I vibe with this girl differently I mean it's almost like we were made for each other, I'd go as far to say I'm pretty sure this is my soulmate, especially after whats been going on for the last month. Over the course of the last month we've really been keeping up with each other and not just texting but 4 hour long phone calls that end when we see the sunrise and realize how much time has passed. I loose track of time very easily when spending time with this girl which to me is a sign that we're both more into each other than ever before. Just this past week we've had three calls the shortest of which was 4 hours and a half. So although I love her more than any other girl I've met by far and I know how she works and who she is, we're still not together. Although I'm not exactly proud to admit this but I've had a girlfriend for the past 10 months and she's had a boyfriend for the past 8 months. I feel bad for doing all this behind her back, it's not like it's cheating but it still feels somewhat wrong. We've been doing this for so long though that it just feel natural to us to talk everyday and we feel extremely comfortable with each other. My current girlfriend and I will be going to two different universities at the end of summer and it's very likely that we will break up, her school is 8 hours away and after 10 months I've realized she's not the one I want to spend the rest of my life with. This girl's boyfriend also goes to a different university than she does and next year we'll be a two hours drive away from each other with her up in Winchester and myself down in Richmond. Now you may be thinking well if shes been talking to you this whole time behind her boyfriends back whats to say she won't do the same to you? To which I would say we've been talking for four years and I know this girl is not a hoe, she's so down to earth and simple that she doesn't even have any social media as a 19 year old teen living in America, and let me tell you those are few and far between these days. I'm tired of having her so close to my heart but yet so far at the same time, so my question is what should I do? Thank you so much for reading if you got this far, I appreciate it and would be thankful for some objective perspectives.",24Apr2020,1

I find it really hard to be natural when i speak danish and show my personality. 
My family sometimes laugh at my danish and even though i know it’s just tiny jokes and meaningless comments, it really hurts and i always tear up and have to go to the bathroom to try and not cry and embarrass myself.

738,"Hello. I’m 17 and I’m quite certain I have Pure OCD. I’ve never been diagnosed nor have I told anyone about it, but the symptoms all line up and I’ve been experiencing it for about 3 years.

I’ve always been obsessed with the idea of beauty and appearance and I often compared my own look to others (I’m better looking than that person, that person’s better looking than me, etc). My brain always used to judge the appearance of everyone. Eventually it started doing it with guys, which made me think I was gay for a short period. 

And then it started doing it with young kids in my school. If I walked past a ‘good looking’ kid my brain would point it out to me. This terrified me. I started to get awful thoughts telling me I was a pedophile and there was something wrong with me. I thought the ability to tell if a kid was objectively good looking or not made me a pedophile and i felt really awful. Obviously I’m not a pedophile and I’m not attracted to kids in any way, and none of the thoughts are sexual but it’s still such an awful feeling. 

This started in January and since the lockdown began its gotten much worse. I just want to sleep all the time because my thoughts are so terrifying and make me feel so awful during the day. It’s gotten to the point where if I see a kid on TV or online I’ll just get an awful sinking feeling in my stomach and I’ll get really nervous because I’m scared of what thought will come next. I think about getting the thoughts so much that sometimes the thoughts don’t even come. 

It’s such an awful feeling and I wouldn’t wish it on anyone. I know from a logical standpoint I’m obviously not a pedophile, but there’s still a little voice in my head saying ‘yes you are’. Obviously I’d never hurt a child and hearing about those kind of crimes make me feel sick.I’m scared of my own mind and I feel very guilty because of my thoughts. I haven’t been truly happy and optimistic about the future in months.

What can I do to make these thoughts go away? I just want to be happy and guilt free again. I was thinking of therapy but the nearest one who specialises in OCD is £90 an hour, and the whole country is in lockdown for god knows how long so I’m not if therapy is an option for now",24Apr2020,1
739,"My bfs brother is probably one of the worst people I have ever met. I don't say this lightly because I genuinely like to give people the benefit of the doubt, but recently I've gotten so fed up from his behavior to myself and my bf. For context, bf and I have a healthy long distance relationship. But we've been managing to see eachother for a week once or every other month. 

Let's call this brother ""Jeff"". Jeff is the kind of person who believes the louder he yells the more right he is. I don't think he has ever sat down with me to talk, or even tried to get to know me. Whenever he has an issue he goes straight to yelling right off the bat. 

To start things off when I met my bf (25) his brother (22) was living with him, rent free and basically taking up space, having multiple guests and partners over regularly, and still being very rude to my bf. Unforeseen circumstances happened and bf had to move out, so both proceeded to live back at home with their mother. Since then, the brother now has a gf who also lives with all of them. My bf originally didn't like Jeffs new girlfriend but tolerated her because it was the nice thing to do. However, whenever a dispute happened clearly they would both end up egging him on and teaming up against him.

 Jeff and his GF don't do much except smoke everyday for most of the day and only the GF has a job. Neither are in school and they stay at home for most of the day. They would consistently mock and belittle my bf in many ways despite BF being in med school, having a job and being out of the house most of the day. Some of the things Jeff does  but not limited to are; taking up all the internet specifically during BFs free time, not cleaning up after himself, when the mom is away going out to buy groceries only for themselves and hiding the credit card so that BF can't get food for himself, stealing clothes, bad mouthing me....etc.

When my bf told me about all the negative things happening and how they treat him. I told him he should stand up for himself, and since he's been standing up for himself Jeff says hes ""being such a bitch, your girlfriend has a shitty influence on you"". 

Aside from the things Jeff has done to BF, heres a list on what ""Jeff"" has done to me in chronological order (important): 

1. When I couldn't get ahold of BF before we were official he snapped me and said he would get BF if I were to send ass pics, only then would he get him. (kept asking many times) then tried to flirt with me saying ""I can treat you better than BF"" (not an uncommon occurrence apparently)
2. Tried to keep my BF and I apart for the first month of our relationship
3. Barged in on us sleeping at 6 am yelling at the top of his lungs because he was fighting with someone and needed BF to ""fix it for him"" (was not a serious issue at all) apologized with ""Sorry, I forgot you were here""
4. When he was yelling loudly at BF for being a liar I said calmly to him ""yelling isn't going to solve anything"" he screamed at the top of his lungs ""Shut up, you're a fucking child""
5. When I told their family I was cooking dinner that night ( also told them what I was making), I spent 4 hours slaving and cooking an authentic chinese dish i learned from my grandfather (yes I am half Chinese) when I finally finished he looked at it said ""I'm not hungry"" then proceeded to eat snacks and avoid the food (it was chow mein and  rice with chicken and tofu).
6. During a game of Cards Against Humanity he said something really racist and kept interrupting any of the females talking. I was fed up with his shit and made a remark of something like ""you never listen to any of the females anyways so whats the big deal"" which ironically he didn't hear and then called me out for it

All of which (except for 1,2) has happened in the past 3 months over the span of MAX 12 days...

The issue is now hes taking issue 6. and saying that I ""disrespected him"" and is using that as his sole ammunition against me when he did all of those previous things and is still attacking my BF on the daily.  I honestly don't feel comfortable under the same roof has him when I visit. 

We're waiting until BF can move out but that takes time and money. So until then I don't want to be walking on eggshells around Jeff when anything I do could set him off into an explosion. 

**I need advice on either how to deal with him, or how to handle this situation because I really cannot anymore.** 

TLDR; how to i deal with my BFs brother who's sole character trait is to yell and argue for any reason whatsoever.

Thanks in advance. Theres so much more I couldn't add but I hope this gets the point across.",24Apr2020,1
740,"Backstory, my guy and I have been going through a rough patch for the past few months. I've been deciding if I want to stay in the relationship. We live together and I think I'm happy most of the time. 

I'm getting my wisdom teeth removed in 2 weeks. It makes sense for him to drive me there and back. I mentioned my best friend doing it and he seemed very hurt. Especially since we are trying to bounce back. 

With that being said, I am terrified that when I get sedated I am going to tell him how I have been feeling lately. Which is not the time to do it. 

is this a genuine concern I should be having? Sometimes when I smoke I talk myself in a upward spiral.  I don't know if they sedate me to the point where that would happen, when I come out of it.

741,"So recently ive been feeling like i need to find some inner peace and i just don't know how to do that. The best way i can describe it is that on one hand i can say that im a very social, open, hardworking, talented person. I acknowledge that i deserve good things in life, no self pity here. I take care of myself, my work, my family, my partner. I go with the flow, i got it all under control. Im the person people open up to and the person who sorts it all out. On the other hand I am a deeply insecure person. I can't relax, i feel out of place, i think every other person is better than me and thus I don't deserve what i want. In every situation in life. I know thats irrational but thats how i feel sometimes. I feel like im carrying everything on my shoulders and people in my life expect me to be strong. I tried opening up about it but i get the generic- you are great, you are strong. But i don't feel like it no matter how positive i tried to be. I feel like i have to please people in my life otherwise they will turn away. I tried doing my way for a while but people just say ""im moody, angry, got an issue"" where i just choose to do something else instead. Its very exhausting. I have this huge storm inside that no one knows about and i carry it with me every day. I think this cycle of building myself up and then knocking myself down really takes its toll. Because no matter how well i do, someone else is doing it better, nicer. I don't know where this stupid need to please people comes from but i cant do anything about it.

743,"My dad has been smoking since I was \~7. He has a habit of quitting, then going back. He also drinks frequently, mostly some vodka every night.

He's also overweight and has anger issues. So that's another problem.

744,"Am I in the wrong?
(sorry for the weird setup and mess ups i haven't been on reddit in ions) 
hello reddit! before I get started I would like to say that this reddit post is very serious and I only want serious replies. I tried this a year or two ago and many people thought i was faking and i didn't get any help. (This is going to be a pretty long post btw) i've tried this in the past and got manny comments about faking for attention so if you think i'm faking then click away and don't give hate. i'm just trying to get second opinions on a personal matter.

I'm a 13yo girl  and i struggle with mental illness, and I feel the way my mom treats me isn't fair and i feel like i'm in the right for thinking she's a bad mom. 
some background and my reasoning as to why i think so - as a young child i was raped by a family member and sexually abused by the family member and and a brothers friend and as a result I suffer from ptsd (diagnosed by a physiatrist) I also suffer from depression (also diagnosed by physiatrist but for the most part unrelated to the rape). I did a good job of hiding it for the most part until I was 11 years old i got in with the wrong crowed (note: everyone i was friends with was fifteen+, I was smoking weed/eating edibles often, and i mentally acted older than my age cause trauma and my surroundings)and I eventually got involved with a very abusive person and i was physically hit by them(they were 16) and they constantly isolated me from other people, made me feel insecure, and peer pressured me into weed ( not saying weed is bad or i'm against it but as an 11 yo it was not good for me at all as my brain was and still is developing and i now have small memory problems) I did online school and lived with my dad at the time  who was always in his room sleeping or smoking weed and my brother hated me at the time so the only person I had was the abusive person. I eventually tried to kill my self via overdose and was (obviously) unsuccessful.
 a few months after my attempt i got into trouble with my family and had a breakdown and explained everything that's happened to me to them (minus the weed cause they would beat my ass lmao) (note- the reason i had not told my mom or dad any of this is because when my older brother had tried to kill himself my mom yelled at him that he was doing it for attention so i thought she would react the same (big suprise  she did) and my dad was always asleep and i didn't want to annoy him +other reasons not that relevant that would just make this post a lot longer)  my mom that night didn't believe i had been raped and the only reason she finally believed me was because (thank god) one of my brothers had accidentally saw the family member raping me but was to young to know what was happening so he didn't say anything at the time but my mom called him and he told her what he saw. i started going to therapy every week for my depression, where i mention hearing voices and seeing things that aren't there (very common with severe depression) my therapist told my i have severe depression (later confirmed by a physiatrist) and that i needed to go to the mental hospital. when my mom was informed of this she was calm but as soon as we got into the car to go pack my stuff she started screaming at me for faking hearing voices and hallucinating and shit like ""is this what you think happens to people with trauma?!!!"" like??? sorry for shit i can't control???? i was sent  to the mental hospital did my time there for two weeks and was overall better and i come back home on medication 
the rest of this is from 12-13 
here are instances of my mom doing/saying stuff that i think makes her a bad mom 

- in seventh grade I accidentally broke my backpack and when my mom found out she started screaming at me for wasting her money (keep in mind we are middle class and are in no way hurting for money and we live a little more than comfortably) I can't handle being screamed at let alone screamed at so i start quietly crying while she keeps yelling at me
now i don't know what's up with this lady but she loves to say everyone is playing victim 
her words (and i quote) ""stop playing the victim!!!""oh i need pills! i need therapy""""
who says that to their child for having depression???? especially when it runs in the family????
- another time when she found out i was self harming she told me i was faking  if for attention and then told me how to properly kill myself if i really wanted to die that badly.
that's just straight fucked up.
- she also makes passive aggressive comments about my sexuality and how i don't like boys (i'm pan and have a boyfriend) 
- she loves to paint me as the inconsiderate and mainpitive one 
i have a trans friend who is figuring out his name 
my mom knew him by his first name but he recently changed it so i called him by his new name my mom asked why he goes by that now and i told her because he wants to and then she asked me if i was making him go by that name
wtf???????
another time i blew up on her for how she treats me and my brother and she told me i was being selfish and inconsiderate of her feelings and when i listed all the horrible things she's done to my brother and i she said she had taken a headache pill and that's why she said we were faking it ( keep in mind all of this stuff is scattered through years so she just so happen to coincidently taken that same pill all of those times wich somehow cause her to scream at us for faking mental illness) she then started saying stuff like "" oh i'm such a horrible mother and you hate me and i know that when you move out you'll abandon me and you'll never talk to me again! i know how hard it is to be a teenager with a horrible mom and i'm just so hard on you!"" which is manipulation if i've ever seen it 
my therapist quit in the middle of last school year ( when i was twelve) and my mom promised she'd find a new therapist but i'm about to be fourteen in the summer and i still don't have a therapist ( i understand around this  time because of covid but you'd think in all of that time she would've found a therapist) 
- one time when i flinched because she moved to fast she sarcastically said sorry
she also gets angry at me for not opening up to her but when i have she screams at me for doing it for attention (which is why i fucking hate people who say i'm doing this for attention because it's honestly really fucking hard to deal with her,trauma, depresion and suicidal thoughts while people say i fake it)  and anytime she talks to me about my feelings or anything personal i start crying and she gets angry at me because i shouldn't be so upset at her for anything because she said sorry and she said  took a headache pill so it's not her fault she acted that way those times 
she always says i'm such a selfish horrible person but doesn't she realize WHO FUCKING RAISED ME???? DOESNT THAT SAY ANYTHJNG ABOUT HER?????
when i brought that point up to her she gets upset at me because my dad raised me too 
but that's not true because i've lived with her all of my life except for two years when i moved to my dads to get away from her but had to come back because he couldn't handle me  properly and when i was switched to  my dad during those years or weekends i visited him he only knew how to buy my love and i rarely saw him and i still rarely see him

recently it's just been comments i'm not comfortable with it and touches (slapping my ass despite it making be uncomfortable) 
anyways what this all boils down to is that i'm not comfortable around her at all and i honestly don't love her 
it makes me feel like a horrible person because minus these events she's a decent mom who give me a house and food and i  have a phone and stuff but i just can't love her 
i hate hugging her or saying i love you to her because it makes me so uncomfortable 
i've recently develope really bad anger issues 
and i mean bad 
im very good at not taking my anger out on anyone but it's very unhealthy and it's caused because how much my mom pisses me off on a daily bases 
two  instances of how bad my anger issues have gotten are (i have a screen time limit) one time i requested fifteen minutes on pinterest and when she didn't approve it right away i started throwing things in my room and got very close to screaming my lungs out which is not like me at all  (this literally happened last night) 
i've also started having very violent thoughts about my mom( and i mean very very violent( like murder level violent)) which also is  not like me at all 

i just want second opinions on my situation. 
I know the thing she's done isn't okay but besides that i feel like i'm in the wrong because of how i feel about her.  what do y'all think?",24Apr2020,1
745,On my other post here it explained everything but I need some advice right now. Just recently as I’m typing this my mom just left the house with a man. I have her phone location so I thought “Oh I should track her” but she left her phone in the house. Now I’m concerned she’s gonna leave me and my sister. I’m 15 and my sister is 25. She’s been acting strange a while ago. Now I’m concerned about her. What do I do? What worries me is that she didn’t take her phone with her and she just left with this man me and my sister don’t know. I need some advice on what to do if she doesn’t come back.,24Apr2020,1
746,"All of my recent past relationships have a lot of emotion, especially anxiety on my end. I feel stressed a lot but, when we break up, I feel empty and I just don't care. It never used to be like this.

I do have ADHD and a lot of severe anxiety and depression disorders as well. I have also been diagnosed with Bipolar disorder and PTSD (Due to abuse in the past from my mother) if that helps.

748,"DO NOT READ THIS IF YOU'RE AROUND YOUR FAMILY OR IF YOU'RE ABOUT TO EAT. Yeah... so this is kinda embarrassing. I've only had a femdom fetish for a little over a year now, but ever since schools shut down it's been getting exponentially worse (pun not intended). It used to be relatively mild but during the past few months it's gone completely ballistic. Before I used to study like 6 hours every day at minimum, but nowadays I only manage to study like 1-2 hours at best because I can't stop daydreaming about new scenarios and fantasizing about them for hours on end. For example, yesterday I spent like 5 hours just lying in my bed and fantasizing. I wasn't even fapping or anything. I was literally just lying there and imagining myself being humiliated and tortured to near death by powerful women. It's like I can't concentrate at all anymore. And it's not just the intensity either, the actual nature of my sexual daydreams has gotten significantly worse. Before I just fantasized about relatively mild to moderate abuse, but now I fantasize about being humiliated and tortured in ways that would most definitely lead to death irl. I feel like my grades this period are gonna be much worse than they usually are because of this. It's strange because I can pretty much pinpoint the day it started getting to where it is now. It started about 5 days after schools shut down so I'm guessing the lack of social interaction might be playing a role? I feel disgusting.",24Apr2020,1
749,"So I live in an apartment building with 3 other units. There is one main door to the house and I am at the bottom floor, and my apartment door is right beside the building main door. 
My boyfriend has got this weird vibe from one of the neighbors since we moved in even though he hasn’t ever talked to him so idk why. 

Since this whole quarantine thing, I set up my treadmill again and started using it. It’s located in my house beside a window and straight across from my apartment door. My apartment door has a little window at the top of it, and I have a thin (see thru) curtain over it. 

I was just on my treadmill and noticed something by my window so I happened to glance out of it and seen the guy was standing out there looking around my window like he had just looked in it or something... so I was like wtf maybe he is looking for something idk. Continued what I was doing. Then he walked in the building door and went straight to my apartment door, and looked in through the small window. I could see him through my thin curtain and his face was so close to the window that his hat was probably touching it. Since my treadmill was straight across from the door I basically was looking right at him, he turned real fast and went back up to his apartment.

So I’m pretty creeped out. Idk what I’m supposed to do about that... my bf will probably go off because he already doesn’t like the guy, which could cause problems...but this guy has lived here a long time and Idk if telling the landlord will do anything. She might not believe me or something. He mows for her and stuff all the time so I think they are good friends, at least for being tenant and landlord. Can I have some advice on what I should do in this situation? Thank you.",24Apr2020,1
750,"I don’t need medical advice (other than maybe if using this arm will make it worse).

Basically, I’m 18 and it’s the last quarter of my senior year of HS and this pandemic has left me swamped with work. I’m currently on Ativan which has wiped out any trace of anxiety or fear which has made getting motivated to get stuff done, even more difficult. 

My problem is, from some sort of issue with posture (I think it had to do with my bed frame and not enough pillow), I’ve injured my neck and my entire left arm and hand feel like this deadweight that’s achy, sensitive, and weak. I’ve been trying to use my right hand as much as possible, but my left hand is my dominant hand and I need to write things with a pen and paper for classes as well as type etc. 

The pain varies. The whole arm constantly feels not quite right and like it’s damaged or something, but it’s most painful at night, so I can sort of do stuff during the day. The problem is, I don’t want to make it worse. I think it’s referred pain from my neck but I think also using my phone has made my hand worse and using a pen exacerbates that. 

Should I tell my teachers about it and explain I might not be able to get as much work done? I already technically have a 504 plan which says I’m allowed to turn in work late and get extensions etc (also apparently I can retake tests, have extra time, miss classes etc- I was crazy-crazy sophomore and junior year) but I feel guilty because I’m already kinda behind due to the pandemic and all the meds I take. 

I’m a straight A student, and I’m very smart so I can understand things very easily, so my teachers all like me and I’m sure they won’t mind. But I feel guilty taking a break when I’m already pretty behind. 

On the other hand I’m worried that using my hand will make it worse... it really feels like somethings wrong (at first I thought it was a heart attack because the pain was sharp and in my chest and an uneasy weak feeling radiated down my arm but now it’s just neck and arm pain and uneasy feelings-can’t describe it exactly. It feels weak and like a deadweight I guess? Idk. 

Any ideas?",24Apr2020,1
752,"(F/20) I had a panic attack on acid and since then my friend (F/21) ghosted me for no reason?


lets call her Taylor. So a little backstory I met Taylor and her roommate about a year ago, as we both moved to the same city at the same time and we all got along really great. We all hung out at least once a week, most of the time being it me and Taylor. Come around to valentines day, Taylor asked me if I wanted to trip on acid with her and her boyfriend (which ive never met before, as it was a new relationship). I agreed and was super excited.

Come to Valentines day, we all take a tab and have a good time for the most part. I gave her and her boyfriend time to themselves as she told me she was taking it mostly to see if they were really compatible and spent most of the trip painting and talking with her sober roommate. Now come to the last few hours of the trip we all go outside to smoke and I started not seeing reality. Everything around me turned to eyes looking at me and everybodys faces morphed...and me having never experienced this before start to freak out in my head. I told them I was starting to have visuals and was starting to panic, so they brought me inside and tried to calm me down but it was hard as my mind kept telling me they were judging me, etc., so I walked outside by myself to meditate and calm down. This went on for 2 hours. When the trip was finally over I told them I was having really bad visuals and couldnt put to words what i experienced..both of them haven taken lsd before understood and we all ended up deciding to go to sleep. Them going into Taylors room, I slept on the couch in the living room. With me still in a heightened/anxiety state her roommate then comes out to talk to me asking what i saw...the questioning then turned to accusing me that i was hiding something from them and i had a problem that i wasnt telling them about. Me being completely caught off guard and mad for her line of questioning just simply told her i didnt know where she was going with what she was accusing me of but I wanted to sleep, so she left and I was left trying to fall asleep while Taylor and her boyfriend were having sex in the next room and were being loud. I left at 6am as I had a opening shift at work which i told Taylor about before we had taken the tab, I didnt want to wake her up so I left without saying anything. She didnt reach out after that or tried to contact me at all...i thought it was maybe cause I didnt reach out either but when I did we had a short conversation about work and again never heard from her again. Months have passed but its still sitting with me that I dont know what happened? We go from talking and hanging out all the time to nothing, I would love some advice if i should reach out or is it even worth trying to salvage if somebody is going to switch up and not even be mature enough to tell me if i did something to offend her? any advice is helpful",24Apr2020,1
753,"Hi, 

&amp;#x200B;

Throw away account and names of places changed because I dont want to cause an issue with my family, but I need some serious advice.   


Some backstory. I live in Northland, my mom lives in Southland where we grew up, and my sister lives in Westland.   


My mom had a very rough patch six months ago, she got cancer, got fired from her job because of her cancer, and had to leave our family home of 15 years because the rent was put up too high. We shuffled money around to pay for her cancer treatment, she got it caught in time, and its mostly gone, but shes 60 and the radiation deal of it knocked the stuffing out of her.   


After she was well enough to travel, she decided to start all over again and join either my sister and I in Westland or Northland. Language and passports became and issue and she chose to go live with my sister.   


My mom has been there since christmas, has been slowly getting intergrated into the society, been for dozens of lab tests (she now has radiation induced Sjögrens Syndrome, benign breast tumours (not the original cancer) and an unknown condition causing white blood cell deficiency). My sister has been looking after her, they share a room, its been tough but they were managing.   


Throw Corona into all of this and its just got a billion times worse. My mom cant leave the house because she is immune compromised, and my sister for some reason is not coping with social isolation. Shes been cranky, yelling at my mom, threatened to kick her out to the street, saying she cant cope with not seeing her friends and finally left. Shes left my mom alone to go to parties in secret, got drunk and passed out on her friends floor, and left my mom wondering where she is, where she is going to get her food from, and who is going to take her to her next appointment at the oncology hospital.   


Im stuck over here in Northland not being able to do anything at all, its driving me mad. My sister left again and has been gone for 7 days now .She said her friend (friend with benefits, boyfriend, not my place to ask) has mental issues and needs help of his own, but my mom needs help, my sister is literally the only support at all my mom has in Westland outside of an institution, and I think family should help first if able before that route.   


Travel is banned between the countries otherwise I'd get her over here to my asap and look after her.   


Im pulling my hair out in frustration. My mom has asked me not to say anything to my sister about this because it would only make things worse in this trying time, and I've stuck to that. However she said if my sister doesnt come back tomorrow to take her to the next cancer appointment I can call her and talk to her. I dont even know what I would say, Im just so angry right now I dont think I should call her, it will make things worse.   


Im sorry for the long post and the vagueness (ive had family snoop on my reddit before and work things out from my posts). Reddit has always been a strange source of comfort and advice in dark times, I just hope you have some good advice for me please.   


Thanks!

754,"I don’t know if my brother is messing with my girlfriend on the low. (Serious Question)

I met this girl off of a tinder app the same time my brother was using it. I never had suspicions on rather my brother was talking to a female I was talking to on the low. I been dating her for 3 months now and she’s also a single mother with a baby daddy that constantly tries to get in her panties but she would decline that activity but sometimes wouldn’t tell me if he texted her on certain days. Yesterday (this Thursday)I started to get a gut feeling of my brother messing with her. We fell asleep on the phone yesterday at 11pm but I woke up to her being extra happy and energetic out of nowhere like this was something I never seen before in the mornings. She told me she was up since 8 am but didn’t know where the energy came from but she was happy. This is the same week she’s about to go to her grandmother funeral I asked her was the energy a coping mechanism she said no she just has no idea where it came from. So I think back because my guts was giving me the red flag signal she said bye to my family in the house the second time she came over my brother didn’t respond tho so she gave him another bye that was a little enthusiastic but not in a flirtatious way. The fourth time she came over when we was on our way to my car to drop her off she was standing Behind him staring on her phone as if she was waiting for me to go to a blind spot for 10 seconds then I told her the car was where I was heading and it seem like she snapped out of a thought and followed me slower than usual. This is where I start to feel the gut feeling more yesterday was one of his work days last week Thursday was aswell n we fell asleep on the phone n she disappeared early in the morning for an hour. So this is my suspicion that I caught onto this weeks Thursday. So my brothers job takes 27 mins to get to her house and takes 18 mins to get to my house. From my girlfriends house it takes 28 minutes to get from hers to my house. He said he worked from 6am to 6pm but did overtime. I was on the phone with my girl till 5:19 pm. I texted her at 5:48pm because we have life 360 and her phone was at 5% so I told her to charge it she replied thank you I’m on the phone with my auntie . So it cooled down my gutsy feeling until I texted her I love her and she texted me back 10 mins (5:58pm) later with a dryer response. I called her at 6:11pm because she still didn’t charge her phone but she wasn’t reachable at all I even FaceTimed and all. She texed me back at 6:18 saying I told my mom I was bored so she said just get on the phone . That’s when I called her she sounded like she was still in a energetic mode but a little drained. My brother came home at 6:43 pm coming from the way I usually come back home after dropping her off. Later on that day she slightly complained her lower back hurts her my brother later on that night asked me to mute her on the phone n asked me if I cheated on her. I asked him is he looking for information to tell her later he asked me what and I had to repeat myself to him again. He denies it. But my guts telling me otherwise. I just need an educated perspective on this situation. Please I need clarification.",24Apr2020,1
755,"My dog is 13, I’ve had her since she was a puppy. She probably still has 2-4 years ( shih tzu yorkie mix) left. She is by my side 24/7. The thought of leaving her is making me reconsider my college choice. I’m finishing up my application to my dream college where I have to live on campus all 4 years. No dogs are allowed. The college is a perfect fit (and I have been in constant contact with them about my late application, they are having trouble getting my transcripts) in every single way besides the fact I can’t take my dog with me. I’ve now been looking up getting an ESA (emotional support animal) recommendation just so I can take her with me, but I feel like that may not be the best decision. I definitely benefit from being around her and I take her everywhere with me but I feel like it may put me in a sort of black sheep situation, and I definitely don’t want her to hold me back socially (such as people thinking i’m weird for having an esa, won’t make many friends, etc). I don’t have any doubts about how she would behave around new people because she is a very relaxed dog and will just lay down beside me. I also don’t have any doubts about my ability to care for her since I mainly do now. My major is pretty sparse so there are not many other college options. 

I’m looking for an outside opinion on whether or not taking her as an esa would be a good idea. I keep going back and forth on the idea. I don’t want to take her away from our home but I’m the main one who gives her attention in my family.

I don’t want to abuse the esa title by getting the recommendation just so I won’t have to leave her, but I don’t know what to do. She does benefit me a ton as I don’t cope well with being alone. I’m torn at the situation.",24Apr2020,1
757,"Okay so I (17m) have a twin brother and a friend. 
Me and the friend have( had) been bestfriends since we were kids. We have spent lots of great times together. I have grown up with him. I was for him when everyone else considered him ""unpopular"". I even introduced him to my friend group and he's now good friends with all of them. 

However growing up I had also realised that he and I don't necessarily have the same point of view on many things. My liking for him began to decrease. We used to talk everyday until Grade 10 ended. 

After Grade 10, we took different subjects. However my brother and him share the same subjects and they became very good friends. We guys had stopped talking and I had stopped attending his birthday parties and all that shit. I dont think he was necessarily concerned about me cuz he literally was talking to my brother the whole day but we still weren't talking.


However during this time my brother told him something about me which I didn't want him to know. I didn't consider him a close friend now and I didn't want him to know anything about me from my brother. I also mentioned that i think he's an asshole and politely asked him to not tell him anything about me. 

Also it wasnt that i was getting to know anything about him too. We had met once at a mutual get-together and when I asked him about something about his life, he replied with a you don't know about it, forget it (everybody else at the table knew what he was talking about. This had happened just in the beginning and this made me realize things about him as a person after which my ""behaviour"" started. I dont think i had done anything to tick him off as well""

However today after 2 years he messages me and he took a few playful jabs at how i hadnt been a good friend and I didn't care (which i dont tbh). He said we'll clean this shit up after corona ends (cuz he has exams left) 

I think my brother must have said him something but i wont ask him anything cuz he'll say that to him too. Frankly i dont wanna clear out this whole thing. I'm cool with us not being good friends anymore. I dont think i want anything to do with him rn. I wanna focus on my own shit rn. Any advice on what I should do?",24Apr2020,1

761," Hey guys so I just got out of an argument with my dad. It was about applying for unemployment benefits due to the Coronavirus. To give you guys some background information, he is a traditional Chinese dad with traditional Chinese beliefs who also does not speak any English despite living in the USA for 30 years. I myself was born and raised in the USA.

So here is my rant, I have been attempting to apply for unemployment for him since March since he doesn't speak English. I've done everything I possible can since March. I've called, I've sent numerous emails, I've also faxed the unemployment department multiple times in hopes of getting the benefits for my dad, but unfortunately not a single response from them. Come this morning he puts his phone on max volume/speaker like he always does which annoys me because I am trying to sleep. He wakes me up and then tells me to eat breakfast, I wasn't really coherent when he asked me because I literally just woke up, and I'm all groggy so I didn't really reply to him. He then proceeds to lecture me on mannerism and how one should reply when asked something. I decided that I wasn't going to take his shit at that point. I replied with ""how are you going to talk to me about mannerism when you are making all this noise while I'm trying to sleep. There is no reason for you to put your phone on speaker, and if you wanted to do that go somewhere where you can't bother others"". Here's how the argument basically goes.

Dad: What so you don't want me to get my fucking benefits?

Me: I never said that. All i'm saying is that there is no reason for you blast your speaker on max volume when I'm trying to sleep, then proceed to talk about manners.

Dad: You are so fucking useless!!

(At this point I lost it, I consider myself to be very calm. I hate yelling as it doesn't get the point across. Also I feel that is it important to mention that my parents are divorced and my brother moved out for reasons such as this one)

Me: ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME!?! I ALWAYS FUCKING HELP YOU! DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA OF HOW MUCH I DO FOR YOU!? YOU THINK I JUST SIT AT THE COMPUTER AND DO NOTHING ALL DAY?? I'VE CALLED, I'VE EMAILED, I'VE FAXED THE UNEMPLOYMENT CENTER NUMEROUS TIMES!! WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT ME TO DO!! I CAN'T FUCKING GO THERE BECAUSE THEY ARE CLOSED! SO TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO!!

Dad: You, your brother, and your mom are all useless! I've lived here for 30 years and you guys have taken everything away from me! You guys are useless!!! Your mom raised you to be a piece of shit!! You fucking Americans don't know how to treat family correctly!!!

Me: \*Slams my hand on the dinner table hard AF\* YOU'VE LIVED HERE FOR 30 FUCKING YEARS AND HAVEN'T LEARNED A BIT OF ENGLISH!!!! WHO'S FAULT IS THAT!! I CAN FUCKING LEAVE RIGHT THE FUCK NOW AND LIVE WITH MY GIRLFRIEND JUST LIKE MY BROTHER DID! BUT I CHOOSE NOT TOO BECAUSE IM TRYING TO FUCKING HELP YOU. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE SHIT PEOPLE TRY TO DO FOR YOU. YOU EVER WONDER WHY TF BROTHER AND MOM LEFT!! . \*proceeds to list all the things I've done for him in since my mom divorced him\*

So yeah that's basically how the argument went down. I just hate how he doesn't understand how much I do for him. I check his bills, deal with his lawyers because of his past car accident, i translate everything for him, I literally do EVERYTHING that requires the English language. Then he calls me useless. I wish he would realize how much I do for him and I wish he would appreciate me for that. This isn't a one time thing either, it's been happening a lot more especially with this pandemic lock down.

If it matters, I'm a 22 year old Chinese American. This crap has been happening to me for almost half of my life and I am just sick of it. Any advice would be appreciated",24Apr2020,1
762,"Hi, all. As the title says, I really want to find a way for my mom to have a much higher quality of life. In short, she works three jobs and it still isn't enough to support us. Does anyone have experience with resources (in America) that could help? It's terrible for someone to have to work as much as she does, and it's not good for her long term physical health. 

For more details:

\- She estimates that she gets about $27k annually from two of her jobs (the third one is more of a side hustle)

\- Job A is full time and provides all her benefits (health, retirement, etc)

\- Job B is part time and is currently considered essential

763,"This is probably a stupid question coming from a bonafide adult in their early 30s, but this issue has caused a lot of grief in my life.

I was always a good student in school.  People called me smart and I guess I used to be.  There was never really a subject that I struggled with - I learned efficiently, I went above and beyond, and I always sought out ways to learn more.  Math and language were among my favorite subjects, and I still really enjoy studying foreign languages for fun.

The one kind of assignment I dreaded was long-term projects - papers that I was expected to work on all semester.  I managed dozens of these through high school, undergraduate, and graduate school, but it was generally a strain and required a lot of last-minute work.  Still, I finished all of my coursework with excellence.  To make a long story short, however, I never finished my master's degree because I could not for the life of me figure out how to make real progress toward writing my thesis.  I had a topic I enjoyed (an obscure but entertaining subject in the humanities), a patient advisor, and time, but I couldn't juggle all of the steps.  I'd get bogged down in the bibliography, the tyranny of the blank page, a constantly changing thesis statement, and a need to perfect page 1 before I could move on to page 2.  In the end, I had nothing to show after two years of effort and dropped out of the program with relief and shame.

I discovered in my late twenties that I enjoyed writing fiction as a hobby, and effortlessly wrote over a half-million words of epic-length fanfiction novels in two years.  For whatever reason, the hang-ups I'd had on long-term projects before didn't hold me back here and over time I became more and more comfortable breaking the mold set by canon, until the stories I was writing were fanfiction in name only.

I've gotten a fair amount of affirmation and encouragement about my writing and I'd like to make the move to an original novel, but the process has me paralyzed.  I have no idea how to begin, let alone finish, a proper book.  I can talk about my ideas all day long with my friends, but I can't wrap my head around the follow through.  It's giving me flashbacks to grad school and I'm frustrated to tears over my inability to handle this.

Complicating factors in the past ten years have been alcohol abuse (1 yr sober now) and mental health problems (diagnosed bipolar 2 in 2018, not currently taking medication).  At present, I'm stable, happy, and healthy enough, and I'd very much like to be able to use this quarantine time toward a goal rather than just spinning my wheels.

TL;DR:  Want to be a ""real"" writer, but have a mental block and a lack of focus and persistence.  How to overcome?",24Apr2020,1
764,"I'm an education major nearing the end of the semester and looking into jobs in my content area. There are a couple near ""home"" and a couple closer to where my university is and I'm torn between which area to apply in or even to apply for a teaching job. I feel like I need to apply for jobs closer to home because my mother lives mostly by herself, with my father being a truck driver and being gone for weeks at a time. I also grew to really like the area where my university is, made great connections there, and have additional family in the area, but it's a few hours away from home. I like the thought of working in that area but also feel a lot of guilt about the idea of her being mostly alone, save for visits and things. 

I'm also not 100% certain I should apply for a teaching job at all. I feel like I need to at least try it, and I've enjoyed student teaching and the experiences leading up to it but I'm afraid I'm not going to be good enough as a teacher, along with some other more personal reasons. I know I need to be applying soon if I want anything but I just feel so uncertain. Any ideas or words would be appreciated.",24Apr2020,1
765,"I am a 18F. I live with my dad full time, and I visit my mom once in awhile. I am graduating this year, and planning to work full time and then attend a college for esthetics. I am currently in quarantine so I'm studying from home and not working. I've been spending a lot of time with my dad, and it's getting very stressful. My dad is a white, conservative, evangelical Christian. While this is alright by itself, we disagree on every single thing political or not. Whether it's voting, LGBTQ+ issues, abortion, marriage, living with someone of the opposite sex, dating, friendships... He constantly fear mongers me and I have to hide everything from him (he keeps telling me that meteors or diseases are going to wipe out everyone on earth very soon, so I have to have faith.) I have never once told him about my political views. I have not come out. I just smile and nod while he goes on his discriminatory rants. My dad has anger issues, and will downgrade everything you say and make you feel like garbage for saying anything and be pissed off the entire day if you try to talk WITH him. He will not change or accept anything. He bashes my friends, family, and lifestyle constantly. I hate having to hide everything but if I'm honest I lose my home, connection, and help with my college expenses; and he will be completely alone. He doesn't have anyone else. The thought of him being by himself breaks my heart but he infuriates me and is the very cause of my anxieties. I plan to also move in with my boyfriend in the next couple years as we are serious and have been together for a long time. (He also refuses to meet my boyfriend.) He is constantly pushing his political agenda on me and I can't take it anymore. Should I start telling him how I truly feel and see what happens? Or should I hold out for a few years?

I moved in with my partner and his 2 cats this past January, we have been talking about getting a dog together for a year now.
We find a dog we are in love with and he tells me to start filling out the dog application, I am so excited and fall in love with the idea of having this pupper.
Next day he tells me it needs it to be just me paying for the dogs food and vet bills, and he can't afford both of his cats plus this dog and we should split all costs with his cats and our new dog 5050 for it to be fair. I was expecting us to pay 5050 for the dog because we would be getting it together but I don't see why I should pay for his cats that he got before even meeting me.

I'm lucky to be able to work from home and enough money saved away, but it's been hard to deal with the isolation. My employer believes the shelter-in-place order where I live will last for at least ~5 more months and has extended the work-from-home policy until then. My parents live in a neighboring city a few hours away and have been encouraging me to stay with them (traveling via car) until this blows over. I get along with them well and it's tempting, but I can't shake the feeling that this is a selfish and risky thing to do. I have minimized going outside this whole time and I've taken serious precautions when I do, but it's still entirely possible I could be a carrier of covid without knowing it.

769,"I cry like... all. The. Time. 

I cry if I get mad at my boyfriend (he basically doesn’t get mad at me but I occasionally get frustrated with him and then I cry because I’m mad at myself for getting mad), I cry if I feel like I’m not making progress with work, I cry if I feel to sedated, two seconds ago I was crying because I’ve injured my arm and I couldn’t find a good pillow for my bed. 


I cry so so so much. And it’s totally real. Not fake crying or anything, I feel the emotions and I sob and cry. 

I think I’ve cried every single day for a while. 

And I’m not depressed at all, I’m relatively very happy and after I stop crying I’m usually happy. Also I’m just not depressed. I’ve been depressed in the past and I’m not that rn. 

I do like crying. It makes me feel better. And I do supposedly have bpd which makes my emotions more intense. But like- I’ve been crying multiple times a day. Something will just set me off and I’ll start crying and then I’ll calm down and stop of course but it’s just.... a hell of a lot of crying 😂. I didn’t used to cry this much. I’m also a lot happier nowadays which makes this even more confusing but idk. It’s not like I’m always sad-crying. Sometimes it’s because I’m stressed, sometimes coz of pain, sometimes I feel overwhelmed, etc. but I just cry a hell of a lot. 

Crying does release endorphins so maybe that’s why but the increase seems weird nonetheless

There are a lot of people in my life who complain about things and all they do is complain and be lazy. Now, I'm no genius but I can say I'm somewhat successful at what I am currently doing. I reached where I am today with a lot of hard work. The same people were being lazy watching Netflix all day doing nothing productive back then. Now all they say is I'm smart and lucky. 

Is it bad to absolutely get pissed off because of them? Not only because they say the reason I'm where I am is because I'm lucky but also generally because they are literally doing nothing productive all these years. They contribute nothing to humanity. They don't improve anyone's life and are so absolutely useless. I honestly don't know why I get so pissed about that and I don't know if I have the right to be pissed about that.

Some of them come from rich families so all they do is stay home and waste their days. Maybe I'm just salty that I have to work twice as hard coming from a average family.

773,"Hi guys! So I’m going to try and keep this story as short as possible. I’m pretty much looking for the best way to ask her to leave my house without completely ruining our friendship.

About 1 year ago, my SO’s high school best friend was in a very depressing situation in San Diego that ended up with my SO offering to help him move out to Arizona with us and help him get his life together. I was fine with helping him out but this turned to him moving into our house permanently and only paying rent half of the time since he can’t keep a job. We already talked to him and he’ll finally be moving out on July 31st before our baby is born. Well, during this one year, my best friend came to visit me from San Diego as well and somehow, her and my SO’s best friend ended up hooking up and now they’re dating. About a week into their relationship, she decided that she was quitting her job in San Diego and miraculously moved into my house to live with him without even asking. 

This was a huge red flag into realizing that she was clingy and why all her relationships have never worked out. But I kept quiet, I didn’t want to kick her out because she was my best friend and I mean, what could go wrong... right? 

My SO and I bought our second home where we finally decided to start our family and we’re due in two months. His best friend and mine asked if they could move in with us and rent out a room. This was right around the time she moved into our previous residence without permission so I had no idea what it was like living with her. We said sure. They were paying $800 in rent, all utilities covered, and even let them use our washer/dryer/half the pantry/and half the fridge. 

Well this is where shit started to go downhill. She began to use our laundry detergent, our toilet paper, and everything else. Even our food. You would think that this doesn’t have to be covered when you have roommates, it’s just common sense that you buy your own shit. She is the worst at cleaning. The most unorganized dirty person I’ve ever met. She broke our trash bin rollers in the kitchen, has damaged 2-3 wooden spatulas, broke several of my wine glasses and so much more. She spills food when cooking and doesn’t clean it up. Let’s just say, you do not want to live with her ever. She’s never picked up the broom or vacuum once or cleaned their living space. Every time I walk by there all I smell is BO. It’s honestly ridiculous.

On top of this, she doesn’t work. She quit her job because apparently she was being “bullied” and hasn’t had a job since. She lives off my SO’s best friends income and he also lost his job so now I have two people in my home not paying rent and using everything in my house. It’s so infuriating.

Now to the juicy part, so my best friend is clingy. She searches this guys phone and has insane trust issues. Well, little did she come to find out that my SO’s best friend was talking to other girls on tinder. She packed her things and said she was moving out and never coming back. I thanked jesus because I finally had her gone and didn’t have to ask her to leave after proving that she’s the worst roommate to live with. WELL, the next day after her “move out” she is begging to come back and wants to work their relationship out and blah blah. So I blatantly said that it’s best that she doesn’t move back to my home for my sanity. She texted me saying “We’re back together, we’re going to work it out and I’m only going to visit him 3-4 times a week and sleep there during the day.” Like, what???

At first it was fine (although at this point I truly think she’s crazy and I no longer want to be friends with her), she’s driving one hour every morning from her brothers apartment to our house to stay with her oh-so-wonderful boyfriend and leaves around 4pm. Well now it’s turned into her living part-time in my house and hiding out in the room. We lowered the rent on this guy to $500 since she had “moved out” but now she’s just taking advantage. She’s been here since Monday and it’s now Friday. Hasn’t stepped a foot out of the room and lays in bed all day sleeping. When I clearly told her that she can’t live here anymore. 

I am speechless. Does she really think that by hiding in the room and not coming out mean that she technically “doesn’t live here”. HA. I am soooo mad. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to text her and be like, “you don’t live here anymore, so leave.” She can definitely come by and visit her boyfriend but when your fucking hibernating in my house without even asking, not paying rent, and thinking you can get away with it is just beyond me. Someone please tell me how to nicely tell her to get out of my house. I can’t do this anymore. It’s disrespectful and I’m just so stressed out.",24Apr2020,1

I have some mental health issues, but I’m a hard worker and have been keeping my shit together for a long time. I still have a job, but have been temporarily laid off from my two other jobs. I work in a male dominated industry and it has taken a lot of shit to get to where I am. The deal was that I would work the extra jobs until my boyfriend got one.

I recently just hit a wall, I’m tired and pissed with my boyfriend (He is addicted to gaming and I just do everything in the house plus bring home the bacon and sometimes I just need a bloody hug). So I got drunk one night and signed up for a sugar daddy dating website (I know this is a whole other can of worms). Found a SD that didn’t want any sex, just photos, I was like great!

I was wrong, so very wrong. It was a scam, he gave me cheque’s and asked to take out cash and buy bitcoins. Now I’m on the hook for over $8,000. I really just think I’m screwed.

775,"Okay, so I'm a reasonably young guy (29) who lives alone in a studio appartment. Across the street there's another appartment building just like ours (still being built but one studio is finished), and it's only around 15m / 50 feet from my balcony. I'm a smoker and I use my balcony around 5-10 times a day. 

So around two months ago a woman moves in across the road with her kids, straight across my balcony. She's a smoker and of course we're gonna see eachother now and then, that's perfectly fine. I've not acknowledged her or been nosy or accommodating or whatever, just pure neutral. I face to the side minding my own business. Whenever I went outside or went back in I'd catch a glimpse and she'd often (always) be sitting in front of her window in the only chair she can see me from with her blinds fully open and no window foil. Shrugged it off and didn't care at first. I thought this stopped but the next paragraph tells me she's still watching.

I started noticing she'd always come outside when I'm smoking. This was very strange as I'd only go every 2-3 hours. The first period you can shrug this off as a coinscedence but after a while you start to pay attention to it and it can get very annoying - I'd just like to take my 5 minute smoke break without someone always watching me. The only time I can go outside and not worry about her coming to watch me is in the dead of night.

Now I'm not a particularly attractive guy and don't do any interesting stuff in front of my windows or on my balcony so I think she might just be super nosy or lonely or something - but I'm losing my mind as I simply don't want her to constantly watch me.

It's been a great help just typing this out but if you guys have any tips on how to handle it it's greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading.",24Apr2020,1

Hello, I'm M, 24 years.

My Mom divorced 22 years ago, My dad isn't understanding at all.

She didn't marry, worked hard to raise me and provided me with plenty of books and investment into my education.

Now,  I'm still living with her, I make enough money for my own living, I'm  planning to marrying a very understanding and caring girl. I've been  dating her for a while now. I originally planned to get two apartments  near each other, one for me when I marry, the other one is for my mom.  She accepted this plan years before I was even in a serious  relationship, but she won't accept it now. She wants me to leave my gf.  insists that I marry ""A Virgin of her choice"". (P.S. My GF is virgin,  it's non of my business but she has been clear about her past  relationships with me, but my mom won't believe it).

Now  things Escalated, She ordered me to stop using anything brought out of  her pocket, I can't use the kitchen, I have to cook and wash for myself  (which I don't mind doing, but how the f can I cook without a kitchen or  even fire). I'm now required to be locked up in my room unless I need  to get something from the fridge (which I co-paid for it) or getting out  of the home for work/fun.

She constantly putting it as: either me or your gf.

Should I leave home? I know she loves me from inside but I can no longer keep doing this.

P.S. I live in the middle east.

TL;DR: Should I leave my single mom who is abusing me and giving me ultimatum about my gf?",24Apr2020,1

789,"My boyfriend and I have been dating for around 10 months, it’s been a blast. The beginning of our relationship was super rocky though, I won’t get into that just know it was our parents.

Im very happy with him, he’s an amazing person, very funny and smart. From the start we let each other know that we’d speak about our problems or in general anything. And honestly to still be a fresh relationship it feels like I’ve been with him for a looong time, he’s like a best friend but WAY more &amp; I cannot imagine him not being in my life.

Recently though, it’s like my head is in a constant fight. He has nothing to do with this, it’s just he came into my life in a time where I was looking for freedom and nothing serious. When I met him, it was also hard for me Becuase hes had some much more experience whilst I’ve only had 2 relationships that were ass (to say the least) We had a few talks since I didn’t know if I wanted a relationship yet. I obviously ended up staying Becuase  something within me told me to, it just felt so natural like I can tell him anything. Which that ended up being true, he’s such a non judging person that listens and cares for your opinion. i wanted to find out more about him, I found him really really  attractive as well, and I was  attached at that point. Anyway back to what I was saying, I have re accruing thoughts where I want to break up and experiment or in general be “free.” I think this is Becuase since he’s my first real relationship it’s harder than I thought sometimes, and we were at a stage where we were still getting used to each other (we are polar opposites on most things). When those thoughts happen it feels like I’ve “blacked out” and suddenly when  I “come back” and think about it the thought of being without him, seeing him with anyone else, not having him near me as my partner, it hurts a lot, I sometimes put the whole thing into perspective to just “see how it would feel” and I absolutely hate it. I feel sick. I know I feel deeply for him, it’s a feeling I’ve never felt before and I want to stay, that’s why I don’t understand where these thoughts are coming from. 

We’ve spoken about marriage, you could say it’s too soon but it’s fun to talk about, I do sometimes think “idk if I wanna marry him” but then I think “but I don’t want a life without him” ITS SO WEIRD ! I don’t see him as a friend either, I could never see him as someone I hangout with just as friends. It’s like my head wants something and my heart another. (?) 

Could this be Becuase it’s my first serious, committed, he actually treats me like a person, relationship ?? I know within myself that I love him but these thoughts are so fucking annoying and confusing. They’re not so often but with this quarantine, I miss him so much, that’s why, again, I don’t get why I think this.

What do you guys think ? Is this normal ?? Am I thinking too much??",24Apr2020,1
790,"I'm in my early 30's and recently moved back in with my parents.  I lived in a bigger city for many years and had a love/hate relationship with it, but ultimately decided to give in and move back home after making no forward progress in recent years.

I wasn't attached to that specific city, but the best friends I've had were there and there was more opportunity.  During that time I had an apartment and my own independence and personal space, and I miss that, even if my daily life wasn't better there.

Since moving back, obviously coronavirus has had an impact on the world.  But the thing is, I'm not sure the situation would be much different if it hadn't.  I didn't particularly want to return to my hometown because I didn't enjoy school or being around my classmates as a kid, and I didn't enjoy my first few years in the workforce here.  There are less places to go and less things to do here, so I feel really out-of-place.  Not that I did much before, but even for someone kind of introverted like me I think I had better chances in the city.

I now live in an area that is 2 hours' distance from any major city, and the population is smaller.  I'd hoped moving to a small town would present me with different kinds of women to date, but the women on dating apps act exactly the same as they had in the city and there are even less options.

There are less places to work here, and they don't generally pay as much money.  I keep thinking about different companies I've worked for over the years and I'm uneasy about running into a lot of the uncomfortable situations all over again.  I worked for a factory at one point and a lot of the people acted like they were really out for themselves, and I've worked in places where I had to stand my ground to gain some respect and maintain a pleasant environment.  At my current job, things have been going alright for the most part...  But I've kind of gotten that sinking feeling around some of my co-workers.

Lately I've gotten really lazy about things.  I'm also kind of scared though.  It sucks putting effort into applying for jobs and updating your resume and writing cover letters, and having to start all over again.  I don't make enough money now, so I need to make a change soon.  I'm uneasy about running into people from school, or being disliked by a whole new batch of locals.  And I really only planned on staying for a few years anyway until I can get my finances in order and figure out my next step, but I'm worried that I may have dug myself back into a pit that I got out of years ago by returning here.

I'm becoming hesitant and negative about the situation.  I miss having my own place and being somewhere that had tons of places to go just 15 minutes down the road, and pretty much everywhere had a bathroom lol.  I never intended to stay in the other city forever either, but this feels like a weird step backwards, you know?  Everything is just kind of surreal, especially with the pandemic going on right now.  But maybe the sad part is, even when this is over my life might still be the same.

Guess I'd just like some feedback and perspective.  Has anyone else been through something similar?  Is it bad that I've become so lazy and paralyzed about things?  After my life has been going downhill for so many years, I guess I have been looking at this as some time to regroup after finally putting that last chapter of my life behind me.",24Apr2020,1

792," I met her 5 years ago when I started high school and she was my classmate. In first 2 years we barely talked once or two times. It changed in last 2 years of high school. She needed help with a subject I was great at and only I knew it that well in order to explain it to someone. Eventually we started chating more over the internet. We would always start a conversation with some school related topic and change it to something casual. But in class we didn't talk much with each other(I know. Weird). I was thinking to ask her out, but we had to prepare for our final exams in order to enter university, so I decided it would be the best for both of us to concentrate on exams and make no distractions. Fast forward a year later we are both in university and we talked again over the internet a couple of times. AND THEN quarantine happened and I am overthinking this situation so much. I want to ask her out, BUT not in a romantic date way. I just want to get to know her better and hang out with her, like a friend and maybe maybe it turns out in something more. How would you ask her out to go for a drink for example after quarantine is over out of a blue and not be awkward or make pressure on her.",24Apr2020,1
793,"I love skating and I am serious about that although I only skate for one year after 31 but I’ve already got some major accomplishment. And in last June 2019 I was going to L.A. Fitness in Stoneham MA to work out and improve my mussels of core and lower body. The first day I went to that gym I can feel some weird atmosphere like people are smirking at me which give me a thrill so I wear a baggy white tee the next day instead of the workout tank on the first day. And on the second day when I was in the locker room I can hear a white girl with a pony tail who’s not faraway from me with her friend talking very loudly said “You can’t look too easy so that guys won’t...(the rest are inaudible and I feel weird about that but I didn’t think a lot at that time)”. And the third day the same girl who’s skinny and with dark circles under her eyes, around 5’3”, blonde hair with dark roots standing beside me when I was changing in the locker room whispering beside me said “She’s here for sex” and I was like “ What’s wrong with you, and I am really not in the mood of talking” and just put the ipods in my ear and go. And the rest of the week are peaceful, I work out a lot and determined to shape my body into a standard skater’s shape which involves a lot of lower body workouts. 

And then the disaster begins at that Sunday afternoon, I rush into the gym to get some last-2-hour workout and I wear a “re:re:re party in the gym” graphic white tee for fun. When I start working out abs I saw a huge bald white or Hispanic guy passing in front of me and walking around slowly in Jeans which is weird because everyone else wears workout outfit and he’s staring at every one in the gym when he’s walking around and somehow it makes me feel that he’s looking for someone to fight with or showing his existence or something. And he saw me and looking at me and then walk around for a while and then went to a half bald guy with long hair and long nails and said loudly:“I’m not going to have sex with some chic if she’s looking at me” and then looking at me and I was like too shock to make any respond. My mom always told me that don’t talk to weird people so I just try not to get involved in anything so I didn’t say anything. And that half bald nasty guy which is his friend smile in a very gross way and that makes me a little bit scared too because I don’t know what kind of people they are. And I am a mother of a 4 year old and married for 5 years and I never, never expect people talk to me like that. Usually people are respectful so I don’t know what’s wrong with his brain. And the staff that works in the gym just laughed and seems very amused and he didn’t help me when the huge guy is still talking about me with his friends in the weightlifting area. To be honest why he just shut up and let me concentrate on working out and we all mind our own business? I was very annoyed because no one disturb me working out for skating! But I just remembered what my parents taught me “don’t talk to weird people” and I even didn’t looking at his face because I really want to keep a distance with any troubles like that. 

And I just went home and then come back the next Monday but the disturbs didn’t stop. Apparently someone said something to the people in the gym and they are all laughing at me and showing their abs in front of me and I didn’t expect that unwanted attention so I was confused and a little bit scared because I feel that they wanted to eat me alive! So What I did is that I write a complaint letter to the front desk to express my anger and demand them to let that huge guy to apologize to me. They checked the surveillance camera and they’re like “Oh that Reed(or Red I didn’t hear it clear) we know them let’s just ‘talk’ and see” and just let it go, and those guys continues to disturb me when I was doing late night workout as if I don’t have the right to be there past 8pm. I have to go to the ice rink in the afternoon and the summer course for architecture soon begins at that time so I was trying to figure out a way to work out at night but they just assumed that I staying late is because I want something and that skinny girl who bullied me in the locker room went behind me and call me slut and all I wanted to do is go home and cry—I really confused because I was polite and avoiding talk to weird strangers and totally don’t deserve that humiliation. Of course I was angry and let it out on Facebook by posting something(then deleted) but they insult me Frist and that makes me confused very much because I was just minding my own business. And then I just quit the gym and ask for a full refund of the initial fee and the front desk girl refused to give my money back. 

I really don’t understand why they don’t let me go even I always avoiding any form of contact with them. I am a perfect victim in this case because all my life I’ve only been with 2 men one is my ex boyfriend and one is my husband and I am a very conservative person and totally the most opposite of slut. And why they blame me instead of blame that bald guy? I didn’t do anything wrong. They’re like “it must be your fault, it must be you did something wrong”. No, I didn’t do anything wrong, and I dress probably, and I trained with concentration and determination, and I didn’t talk to anyone. I am a perfect victim. Even I am a perfect victim they still blame me. What happens if those who are not that perfect being a victim? Do they deserve that humiliation?

And why there are people feel so good about themselves? My husband is a MIT graduate, handsome when he was young and tall always, and I didn’t see him feel so good about himself that any women on the street looking at him and he’s yelling to his friend “I am not having sex with her!” And those who are cultured and polite and good looking, I didn’t see them feel so good about themselves too so I was really confused. Really. And I am starting to feel that it is because I am Asian. 

Thanks for reading theses annoying trifles.

I checked online and most English versions advice ppl to react immediately and seeking for alliances fast while most Chinese versions of advices suggest ppl to ignore that person because anyway the rumor will go away in front of the truth. Very different way of thinking. I think it is because I act like I don’t care due to my education(my parents always taught me to avoid eye contact with weird people) so some of them are actually think it is true.",24Apr2020,1

799,"

I have been talking to this guy for months and we were very much in the honey moon stage for the duration of it. He has told me multiple times that he loves and is actually the best relationship I’ve ever hadWe are very compatible in a lot of things, we have the same religious and moral beliefs while our political beliefs are different. It wasn’t a huge problem we were able to have discussion about it without any problems until today..

We were really arguing without even knowing it but there was a two hour long rant he made that I let him run himself into the ground with about some liberal ideals. We talked about privilege a lot but he kept saying that he truly felt he was being discriminated against by people because he was white and that universities were indoctrinating students to think more liberally. Some of the stuff he was saying was very micro-aggressive to my race and I let himself talk and talk until I couldn’t let him keep dissing my beliefs. Because he kept saying in history, we as a society focus too much on the negative and invalidate the actual achievements of people like Christopher Columbus and should objectively present both sides of the info unbiased.  The thing is, he describes certain issues without the full picture and rants about issues that aren’t an accurate representation of what they truly are. (Examples below) We both realized how bad this was getting and decided to stop because we both didn’t want to hurt each other until he brought up that he was feeling guilty that we haven’t talked about black issues and he wanted to tell me what he truly thought about them. 

I let him. 

He talked about how he doesn’t believe that there is true evidence of racially biased police brutality in a sense that police officers aren’t going around shooting people like bad guys and that the people that they’re shooting and beating are really criminals. 

Or the fact that after the 80s, African-Americans haven’t really been dealing with privilege. 

Or the fact that the school to prison pipeline also doesn’t exist. And that our judicial system is far to everyone of every color and that the disparities between the overwhelming amount of black males in jail are due to the fact that their mindsets in the inner cities made them criminals And that anyone would be a criminal if they lived in the inner city 

He also said that he and his friends joke around all the time about racial stereotypes and literally say the n-word all the time because it is taboo. 

Throughout this, he keeps saying that he doesn’t think all of this to hurt me and that none of the things he is doing is intentional or malicious.  

I then told him about plenty of real examples within not only my life, but others that show that these issues are truly happening. But he just doesn’t think it’s racially motivated. 

And it is really sad to think that he genuinely will sit with me and tell me how much he cares about me but then go to his friends and say offensive things because they aren’t allowed to say it anywhere else. 

I don’t know what to do. I really really care about him. And I don’t want this to be another example for him to internalize as a “liberal just calling him a racist and leaving him”",24Apr2020,1

801,"Dilemma/Advice Needed

Hey there to all you beautiful people, I’m in need of some advice. 

Me (22M) and my SO (21F) met a while back, around 7 months ago and we’ve been dating for 5 months now. I started to get to know her and develop my feelings talking to her, we’ve me once briefly, hit it off, but we had to part and we’ve just been talking ever since. The feelings grew stronger and she asked me if I had feelings for her, I said yes. We’ve been healthy and strong and we’ve connected over a number of things.
  I’ve never met anyone like her and want to cherish her and support her in so many ways and just be there for her.
 I think it was about a week or two weeks after we made things official where me and her started to talk about naughtier things. I was and still am incredibly attracted to this girl. We both are and we flirt from here on and then. We talk daily through text and video. We’ve had Skype sex multiple times/sent nudes. She asked me earlier in the relationship when’s the last time I’ve been sexually active and I lied to her. I’m still a virgin. 

She hasn’t asked since then. I felt bad because I didn’t want to tell her truth, I just felt incredibly pressured under society. I didn’t want to lose her if it meant something really much to her, but I’m not sure. I don’t want to lose her as we’ve built something so strong. I’ve been meaning to visit after COVID but we’ll see. I feel as if I should tell her? Has anyone been in a similar situation? What are your thoughts on the situation?",24Apr2020,1

This is literally the dumbest thing that she texted be out of the blue that our hometown’s Fourth of July festival has been cancelled due to COVID-19. I tried diffusing the situation because they are just taking precautions but she got pissed off at me. She basically said the stay at home order is bullshit and a lot of what I would say is conspiracy theory stuff about the US government and my state’s governor. I told her I’m gonna continue following the stay at home order because I could easily get sick and stuff. I also told her perhaps talking to a therapist would help her with her anxiety with COVID-19. I even sent her some because she seems very stressed. She continued being angry through text and wasn’t answering anything I was saying. Eventually she said, “you think I’m crazy” and I didn’t answer because I had enough. Ever since then she’s been weird with me through texts and various forms of social media. Today, I wanted to try to get ice cream from an outside stand right when they open so I see minimal people. She said, “oh you’re breaking quarantine then. I thought that was illegal.” And I asked her why she was angry with me. She was literally mad at me because I didn’t agree with her views. She is very right-wing and I’m not. I do not like talking politics with her or anyone really. I told her that and she said, “I guess I better keep my opinions to myself then.” I just feel this was very childish. We are adults and she does not understand what I’m going through since I’m immunocompromised and she is not. I don’t understand her whole reasoning with reopening the country. I’m still angry that this happened. What should I do about this situation? She has been my friend since like 1st grade and we do not fight like this ever.

I was accepted to UBC for my second choice but got waitlisted for my first, and was also accepted to Waterloo for my first. I live fairly close to UBC, but after giving it some though months after I applied for that second option, I simply don’t want to do it. As a school, UBC was everything for me. Location-wise it was perfect, and many of my friends are planning to go. I love Waterloo as well, and I’ve done sufficient research, so much so that it’s as if I’ve been there in person (they have virtual campus tours). My main issue with moving to Ontario is that I lose all sources of help and familiarity, and yes I understand that it’s a part of growing up, but it’s also that I feel like I would be stranded there if things go wrong. For example, I wear nighttime contact lenses to help my eyesight, what if they break? I would not know where to go if I had not previously established these questions. The problem I have is that I can not think of all of these possible scenarios that might fuck me over, and when I do think of them AFTER I’ve moved, it’ll be too late. I had my drivers test scheduled for a month from now, but with pandemic going strong, it has obviously been cancelled, so I would not be able to drive as well. What if on-campus residences close down due to the pandemic, and I have nowhere to stay? If they switch to online schooling while I live on res, I would lose motivation and constantly be feeling like I’m wasting money on tuition.

*trigger warning: mentions of mental abuse and mentions suicidal thoughts*

So my friend, let’s call her B, lives in the same city as I do, with her mom and her sister and brother, and her step-father. She’s such a nice and funny person, but she’d always get angry and annoyed or offended very easily, and never talked about her home life at all and I had no idea why. I do now. 

We were hanging out at the park last night and I noticed something was off about her. So I asked her, hey, what’s wrong? And she just broke down crying and what she told me absolutely broke my heart. She wanted to visit her dad, who lives  a few towns over and stay there for a week and a half. She also has plans of moving there, and now I totally know why. She’s slept over at her dad’s house before the past year, previously to that they hadn’t had contact for a few years I believe. 

Her mom didn’t want her to. And what her mom said to her was just terrible. Her mom apparently screamed at her for hours saying things going from you’ll lose contact with everyone you love, I’ll never love you the same, you’re terrible, your dad raped me and you and your younger brother were unwanted anyway, etc. (According to B her mom was never raped and the relationship was consensual, and this was apparently the first time her mom had ever claimed this.)

She also said that this had happened many times before, that she felt terrible at home and that her brother had told her multiple times that he wanted her to die and stuff like that. Her mom also tried emotionally manipulating her into staying by suddenly starting to cry and telling her to please stay and how could she leave her own mom behind for a week and a half etc. (B says her mom doesn’t mean it and that there were no tears.) 

Her mom has also been telling her that she was fat and that she should lose weight since she was 5. B struggles with food a lot now and has had times where she would barely eat for weeks.

On top of that she expressed that she had thought about jumping off a building and just killing herself because her mom had told her so many times that she was unwanted and no one loved her. 

I feel so guilty. I’ve known her for so long and I just didn’t have clue. I wish I would’ve been there for her.

The people in this story will be named like this

Ex = Ex
Me = Me
Rude mom = RM
Also RM is the mother of Ex


So my ex and I are best friends. We broke up right in the beginning of this whole Covid-19 break out in the US for other reasons that I’ll state in another post someday. But my Ex and I still want to be friends afterwards because we still love each other’s company. (There’s other reasons but I can’t explain them) So her and I stay on call nearly every day and night. My ex and RM haven’t had a good relationship for awhile. Mainly due to RM nearly forcing ex to live like her and not giving ex her own space. RM thinks that ex needs to stop being on call with me because she does like that we are always on call. For some reason RM is uncomfortable with ex and I for falling asleep on call. We’ve tried to talk to RM to let her know why. You see, me and ex have anxiety. So being on call with each other makes us feel more comfortable and with this whole epidemic, our anxiety has been going hey-wire. So we’ve found out that when we are on call, our anxiety levels are low. Sadly RM doesn’t think it’s necessary. Ex has a therapist that has recently diagnosed her with severe anxiety and mild depression. Yet RM thinks that being on call with me is bad and that ex needs to “give me space” when I’ve made it clear I don’t need or want it. RM has the audacity to threaten to take away Ex’s phone if she continues to fall asleep on call with me. The problem with that is, I nor ex can fall asleep without each other on call. RM still doesn’t care at all. RM thinks that being ex being on her phone and staying in her room is unhealthy. But those are the things that make ex happy. Ex is on call with me because I’m on call with her. Ex stays in her room because she feel safe there. RM is completely ignoring everything that ex has told her.

821,"Throwaway for obvious reasons- and sorry for the bad formatting, I’m on mobile etcetc


The issue is mainly in the title. I feel like I talk about myself way too much, and way much more than normal. It’s gotten to the point where I try and actively try to avoid it, but whenever I do, I can’t help feeling incredibly vain or self obsessed. In reality I have a really low self esteem, and the last thing I want to come across as is horrible and close minded.


One of the main issues I stress over is relating to my friends. For example, if they’re talking about something they experienced (for example, how their day was), and they mention playing a certain game that I also play, I usually say something along the lines of ‘omg I play it too! It’s so good right’. I’m just constantly paranoid about making things about me and changing the subject, when in reality I’m just trying to relate to them.


Obviously I to talk with them about other stuff too, it’s just that this issue keeps eating me up. I feel bad just posting this lol, it feels wrong to say ‘I’ this much in a post. If anyone relates or has any advice on how to overcome this, that’d be amazing- thank you again. im sorry",24Apr2020,1

823,"It can be about uploading photos on Facebook, a photo of my face on LinkedIn, or even more obviously putting up the necessary pictures on dating sites. Basically, things that makes me recognisable. Even having my real name on FB bugs me sometimes (and I have a fully private profile with a few selected friends). But I understand that today a lot of things happens online and I don't want to cripple my chances due to this fear.

To be honest, nothing has ever happened in the 20 years after I left the city in which I went to elementary and middle school, and I had less problems with high school classmates in my current city. However, I have this terror that they will recognise me and go after me: pointing at me, mockery, gloating, ridiculing me. It's as if I imagine them as gluttons eager to taunt me. I don't have issues with people I might have fallen out with as an adult, because I don't care and we can deal with things as grownups (also blocking).

I can very much go back to that city (40 km from here) and walk in the streets with nothing happening even if they spot me (they? would I recognise them? would they still be together? be the same people?). I met some of the nasty high school classmates as a grown up and even if it was very uncomfortable there wasn't any attack. And yet I expect a ""feeding frenzy"" if I expose myself online: oh, look at who's there! The shameful ridiculous defective person! Go after them!

I also did came out as transgender about 5 years ago, and I'm out even at work. However I have this fantasy of them from that old city calling me a bluff because as a child and teenager I experimented with different religions and initiatives, so I am ""famous for changing my mind"" and this means being fake or even worse: being a problem person for coming up with weird stances that no normal respectable quiet people would pull out.

I do admit that I have a sore spot about being judged and rejected by classmates through my own school career, even if I have had a normal social life since university. I feel that I am not a problem unless I'll be found out by those who know the dirty secret that I actually am a problem. And so I limit myself online almost in a paranoid way... I know that it's likely a non-issue and they have moved on, even the bullies. And you know what? This bugs me even more: that there is no way to make them care for and accept me. They were just disgusted, weirded out, condemning. Fast forward 20 years and I can't network for a job or date online without expecting that bad treatment to happen from them. Do you have any idea about how to end this situation? I feel that if I was ok to begin with, none of this would have happened in the first place.",24Apr2020,1

828,"A year ago, Jo and I met and became friends with Barb, someone I met  through a writing club. We all hit it off but Jo, who had gone through a bad breakup and subsequent depression, quickly became controlling and jealous. She'd get upset if she knew we were texting and she wasn't included. She'd quickly butt into any conversations or interests Barb and I shared that didn't involve her. She also became very sarcastic and passive aggressive to me and would often ""call me out"" for liking Barb better than her (her words, not mine). Barb never knew and still doesn't know how badly Jo treated me. Eventually, the arguments became too much- I deliberately distanced myself from Barb.

Now, Jo and Barb are joined at the hip. Ironically, though I'm not the jealous type, I'm in the exact position Jo once worried about: they have interests they don't include me in. They make plans and never invite me. They post on social media together, so I know they spend time together often and don't include me. Still, Jo always calls me her best friend and always seems to want my attention and time. Recently, I had a falling out with Barb. She lashed out at me in a moment of her own stress and said some deeply hurtful things that made clear that Jo and Barb have spoken badly about me and my anxiety issues before. 

I called Jo out on the fact that she had been talking about me. she's apologized profusely and owned that she was being a manipulative and hurtful friend. She seems extremely upset and has told me she feels she needs to make it up to me. I was clear that her friendship with Barb makes me feel like they got close at my expense and I was replaced- but even though Jo has apologized, I'm so resentful. I hate seeing them together. Their closeness leaves such a bitter taste in my mouth and after the falling out with Barb, I don't even want to be around her. 

What's wrong with me? How can I get over myself? Part of me wants them back very badly and another part of me never wants to see them again or, at least, feels instantly inferior when they're together. What can I do?",24Apr2020,1

834,"Im at a cross road in my life. I graduated less than a year ago from college (Electrical engineering) afterwards i took a break for a few months with getting my masters degree being my goal. After i started applying to colleges i also applied to a few jobs as a short term thing and i ended getting hired at a startup company.

I’ve been working for a month now. My position is sales engineer and im the only guy in sales so should that company grow im set to become the sales manager (we can’t predict the future tho) but what i do know is the company is kinda cool they’re not super uptight and they give a good amount of space and everyone is nice. Of course the pay isn’t great but should we grow to something big so will my salary.

My problem now is I don’t know if i should postpone my study plans for a year or more to see how the company turns out OR leave the job and start applying for the First semester (around September which hopefully by then the curve is low enough that life back to normal or something close) 

Things to consider:
- getting my masters degree is something i want to do sooner or later.
-it’s gonna take at least a year before i see major improvement in my salary if i stay and IF the company makes it.
- i kinda like my job and im definitely getting experience but leaving wouldn’t be hard to do
- if i choose to stay im not quitting in a few months, i’d be staying for at least a year (if nothing goes wrong of course) 
- getting my masters degree is something i would rather do sooner than later and would really hate it if it turns out im wasting time at this job. 

TL;DR : i’ve been working for a month at a startup company with good potential in the long run and I don’t know if i should stay for a while (a year at least) or pursuit a masters degree this year (something im gonna do sooner or later)",24Apr2020,1

845,"The pay for the supervisor position is about what I’ll make as a regular armed officer at the site I like in a year. I actually left the site they are offering to me because I hated working there so much.

But also the major reason I hate working there was the toxic work culture lead by the supervisor, who is now gone.

I’m really torn here so here’s my pros and cons list:

Pros: immediate pay increase, can make changes to make things better, I am good at leading (at least during emergencies), I like who would be my supervisor, work is closer to home, I’m 27 so it’s time for me to settle into a career

Cons: some of the officers are rude and don’t like me, training new people is a pain, I hate morning shift, my knowledge for the location is out of date, the previous supervisor isn’t leaving much for me to work with (and will likely use current employees to sabotage me/ make my life difficult), the pay increase isn’t much and I’ll make almost that much if I stay an officer at the location that I like

846,"So..  I bought a $1000 item from a place.  It's a franchise, there are many locations, but they are all owned privately.  

I bought it following pandemic guidelines.  Nothing on their website says anything about all sales being final.  It doesn't say all sales final posted on their front door.  I wasn't allowed to come up to the register, so I don't know what signs may or may not be posted around that area of the store.

When I parked out front, I called to let them know I was there.  I asked if I needed to sign anything.  They said no.  I had already paid over the phone, and he ran my credit card by putting in the numbers manually.  I didn't sign anything.

This was less than a week ago.  

Well, unfortunately, I can't use the item.  The item is a piece of fitness equipment.  I'm trying to get in better shape for an upcoming surgery.  There was no way to know that this particular type of equipment would irritate the part of my body that is being operated on.  Even the surgeon suggested this type of equipment.  

This particular place said they would give me $500 trade in credit for it, or I could put it on consignment, but their consignment fee is split 50/50.  

I am a very reasonable person.  But this is absolutely insulting.

First off, a receipt that says all sales are final..  How is that....  legally upheld?  You don't technically get a receipt until AFTER you exchange money.  The receipt prints once the credit card is approved.  How do I know all sales are final unless I'm told before hand, either verbally, or it's written somewhere or on the company website.

All the locations of this company use the same website template, just different locations have different things on it.  Some have current specials or promos.  Some list classes they do.  Some detail how to go about getting a return, bringing the item back in new condition, with receipt, etc.

The location from which I bought my item, their website is kinda barebones.  It has basic info.  It doesn't say anything about how to do returns.  It doesn't say they don't take returns, either.  I've already archived a copy of their entire website.

So I got on their Yelp, and their Facebook page, and went through some reviews.  There are good reviews.  Then of course, there are bad reviews.  The bad reviews are basically how the owners refuse to accept any returns, belittle people, shame them for not knowing the correct size glove or bat their child needed before spending money on one.  Things of that nature.  

So I don't think I'm going to get anywhere with them.  

So I'm thinking about just doing a chargeback.  I've never done a chargeback.  I figure it will either work, or it won't.  If it works, great.  If it doesn't, I'm back where I am now.  

It's upsetting, because I know they will have zero issue selling this item again.  Hell, the only reason I got it was because the person before me backed out.  I was on a waiting list.  It was the last one of this particular item they had in stock.  

I am bummed.  February 1st, I finally got into the swing of a solid gym routine, going 4 days a week, then the pandemic hit, and my gym closed.  I used my stimulus check to go buy something to help keep me on track, and now I can't use it.

852,"Bit of background. My (28f) friend (33f) and I like to drink and FaceTime each other on Friday nights during this lockdown.  Since I moved, we live pretty far apart now anyway. 

I met this dude online (45m) before I moved. The three of us lived in the same city. Neither of us have met him in person. I’m married and he knows this so there’s nothing too weird going on. He’ll randomly text me throughout the day stupid YouTube videos. I normally don’t watch them, but he’ll still send them. Doesn’t really bother me enough to say anything. My husband finds it a bit odd, but I think of him to be harmless and bored. We’ll randomly Chat about the day, mostly small talk here and there. I’ve known him for about 6 months. I think he’s a little weird, but harmless. He’s divorced with a couple of kids. 

To my point. 

One of the Friday night quarantine chats, I decided to invite him. My friend and I are drunk and mostly just chatting. Trying to get him involved. He’s a bit shy and awkward and doesn’t say much. Next morning, he messages me and takes a keen interest to my friend. He tells me he actually has a gf, but my friend is interesting. The way he talks about her, I know he probably likes her. I also know she very likely doesn’t feel the same. A week goes by and he’ll randomly ask me if I’ve talked to her. I don’t really think much of it, I know she’s an adult and if he were to make her uncomfortable, she’d probably say something. He probably just has a crush because she’s good looking. Next Friday rolls around and we do the same thing. Except this time he’s added her and started doing the random sending of memes or YouTube videos. I told her that he asks about her and he told me he found her interesting. She kind of eye rolls at it and doesn’t seem interested. Before I added him to this chat, he tells me he needs to go to the store. Messages me and asks me if my friend (remember, they live in the same town, I’ve moved) needed anything from the store. And that’s when it started to weird *me*out. 

I told her about this while we were chatting and she gave me a weird look. I guess he also messaged her asking her the same. She hasn’t really responded to his messages. When he got online, he was asked about the trip to the store. And he basically just said he was trying to be nice. 

They’ve never met. 

So do I:

A) leave it alone and let her handle it. She an adult and it’s none of my business. 

2) tell him to essentially leave her alone. He’s coming off a bit strong and making her and me uncomfortable. 

B) is this stalker like behavior? Should I be worried. 

C) is this due to him being of a different culture? (He’s Asian, we’re not) 

4) I hope this doesn’t come off as being a dick if you happen to see this. I feel bad for asking the internet for advice.

How can I have a healthy family life even though I don't trust or really like my father right now?

how do I get to know a better side of my dad?

My dad is a lawyer and is really good at arguing he can feel like a brick wall sometimes and I have trouble confronting or talking to him, he has a need to proofing he is right even after the argument is already over, how do I talk to him about all of this without him turning it all into an argument?

When would be a good time to talk to him about this I don't want to ruin the mood, I don't want to upset him my dad does care about me and he has told me that he wants to talk to me but I just don't trust him, I do I bring my self to talking with my dad?

*5. I don't know how to coupe with my mom's death*

During my mom's last couple of days I acted very immature and I'd act like nothing was wrong I'd still complain (sometimes about things that she tried to do to make me happy) and I got over sensitive about every time she'd tell me to be more mature. How do I come to terms with the fact that I was terrible to my mom?

I feel a lot of dread when I think of my mom, The thing that scares me is whether there is a heaven or not, if there is a heaven would she still love me even after she has seen me masturbate, be mean to some of my friends and even be lazy. but if there is no heaven then the last time my mom ever or will ever see me was when I was being very immature and would sometimes didn't appreciate her. how do I get away from these thoughts?

My mom and I were very close she was probably the person I felt the most comfortable talking to her and she would always try to cheer me up when I had a bad day, now I just keep these feelings bottled up. How can I find someone to talk to like my mom when the only person available is my dad and when I talk to people over the phone convos tend to die quickly?

*6.I don't know if I should see a therapist or not*

I have a hard time trusting someone that I don't know

I can't stand the thought of talking with a stranger for an hour about my feelings, I just feel like I'd be wasting my time.

I only want to feel like talking about my feelings at random times and I feel like if I schedule an appointment most of the times I'd just not feel like talking

I'd just feel weak for joining theropy

859,"Hi everybody, so I just got a real confidence punch when this girl I thought was nice and fun from instagram answered to one of my stories and we started talking and told me she really liked talking to me and that she liked me, the only problem being that she just got of a relationship a few months ago and still had feelings for her ex, and I knew not to get my hopes up and that she wasnt emotionally available. The things is as we were talking her ex contacted her and said that he still loves her and that he wants to meet, but that was just an excuse to meet her and tell her that he has a gf and he is sorry and say to her that he regrets everything and so on. After that she told me not to get my hopes up and I was ok with that. Not long after she started answering slower and slower to the point of not talking. And I'm ok with the fact that there wont be anything there, but the thing that stuck with me is that after she told me how much she likes me and wants to talk to me more, the next thing that happens is cutting all connections. I can find reason to all that happened, but it still hurts me and really fucks with my confidence and trust.",24Apr2020,1

864,"So when I was in elementary school, all I wanted to do was sing. I loved music, and though I didn't understand the technical side, singing brought me a lot of joy. When I was twelve or so, I worked *really* hard to memorize one of my favorite songs and rehearsed it over and over again in my room; I could actually feel myself improving and it was super exciting. 

When I went out into the living room and sang the song for my dad--the whole thing, without missing a line. When I was done, he just laughed, shook his head, and told me ""not to quit my day job"". It didn't matter if I wasn't very good, or that he was probably joking, I was a *kid* and it really hurt; I'd just wanted him to be proud of me. Plus, I had already been painfully shy so it was a real blow to my confidence.

Long story short, I haven't sang in front of anyone since. I'm 26 now. The thought of my roommate or a neighbor hearing me is particularly mortifying (our walls are thin enough that I can hear someone next door on the phone right now), but I really want to get better because singing in private still brings me a lot of joy. I think I could be pretty good with some coaching and a lot of practice, but I'll never improve if I don't work at it. 

So, this week I set out to turn my bedroom closet into a space where I can sing and/or do vocal exercises...hopefully with minimal eavesdropping. I ordered some acoustic foam to put up inside (it's coming next week), and I have some spare blankets and towels to aid in soundproofing. I'm not sure how well it'll work though, so the anxiety is still there. Everyone is home right now due to the quarantine, including my roommate. When I sing, I can *feel* myself holding back and it shows in the delivery. I wish I could afford an isolation booth or something, but it's just not an option for me right now. 

If anyone out there could offer some advice regarding either soundproofing or my pseudo stage fright, I'd honestly appreciate it a TON. I'd like to avoid bothering the neighbors, but if they *can* hear me, I don't want it to keep me from practicing. Even if it's a little embarrassing.

870,"Hello,

 A lot of people here seem to be suffering greatly and while I don't feel suicidal or hopeless I am hurting a lot and I would appreciate any input from others on this, particularly other people in their 30's.

  I had a career I loved, a boyfriend I loved, an apartment I loved and now those things all seem to be gone or on pause. Before the quarantine, the apartment I was living in was bought out by a company and I was paid to leave, I decided to put everything in storage and hole up somewhere until COVID had passed. Kindly my boyfriend offered me to stay with him and I was really excited because I was/ am still, very much in love with him. After a month and a half, he told me he couldn't take the pressure and that he felt he couldn't commit and was unhappy and asked me to leave, I was devastated and scared because the only other place I felt I could go was my mother's house in Mexico now that my apartment was bought out. 

 I left home when I was 18 because my mother (as sweet as she is) stresses me out and makes me depressed, I had a very chaotic and abusive childhood because of my Father and my Mother doesn't really understand why I get quiet and sad and angry around her, it's a sad situation I'm currently trying to work out in therapy. I've been here just a little over a week and my mental health has really declined, on top of feeling abandoned by my boyfriend during a time of crisis, I am unable to be around my Mother, I try to talk to her and spend time with her but it's really not working, I feel like I can't breathe and (I think) from her perspective her daughter is mentally unstable and depressed and she is very worried in a way I find even more uncomfortable. Mind you, I have a pretty established career that is currently on hold and managed teams of up to 10 and don't behave this way in my own personal life, I left home when I was 18 and now am 33 years old so shit is really topsy turvy right now.

  I feel so incredibly displaced. I usually dress very well, take good care of myself and enjoy feeling sexy but currently, I have to gather my wits to even take a shower and I don't feel like putting any effort into my appearance. Currently, I'm burying myself in books and trying to get out to nature here which she sees as engaging in dangerous behavior since there are kidnappings, robberies etc.. also, I've been literally tearing out parts of my hair.

 The whole situation makes me so sad.",24Apr2020,1

872,"I got approved to undergraduate research over the summer, yesterday, and it made me realize I may have jammed way too many things into my summer. Right now my summer commitments are as follows;

- Three online courses, which may become four as I suspect I may fail a class this semester and need to retake it.  
- An internship which is letting me remote work for ~40 hours a week  
- My job at Walmart, which I am currently only working at for ~16 hours a week on the weekends 
- My summer research project, funded by my university, which will be time consuming as I have to do field survey work/etc in order to prep.  

Looking at this list, which doesn't account for any other obligations that may crop up, I fear I may be setting myself up for failure. I certainly know that this semester has been rough for me between working at Walmart, working at my internship, and taking 5 classes (one of which has a lab, so it's really like I was taking 6).

I hate my job at Walmart and I've wanted to quit for a long time. But, I'm also very afraid that if the economy gets any worse my internship may decide they don't need an intern anymore. I've been there for 4 months, counting April, so I feel pretty safe.  I've heard this company pretty much *always* offers their interns a job once they graduate. But, at the same time, these are unprecedented times we live in. I don't know if it is safe to ban on them keeping me around for the summer + fall semester.

I understand no one will have a be-all-end-all answer, but is it safe to quit my job at Walmart? If people were in my shoes, what would you be inclined to do?",24Apr2020,1
873,"I’m writing this on a throwaway account because my girlfriend knows my personal reddit. So basically, my girlfriend has bipolar disorder. It can cause her to do a lot of impulsive things, like break up with me. And she did, a week and a half ago. She told me that she needed to be alone to focus on her mental health and she didn’t see herself dating anyone. Some background info: we maintained a very healthy and supportive relationship, and we were planning on spending the rest of our lives together. So as you can imagine, the breakup was completely unexpected, and out of the blue. It completely devastated me, but I’ve dealt with heartbreak before, so I cut complete contact and rigorously worked on bettering myself, not for her, but for me. I had completely shut her out of my mind, any thought of her i shooed away. And it worked so well, I was doing so well, and coping so well with her being gone. But then she called me a few days ago, saying she made a huge mistake and that her bipolar disorder got the best of her. She didn’t beg me to stay, she told me if I want to leave, she understands and she felt incredibly guilty and regretful. I told her that we could try again, but I would need space to open myself up to her again. I told her my boundaries, and let her know that if she did anything like this to me again, that it was over. Because those are my boundaries. Of course I still love her and want to be with her, the thing is that I feel so unsure. How could I have gone from wanting to marry this girl less than a month ago, to almost not even wanting to talk to her most days? What should I do? Should I take space to myself? Or jump back in and accustom myself to being with her again? I want to try this before completely giving up, because we have set lots of healthy boundaries, even healthier than before.

877,"My friend (also roommate) and I have recently started making videos together. We had talked about doing this for a while now but the currently world's situation has us inside, with nothing to do. So we thought why the heck not. (Side note, we we're friends before we were roommates, and we talked about making videos before moving in together) We started researching advice and ideas that would get the views. We both had two things we like to do, she likes to cook and I like to inform. So what we had originally discussed is that she would cook and then we'd sit down and discuss a topic whether it was true crime, history, politics, theories, etc. that was going to be my segment of the video. Kinda like a mukbang but an informative one. Well she came back to me a few days later and told me that all the videos she was watching told her that if you were going to make videos successfully, you needed to stick to one genre. Basically that my idea and her idea would be too much for one video, and we needed to stick to one niche. 

Mind you she didn't say any of this to be mean or cut me out and honestly it made sense. You don't want to be too flip floppy with your videos right? Well now we're into filming our 5th video and honestly I hate it. I hate doing it, I'm not motivated to do it and really, I'm a little upset that my idea has been cut completely out of the videos. Now we're talking about starting another channel that's me and my idea but she still wants it to be centered around what we're doing right now and she wants to edit the videos too. I want to edit the videos because I know what I want them to look like and she's already crazy tired from editing the other videos.

So why am I asking for advice from Reddit instead of talking to my roommate? Y'know like an adult? Because we don't communicate well when we disagree. She shuts down whenever I talk to her about anything serious and then I can't talk to her. Granted we both come from different family dynamics. Her's handles things quietly and calming and mine yells at each other (we're not white). I can talk to her calmly cause I'm an adult lol (at least in that aspect) but that still doesn't stop her from shutting down. How do I tell my friend I'm not happy with what we're doing, that I'm upset she decided to take my part out and that I want to be the one in charge of the other channel.

879,"Context: I co-run a pretty specific community in my country. We're the largest in our niche and welcome a lot of people who are new to the niche. We also made a list of counselors that are sensitive to issues specific to our niche. This list was made by our members, anyone could edit it, no one really verified the legitimacy. We've since seen our mistake and locked the list, so one of our volunteers can verify whether the people on the list, should really be on the list.   


A while ago, I was contacted by a few members who had seen a specific counselor and had bad experiences with that counselor. Think: inappropriate behaviour during session, gaslighting, wanting to mingle in closed communities that clients are involved,... Stuff that is deontologically not ok, therapeutically not ok.   


We removed this person from our list. Now they are applying to be on the list again, confused as to why they were removed. They are also a member of our community, stated that they used to get some clients through our list.   


I don't want to put them back on without addressing the issues, but I also don't know whether it's ok to address the issues in the first place.   
And even if the issues are addressed, I'm hesitant to put them back on to the list. Our community is vulnerable as it is, I don't want to expose the people in it to a counselor who behaves in such a careless way.

881,"Advice? Feels like I’m losing a friend (hoping it’s not just my abandonment issues)

Even before quarantine started, I felt my best friend drifting away from me. We live together with 3 other close friends and work together. But she’s always with her boyfriend. Like to the point that the 3 days we work together are literally the only days I see her (we spend maybe 40 mins out of the 5 hours we’re there together)Sometimes she doesn’t even say hi when we pass by in the house. And when I have the chance the hangout with her, it’s only for maybe 15-20mins before her boyfriend shows up and she’s leaves to be with him. And this is on rare occasions.

Idk I just feel kinda lonely, I hang out with other roomies too but it’s not the same when I can noticeably miss her energy. 

I’ve always respected her desire to be alone, because I’m a very solitary person myself (only child in a 2 person home my whole life). But I’m always available when she wants to talk or hangout (Like she’d get out of class at like 9am and knock on my door and I’d pretend I wasn’t in a deep slumber, so she wouldn’t feel bad for waking me up, cus I know it’s the only 20 mins of her time I’ll get) But I can’t say that she is. If he’s at the house, which he always is (he’s staying here throughout quarantine). I know I have no access to her, and she’s not one to really text or message. Her bf is cool, I have no problems with him. But it sucks that we never hangout or bond anymore. 

Like I’m big on watching movies and tv with my friends because it’s how I like to bond. I always recommend shows or pick out stuff I wanna watch with certain people. We used to watch tv series together, like weekly shows that we would start from the beginning. But now we don’t watch anything together. Everyone gets together to watch tv and she stays with her bf in her room. We would start a show together and when the next ep would come out she’d watch it with him instead. We’d talk about a movie we both wanna see and I’d find out that she’s already watched it without me or with him. Meanwhile I’m holding off waiting for her to hangout so we can watch it. She’d even find the link for it and not tell me. It’s little stuff but I feel like it adds up over time. 

I’d never ask her to stop hanging out with him, but it sucks feeling like someone’s leaving you behind. I’ve lost both my best friends in the past, because they left me behind and it feels like it’s happening again. I’m afraid about what it’ll be like when we move out. We’ve lived together for 4 years. 

TL;DR I’m just really sad that my best friend seems to be drifting from me and I don’t know what to do. Like how do I tell her that I’m hurt by her not being around anymore? I don’t wanna make her feel like I’m coming at her, or sound like I’m being delusional",24Apr2020,1

885,"I've held an account with my cable service provider (Atlantic Broadband) for over 10 years now, every single year at my current residence. 

The first couple of years the TV/internet package was under $100 and for the most part, it was decent value. 

As most cable companies do, prices go up over time, and that was the case here as well.

However, over this past year I've noticed my bill has increased by a margin well over $100, and it's only going up every month.

I'm currently paying over $330 every month for TV and Internet (which I believe is highway robbery).

I've even called Atlantic Broadband in order to try to negotiate a more reasonable deal.

In response, they essentially threatened to raise my prices if I were to opt out of the ""package deal"".

To add insult to injury, the internet (100 Mbs) is always giving me lag spikes during online gaming sessions (which makes it unreliable).

I can't use my own Modem or Router because Atlantic Broadband doesn't let me, I have to use their equipment and pay the rental fee monthly.

I can't switch providers because in my residential area, they hold a cable provider monopoly.

I can't get Google Fiber (Webpass) because I live in an apartment, and this building was built prior to 1995.

Therefore because of poor internal building wiring, that's not possible either.

Well jeez you may ask, ""Why don't you just cut off the service?"" 

Unfortunately, I can't turn off the service because my parents watch TV more often than not.

Since they're both retired and at home most of the time, it's not fair to them if I take that away.

I'm currently helping my parents pay for all the bills, and that includes cable.

If it were up to me, I would completely drop my cable provider and live off my T-Mobile Hotspot.

Especially since I've been unemployed for over a month now due to the pandemic.

Given these circumstances, it's a complicated situation all around.

&amp;#x200B;

Could I have the building internal wiring updated somehow?

My mother is not in good health, or my anxiety/PTSD) and then its finished and we never talk about it again and they never check up on me even though I check up on the one friend who does open up (the other 3 are not really emotional people)?

Part of me feels like they really dont care for me (and I really do think I annoy them with my non-problems compared to my other friends who has more obviously difficult problems and is much less apologize-y about opening up ??)

Yet the other part of me really does feel like I am asking a lot of them and I do love them but to be honest I'm just getting worse mentally and I need support but asking them to check up on me just feels embarrassing to me.

Am I just too different to them?

Note: they are all the same age as me.
Note: we have a lot of mutual interests and I do like talking to them I just feel like we are maybe too different.",24Apr2020,1

889,"I recently moved in with my SO. It has been very nice except for one thing. My SO has pretty severe rheumatism and is in pain most of the time. So I have to do most work at home. That is not a problem. What is a problem is for the few days a month that my SO gets their medication. It is a very strong sort of painkiller and it completely changes my SO. it is like they're drunk. They can barely talk and we can barely hold a conversation. While being able to do some chores they are now so absentminded that I literally cannot trust them to do those chores or anything. I am constantly worried that they might mix chemicals and hurt themselves or destroy things at home. Some things have gone missing because they were ""cleaning"" under the influence and I cannot for my life find those things. 

I'm really not sure what to feel. My SO is superhappy to not being under so much pain that they cry constantly. I don't want to take away that relief they have for a few days a month. But I don't feel comfortable with the person they become when under the influence of the medication. My SO is intelligent, witty and interesting, but under the influence can't follow along in a conversation, acts like they're drunk when it is its worst and is in a word vulgar. I'm not a prude, we met on an site for kinksters, but this sort of vulgarity makes me feel uncomfortable since they seem like a black out drunk person unable to form coherent sentences. 

Tldr; chronically sick SO needs painkillers to have a functional life. But turns into a other person due to the strong medicine. I'm not sure what to do. Whenever I bring it up they either handwave it or ""reassures"" me with things like ""no, I would never do that. You know me""",24Apr2020,1

But I feel guilty because I withheld that I live in a house right next door to my parents.

Staying inside together all the time is potentially the reason for this pointless argument, but we cannot agree on what we are saying. So we thought we can try to get an answer from you guys.

We are having a simple argument: Our neighbor comes to us and tells us that last night he was abducted by aliens.   
What do you say, and do you believe him. 

My answer would be; I do not believe you, I think you are lying, but that does not mean what happened is not true.

My better half says; Okay, that has happened to you. 

Then I asked my better half; So you believe in aliens, that they exist and could have done this?   
And the answer was; Maybe, it might have happened, or it might not.

I am arguing that we basically are saying the same thing, while my partner is saying we clearly are not saying the same thing.

893,"Hello! 

I lurk in this subreddit with my main but dont want this associated with my main, hence the throwaway.

I'm moving into a home with my boyfriend in July. It is 2 bed, 1 bath, gorgeous standalone home (small front yard, huge backyard). 

I was raised by a single Mom who taught us to be pretty responsible for our house. I did dishes, laundry, vacuumed, helped with meals, made my bed, etc from a young age, all age-appropriate. When I was 15, I essentially lived alone as my mom basically moved in with her boyfriend and my sisters were grown/living elsewhere. Please don't hate on my Mom for this, it was a complicated situation. While I lived alone, I bought the groceries, cooked meals for myself, did the dishes, did my laundry, cleaned the cat's litterbox, went to the bank to pay the bills, vacuumed, wiped down surfaces, that kind of thing. I never did any sort of deep cleaning because it just never occurred to me. I didn't clean the bathroom at all (I was the only one using it so it wasn't gross, but I should have cleaned it), I didn't really clean the kitchen beyond washing dishes and wiping up spills, I wasn't great at keeping up with laundry (had to throw out some clothing because it got moldy in the washer). 

After a few months, I moved in with my grandparents. My grandparents have always spoiled me but even more so when they found out I was living alone and 100% responsible for myself. This caused a lot of tension at first, but we figured it out. I still lived with them (now 26). I try my best to insist I help around the house, but it never works. My grandparents do basically everything for me. They do all my laundry, all my cooking, all the dishes, all the vacuuming and general tidying, all the deep cleaning, all the outside house work, everything. They would do most of this stuff when I was out of the house (university, then working full time). 

Now that I am faced with keeping a house clean, I'm panicking. I haven't done most of this stuff in years! I dont even know all that needs to get done! For example, I know the furnace will need the filter changed, but how often does that happen? Are their instructions? 

My boyfriend has also never lived without family. He is responsible for keeping his basement clean (bedroom, lounge area, small bathroom). These spaces are not as clean as I would personally like them, but we have talked about it and know we will both need to compromise. He also has never been responsible for maintenance on a house, so not much help.

My question is mostly: how do I keep a house maintained and clean? Should I have some kind of cleaning schedule? Are there any places or websites I could find a list of what all needs to get done? 

I'm not being thrown into the wild and told good luck. I have my grandparents and my sisters, not to mention my boyfriend's family. But I just feel like I need to learn all of this instead of always asking family.",24Apr2020,1

Hi, a long time ago a random guy on snapchat added me by username. I thought he was an old classmate so I added the request and didn’t think much of it. 

He ended up being a stranger and wanted to pay for photos. After a few days of talking, a severe lapse in judgement, and desperation for cash, I agreed. He initially only wanted clothed selfies sent through snapchat and said he would not save them at all (which I didn’t believe but my face was on the Internet anyways thru social media) so I didn’t see the harm.

He increasingly kept asking for more and I felt extremely threatened and pressured bc he made small threats releasing information he already knew about me. I felt scared and complied and instantly regretted it. I told him I would not continue and he initially seemed okay with it. I was scared to block him in fear he would release my nudes to the public. (Big mistake) KEEP IN MIND I NEVER GOT PAID.

A few months later he asked again and said that if I did a session (he wanted to me to send photos as he jerked off until he would come) one more time he would leave me alone forever and if I did not he would release my nudes and ruin my life. 

I asked him what he had saved and he refused to send anything to me... but me being dumb and paralyzed by fear, I agreed one more time. After sending the photos, he said I could ask any questions I wanted. I was too distraught, but then he APOLOGIZED for hurting me, resulting to disgusting measures to get photos, and that he saw himself falling in love with me and then told me he would unfriend and leave me alone. 

It’s been more than a year since this happened and nothing has been released. I feel incredibly anxious and uneasy still because I don’t know his true identity and I suspect it’s someone who actually knows me. 

It was a really weird situation but it’s literally ruining my life since I’m constantly anxious about it. 

Since it’s been so long, do you think he will release anything? 

If he actually had something of me, wouldn’t he send it when I asked him what he had as a scare tactic to gain more leverage? 

Would it be possible to track down this person by hiring a digital investigator? 

Please please help I don’t know what to do.",24Apr2020,1

897,"We've been together for 2.5 years and have been doing long distance for the past 2 years. It's had its ups and downs. She's about 6.5 hrs from me. The last time I saw her was in February and I had planned on making another trip around this time. But now that there are COVID cases seemingly in every city, I am hesitant to make the trip. 

I am currently living with my parents (mother is 60, father is 70), both of which have some underlying health issues. I feel that it would be wildly irresponsible to travel and possibly bring this virus to our doorstep. 

Her town has several cases, but she has been quarantining at home and making minimal trips for essentials, so I believe her to free from infection.

She feels like I am overplaying the severity of the pandemic. Technically I could make the trip and only have to stop for gas 1 time, but even this seems risky in my opinion.  

I've explained my concerns to her, but she doesn't seem to take them seriously and would rather claim a lack of commitment on my part. I'm honestly a bit pissed because I feel like there is no right answer for me and that it's not fair to demand that I risk my family's safety.

903,"I'm 12, male, and in 7th grade. My father and I have never been too close. He's abused me for a big majority of my life, hitting me with belts and his hand; to the point where I was thinking of committing suicide. Ever since I hit puberty, he's been expecting me to mature immediately, and whenever I get something wrong, he acts like I just broke his computer or something. He started punching me, in the head and neck, but he continues to hit me with the belt and his hands. He doesn't do it often (the punching), but once he did it right before home church service (courtesy of COVID-19) and expected me to be over joyous to praise our Savior right after (and he hit me because he'd asked me to put my little brothers shoes on, and they wouldn't fit). I didn't feel pure in His presence at all. I couldn't help but silently cry the most of the service. He always accuses me of lying, even though I've stopped months ago. When he greets my siblings (Sister is 16, brother is 5) He hugs them like he hasn't seen them in years. He calls her his 'beautiful flower' and my brother is now his 'big boy'. He just calls me Junior, since we have the same name. And he doesn't even greet me. He pays me no mind. i.e. He greeted my sister while she was at the computer, and showed her all this love and asked her how was her day. Afterwards he walks right past me to my brother, does the same, and doesn't even bat an eye  at me. I was crushed, I would just appreciate a 'Hi' or something. I tried cutting, but my skin was too thick, and I couldn't get through. So I stopped after only two days.

From here, I'll start from where his attitude was getting worse with me. January, 2020 I was a participant in a school play that I have been working hard on. About 1 and a half weeks before public opening, I told two girls of my troubles at home. We'll call them V &amp; C. But my dumb self asked them to promise not to tell police on what I was about to say. They agreed. (Keep in mind I had grown very close to these two girls as best friends; I'm not gay, trust me) So I told them. The convo went similar to this:

Me: ""I have something to tell you guys""

V:""You can tell us anything. Don't be afraid.""

C:""Yeah, whatever it is, don't be shy. Tell us.""

Me:""Alright.""

\*Cue about 5 to 8 minutes of me being silent and time to time saying 'Sorry I'm taking so long'\*

Me:""Okay. My d--  \*two seconds of silence\* My dad uh... \*two more seconds of silence\*""

They are looking straight at me, ready for anything. Really, I love those girls, they are so kind.

Me:""My dad abuses me.""

\*Cue the shocked expression on both of their faces, but very well hidden\*

V:""Oh my goodness, are you alright?""

Me:""I'm fine.""

C:""Are you sure?""

Me:""Yeah.""

V:""Oh my gosh, how could he do something like that to something he- he made?""

C:""Oh my god.""

V:""Like, what does he do? What does he hit you with?""

Me:""Belts, his hands.""

V:""Does he like, punch you?""

I lied at this part, and I said no, because he had only done it a few times, and I didn't think he'd continue. Now I wish I hadn't lied.

Me:""No.""

C:""Are you sure you're alright?""

Me:""Yeah, I'm fine.""

V:""Oh, wow, how long has be been doing this?""

Me:""Uh... since I was about three.""

C's jaw  drops, but not one of those mouth fully open one. Like if you looked at her through the corner of your eye, you could barely see her mouth open. For some reason, this made me cry, so I turned away for like a second, trying hard until the tears went back into my eyes? Well, I don't know, but they didn't pour out, which was good since I was in front of girls.

Now, this is where my memory of the conversation starts to get foggy, and I don't really remember most of the conversation.

Flash-forward to half a week before performance of the school play. The girls *didn't* tell the police. Yet they *did* tell their mothers, and their mothers reached out to school staff, who then told my principal. I get called into the office while in 1st period Art. Let's call him Mr. M. Mr. M, super nice guy, great to talk to. So I enter his private office, and he tells me to have a seat. So I take it and he asks if he knows why I was there. I did know, because one of the girls told me that she and my other friend told their mothers, and yadda yadda yadda. So I tell him yes, I do know. Here's part of the conversation:

Mr.M:""So what does he hit you with, iiTrixyIsaiahii?""

Me:""A belt. His hands sometimes.""

Mr.M:""Does he slap you? Punch you? What does he do with his hands?""

I lie, and say he only slaps me and hits me with the belt.

After the conversation, he says,""How old are you, 13?""

I said 12 and he is amazed. He says I have potential, and that he actually means it, not like he was wanting to give me some hope. He gives me a phone number(DCF number) to call if my father ever hurt me (I also had a choice to say if authorities specialized in this situation should be called or not.) I did not want that happening to my father, even though I despised him greatly. Sitting 2 feet away from me is that number on a folded post-it note, hidden in the hat I wore for the school play.

What I came here to ask is what should I do to get my dad to like me more. \[I partially think he doesn't like me because as a child I was always a little clumsy, but I have gotten over that and I was always a smart kid. My father is a pastor, though in my opinion, he doesn't deserve that role for his actions. He abuses my siblings also, but he definitely hits me more, and my siblings agree. I feel like my father always hated me more. And he always makes fun of me, in front of my family, (I also haven't told my principal that) and I'm not sure if that is verbal abuse, but he knows I don't like it and continues.\] It isn't only my father with the verbal abuse. It's my whole family except my mother, but recently she's stopped trusting me because whenever I ""lie"" I get in trouble with dad, and he thinks he can decide if I am lying or not. And she believes him. My mother was always the one I went to when my father had me down, or even my siblings. But now, when I go to her, she puts me down even more. I had lost who I always went to, and so now I'm coming to you guys, even after going for help with people, I don't feel like calling authorities because I'm scared about what would happen to my dad and if he'd abuse me more after they let him off.

TLDR: Unheard-of Underdiagnosed Emotional-Trauma-turned-into a Bone/Cartilage/joint condition not recognized by doctors, living with it by myself for 8 years, recent diagnosis of MRSA amidst this current COVID19 health crisis, no friends, Hong Kong 
-

I am Kai,27,Hongkong Asian male.

Emotional trauma:

When I was 13-18, I was extremely anti social possibly bc of being queer, I didn’t like talking to others, I hid my emotions, including harboring anger issues towards immediate family. Most of the days I spent my time in front of the computer or just finishing homework. When I was 18(2011), during the summer holidays, I had met a UK teenage guy but I was very socially awkward around him and I texted him a lot by the end of which he vented on fb saying there’s “a creepy stalker guy that can’t stop texting me, such a loser” something like that. When I found out, I went mental. I went to bed and kept saying to myself that I’m fine it’s okay and I didn’t sleep much for a few days and I feel like it was during that time period my sensitive and overactive nerves have gone haywire.. flash forward to a few months later, I started going to community college and one day after school on my way back home I started feeling two waves of nerve pain, one intercostal, on lower left rib, one on left temporal area but it’s more of a numbness in the head later..there’s also right side Epididymitis around the testicle but the point is through time, after 8 years now, these three problems are lesser issues than my messed up neck.

Days later, I started experiencing a warmness within my neck on the back of my neck right in the centre (spinous process protrusion?)as well as a bunch of bony sound on either side of the concerned process when I tried to feel what’s beneath the skin. Also at the same time, most of my bone spurs/calcifications also start forming from the left lateral column of possibly the transverse process(?)especially the upper ones and the lower one. It’s noteworthy that all this extra bone formation does not cause pain, but it’s affecting every part of my life. Explained below

One or two years later, I have gradually discovered the formation of bone spurs on my anterior cervical spine right behind the left tip of my hyoid bone, I would be able to deeply touch it palpably with my fingers and feel them. Then one day, I don’t know what exactly triggers it, probably the friction but my hyoid bone and soon the thyroid cartilage, the Adam Apple and cricoid cartilage soon befall the same fate- they are calcified but more with the left side because the left side of my neck connected to the brain  is basically the most affected place. 

So with all this, I have tried a lot of things just to make me able to sleep and make me feel like during the day my neck does not feel “stony” (it’s beyond the point of “stiffened” now) and finally make me feel like I m breathing through the throat feels normal because my throat does feel constricted at times (towards the left side) and also my left nostril’s sense of smell feels weak.. anyways, compared to 2 years ago if I tried to crack my neck i could get 7 cracks when I moved my neck all the way to left and same with right, these days it’s possible I couldn’t get any sound as the joints in between vertebrate are already so damaged.. 

the things I have done over the years to better my situation include

Currently:

sleeping pills (stilnox, zopiclone) 2 pills each per day

NSAIDS (ibuprofen, paracetamol if I have cold symptoms)

Gabapentin/Robinax(if needed)
(Please give me better suggestion for musculoskeletal relaxant if you think it helps)

Glucosamine and Chondroitin (trying these now, will see how it goes after 90 day regimen)

Serrapeptase(gonna start trying this as well bc it  helps)

Ashwagandha root powder tea 

Melatonin (sometimes)

 No longer:

Neck massage(there’s no use, massaging confirms that it’s a bone situation whenfor instance, the back of my neck is massaged)

kratom(recently quit), 

even alcohol (I was a bartender for a year last year, and I drank on the job every day to try to take the edges off, now I have stopped drinking for the time being

Muscle rub applied on body

The only “invasive” treatment I have tried is PRP injections to my facet joints from the back of my neck I felt only temporary relief...

X Ray and MRI show merely mild cervical scoliosis to the right curvature and lordosis, but what other tests can be done ?CT? Dexa?

I am thinking about trying valerian root tea and topical CBD oil as well but I don’t know if they will help.

So now I’m at this point I really wanna feel better bc I have saved a year of money from bartending, I want to do my Masters degree but I need to be in better physical shape before being able to convince myself to do it, but I do not know the course of action. I live in Hong Kong 🇭🇰 so I will either see doctors here in public hospitals or I may consider going abroad for medical tourism.

I know there’s probably no way I can have it cured but I just wanna see what my best bet would be... obviously the most affected parts are the left laterals, anterior left cervical spine bone spurs, my hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage (left portion esp) bothers me as well breathing-wise but I don’t know what can be done about it and also the back of my neck.

I have a history of doctors not believing my conditions bc I have never talked about the emotional trauma aspect of my problem... now is the time I have to face it bc my neck is getting worse, please give me any suggestion. My case is unheard of and I really wish I can get my diagnosis, prognosis, medications or supplements that I should have, how I should approach to see the doctors? And would any injection therapy help or surgery?

I also need to say recently I have been tested positive that I have MRSA as I had a carbuncle removed from left side of neck anterior two weeks ago. I’ve been feeling so weak of late bc of MRSA and it may complicate things down the line... 

I am also battling this alone and don’t mind if anyone approach me to share with me about their struggles as well.",24Apr2020,1

I have an addiction to light bulbs. It just provides me such infallible sensory stimulation! I’m so sorry, I’ve tried to change, but I’ve found out I must stoke the fire. It all started when I was a tot and my mom drove me around the block at night in the car whilst playing classical music to put me to sleep when I was sick or couldn’t sleep. Whilst this music plays today, I reminisce on the orange lights that passed our car overhead with such vibrancy. I must relive this moment. Can someone help me find light bulbs that will fit into common sockets that have the same color and intensity as low pressure sodium and high pressure sodium street lamp bulbs? Deep, orange, somewhat dim* monochromatic? I really don’t want to buy actual lps and hps bulbs because I don’t want to mess with the price and complication of setting them up with a ballast.

First little backstory:
So a while ago i (M18) went to a party and the girl(F17)  i like was also there (she is in my friends group and i dont know her that long). I think i got signals that she likes me too.

Recently i went to another party she hosted. When everybody left we started making out and had sex. I have to mention that we were both really drunk. 


Due to covid i was unable to speak to her in person for a while know. We have texted a little bit but nothing too serious and not much. But i am going to take a walk ekth her in tommorow. 
And i dont know how to ask her if it was a one time thing or if she likes me
And i dont know how to ask her if she likes me.
Any advice is welkome. Thanks in advance

910," First semester of college I wasn’t feeling it. Around this time my significant other asked me to live with them; in another country. I felt like it was the right thing to do and I left not finishing my finals for the classes. I recently about a month ago returned to my country of origin (to pick up my visa). But due to the corona virus I am now stuck here. My family wishes I continue my schooling, but I know once the boarders open up and I have my visa I will return to my significant others country. Why would I waste money and get more debt to do a semester in college so I’m not “wasting my time”? Although moving to this new country and having only a bit of grasp of the language is difficult; I will not be able to enter college starting off. I plan to work for a year or two till I’m ready. Do you think I’m doing the right thing?

Now i had a history with shoulder issues on my left side for a while, and i know that it can go as far as to cause issues around your head aswell so part of me is shruggin it off as part of it, but another thinks maybe its an infection or something similar.

915,"So im 28 my wife is 24. Been married for almost 5 years and have an amazing soon to be 3 year old son. Im a pretty quiet and laid back guy. Dont have many friends. Moved a lot throughout my high school years so that didnt help but thats another story. Never been too into parties and always prefer a night in. We have had some fianncial problems throughout the marriage but in the past 8-12 months everything has been great on that end. I have never cheated on her but there was a 2 week period where we broke up (i brought it up) i wasnt with another girl although she swears i was. Anyways she is the type of person who doesnt let things go and this was around 4 years ago. So not recent. She has physically cheated on me once and multiple times over text and social media with ex boyfriends from back home. I let all of it go because i felt that i was the first one to betray the relationship so as much as it hurt, i love her and our family and decided to forgive her. Whenever there is a fight i dont bring that up but she brings up what i did and says that that cause all the problems that we had thereafter. And that part of she doing what she did was because of what i did. Past two months have been rough. We have technically broken up but decided that we would still live together since this whole covid-19 started and just didnt feel like the right tome for me to leave. She said she feels like she doesnt love me anymore. And that the relationship has gone through too much. I just cant quite give up. I feel that with eveeything we been through it should mean that much more to fight through it and be good. We are still young and have so much to live and memories to make. Idk if i should just move on and accept what she is saying or maybe keep trying. There are some days it feels like she is open to continuing but then others whwn she makes me feel worthless. Some days we hug good mornings and a small kiss goodnight but then others she wants me away and doesnt want me to even get near her. I feel like it causes me more pain to be around that than it would to just decide to leave. My son has autism and i dont want to be away from him. I think he needs his parents togethee but im also realistic that he needs a loving family not two parents that arent happy togerher. Should i keep trying and see if her feelings and thoights change? Also she has changed her phone password out of nowhere and when i confronted her she ssid that we arent together anymore so that she did it just because.. im not the type that goes through the phone but it jsut struck me since i dont see a reason of why do that unless u are hiding soemthjng.. we give our son our phones at times thats why i grabbed her phone to give him and tbats when i realized she had changed it. When i asked her she didnt give it to me and instead Input the number herself. Should i think something of it? Trying to get some outside thought into it. thank you all in advance.",24Apr2020,1
916,"So back late last year my friend quit her job. She was tired of working at our company because our particular department is FILLED with extremely difficult people and has a high turnover of leadership.  Everyone here wants to quit in some form or another.  Then she got the golden chance, a better job at a different company with higher pay. Obviously I was super excited for her, and almost immediately she said she was recommending me to take over her position. I was excited for the change in duties and higher pay so it was working great for everyone. Since she was leaving on such short notice then said they would hire her on as a contractor to train me so she would get even more money. Wins all around!!! 

Well, management fell flat on their face and never contracted her, so I moved into her position with no training whatsoever. She was nice enough to help me through texts and an occasional phone call, but I really didn't want to bug her too much and just tried to figure things out on my own. The tough part is her position was extremely specialized, to the point where basically no one had any idea what she actually did. 

Today I texted her asking advice for how I should go about a certain situation, and she responded like she normally does. Again, she said she was frustrated because issues I'm running into wouldn't happen if I had been properly trained in the first place. We started talking about regular life and asked her about her school and said she was almost done one more week. I asked her if she was excited and she basically said ""Super. I'll have two degrees and be unemployed"" I was like wait what??? Then she explained to me she was furloughed at her job and even though she's supposed to return soon she thinks the furlough is gonna get extended. 

Now, I feel terrible. Here I am asking for help about a job that she probably does better than I can, and she has no job. What do I do? I feel like I wish I could give her the job back but obviously I can't. I feel like a major asshole for even bringing up work now. I dont know what to do...",24Apr2020,1

she tried to invest in my boyfriend behind my back during that.
then, when i started to try and see her ""good part"", she took advantage of my boyfriend when he wasn't lucid, at his neighbor's party. i tried to kill myself at the next day.
right after that she spread around their college that he had abused her but actually nothing more than make out happened.
i tried but i can't forgive her.

921,"My childhood was fairly messy. My family had money but both of my parents were emotionally unavailable. My mom left when I was 5 and I rarely see her. My dad remarried with a really awful woman who dislikes me. My mom was quite emotionally abusive during my childhood and would fabricate stories about being raped/kidnapped and tell me (I was 7 years old). 

I had no support during my childhood which lead to me being admitted to a psychiatric hospital aged 14. By aged 14 I was on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medications. 

My step mum really resents me. She despises my existence and has spoken about how she wishes that I  wasn’t around when she was angry. My dad says nothing about this behaviour and insists that he isn’t involved. This happening over 8 years of my life, safe to say, has caused me a significant amount of emotional trauma that I am only really recognising now at the age of 21. 

I see some of my current behaviours that are avoidant in nature and can correlate them with specific interactions I had in my childhood. Specifically, my low self-esteem which I guess is as a result of having a lack of parenting and support as a young child and throughout my teens. I realise my lack of self worth is due to not feeling worthy of parenting and love. 

How do I make peace with this trauma? 
How do I move on? 
How do I make my self-esteem better? 

Part of me wants to cut them out permanently, move to a new country, try a new life and forget. But part of me wishes that I could go back to my childhood where things were simpler. 

How have you made peace with your traumas? 
What does “moving on” mean?

Anyways. If he was to hear it, what would be a good excuse? I was thinking of ""I moved my phone and the case squeaked"" or ""my phone vibrated"" but these dont seem like good excuses.

924,"Hi this is kinda long so bare with me.

We’ve been friends for over 2 years and I met him my freshman year of college (I’m a junior now). It was obvious he was interested from the beginning but long story short we talked, eventually kissed, he hooked up with another girl, I asked him what his intentions were and he said he didn’t want a relationship at the time (this was 2 years ago). We left off on good terms and remained as good friends. Sophomore year came along and he made the effort to hang out here and there but we never got physical. Summer going into this school year was when things started to change. We began to Snap a lot and he would tag me in things on Facebook. Immediately when classes started in August, he asked to grab food (which he has never done during our 2 years of friendship). This became a consistent thing throughout the year along with other things such as: complimenting me (he has never done that before), asking to hang out more, buying me coffee several times, bought wine, cooked for me (specifically bought me steak once), asked to go to the city and FaceTime over winter break, he remembered my birthday and even bought me a bottle after I jokingly asked for one. All of this happened from August-March. The past 2 years, he would hookup with other girls when we were at the same party together. This year, however, we were at 2 parties together and he stayed by my side and would tried to get with me. At one party, I was getting close with another guy and I knew he got jealous but just didn’t say anything because, well, he really couldn’t when he has been doing the same thing to me last year. At my birthday party, I got really drunk and apparently flirted with one of his friends. The next day, his friend told me that he looked like he didn’t like that I did that.

Anyways, in March, because of COVID19 we all had to leave. The day before we had to leave, he asks to hangout because he said “this might be the last time I see your face.” We hang out, he pays for my coffee, and we go back to my room. He eventually asks if I wanted him to kiss me and I say no. He then asks why and I say “I’m bad at this stuff” and I just say the cheek. He kisses me on the cheek and eventually kind of makes out with my neck. Eventually he leaves and I go to the bar with my friends later that night. I then get a text from him saying he’s coming with his friends too. I dance with my guy friends and then I see him hooking up with another girl. I get mad and I know this is immature so I found another guy and eventually I’m sitting on his lap (we never kissed or anything).

I like him but I don’t know if he was just trying to just hookup or wanted something more. We’ve always kept in contact since freshman year but now we haven’t talked in about a month. I’m not sure if I should reach out because I don’t know if he still has feelings for me.

So, did he just want to hookup or wanted something more?

tl;dr: This guy is giving me mixed signals and I don’t know if he wanted to just hookup or something more.",24Apr2020,1

926,"Hi all! 

I'm Mandie and I need some help. Currently, it is my junior year in high school and I'm doing a thing called running start so I'm currently just taking college classes at my local community college. However, I found out there isn't a way for me to receive my AA so I'm thinking of going back into high school. The only issue is that I am/was a cheerleader there. Honestly, the girls in my squad are just completely awful. And I had a really bad injury a majority of this year, so when I worked my butt off for our big final events, it really hurt when no one cared or notices. I have no friends on the team and when I try to talk to the other girls, they don't want to get to know me. Which is funny because this will be my third year on the team. So I've decided I do not want to continue cheering there. And while that doesn't seem big compared to others, I absolutely love cheering. And I've never loved another sport as much as I love cheer so letting go is really hard for me. I'm curious if I should switch high schools entirely, I want my senior year to be good and I know if I stay at the school I'm at, it's not going to be an enjoyable last year. But I don't know if the risk of it being worse is worth it.  I could stay in running start. The upside is that I can work more and my job is amazing, I am so fortunate to have my dream job at such a young age, but I miss high school so much, just not the high school been at since 7th grade. I could try to stick it out another year, cheer, school, work, and all, but it just feels like I really need a fresh start and I don't know how else to get one. There's a school I've wanted to go to but their team has already had tryouts, so if I go there, I cant cheer.  So I'm torn between a few options and I need advice 

I could... 

1. stay in running start and ignore high school entirely until graduation. The upside is I get to work more and I'm happiest at work. Plus id gets to go to the gym more which I've been wanting to do. The downside is that I really want to finish high school in high school and there's no sense of a community, or really a chance to meet new people my age. 
2. Go to a different running start college. We have a university option available so the upside is that I could get some credits in and meet some new people. The downside is that lots of the girls from cheer go there and I don't really want to have to see any of them plus, it would mean I barely get a senior year, only graduation.  
3. Go to an entirely new high school. The upside is that I can still work more hours because cheer isn't an option, I get to have my summer and go visit colleges in California, meet new people, go to the gym more and get the fresh start/change in scenery I've been really wanting. The downside is that I know no one and I'm worried the people will be worse and I don't know if I want to risk an even worse experience.  On top of that, there's no possibility of cheering because they've already had tryouts.  
4. Stay at my home school and not cheer. Honestly, this would SUCK suck but the thought of being in my safety blanket seems nice
5. Stay at my home school and cheer. The upside is the activity of cheering and some of the teachers there that I like. The downside is that id gets no summer, id still has to deal with the awful people, the same scenery (that's driving me crazy) and I would have to balance cheer, work, and school. I did that this year but honestly I've been really miserable about it all year. 

One of the big things I should mention is that I have intentions of moving to California for college, so in about a year ill be 3 states away.

929,"[Reposting in hopes of more responces now America is awake]

I Have reason to suspect that I'm being targeted and harrassed by a cyber stalker, and evidence points to it being my abusive ex or his new partner.

Background- At 18 I was in a mentally and physically abusive relationship with a man, which lasted a year before I finally left him.

Now, about 4 years on, I am experiencing online harassment and catfishing which has been going on for over a year.

I'm Gonna explain why I think my ex is behind this, and I'd like you to help evaluate the clues with me to tell me if it is him or not, or what could be going on?

It began when I strange Instagram account followed me and began liking and commenting on my posts, it also followed my boyfriend and sister. This account had no name or face on it, all the pictures were just random stuff like landscapes. I Went snooping and discovered that the account was following some people I know of including a few women who've dated my abusive ex, including his current partner. I Went on to the insta page of his current partner and found that a couple photos she'd posted matched the pictures on the strange profile. This lead me to believe she's made this profile to stalk her boyfriend's exes.

To find out more, I sent her a few anonymous questions on Ask.FM. I Asked if she's ever looked up any of her partner's exes online, to which she responded, 'Who of us hasn't?😅' I Also asked if she's ever catfished anyone, to which she admitted she has 'in the past' if she 'needed to find some information'. These responces solidified in my mind it was probably her.

I Went a further, deciding to add her in snapchat to see how she'd react. When I did so, she added me back, and messaged me, 'Hey, who's this?' I Didn't respond, and a few minutes later she reached out again something like, 'It's okay if it was just a random add, I don't mind meeting new people😊' After which point I just removed her.

Not long after those messages, maybe a few days or so, I get added on snapchat by guy friend I hadn't spoken to in a while. Now I need to provide a little more background, early on in the relationship with my ex I ended up sleeping with his best friend and he found out. Yes, I know how awful that is, I was wrong for it and am fully remorseful. But, it happened, and it's somewhat relevant. My ex (Then bf) chose to forgive me and stay with me, though it damaged the relationship irreversibly. Anyway, this guy who adds me on SnapChat is the friend who I cheated with. I Did have some friendship with him after me and the ex split, though we weren't as close. I Was suspicious when he added me due to the fake account on Insta. I Told him about it, and gave him a test to see if he was real, I asked what town I was from? Initially he gave the wrong answer, he said the name if the town my current boyfriend is from. When I said he was wrong he said, 'Wait, but I thought moved in with your partner?' I Descided to class it as a pass as I had been staying at my boyfriends so much I could see why he'd assume that, plus how would my ex's new-gf know where my boyfriend is from? I Carried on talking to this account for a couple weeks, it seemed legit. Until one day I sent him a pic and he asked, 'What's that ring?' Referring to the one I always wear on my right ring finger. This sparked suspicion as he already knows about that ring. This is when I finally realised this was catfish, and I blocked the account.

Things were quiet for a while. The Insta was still sporadically active, but didn't exactly bother me. One day I started using  YOLO. For those who don't know about it, it's an app paired with SnapChat which lets you receive and send anonymous messages. I Got a lot of things sent to me on there, and what was strange was that most of them, in a round about way, related to my ex or past relationship, asking question connected to stuff only my ex or his family would know. For example, someone asked if I'd ever called 999, to which I said no, but I'd been involved in an incident where someone  else had to.  (That incident was when the police were called when my ex and his brother had a fight in their flat) the person kept asking more questions about it. Also someone was asking if I'd ever cheated, and whether I'd ever been in an abusive relationship? When I said yes to these things they delved for more detail.

Around that same time, I got a friend request from an old school friend on fb, and she also added me on SnapChat. After not long I discovered both those accounts were not actually her. I Had the fake account on my SnapChat when I was getting all the weird questions, so that explains that.

Then, there was one incident outside of the internet. I Went for a walk recently and while I was resting on a bench a black car parks behind me, rolls down it's window, and is just sat there for like 5 minutes as if they're watching me. I Don't know is it was related to all the other stuff, but it triggered my already severe anxiety and made me scared to go out again.

Now the most recent event, after multiple fake account adding me  a fake account was made of myself. Someone inormed me there was a Kik account using my name and picture. I Messaged the account asking why they were doing that, and also contacted the police. The account did not reply to or even open my message, the police couldn't do anything.

I Was now starting to question if my ex's  new partner was really the one behind this, it seemed that way at first but with all the other stuff it didn't make sense. I Descided to send her some more anonymous questions as I had before. This time I asked, 'Have you ever tried to message any if your partner's exes'? And 'Have you ever pretended to be someone else online?' To the first she said yes in the past if she's had reason to, and to the second she confessed some story about making a fake FB when she was a teen to add her crush. I Then asked if she's aware there's an Instagram using her pics, to this she said, 'No???' I Told her the name if it and that it's likely her boyfriend behind it. When it done that she said she actually does know the one I'm talking about now, that someone had told her about it long ago as it also took some pics off her friends account. She said she'd reported and blocked it at the time, and asked why it would be her husband? I Sent a message explaining that 'someone I know' had been harassed recently by a lot of fake account and i wouldn't be surprised if it was her man. She said she doesn't know why he'd do that, and asked whoever this is to DM her. Of course I didn't, and I stopped sending her stuff after that.

So, at least 4 fake accounts have added/followed me, and one has been made of me.

Despite everything pointing to my ex and his partner, i still have doubts-

 For one, even though her oictures beibg in the weird insta seem ti make it obvious it's  her, ir almost seems *too* obvious. Why would she be dumb enough to put the same pics on her real and fake instas? What if someone was trying to out me off the scent? Also, not every pic ib there matched with her insta, only about 2. I've Looked at it again more recently and there are pictures take  from skme other people's instas, not just her's.

Also, how do I even know all of these things are connected? How do I know the person who made the Instagram is necessarily the same one who made the SnapChat, or Facebook, or Kik account?

And then there's motive. When it was just the one Instagram it made sense it could be my ex's partner checking out her boyfriend's exes. But, why would she do any if the other stuff, why would she want to target me like this? And as to my ex, yes he was quite controlling, but since we split he honestly hasn't bothered me. I Haven't heared a peep from him in years. It wasn't until  almost 2 years since we split that this all began. Why would he suddenly start doing this years later out of nowhere, when he's apparently moved on? 

Could this be a massive double bluff and my real stalker is framing them? Am I just paranoid and this is all silly?

I think he is a pervert online trying to get her. He lives nine hours away and last week Sam was really upset and told me that Toby attempted suicide for the 15th time. Then yesterday, my friend texted me and said Toby is gonna meet up with her soon. Toby is always sending overlly filtered pictures and i think it is to stop people from tracing them back to where he got them from. My friend has recieved shirtless pictures from him and Toby likes to talk about having sex with her when they meet up. Sam has also told me they have talked about going skinny dipping. Toby has only sent two heavily filtered photos to Sam up until today, they have also never video called. The photos he sent Sam today were also heavily filtered (i know this cause Sam sent the pictures to me.) I was disgusted, because one of them was shirtless and even if this dude in the small odd is 15 almost 16, he shouldn't send that to a 13 year old. From what Sam has told me he likes to get high and drink a lot too. There are some other things but it would take forever to list them off. My parents know this is happening and are trying to help me give her signs this isn't a good idea. I think whoever this person is, they have groomed her. I can't straight up tell her that he is probably a pedophile because she has cut tons of people out of her life and i know she will just do that to me too. She has also been acting out ever since she started dating him. Like shortly before everybody had to stop physically attending school she told our friend (who has BPD, ADHD, autism and anxiety) ""why can't you just kill yourself you get in the way all of the time"" after he couldnt do a project we were working on. I don't like her attitude lately and i am only still talking to her because i dont want her to get raped or kidnapped, i may not like some things she said, but i wouldn't wish something like that on my worst enemy i have seen the effects of that on a friend of mine who was raped and it seems like she has no one else in her life that really cares enough about her to help her.

932,"I'm in university, but because of the coronavirus I've been back home with my parents for the last 5-6 weeks. The only unfortunate thing is that my dad's a doctor and his hospital was declared a pandemic hospital, but other than that fortunately I have my own room and internet connection through these times. I also have lots of course work to do but it's not that bad since I'm a freshman. 

However, I feel extremely depressed and find it difficult to do the smallest things. I'm not diagnosed or anything but even brushing my teeth seems impossible. I don't really talk about these things with my family and now obviously my dad is under a whole lot more stress than me, so I'd feel like a jerk bringing this up with them. I've never been the one to talk about my feelings with family.

So my question is, does anybody have any advice on how I should deal with this lack of energy and anxiety and stress I've been feeling?

934,"I (18F) work at a resturaunt and I've become very friendly with an older lady we'll call Dolly who's in her late 60's (Idk her actual age, I asked once and she said not to ask a woman that so oops). To give an idea of what she's like, she's super tiny (about 4'11 and maybe 90lbs), super nice to everyone, and actually baked me a cake once (it wasn't even my birthday either) inspired by my ringtone which was a Beatles song (it was a strawberry creme cake she called the ""Strawberry Fields Cake""). Literally an angel.


Today she came into work, clearly beat the fuck up. I'm talking about a black eye, dark black and purple bruising on the entire left side of her face from cheekbone to jawline, and another bruise on her forehead just missing her temple. She was telling everyone she got drunk and tripped over her coffee table, but I could tell that there was multiple points of impact, not just one from a fall she described.


So naturally, when I was on my lunch break and she was grabbing her things to end her shift, I asked her what the real story was. I made a joke about her getting into a bar fight (because that's totally out of character for her). She ended up shutting the break room door, and told me the truth: her old man did it.


I can't even explain the feeling I got when she told me. It was like a mix of rage, sadness, and just shock. Especially because I've met her husband before. He's a bulky ass dude. A brick wall of a person. At least a couple good inches taller than my bf who's 6'2, and 250lbs or more. Not muscular so much as just a giant dude. 


I tried to tell her that she needs to leave, she seems to have accepted it as a normal thing. She told me it was her fault because she ""doesn't know how to keep her mouth shut"". I asked how long it's been going on and she said about a year after they got married 32 years ago.


I called the local safe house and they say they can't just talk to her about considering it, she has to call them and they'll pick her up and even drive her to and from work, she just has to be willing.


I just can't stand the idea of anyone hurting such a genuinely wholesome and kind human being, and I want to do everything in my power to help her.


Does anyone have any experience with things like this? I need advice because I don't even know where to start.",24Apr2020,1
935,"Hey everyone 👋 

So, I feel a bit stupid posting this because some people have no choice but to go out and work. Also, people are losing family members to this disease. 

Quarantine is impacting so many people in so many different ways, this is starting to get to me now. I have OCD and I’m also on the ASD spec, so something as disruptive as a pandemic has really thrown me off. 

Where I live, the shielding group began to be informed last month; this group have to stay indoors for 12 weeks. I thought I had escaped this list and celebrated, today I received a text out of the blue telling me I am on the list and cannot even go out to empty my bins or have a walk. I knew people would slip through the cracks of this list, but I didn’t think I’d be one of them; I’m a bit annoyed that I was told I was at no higher risk initially and I’ve spent the last month going out each week. 

I’d started to get into the swing of lockdown and found happiness in my new routines, this has made it really weird now. 

I’m not sure I am even looking for advice, I just wanted to talk about it. My friendly have been a bit dismissive, which I understand because we’re all stuck indoors anyway and also I tend to joke about everything. But this I don’t find funny.

939,"hi, 

This is my first post in this subreddit, and it's probably very generic by now. But I'm gonna write it down regardless in hopes to find a solution or an advice that would help me.

I used to be a very studious child, I didn't explore many things, tho I have many hobbies but no goals. I didn't do much exploring during my childhood, was very introvert and most what I learned about life and the things I like was off of the internet.

I'm now a 19 yo engineering student, I didn't pursue that degree because I like it, I don't know what I like. It's just one of the choices that I was offered and I followed it.

So when I was about to make a decision, about which career to pursue, it was tough. One day I want to be a doctor, the other a writer, then a teacher, then an engineer, then a vet, then carpenter... I never really had any idea. Because I know I am attracted to arts, but I'm also attracted to people and their lives, but then I wanna know more about the world and pursue science... It's just too much at once and it's just leads me to collapse every time. Because a jack of a trades is a master of none, and I can't seem to master anything because I drop it as soon as I start.

I've been thinking for 4 years now about ""what are the things I like?"", but I don't know them, because I don't have anything that I stick to, I abandoned most of the hobbies that I started and I only get back to them once in a blue moon because they feel boring or tedious or no longer joyful. This lead me so many times to question whether it's an identity issue, because I don't have any drive or passion about anything. I do read a lot, however, I like to know about different topics and fields but that's about it, I can't seem to find anything to pursue. And the more I look around, the more I see my peers having future plans, goals, desires, and they are planning their paths to achieve them, meanwhile my journey is just getting good marks and that's it? 

Even when it comes to my day to day life, I don't find joy in playing games or making new connections or watching that new trendy show or movie. It always been basically a loop of waking up, eating, studying, watching youtube or reading something, chatting and then sleeping. 

I feel like I'm wasting my life at this point, and I've been wasting it since long ago. I do wanna be successful, but how and at what? I don't know.

TL;DR : Passionless about everything",24Apr2020,1

945,"(Sorry in advance for the long read.)
    The title sounds really dramatic, but just bear with me. I, a 15 year old girl, have lived in the same house as my step dad for about ten years. We used to be good friends, but about a year ago, crap kinda hit the fan. My brother was going around doing not-so-good teenager things, and almost got himself killed (long story, and idk if it's even allowed) and my mom's dad died. On top of that, I was getting bullied at school and struggling with body issues. But the biggest shiz-pickle in this whole poo storm, my step dad had a stroke. He lost hearing in his ear and had to stay in the hospital for a week (it was triggered by a surgery gone wonky, by the way.) Now, this is going to sound a bit biased, just strap in I guess. 
    After getting back from the hospital, he comes home... Different. He started arguments about everything, and held any problem over us, all while preaching that he was 'tortured'. We all kinda dealt with it, writing it off as just a bad mood. I mean, he went through a lot. He'd get better... Right?
   Wrong. It continued to get worse and worse to the point where he was screaming through the locked bathroom door (my door didn't have a lock) and he even took the handle off of my brother's door so that he couldn't lock it. We couldn't write it off anymore, as it had been going on for months by then, and eventually we had to stay with our dad. We didn't talk to them for at least a month, and they kept our keys so we couldn't get in. After a while, I got back in contact with my mom and she gave me the keys to the house, but the step dad wouldn't let my brother in, so I stayed with my dad for another month(ish) and eventually came back.
   About a year passes and I deal with his outbursts, and we just kinda live. Flash forward to the other day, when he starts talking smack about my brother, and then me, and then my dad AND my mom (right in front of her) and I have to leave to keep things from escalating. I did call him a prick, and I know I shouldnt have. 
   Anywho, yesterday, my mom tries to get him to come downstairs and talk to me, to which he says no and she mentioned divorce. Needless to say, Things. Got. Crazy.
   He explodes on her and yells that we all broke his heart, etc. and I can hear everything from all the way downstairs with the tv playing. Mom comes down, and we decide we're just going to bed and she'll take the couch.
    You'd thing that is where the story ends, but no. 
    He comes out screaming again, and he rants for a good twenty minutes about how my brother and dad were poisoning me against him, how I stabbed him in the back, etc. I remained as calm as I could, even when he called me evil and kept saying that I was a piece of crap for hating him. I told him to screw off and left, to which he called me a b**ch and stormed away.
    And it doesn't end there, folks. 
    He came back after eating dinner and started again. My mom had come to talk to me, and he listened in until he had the right chance to break in. He called me a monster, called me a cancer. That is no lie. A cancer. 
    We were up until 11pm (he got home at 7ish, btw) trying to calm him down as he paced back and forth in the hall, screaming. Any time he steps into my room, I tell him to step away. If he passed the doorframe, he was too close, and every time I told him to back up, he got worse. I asked my mom to step inside so I could lock the door, and he starts talking the screws out of the door, ready to pull it off its hinges. He said he could get in even if I locked the door.
    In an attempt to calm him down and to resolve the situation, she mentioned letting me stay at my dad's house. He exploded again. How dare she even think of sending me over there to be poisoned? How dare she put me in danger? That was his reasoning. 
    The situation died down after a bit more screaming, and my mom layed down with me in my room. She ended up going back to him later, but it ended for now.

946,"I [F] was 19 years old when I was manipulated and forced into an intimate relationship with my boss [49M]. I'll call him ""Justin"". Justin was emotionally and verbally abusive, and he created a controlling environment with rules and threats. He violently raped me. I developed PTSD and attempted suicide at a gun range as a result.

My best friend, we'll call him ""Alan"" [38M]. He was my colleague and my confidant through the abusive relationship. Alan and Justin knew each other and worked together. Alan would try to stand up for me, and Justin professionally retaliated against him for doing so. Alan was always supportive...but he doesn't see things in black and white/good and bad. He sees the grey area, and he appreciates that nobody is perfect. Sometimes, I feel bitter that he never straight out told me, ""You're being abused, get out."" Instead, he would try to help me navigate the relationship with Justin so I would be punished less.


Now: 
I'm almost 2 years out of the relationship with Justin. I achieved some legal justice. With therapy, medication, and supportive friends, I've made significant improvements in my mental health. I'll never ""get over it"", but I'm in a good place now.

Yesterday, Alan told me he wanted to make amends with Justin. He said he felt guilty about burning bridges at our old job, and he doesn't want to have bad blood with anyone. I understand where he's coming from. But the idea that Alan wants to forgive someone who violently raped me makes me wonder if he is truly my friend.
I told him, ""You can do whatever you want, but I don't support it.""
Alan insisted that he doesn't want to be his friend, and only wants to make sure there are ""no hard feelings"".

950,"So this could be a complete shot in the dark. 

I don’t want to get too in detail just because this is a public forum and I would be destroyed if my identity was revealed (burner account) but here I go.

In my late twenties, I am finding loving myself, enjoying life, living, waking up, etc almost impossible to do. I used to be incredibly creative, motivated, and setting goals for myself every day. At one point, I felt loved by my peers, and I genuinely thought I would have my friends forever and that we were all on a path to success together.  I have now lost pretty much every friend I have ever had, either due to personal differences (both of us treating the other unfairly) or from people who at one point had romantic or sexual desires for me not getting what they wanted, and then deciding to make me look bad to everyone else in the group in order to make themselves feel better. I will say that I lost the majority of my friends on account of people pursuing me, and then attempting to make me look bad to others after feeling rejected, either by lying or using their friendships with others to alienate me. 

This has made me feel incredibly isolated and depressed and honestly embarrassed to even post anything I’ve created online for fear of harassment or just knowing what someone might have to say. It really crushes me because I put so much in people who turned out to be so obsessed with drama, that they burned my friendship.  Recently, I started abusing recreational substances to cope with this loss, and it ended up having some very traumatic consequences (I did not hurt anyone just to clarify, I was hurt by someone else in a way I do not wish to share) that may affect me for the rest of my life. 

I feel like I don’t know myself anymore. I feel like I can’t even fully develop social relationships anymore, partly because I am afraid of others betraying me, and partly because I have become completely apathetic to almost everything that I used to enjoy.  I have stopped using all substances, and I have been going to a therapist since that night, but nothing seems to be helping. I would be lying if I didn’t say there were days that I truly couldn’t see the point of living any more.  I do have a relationship with someone I care about very much, but I can’t help but feel as if I am in fact weighing them down too now.

I used to feel like I was on a good path, like I knew where I was headed and couldn’t wait for all of the adventures that life holds. Now I feel the days flying by, too many to count. Doing anything creative seems fruitless, because there are so many skilled creators out there who are leagues ahead of me, and didn’t make the same mistakes that I have made. I just don’t feel like I will ever truly fit in at this point. Maybe I would have been able to, but now too much has happened, and I just feel entirely alone. Add the quarantine to this, and you can pretty much assume all I do is play video games and barely even shower or do anything to take care of myself really. Even going on a walk or exercising seems completely pointless, and whenever I try to do something creative, I usually end up getting lost in my own negative thoughts and beating myself up in my head until I start crying, and then I give up and play video games to get my mind off of it. 

TL;DR 

I guess what I’m asking is:

To those of you who have experienced trauma, loss, betrayal, and/or the ridicule of others to the point where it felt like everyone you’ve ever known hated your guts (whether you feel you deserved it or not) how did you regain your self confidence and ability to put yourself out there again? How did you find that creative spark again and feel the buzzing of a great idea in your head? How did you learn to trust yourself and others? How did you get your voice back? What made you realize that life does matter?",24Apr2020,1

952,"To start off, I'm M16. Last September I met a girl at school, we'll call her Sal. Sal and I shared a table in math class for a week or two, and a few times she even tried to spark a conversation with me on the way to another class. After just maybe a few weeks, one of her other school friends added me and her to a group chat for our math class. I'm still not quite sure why she did, but this one GC of just 3 people became one of my main sources of social interaction, these two people becoming my only two actual female friends, especially Sal. Since the creation of the group chat, she and I became pretty damn close, mainly texting each other and chatting in class. Turns out we have a ton of things in common, both being massive nerds. Being the lonely mf I am, it wasn't long before I had a decent crush on her.

Within the last 4 or 5 months, there hasn't been a single day where we didn't have a decent chat, and there's been a lot of nights where we would stay up really late talking about random shit, sharing memes with each other, making inside jokes, talking about our personal and even somewhat private problems, etc etc. She has always been unbelievably kind, supportive, and chatty with me, and most advancements of our friendship have been made by her; first talking to me in the hallway, first directly messaging me, etc etc. Generally I have found that she is even more aggressively friendly towards me than vice versa, sometimes desperately keeping sleepy conversations alive, for instance. At some point, there seemed to be enough mounting evidence that she might actually feel the same way about me. There really had never been a girl who has treated me this way before, and I finally started to feel as though maybe I had found someone who I could potentially have a relationship with.

However, there's a lot of problems with the concept. I know there are one or two people who Sal has been into either during or very recently before we met, and she seems to be founding a potential relationship with someone else as well (it should be noted she has never had a relationship before either). As of just the past week, I know they have facetimed and even hung out together briefly, two things I have never really done with her. This leaves me in a rather awkward spot; I have a big crush on her, it's seemed likely that she likes me back, but seems to also be chasing someone else simultaneously. I find it very difficult to tell if someone likes me or not, especially her. I know that in general, she is very chatty and affectionate towards a lot of her close friends, so it's possible that the way she has acted towards me is just how she acts in general, in which case, oof. It's also possible she likes me *and* somebody else, but they are just jumping on the opportunity faster than I am (I generally don't flirt TOO obviously and tend only to be friendly to the same degree that she is towards me. Anxiety ftw). 

I am pretty lost as to what to do now. Should I be more flirty with her, or even tell her how I feel or ask her out? That could put our friendship at stake. Do I accept the possibility that she probably just really likes me as a friend and person, but in no romantic way? That would be painful and at this point, maybe premature.

Complicated ‘friendship’ with my teacher

Before I start, we are both the same gender(females) so nothing weird here. She first taught me in grade 10. We got really close and on the last day of classes she asked me to find things to do together in the summer. We stayed in touch and went to the movies once. In grade 11 I wasn’t in her class but I visited her in break every once in a while &amp; we went out a couple of times. In the summer, she went radio silence unless I texted. In grade 12, I was back in her class. It was awkward for me because I thought of her more as friend. On her birthday that year, I arranged a surprise party for her with the class and got her a small gift with a note telling how how I loved her despite us growing apart. She responded by promising me never to grow apart, that she will always be there and that she loved me like her own kids, very close friends &amp; sister. We had lunch afterwards and she said she’d like that we do this more often. She would always check on me by texting or calling. However, by mid-year I was the only one initiating conversations and it really hurt me. I expressed how I felt to her (maybe not in the best way possible) through a long message, she said she felt lost &amp; confused and was really sorry I felt the way. And that she does truly love me and care about it. She said that love and hurt don’t go together and it seemed that she genuinely felt sorry. I waited for her to say or do anything for the following 2 weeks but nothing... she continued to treat me like a stranger at school. I was really hurt and couldn’t take it so I sent her another message telling her I wished we talked things out but i won’t disturb her if that’s what she wants. She told me we could meet up in an hour to talk. We met and she said she never got into such a ‘fight’ ever before and that she won’t take any more accusations. We cleared some misunderstandings on both sides. And she told me that I expected too much from her and that it’s best not to expect anything from anyone to avoid misunderstandings. She told me to ask her anything at the time and she won’t take any of my inquiries again. I asked her if she was okay with us being that close and she said I was impossible and that of course and relationships just happen. But I still felt distant and unfortunately hurt. So I tried to lower my expectations cause I feel like I’m just another student to her and she means more to me than I do to her.
Covid19 came and I didn’t think we would talk but surprisingly she texted to check on me and has been nicer to me. However, I don’t want to get attached to her and get hurt again cause it still hurts tbh and I don’t think I can take it anymore. Also, a week ago she was having a problem with my class and asked me to help and I was there for her and she she thanked me for it and said she loved me and referred to me as her daughter and it really hurt. I don’t want to get attached to her and I’m not completely over her either. So, what do you think? Is it possible that she loves me? Should I keep distance? If so, how come because it’s really hard for me",24Apr2020,1

957,"Greetings. Currently I am working, although with much less reduced hours and do not know for how long I will be working for. Given the free time and the stimulus check, I feel like this would be the best time to try and go back to school online to maybe get a certificate or take courses to help find another career path. All the paths I was considering going to are nonessential, or require in person classes (I was thinking about finally becoming an electrician, but no colleges near me are offering courses online for it.) I was reccommended coding or something in the arts, but I have been attempting to improve my art for the past 15 years and have seen little to no progress, and would prefer something a little more hands on. If I could find work with this through COVID, it would be preferred. It does not have to be a career per se, just something I can work on to maybe save money in order to make a living and eventually return to school.

There are more than a 1000 cases of Coronavirus in my city. 

I live with my mother, sister and cousin. My father works in another country (not native country) and for our ‘safety’, he let his sister’s son (my cousin) live with us. He had his reasons too. He needed a place to stay and wasn’t making much money to afford basic needs. 

Now this cousin of mine is outside the house all the time, meeting with his friends. His friends live in various shared apartments. And coronavirus is out of control in my region and he just won’t listen. He shows this weird attitude to my mother like ‘you can’t tell me what to do’. And then leaves and comes back hours later. When he comes back, he won’t take a bath (despite that being a rule) and goes straight to the kitchen to eat). 

We moved to this country a few years back and my father had to stay in the previous country. We are from a very patriarchal and toxic culture. South Asian to be exact. Families are suppose to everything no matter what. My mother takes care of us alone and let’s say she isn’t the most mentally strong person. And my father is always forced to serve his siblings. Thankfully my parents are very supportive of me and my sister and don’t want us to be in that culture. 

Because of some reasons back in our native country we can’t tell this cousin anything. My mother can’t tell him anything as a result and her in laws are horrible. My father’s brother and his family live in the next city and they are not very nice to my mother. He used to love with them for a while but his wife threw him out of the house, but he still tries to appease them.  

Anyways, my mother says she is not strong enough to stand up to him. And I can’t say anything to him because then his parents and rest of the family would give hell to my father. TBH we just don’t have the guts to talk to him because he is very disrespectful and my mother just takes it. 

She did talk to him some while back, but then he starts acting disrespectful and makes a face and won’t eat. 

Now, I have a very weak immune system and I am sick most of days in a year. Even right now, I have to visit the doctor (I don’t have coronavirus). And my next appointment is already booked. I get hospitalized once a year for sure. I had a surgery a few months back and the healing process takes a year. My sister has an ok immune system, way better than mine. Whenever my mother goes out to get grocery, she takes extreme caution and doesn’t let my sister or I leave the house 

My mother in the past, has dealt with stress and anxiety issues. Right now she’s going through the same, and my cousin is adding on way too much to that stress. He won’t listen at all. His parents (back in our native country) don’t give a fuck. She’s  really worried about me and my sister falling sick. Right now, she’s complaining of heart ache often and that’s really worrying me. I am really scared for her physical health and her mental condition is really worrying. 

We have thought of telling him to stay with his friend, call his parents, tell him the rules again, but we just don’t know how to talk to him without pissing him off 

I really need some advice. Any Advice tbh. Sorry if the post is long and Thank you.",24Apr2020,1

Lost memory
My whole life I’ve dealt with depression and anxiety. As a kid I hated people being behind me. I made sure I was at the end or out of line because It made me felt safe. It wasn’t until I was 14 that I had this nightmare of ( let’s call him x) molesting me. That night I woke up hating myself and crying. The dream felt so real. As time went by I kept putting it behind my mind. Like it was just a bad dream. 
I finally got the courage and told my parents after 18years that I’ve hold it a secret. The only other person I’ve told was my now wife because one day she jokey  tried to poke my butt hole and I snapped. I was so close to beater her. (Lucky I noticed what I was doing and apologized and explain why I snapped) 
I just want to know if all this just a fucked up dream or if it really happen. Should I confront x and ask him? I just want some closure on why am I the way I am? With my anxiety and depression, why I happy one day and sad or mad another day . It’s been so long that I want to bury this once in for all. How can I know if this really happen?",24Apr2020,1
963,"Throwaway account to remain anonymous. I am supposed to be a bridesmaid in my friend from high school’s wedding. The wedding is in June and despite a lot of weddings in that timeframe being postponed due to COVID, the bride is dead set on keeping the date for her dream wedding. 
A little bit of background, I am a cancer survivor and in a high risk population. I currently live in NYC, where the realities of COVID are very intense and widespread in my area. The wedding is in Texas and pretty much 200+ people are flying in for this wedding as neither the bride or groom’s families are local. 
Is it bad I f I missed the wedding? Of course in any other circumstance I would do ANYTHING to be there but I am so terrified of getting sick and even risking death. On top of that I think it’s irresponsible to ask so many people to travel at a time where we are supposed to be minimizing exposure to other people and trying to flatten the curve. 
Am I being unreasonable? I’ve been told things in Texas are not bad at all and life is pretty normal. But that’s exactly why I don’t want to go there and potential spread the disease to other parts of the country. My friends are saying everything will be so much safer in June but I’m not convinced.

964,"To give a background I'm an 18m and an existentialist. I don't believe in a god i have no real emotional connection to my family for past reasons.(not something I'm looking to change) 


For the last five years ive had this friend 18f lets call her dory for convenience sake. She's been my closest friend and the only person in my life that I've ever genuinely cared about. recently(past year or so) feelings developed but because of her living in a differant country we never went further than friends as we (mainly her) weren't prepared to do a long distance relationship. Despite this the feelings never faded between me and her and have remained in good contact calling almost everyday. 
Currently she is the only person I've ever been able to call family furthermore when ever i look to the futer she was always there. 

Today shes told me that she's been vibing with a guy from her school. ive accepted this as it would be unfair of me to ask her not to see him.
I know i haven't lost her as a friend and ill continue to talk to her and maintain that friendship but i cant help but feel completely at a loss for what to do with my life now.

965,"I completely cut off contact with a former friend a few months ago.  This might be kinda long but bear with me, I need to explain the circumstances so it's clear why I left.
This friend, who I'll call Jenny, was nice and stuff at first, but the more I found out about her the more I didn't really want to be associated with her.  She was being unfaithful to her then girlfriend and bragging about it, then complained about how her relationships never worked out.  
She would get extremely pissed off and jealous if any one of our friends in our group got in a relationship.  One time she even locked our friend, Sam, and his then boyfriend out of her car while it was cold and drizzling because ""they were being too affectionate.""  Eventually she ""apologized"" for it, but not until after weeks of acting like Sam was in the wrong for being upset.
She started causing drama at our workplace, trying to get with literally every guy there and then spreading rumors about a girl because she had done the exact same thing, to the point where said girl quit.  
She did deal with depression, but indirectly used it as an excuse for her behavior, and anytime any one of us needed to talk to her, she'd change the subject to be about how hard HER life was. And I never want to think that someone is using their depression to get attention, because I and a lot of my loved ones deal with it. But the way she constantly made things about her and always changed the subject to be about her depression, accompanied by how she straight up told me she didn't want any psychological help, makes me wonder.
There was other shitty stuff but I don't want this to be novel-length, so we're gonna move on.

I bring up all of this so you'll understand why I had had enough.  I quit my job and went to work at a better paying one, and after that I stopped talking to her completely.  She never did anything particularly bad to me, but the way she treated my friends wasn't acceptable.  She did some other stuff but I don't want to make this any longer than necessary. 
I restricted her on Instagram and ignored any message requests from her.  Then she started trying to contact me on other social media, even ones where I hadn't given her my information.  Eventually (a few months later) I ended up removing her from my followers on Instagram, and unfollowing her.  Unfortunately she noticed and followed me again. So I removed her. And she followed me again. And I removed her. And then the cycle repeated itself one last time before I blocked her. This happened over the course of a couple of days.
Then, I found out that she got a new job, since our old place of work shut down because of the pandemic.  She got a job at my workplace, in my department. One she KNEW I was in. 
She whispered my name when I walked past her one time and I ignored her, and now whenever she sees me at work she just STARES at me. 
And then yesterday she used a different Instagram account to contact me.
So, after a billion words (sorry about that, I just wanted it to be clear why I left this friend. Context is important here,) I'm finally asking for advice.  Am I in the wrong for just ghosting her?  And, even after all this time, should I finally just respond to her and tell her why I left and ask her to leave me alone?  Or should I just keep blocking her until she gets the hint?  I'm worried that if I talk to her she'll threaten me with self harm or suicide or something like that.  But I honestly don't know anymore.",24Apr2020,1

970,"When the announcement was made that the university was temporarily moving to remote learning, a professor messaged us, stating a wouldn't be continuing class until we arrived back to campus.

Now we're in the last week of the semester, and they're throwing together a last minute final project.

The University has refunded 50% of room and board, parking passes, and other similar fees. This professor isn't the only instance of this happening at this campus.

Understandable that they want it paid off but I'm now stuck in a weird situation with a mostly complete degree but not enough money to pay it off. I can get on a payment plan but I still wouldnt be able to sign up for classes even with the plan. I do have regular student loans that I am working to pay off as well.
