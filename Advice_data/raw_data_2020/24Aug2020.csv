0,"Very often I hear or read about people taking time to ""heal"" or ""work on themselves"" but I have never understood what that meant. Most of the time I will hear the phrase come up after someone goes through a traumatic event (losing a loved one, breaking up with a s/o, being cheated on, etc.), and I can't seem to understand the meaning behind it, or even how to do it. 

I have been striving to make self improvements in all aspects of my life, but one that is still lacking is my mental health. For a bit of background, I never had any experiences with ANYTHING related to mental health until my junior year of college. Without drowning you in details, I met a girl that had mental health issues (again, I never had a clue about anything mental health related up to this point in my life). We started dating and her mental issues were incredibly difficult for me to understand due to a combination of that being my first ever relationship, and never being exposed to mental health in the past. My girlfriend and I had an incredibly large falling out, broke up, and haven't talked in about 4 months.

Even though that much time has passed I still struggle most days with memories and strong emotions that typically aren't positive. My family was always the ""Suck it up and you'll get over it"" type. Lucky for me, up until this point in my life, that way worked. I know the right thing to do is to use this time to ""heal"" and to ""work on myself"", but what does this even mean and how do I start?",24Aug2020,1

2,"My best-friend (smh) is trying to hit my crush up.

He knows I liked her before he did but i dont know why he does that?

Maybe because she was also giving me signs(eye contact, smiles, etc)?

I'm a bit hesitant to go make a move on her, and he tries to ""win"" her just to piss me off.

(He even bought a pack of cigarettes 2 days ago just to ask her for a lighter, she gave him it but didn't hold conversation-i have noticed she is very moody when he is close to her and does not even speak)

Any advice? 

Go talk to her and ask her out before he succeeds?",24Aug2020,1
3,"This post is to vent just as much as asking for help. Im already have a psychologist, but i can only see her in a few weeks.


My parents were always ""nice"" to me but nothing more. They raised me to be educated and a proper functioning person but I feel like that's it. They were never there for me to the point of pretending my problems didnt exist when I grew up. I have several siblings and they are all on medication and diagnosed with mental disorders, despite financial success, and i presume my parents' style of raising us is a big reason.

I know my parents are only people, and I'm not blaming them for my problems but I feel like I can't overcome them. Let me give examples of my parents behaviour.

1)talk to me more like a coworker. Never want to discuss anything real. Our conversations rarely last more than 5 minutes and are always something factual

2) for example, when my now ex gf attempted suicide right in front of me but i saved her life i came home to my parents for support.. they just told me ""onto the next one"" and kept bringing up how fresh the food they bought was that day whenever there was silence to prevent me from talking about my ex

3) extended family members have bullied me or outright touched me inappropriately ""ironically"" right in front of them and they did nothing if they even noticed at all. Just pretended nothing happened.

Theres a lot more but you get the gist. They arent abusive but they are so neglectful when i needed them most it borders on abuse.

I had a revelation the other day when playing a video game me and my dad both like and play a lot (indivually, but it has multiplayer). I kind of thought we bonded over us liking this video game and then I realized: us both liking the same thing isnt a real bond. He never even wanted to play it with me or even wanted to talk about it with me when i brought it up. I finally realized my bond with my father is mostly imagined and it crushed me. But I think I needed to realize this because it made me realize its not my fault that my parents dont want to connect. They are just like that.

Now onto my issues. I feel like im not really capable of relationships and friendships to an extent.

You may have noticed i had an ex, but both of my relationships have basically completely revolved around puppy love and constant sex with equally fucked up people and ended after just a few months.

My friendships arent much better. I recently realized that most of my friends were also very emotionally distant. I feel like im making progress here at least because recently ive made a few healthy friendships who are emotionally open. But it was always a challenge for me and I remember having parent teacher meetings about me basically being overly anti-social thats how bad it was.

I recently got a hamster. It was left alone during the first 3 months it was growing up, and never learned to be around people so its very anti-social even for a hamster and will probably never change. Am I like my hamster? Am I doomed to be mostly distant and unavailable like my parents. I see people in normal healthy relationships and I dont understand how they do it.",24Aug2020,1
4,"TL;DR I am having anxiety in multiple aspects of my life, and they are all feeding off of each other even though I know that they don't even make sense. How do I keep from having self destructing thoughts?

I have been feeling very anxious recently, and after some self reflection I have pinpointed it to a few reasons and added some realizations too. I am looking for any advice you may have on how to make myself feel better. I am currently looking for a therapist, but I would appreciate any additional insight.

1. I am currently unemployed and in the middle of a career/industry shift. It has proven to be very difficult due to the field being extremely competitive and covid taking away many job opportunities. I went to a top university and worked at a top engineering company in the past. I see my friends currently with their jobs getting promotions, etc and it is very hard for it not to make me feel like I am falling behind.
2. I am very entrepreneurial and want to start investing in real estate, but it's impossible to do because I am currently unemployed with no W-2 income. I am working a part-time, remote customer service job that covers my monthly expenses (student loans, bills, etc).
3. I am currently living at home with my family, who I love very much and get along with well. However this also makes me feel like I am falling behind for some reason.
4. I am started seeing this guy since I have been living at my family's. I find myself obsessing over whether or not I am ""good enough"" for him and keep picking out my insecurities. I do think that maybe this is stemming from my unemployment and feeling like I don't have my life together enough because of this. He is older than me (only a few years) and I look younger for my age, so I feel insecure that he is embarrassed to be seen with me in public. I know this is ridiculous and most likely not true since he was the one who originally approached me, but I can't help but think that. I am also anxious about knowing where we stand/how he feels about me/where he sees this going. This doesn't even make sense because I don't even know how I feel or what I really want from it. I am pretty content with where we are at now, just taking things pretty slow and being pretty casual. I am also just feeling ugly all the time even though I know I am decently attractive.
5. I find myself getting especially anxious when I am by myself or at home with my family, not with my friends or when I am out. This is the time when my mind starts spinning and the anxiety kicks in.
6. I think that there is just a lot of unknowns in my life right now and it is making my very anxious. I also find myself worrying about the future, and thinking what-if's... what if I don't succeed in my career life to the extent I want... what if my dreams of real estate investing don't pan out... what if I don't wind up meeting someone and getting married and having a family...

Do you guys have any advice on how to keep myself from having these thoughts, and how to stay more positive? I feel that it's just a cycle of my different insecurities feeding into my other insecurities. I at least realize how illogical some of these thoughts are, which is a start... but how do I keep myself from having these thoughts?",24Aug2020,1
5,"I love kids and believe in education but I don’t know what career to do because I hate the schooling system. 
I think it institutionalises children and doesn’t teach them to be independent or creative it just force feeds them information. It’s pretty evil how we teach them to obey and not question authority in order to prepare them to live in a capitalist society where their main value is being components in a system. Hate it. 
I want to help children flourish and develop as people, as social and emotional beings and cope in the society we live in, as part of a community.

7, my girlfriend cheated on me 2 and a half months into our relationship i had a lot of feelings for her and when she told me it felt like the worst day of my life she told me that she doesn’t deserve me and that i should leave her she said she regretted it all and had to be honest after that i forgave her but only for revenge my plan was to take her virginity and cheat on her and then tell her what i did but what ended up happening was i kind just forgot about it for a month and thats when it started i started getting random thoughts of her cheating and how she did it willingly and how wrong it was then i told her to tell me every detail she told me that they only kissed and it was short still i feel so broken and betrayed after that i cheated on her multiple times even had sex with another girl i also took her virginity and she is super happy and grateful to have me but i dont know what to do i keep remembering what she did to me and it’s driving me crazy the fact that i got my revenge makes it a bit less painful but i havent told her and i dont plan to i love her and don’t want to hurt her feelings but at the same time i hate her and cant forgive her for what she did my heart hurts every time i think about it and i think about it multiple times a day sometimes when im about to fall asleep i think about how it all went don’t and how she let that happen and i cry a lot at night knowing no one will know i know im a scumbag for doing all this but it felt like the only way i could feel better,24Aug2020,1

11,"This might sound confusing but let me explain. I feel like I can’t tell how I feel about people romantically, whether I’m just “attached” or “like the idea of them.” It’s always been super hard for me to figure out. For example, my last ex broke up with me. I was super depressed for around 2 months after that, but here’s the thing. When I’m depressed and in a bad mood, I’m not feeling like omg I miss him or flashbacking to our memories together or crying over him being gone and stuff. In fact after every break up I’ve had, my bad mood and sadness literally has NOTHING to do with that person. I am only depressed because I feel like I made a mistake. Like I was not good enough and how can I be better for the next person etc. I feel like it’s just all about me, and I don’t mean it in a way that I’m questioning my worth for my ex. I feel like I’m a perfectionist and due to past events that happened in my life it’s shaped me in a way where I must be perfect in everything I do. I have to be super attractive all the time, I have to be super smart, everyone has to want to be friends with me, everyone has to have a crush on me, and the moment something doesn’t go in the way I expect I let it crush on me completely and I feel like I am not perfect and not good enough and I start overthinking every single day on how to be better and be more perfect. This breakup is an example of that. All of my friends think I’m super heartbroken even he thinks he broke my heart, because of how sad I’ve been but I constantly question the reason for my sadness. I’m sad because I feel like I embarrassed myself and I’m not who I wanted to be. Like if I were more perfect, my ex would have wanted to stay with me forever. I expect it always to be like that. Sorry this is kind of a vent but I have always felt like this after every breakup I’ve had. Instead of feeling sad and heartbroken over missing the person, I just feel angry at myself for not being good enough and everytime I date I don’t even date in a way where I’m looking to see if that person is a match for me. I date where I HAVE to get them to like me or else I’m not good enough, without even caring if I like them back in return. Sorry if this is kinda confusing to read but I guess I just wanted to ask... how do you know if you genuinely like someone? Did I even have actual feelings for my ex or was it all just about proving something to myself? Do I have mental issues??? I feel like this isn’t normal. Thanks.",24Aug2020,1
12,"My cousin who is autistic and doesn't have a lot of friends, Wants to be a part of a friend group but rarely goes to school, so he sometimes invites me over and tells me to bring some friends (which I'm okay with) and I will sometimes invite him to come hang at my place with some friends. But he almost never wants to hang out with me alone and always asks if I can bring some friends.

I sometimes don't want him to hang out with me and my friends because he can be annoying, only sits on his phone and sometimes he just uses my friends to act cool and popular for girls. He will for example DM girls on Instagram, acting like he is one of my friends (who the girl knows) on his phone while they aren't even there.

When I hang out with my friends and he isn't invited, he will text me passive aggressively why he wasn't invited and tell his mother ( my aunt) about it who will then get mad at my mother, saying she should tell me that that's unfair and stuff. The reason he find s out that I am hanging with some friends is because checks the map on snapchat regularly do find where everyone is.

13,I have a boyfriend currently just going through the motions. It’s been like 8 months-ish off and on he’s pretty cool we do a lot of fun stuff together. I’m soooooo  Open about how I feel and I don’t feel like he exactly believes it .I told him I feel like dating for more than 2 years is not super smart. He wants to plan vacations really far out. He wants to buy a home near me. He wants go here and there and do the and that. He jokes about cohabitation and I always say no I’m not a couch. if I’m gonna live with a man I’ll move in a few weeks before the wedding once everything is paid for and we’re sure and confident about it. He’s 26 I’m 20 and I’m wondering if he’s actually really listening when I tell  him this isn’t very serious. I understand everyone gets cheated on. I understand most relationships don’t work. I feel the likely hood of myself meeting my husband at 20 is like -0.1.  I look at relationships as someone to go out with maybe travel. I don’t really like the drama or stress I want a very fun light hearted relationship without thoughts of a long term  future. Before everyone comes at me like ummm you should be single you don’t need to be dating etc etc. I’m asking for advice on how to really get my current boyfriend to understand this is fun for me and how to explain it to future parents,24Aug2020,1
14,"Hi guys! I’m having a hard time finding out if I’m adopted or not! You guys mind giving me you’re opinion? Here’s what has made me wonder if I am. 
I’ve always had darker skin since I was a baby there’s pics of me next to my “brother” where I stick out like a sore thumb. I’ve always been told that I “tan easy” and that I’m Caucasian. Although I regularly get mistaken for being light skin. I live in England and as you can imagine we don’t get too much sun and my “tan” has never faded even during the lockdown when staying indoors for at least 4 months. I have never met my father and was told he left when he found out my mother was pregnant. I was also told he was white so no it still leaves my skin colour a mystery to me. I also have a different middle name than my mother and brother. However I was told my brother dose have a different father than me Which he still visits. I still have white features though like my hair and face. I have also been told by my brother that I was adopted one or twice when he was mad at me although I brushed it off as it could have been an emotional moment and he had said may things when mad which have been false so I never really have it thought. I love my family Either way and they’re always going to be my family though it would be nice to know wether it’s true or not. My mom says she had me when she was 19 and the math checks out and that’s the key piece of info that makes me feel as though I am definitely her child because who in there right mind adopts a kid at 19 ahaha.

15,"(I decided to type this after just lying in bed trying to sleep for two hours overthinking if you want to imagine it from my perspective…)

I’m a 22(M) virgin and I’ve finally realised am in a pretty deep hole at the moment. I believe am I a position where my low confidence has prevented me from speaking to girls or attempting to get a girlfriend due to the fact I’m scared of ‘shooting my shot’ as they would say these days. This can be in positions of where I may be attracted to a girl and don’t have the guts to message/DM them, or even approach them if I was on a night out etc. This can be quite complicated though… as if the roles where switched and a girl was to message me or approach me for example, id have no problem talking but obviously this happens in a blue moon and most times I’ve not been attracted or into the girl.

I can’t deny, I’ve had multiple opportunities to speak/pull/have sex with girls on nights out, lads’ holidays and through my friends’ girlfriends’ friends (if that makes sense) and on multiple occasions I’ve kind of just played them down. 

I do feel as if it’s time to make a change.

My first step I feel I need to take is accepting an offer. So recently, a close friend of mine has said his girlfriend’s friend has been asking for single friends and he’s basically put it on a plate for me. The problem I have with this is I can jump straight onto it I just generally have no clue what I would talk or say to her over message etc. However, as mentioned before I would rather meet her in person straight away but nowadays it’s not a simple as that and I feel as if I’d need to talk to her for at least 2/3 week minimum before meeting her. I will admit, the fear of rejection is a massive problem of mine and this may be playing a bit part in my overthinking of outcomes from talking to her. As previously mentioned on some of my old posts I think I’m being completely dominated by the fact that near enough all my friends are in relationships at this point and I’m just waiting for the time to come for it to be my turn but, while am sat here doing nothing that time will never come.

I just don’t know what to do..... any tips would be massively appreciated, and I do see myself to be in an extremely fortunate position compared to others with a solid group of close knit friends and family around me at all times, however deep down am too much of a shithouse to express this out and just suppress it all massively. I do believe it’s time for me to change and be better for the future, ideally I think this should be now.

TL;DR Overthinking and confidence can be a horrible mix.",24Aug2020,1
16,"Currently about to start my sophomore class tomorrow online, I (15M) had a look at some of my classes online and I saw that one of my classmates has an identical name to one of my bullies in 7th grade. He was a year ahead of me and mocked me relentlessly due to my speech impediment, the games I liked, and my awkward behavior. I didn't see him again for 2 whole years but now that I see that I might share the same class as him, I'm worried he'll continue the same treatment to me. Of course since I have online classes I probably won't interact with him as much but I still have a fear of encountering again and him belittling me like the spineless dickhead he is.

18,"I’m going to post this in a few different subs, because I need all the help I can get. I’ll start by telling you my story

I have always had social anxiety when I was growing up (I’m now 17) but on my 16th birthday I had my first panic attack. I was giving a presentation in my English class which I had been dreading all year, and when I got up to the front of the class and started to speak my voice went all shaky, my heart started pounding, I started visibly shaking and felt and sounded like I was going to cry or throw up. I managed to make it through the presentation but I had just humiliated myself in front of all my classmates and friends (I’m quite popular and on the outside I look like a normal, confident and handsome teenager, but on the inside I feel the exact opposite, and this event surprised all my classmates)

So this single event started my anxiety disorder which has grown to make my life a living hell. Every time I am asked to read out loud in class I have a panic attack and get to the point where I’m struggling for breath so much and physically cannot focus on reading the words, feeling like I’m going to faint any second or burst out crying. I am quite literally petrified of this, and have adopted several avoidance strategies such skipping classes where I know I will have to read, but the problem is I may be randomly called on to read in any class, so every second of the day I am in constant fear of being called on to read because I know if I do I will have a breakdown.

I would like to stress how serious this issue is to me as it may not be completely obvious to whoever is reading this. I have had suicidal thoughts, considered dropping out of school and considered taking drugs to get rid of my anxiety just because of this. But my disorder is beginning to progress, and I now get panic attacks at the worst times usually when I can’t escape, such as in the dentist, getting my hair cut or something of that nature along with when I’m called on to read.

So I am asking you guys for help, I cannot go on living like this for any longer, it is seriously affecting my mental and physical health. I know that I should probably face my fear and join a public speaking group, but I simply do not have the strength or courage at the moment, I am genuinely terrified of the thought. This is my first time properly reaching out for help, I tried talking to my mother about this problem and she just said everybody gets scared sometimes. Any help or advice from someone who has been in my situation or knows anything about this type of thing would be greatly appreciated. Apologies for the wall of text. Thank you 🙏🏼",24Aug2020,1

21,"A little bit of backstory: all of my life its been just my mom, younger sister, and I. My mom and I are extremely close, she has always considered me as her best friend even when I was a toddler. Our relationship isn't the healthiest dynamic as she has always leaned on me for support through my step father's abuse.

22,"I am in a supervisory position at the company I work for and I manage a program that brings our business about $40,000 per year. We're a super small business and our annual finances don't top $1,000,000. Therefore, that aspect of my job is a large revenue source. Other than that, I perform a task that's directly necessary to our daily functions. I'm one of three supervisors and one of those individuals is the business owner. 

I used to absolutely love my job. It was my safe space, my home away from home, where all my friends were. For almost two years now, though, my job has gotten to be so beyond stressful that I find it difficult to function. I've taken on several other tasks that take a lot of time to manage, as well as helping with our normal operations as we're always short-staffed. I'm always behind on my work. As we're such a small company, something as simple as ""tell your boss to hire someone else to help with your work"" is much easier said than done. I'm 100% essential to our operations. 

I love my boss so much. He's become a good friend to my husband and I and he's always treated me way beyond fairly. I make a decent salary for my field and don't have any complaints about pay. I just cannot handle the stress-level anymore. I have two elementary aged kids at home and working 55 hours per week doesn't allow me to adequately co-parent at home. Every Sunday I am so stressed about going to work on Monday that I'm cranky and short with my kids and husband. I literally leave work sobbing several times a week. 

I want to quit every single day, but I know that the business wouldn't be able to function without me. I know people say that and they're just being conceited, but this is the truth. This means that if I quit, 25 other people lose their jobs. And 75 clients lose our services that they rely on heavily. However, I've reached the point where I have the mindset of ""that's not my problem"" and I can't explain how much I hate saying that. 

I want to tell my boss this week that I'd like my last day to be December 31st of this year. That gives 4 months to either figure something else out or come to terms with it. This allows for me to possibly train someone new if that's somehow an option. My husband and I have already discussed this and know that it won't wreck us financially as we have a good amount in our savings account, I have a bachelor's degree qualifying me for good jobs, and my paychecks only pay 1 of our essential bills that we can manage through savings or my husband's paycheck until I'd get a new job.

28,"Hey all. So recently I have had to take off work on disability due to my mental health struggles with anxiety and depression. This is the first time I’ve ever really burnt out (I’m 29) and have always been disgustingly high functioning otherwise. 

The thing is, I really need to do some soul searching on top of the therapy and medication I am taking to bounce back and recover from this burn out. And I feel like my current job is crushing my soul. I hate it there. I hate the workplace drama, the loudness, the bosses/managers, and the environmental impact. But when I think about it, it’s actually a pretty tolerable job. I am shielded from a lot of the drama and get to work by myself most of the day. The company has been good to me even if I watch them be horrible to my coworkers. They provide some top notch healthcare which is currently paying for the therapy and plethora of meds I am taking. And I get paid pretty good wages and have a good chance of getting a raise in December or January. 

I feel stuck. I need the healthcare, the job isn’t THAT bad. It’s like if I could just stop caring about my coworkers it would be a good job. But I have a hard time working at a place that gives certain people special treatment even if I’m one of them! I want a new job but I don’t feel like I am very skilled. At least not enough to find a job with healthcare. It’s either work at my current factory, the military base, or another more dangerous factory. 

Is the soul searching worth the collapse of everything stable in my life? For context, much of my health struggles revolve around codependency, over working myself to try and get validation, depression and anxiety over my self esteem (lack thereof) and I have absolutely no clue what it means to love and live for myself. I have poured so much of myself into my job or romantic partner that I have no clue what it means to do anything for me. I don’t know what I like and dislike, I don’t know who I am or how to make myself happy. I literally need to do some soul searching. 

What do I do? Advice and opinions greatly welcomed.",24Aug2020,1
29,"Apologies, I know this is the billionth variation of this post, Advice 101 but I’m hoping y’all can still share some pearls of wisdom.

So I’m going to a new school and I know nobody there. I had to go to a far away school to get on the course I need for the path I want to be on. Anyway, it’s so far that I don’t know anybody there. Not a single soul. Of course a lot of people there will already know each other.

How do I meet new people? I’ve had the same group of friends all my life and I don’t really have any memory of making friends. It sort of happened as a child and I’ve kept the group ever since. I’ve never really experienced meeting new people as an “adult.” I’m not gonna claim I have anxiety or anything but I’m definitely a bit awkward and I struggle maintaining a conversation. 

I get you should just go up and talk to people but like how do you pick who do talk to? What do you judge it on? Appearance? That seems wrong. What’s the process of making friends?",24Aug2020,1
30,"A concerned friend approached me and told me everything, apparently there are rumors about my girlfriend’s nudes being leaked. At first we just brushed it off as a hoax but recently i found out my bestfriend hacked into my social media account and invaded our privacy. He shared the nudes to 2 other people and it spread from there but we dont know to what extent. Then apparently *I* was the one spreading them according to the rumors. This happened last year and resurfaced again. I’m so fucking mad at him and will never forgive him because of how much he hurt my girlfriend. My girlfriend right now is panicking because it could damage her reputation, her family might disown her and be beyond disappointed, and that random people are objectifying her body which is fucking disgusting.

I have no idea what to do right now other than i traced the roots and i have the names of the 2 people my former bestfriend shared the pictures with, please help I can’t stand looking at my girlfriend crying like this, it hurts so much that she’s going through this, i want to help as much as I can, I dont give a fuck about what people see me as. We live in the Philippines, so Asian parents are the worst when it comes to understanding these kind of stuff.

32,"My boyfriend and I have been in an LDR for 2 years. Since the coronavirus we decided to quarantine together it's not been 7 months together. I live in the UK but I'm not sure if it's going to be the place I want to be since I'm not happy. I told him that my parents would be open to me moving to Australia to be with my sister. Although things aren't set in stone, its been a conversation I was not ready to talk about with him but as my parents kept talking as well as my sister I thought it is right to tell him.   


Finally told him and then we agreed IF it would happen it would be better to break it off as he will be in Europe. Then he said he understood then he got upset at the whole situation. He told me that I can't say anything about how he feels about it because I reacted badly to when he wanted to move to the Netherlands. I told him that I admit my attitude towards him moving to the NL was not fair and I have apologised about it ever since and I have learned to embrace him moving to NL and I am genuinely happy for him but he says its no different if I accepted it now. I told him that I wanted to move to AUS to make me happy and to be near family but he kind of said he understood then proceeded to say are you really sure about this decision, you're going to have to start all over again, you won't be a student anymore how are you going to make friends and said that my old friends from AUS (I lived there when for three years before starting when I was 10 and still keep close to my contacts there) won't be there all the time anyway. 

I understood why he would say these things because I think this isn't an easy subject to talk about but I did tell him this was all hypothetical right now, it's not sure, nothing is set up and that for now its still him and I  and I am still thinking of my plans after I graduate university next year in the UK. He still got upset and said he got angry I didn't sacrifice how he sacrificed for me (he moved for me in quarantine, didn't take his esports game opportunity in L.A because of me but I didn't say anything about it he decided it himself and he had to deal with my bad side and my breakdowns and my anxiety).   


Now he said he's gone off to watch some football with a friend and he said he'd come home but he hasn't and I guess he won't for a while. Should i leave him alone ? Am I wrong for saying what I said?",24Aug2020,1
33,"Before we met my best friend dated a girl (For context, friend is Bi, her ex is a Lesbian, and I'm a Straight guy) they broke up after feeling loveless, and remained friends. My best friend also deals with parental issues including alcoholism.

I knew both of them, but was only really familiar with my best friend as we did theater together as kids.  We followed each other on insta and we got close since Mid-October 2019. 

She started seeing someone else not too long after. About a few weeks before Thanksgiving. A boy this time. She broke up with him in February 2020. Admitting he was just a rebound. But ever since she's been working a lot on herself.

In that time I watched her grow from someone who was torn apart from all her issues to an amazing and mature girl. She made me feel more stable too. She makes me feel loved and cared for and she knows I've always kinda had a crush on her. But still decided we'd always be there for each other. Even when im at college while she's doing her senior year.

But she was always really awful with her ex. It took her much longer. Til one day, in a drunken mess of texting, her ex told her she had feelings for her again. She swore she wouldn't start dating her ex again. One month later they were together.

I've been in an abusive relationship myself. And it feels so similar to when I entered mine. Going back to someone who used to care for me. She knows I hate it. I've been vocal about it. I support her in all she does but this time I just don't know. It feels so wrong and fake and forced.

I've thought about everything. Jealousy, but I was supportive when she started dating the other guy and still cheered her on until he started treating her bad. Homophobia, but I have other LGBT friends that I've been super supportive of! Ones I've been closer with even longer than I have my best friend. Ones that make my other friends very happy.

Im just so worried shes gonna get hurt. What do I do? I know she's her own person but she doesn't deserve the hurt of an unfilled relationship. Nobody does.",24Aug2020,1

For my 30th, she took me out for dinner and to the symphony, and surprised me with a little home party with cake and my friends. She wrapped 30 separate colour coordinated gifts for me to open and made the day feel like the most special day. 

Because I lost my job, I don’t have the money to do anything extravagant like I had planned. We were going to go to Europe on a quick trip (I’m flight attendant so it would be inexpensive) but that got cancelled. Then we were going to do a huge, formal dinner party and that got cancelled. 

Her birthday is a week away and I don’t know what to do!! She is the kindest, most thoughtful person. She always puts everyone else first and goes above and beyond. She often gets the short end of the stick because ever since we were kids, something ALWAYS happens to upend her birthdays.

39,"To give some background, I am 21F and I live with my parents still. A few weeks ago I finished nursing school and I have a job starting at my local hospital next month as a nurse. The deal was I could live with my parents rent free as long as I was in school and contributing to household chores and upkeep, such as cleaning, cooking, shopping, yardwork, etc. I paid for my schooling using scholarships and about $15k from a trust fund my parents set up for me when I was born.

My original plan was to live at home for another couple of months until I could generate enough money from my new job to afford to live on my own. I still have about $3k from the trust fund, but the average apartment in my city is $1500/month. However, I decided to buy a lottery ticket for a grad present and I actually won. I didnt tell my parents, and I made plans to move into an apartment next month that's closer to the hospital I'll be working at. 

After taxes, my winnings are about $130k. I'm absolutely thrilled because I dont have to worry about rent for awhile and I can start a substantial savings account that I could use to travel or put a downpayment on a place or something in the future. Then I made the mistake of telling my mom that I won.

So, my mom is essentially insisting that I either a) pay off my parents mortgage or b) give them back the $15k from my trust fund and pay for them to renovate the house. I was planning on giving them money anyways and I was planning on paying for them to go on a vacation with me in the future, but my mom is asking for essentially all of the money. We have had multiple huge fights over this to the point where she is going to kick me out (my new place isnt available until the 15th of next month) and is threatening to not talk to me at all. I had a super close relationship with her before and I dont know what to do. I dont want to sacrifice my relationship with my parents, but I would really like to save this money for the future.

42,"My brother got sick a while ago (6 years) and developed Chronic Fatigue as a result of his illness. Since then, he's dropped out of high school, gained a ton of weight and spends all his time in bed with his laptop, playing games. Mom has tried over the years to talk to him, researching what she can do to help him, such as books from the library on CF, diet books to help him with his newly found gluten intolerance, she’s taken him to three different doctors, naturopaths etc, and gotten him prescriptions for depression as well as other vitamins for his CF. 

We’ve done our best over the years to be understanding of his CF, as he does get really tired very easily, but we’re running out of patience. He’s in his room all day, briefly appears to eat dinner (or asks we bring it to him) then disappears again until about midnight when he reappears to sit in the kitchen eating toast for about half an hour to an hour. He does have brief bursts of energy, such as going out for a 5 min walk around the block every week or so, but that seems to really tire him out and he then spends the next few days in bed. His personal hygiene has dropped as well, and he maybe showers once a month?

He has gone from a fairly fit young man who does Judo and wanted to be in the Navy, to a not so fit young man who plays games all night and talks occasionally about ethical hacking, but then makes no further effort to get into the field or develop his skills, he’d much rather play games as that’s mostly what he talks about.

Dad tries his best to ignore what’s happening, and simply focuses on what he wants to do within the house, such as playing his own games, working on the house or going to various night classes. When he does talk to my brother, it’s a very short conversation that usually starts with “Yo, bro.” Mum has almost reached the end of her tether with my father as he acts in his own best interests and is passive about everything.  I’ve tried talking to my brother as well about living with roommates and what he wants for the future and he usually gives me really vague answers and the conversations end up being about the games that he plays.

45,"I met my ex-best friend in my southmoor year of high school and he quickly became my only true friend. Sadly, after we graduated, we stopped seeing each other as often. We both went to different colleges and we both had part-time jobs. Even so, we would still hang out once every other month. We would also text weekly and played games to try to keep in touch. Despite this, we slowly started to talk less and less and stopped hanging out at all. But recently, I want to stay about 3 months ago. I started to notice that after we graduated. All the times we hung out, played games online, or even texted. I was the only one trying to keep our relation.  He was never the one to text me first.

Due to this realization, I decided to stop contacting him for a while to see if he would ever try to contact me. It's been 3 months now, and nothing. He's never asked how I've been, or do you want to hang out or even play Minecraft or anything really. This has saddened me because I feel like our relationship was one-sided all along. What makes me even sadder is that back in high school we would call each other brothers and that we would stick together through the end.  He was my only friend left from high school and I haven't been able to make friends in college do to quarantine, and the friends I've made at work do not compare to the relationship I had with my old best friend.

I don't know how he truly feels about me now and I'm not sure what to do. I came here to maybe get some advice from people that might have gone through the same thing.

I never thought much of it, but now it turns out that this absolute dumbass he knows is going to sell him a legit AR 15 and a handgun. He just mentioned it to me a moment ago. I didn't say much, I was just kinda floored. 

I can't bear the idea of two guns being in the house with me, especially since my roomate knows fuck all about guns. Frankly, I don't trust him with a gun. I feel this foreboding that he's going to show it off to everyone that comes into our spot, and one day he's not gonna secure it properly and it's going to go off and I'm going to get killed. Maybe I'm freaking out for no reason, but I just wish he could have asked me my thoughts instead of making that decision alone. An AR 15 in our tiny-ass place, and I'm supposed to be completely cool with it. So, I'd really appreciate some advice.

I’ve attended a total of 3 semesters since fall 2018. I had to skip spring 2019 because I had to go back home due to severe depression. I went back for the 2019/2020 year and completed that, but in march/april, my grades slipped because of the rising pandemic and I ended up having to drop a class which put me in a little debt (it’s solved now) and I have to retake that class. I should also mention that I’ve changed my major 4 times throughout it all and finally settled this year in the interdisciplinary studies program, but I’m starting to have my doubts about that even. 

This semester, I’m concerned about the way my school is handling the pandemic. I attend University of Alabama, and if you haven’t heard, the greek life are still hosting parties and people are filling clubs w/o masks, and also walking around without masks. A lot of my classes are hybrid, which is in person one day, and online another day. Most of it is online. I’m not the best with online classes. I’m also not getting the college experience I wish I had (I know people’s health is more important though so I’m not too bothered). 

I’m starting to think maybe college isn’t for me right now. It seems like something happens that prevents things from going smoothly almost every time. Also my depression has been getting a lot worse to the point of bad thoughts and I haven’t found a therapist at school nor do I have time for it. I haven’t told anyone though. I’m thinking of pulling out for a few years and getting a job and focusing on my art and art career so I can open an etsy shop one day (which I really wanna do, but can’t if I’m enrolled).

We are both intelligent and reasonable people. The main difference between us is that I was in a very horrible, manipulative and disrespecting relationship for seven years, and our relationship currently is the longest my boyfriend has had. Which is fine!
I trust him with my life and I trust him never to hurt me, but I do still have some insecurities and things that make me feel uncomfortable that I think he is doing unintentionally. He is a musician, and has been out of work since March due to lockdown where we are, I am in the same situation. We go live online and sing together to try and make some money now, and for a few months there has been a girl following our live streams. She is from America, we are Irish, we are living in Spain, neither of us know her or have ever met her. She has commented and complemented our music several times. That's all fine.
Yesterday I realised that she has suddenly blocked my page on Facebook, remains friends with him, and her mother is friends with him too. She watched our live stream the other night but seemed to go away when I joined him to sing, all the while knowing she had blocked me, and kept commenting to him. Personally I think this is very weird, so do my friends. Its just a strange thing to do. I mentioned it to him and he thought it was also very odd, but after seeing her page through my friends page, I can see he has been ""hearting"" photos, videos etc that she has been putting up since earlier this year. I think it's also a bit weird that he is friends with her mother, yet she seems to be pretending that I simply don't exist in his life. He has said he has given her no reason to think he is interested in her, and he may be liking things etc without thinking that this could make her feel special in some way, or misconstrue this for his interest in her.
I am uncomfortable, I think it's quite disrespectful on her part to block me completely and still talk to him when she knows I can hear him mention her in live streams, yet I cannot see her comment or find her at all on Facebook.

(This will be long, I’m sorry in advance)
I wanted to go to med school for the longest time, after taking time out and re-evaluating my options I decided to form a plan. I re-applied in a one year pre-med course, entry exam classes and started looking at a different country that I could afford. My brother had already applied and gotten into a degree for bio-medicine. Mind you, my dad has been VERY persuasive about him going to med school and he’s always told him no. My classes start tomorrow and last week he tells me he’s enrolled himself in them. He says my plan is brilliant and that he’s going for it too. Claims it’s what dad wants and that way he won’t worry about me moving away.

He’s adamant that he’s going to do better in these classes than me and get into a better university. I don’t want to hate my brother or wish bad upon him but this was MY dream. Not his, not dad’s. And he doesn’t wish to speak to me in the classes or let anyone know we’re related, like sir I’m not the embarrassment here. This isn’t much of a advice post, but how do I resolve this?

62,"so in april i bought a new phone from sprint. i bought it outright so that i could only use sprint for a month or two, unlock it, and use it on my tmobile number. i own the phone fully, i am not in a contract or anything like that. the reason i bought it from sprint btw is because the phone was on sale and it was a great deal, and my phone was super old and in need of replacement.   


in june i was able unlock the phone and i told sprint that i wanted to cancel my service and line so that i wouldn't be billed anymore because i'm going back to tmobile. they told me that i had to pay the bill for the last billing cycle (may - june) and the current one (june - july), which i did on june 19th. after i did that, i talked with the lady on the phone a bit more and she cancelled the line and my account and said that when that current month of billing that i'd just paid for was over, the account would be cancelled and i wouldn't get service for that line anymore and wouldn't have to pay anymore bills.   


well today i got a rude awakening when i received an email that i wasn't supposed to receive from sprint, informing me that i was being billed for the billing period of  July 19 - Aug 18, 2020 for $44.29 , due by september 11th. i remember that when i paid off the bill back then, the total went down to 0$ so this is a brand new charge. i also see on my banking records that i made two payments to sprint on june 29th for the two charges. i paid for the last month and then was informed that i had to pay for the current month i was in, so i paid that too.  


what am i supposed to do? is there a government agency i can file a complaint against sprint with? they told me it would be cancelled and it hasn't been cancelled. the easy apparent solution would be just don't give them more money, but i've read that if i don't pay them, they're going to hand the charges over to a debt collection agency which will ruin my credit score and they'll hound me until i eventually pay up. in the mean time until the bill is overdue on September 12th, it would just rack up an additional month of charge.  


i don't have any proof that i tried to cancel the account, i never got any email or any sort of notification from them confirming the cancellation, the lady on the phone just said it would be discontinued and i took her word for it. thinking back, i should have recorded our call but who even knows how much good that would do. they're clearly a big dishonest scummy corporation and at the time i tried cancelling it, i read a bit online from other people saying that something similar had happened to them and that sprint are a dirty business. i can't call them right now because it's sunday, but for all i know i could call them tomorrow, we go through the same song and dance again and i record the call, they say that it will be cancelled, and then a month from now i get yet another charge. i call them again and present the recording i made of the call and they just discard it entirely. now i'm stuck giving them money for nothing indefinitely because they just refuse to close the account, while lying through their teeth saying that they did.  


by the way one other thing, i mentioned that i bought the phone outright and i'm not in any contracts. this is important because it shows that i have no contractual obligation to continue my service with. they even told me in the call that there wasn't a cancellation fee because i own the phone and am not in a contract. they told me this because i specifically asked if there was any cancellation fee, and that's what they told me in response.   


something else is that i do not want to pay this new charge because it is fraudulent and they're literally just trying to steal money from me now. how do i get out of paying that? how much of a pain in the ass do you have to be to them to get them to do something like this, and how do you go about being that much of a pain in the ass? i've never really had to do something like this before now.",24Aug2020,1

One of the IT guys in charge of off-boarding previous employees said that he would email me a shipping label, but it never happened. 

I’m not personally attached to the laptop, but it would be potentially convenient to keep because I only have a desktop PC at home. 

Would be a total a-hole if I didn’t reach out to him on this? I could see it being a case where if I don’t ask him, he won’t realize and I would be able to keep it (almost a form of “ask for forgiveness, not for permission”). And I don’t know how much work he would have to do to wipe it clean and deal with the logistics, so maybe it’s easier for him if I didn’t follow up. I don’t want to get the guy in trouble though.

65,"My brother and I have the same friend group, and these are some of the only friends that we have made since we moved to a new town half a year ago. Anyways, my friends made a groupchat with my brother a few months ago back in May. I don't know why, but I'm not included in the groupchat that they made that they talk on often every sine day. My brother claimed that they made a groupchat with me that everyone could talk on, but they've only talked on it once. Whenever I bring this topic up with my brother he always claims that they're not talking about me in a negative way (which I certainly believe) but it still hurts to not be talked about at all, especially since I was the one who introduced him to my friends. Unfortunately, nobody has reached out to me at all these past few months. I have been the only one to reach out to others. Even when we were at school in-person it felt like nobody listened to me when I talked. That being said, these people are all that I have. So, here are questions:

1. How should I approach my brother when it comes to my friend group or should I not approach him at all?

I knew he cheated before.  And humiliated her with words. He is a manipulative a**hole. 
So,he was with this girl yesterday and my sister went there to face them. He was drinking. He said some mean words again, and walked away. Then, he turned around(I read how she hoped he would say how sorry he is or sth) but instead he pushed her hard , she fell on the street. He wanted to hit her. But  a neghbour saw it, ran to them and they got into fight. I read something about a knife he had in his pocket ( I know he has a swiss knife he's carriyng around. ) maybe he meant that. He threatened that neighbour with a knife. As they were yelling, that boys father ran out. Stopped it. Police was there but they just left him with a warning. Whatever happened later between their families , I dont care. 
Anyway. I am going crazy now. It's 3 am. i want to go to his house and hurt him somehow. I am just a girl. My dad is ill. I will try not to tell him this. But i have to do something tomorrow. 
I am tryng to think calmly. And work this out without making any scene. I just hope my temper doesnt overwhelm me tomorrow. 
I wilo sent him a message. I will tell him things. 
I will threaten my sister if she doesnt block him on all social media and phone and stop seeing him , that I will call our uncles. That I will make a scene. I hope that works  . She won't cooperate , probably. But if she wont do it . I will get family involved.

For privacy, I’ll keep my currency anonymous. 

So I start working after graduating summer 2019 with a job that pays around 35k monthly. I got married soon after it and have spent all money I had on wedding/honeymoon. During quarantine, I was blessed by saving up a good amount of money and until a month ago my life was going fine and salary was enough. 

Issue started about a month ago when I decided to buy a flat in a newly developed area in my country for 900k paid over 5 years. This means I’ll have to pay 10k a month of my salary for installments and save another 10k for the final payment. This leaves me with 15k of money to enjoy. I’ve split it three ways 5k for my wife, 5k for me and 5k for bills and other shared expenses. The issue is this is making us live extremely tight and it is forcing us to give up on eating out and other life luxuries we always been used to. My wife is still in University and I pay for her tuition fees (20k annually) which adds to the struggle. She’ll always soon to be driving so I have to get her a car too. I am such a mess. I suck at managing money. My wife showed here willingness to give up some of her essentials to help, but I strongly refuse to make her suffer for my poor financial choices. Both sides of family offered us help but I’m too proud to accept any. I need advice. Should I consider investing money? Do I start a business? Considering how tight I’m living right now, is it a good idea to take such risks?

My dad has dropped 600 dollars on a nutrition sales man. The sales guy claims his products will have get rid of Covid and my mom had passed because she was not taking theses products.

We are curious on how to start the process of purchasing a home.

80,"I know what I said was wrong but I think the amount of hate I have received from my family even my own sister is getting out of hand. It all started in a heated debate in a group chat with my cousins. One cousin who I will refer to as JAY [23F] was making unsubstantiated claims about a criminal case. I [16F] called her out in her I’ll informed remarks and pointed out the laws since I study criminology, and I hope to be a lawyer. That’s when JAY’S sister JESS [17F] came in and called me uneducated (she spoke much more strongly) and insulted my intelligence. I continued the argument with JESS using my knowledge and what I know to be truth. Then my cousin JAKE [16M] came in and agreed with me and adding more information. JESS came in and insulted me once again but way more viciously. I go out of my way to be educated and anyone who knows me knows I hate being called dumb or stupid and what made it worse was that JESS said it, since she is literally known in the family for being an idiot. So I snap, I agree it was wrong but I did, I insulted her by saying that she wouldn’t know anything about intellect since all she does is sexual activities to raise her self esteem. I acknowledge this was out of line however I didn’t think it would have been taken so bad since a) she is very open about her sex life b) she has done much worse by spouting  private information c) this wasn’t private information she jokes about it herself. I do take blame however it has been MONTHS and she still won’t speak to me. I visited her at her home to apologize however she would not leave her room and I could hear her yell at her mother saying how I disrespected her. My sister blames me and JAY said I was a bitch because me and my cousin JAKE ganged up on JESS Although she ignores the fact that a 23 and 17 yr old ganged up on me. I know I was in the wrong however people won’t even speak to me, but where was this energy when JESS on New Years said that I could never be loved and that’s why I had been dumped by my ex which WAS private information. People were telling me “that was mean but forgive her” or when she grabbed scissors and cut my hair without consent. What about when she yelled at me saying I can never give dating advice because no man would touch me with a 10ft pole. All those incidents went by without her apologizing, I just stayed composed and let it slide, and people would tell me to not overreact and that was her “personality”. Nonetheless the one time I snap in the heat of the moment, even going out of my way to apologize directly face to face and  she would not even consider seeing me, I am the bad guy. The only apology I ever received from her was from New Years and it was my parents telling me JESS’ MOTHER asked for me to forgive her cuz JESS felt bad.

91,"About a month ago I made the mistake of talking to someone from reddit online as well as giving them my location, name, face, and eventually nudes. I later realized they were trying to scam me, at which point they threatened to leak my nudes. I caved in to their demands, paid them a small amount of money in exchange for them deleting the photos, which I’m not actually sure if they did. When I later tried to ask for proof of this they got mad and threatened me further, which makes me believe they haven’t. This was largely over email on an alt account and I no longer have the account which I used because I eventually blocked them and then signed out.

Over a month later, this is still my greatest source of stress in life, and a daily worry. I realize now how dumb of a decision it was, and I’m super concerned about this incident as well as other people I talked to online in the past. I don’t want to take legal action because I’d like for this to remain anonymous/not have anyone find out. I talked about some things like bdsm/femdom which I’m not proud of and I definitely don’t want the convos to get publicly leaked.

Does anyone have any advice for any course of action I can take to try to get those photos deleted off their emails or deal with the stress of this whole ordeal. Im a college student and I’m terrified that this might come back to haunt me in the future and I’d have to deal with the social ramifications that entail, potentially harming my career or relationships with family/friends/etc. 

I’ve searched online and there’s no way for me to really be sure that those photos get deleted save me taking legal action (if that’s even possible considering that they haven’t actually leaked my nudes yet) or hiring someone to illegally hack into their email account or learn how to do it myself which are pretty much out of the question for obvious reasons.

1. We are held to a three hour screen time limit which I am supposed to follow religiously while my brother watches his iPad, computer, tv, switch at any chance he can. He isn’t restricted at all in this regard while I have 3 hours on the dot. 

2. My brother does nothing around the house and I’m supposed to pick up his slack. (Insert downs argument) there are plenty of easy tasks that he could do but isn’t required to do. The only thing he does is get the mail which is like a 20ft walk from our house. Also I am constantly being asked to do mindless chores he could do easily. Also I get paid to babysit him, but guess what, sometimes they PAY HIM TOO. So I work my but off entertaining a kid I don’t even like that much and he gets paid the same I do. Also she pays me next to nothing but that isn’t really important. 

3. She lets him get away with pretty much anything including but not limited to being rude, disrespectful, stubborn, and not listing to anyone.

4 She is super harsh on me. She forces me to do stuff. Would literally kill me if I called her half the things my brother calls her on a daily basis. She also nitpicks my every move and gets mad at the smallest things.

5. I’m not allowed to have an opinion but they take my brothers. This is self explanatory

6. I literally can’t fight her. Even though I have a valid point it is always shut down by some petty remark.

I don’t know what I should do as this has been going on forever but I’d like any advice so thanks for reading this please leave your suggestions in the comments.",24Aug2020,1

97,"Hi this is probably really dumb. I’m a first year architecture student. When I chose this course I knew I would have to develop my communication skills but I didn’t know it involved presentations and sharing ideas in front of my peers (this includes a pin-up presentation of my work etc and explaining my ideas / creation to everyone. Everyone must do this). I feel really anxious / nervous when it comes to this stuff and I can name a few reasons:

1. Some people in my course are older than me and very opposite to me (they seem outgoing and confident; I’m a timid, shy girl)
2. I’m not creative so I never have good ideas
3. I especially struggle with articulating my ideas / communicating them
4. I don’t like the feeling of being judged

Honestly i’m not sure what i’m getting that and all of this is silly but I wonder how I can boost my confidence / deal with all of this.

TL;DR: how do i stop myself from being nervous about presenting / sharing ideas / communicating

98,"a lot of my friends have been reinventing themselves during quarantine and have started refining their clothing styles and personalities and have been just overall changing , but for me, i’ve stayed the same. 

the only changes that i’ve experienced are feeling even more depressed than when i wasn’t stuck at home all day. this has given me a lot of space to let my negative thoughts and insecurities control me and i feel horrible about myself for not having made any changes to myself despite wanting to so badly.

my friend posted some photos of herself and she looked so pretty and it’s horrible to say this but it made me cry and feel so horrible about myself .

anytime i see my friends post pictures of themselves i automatically feel horrible about myself for being ugly and stuck in life , has anybody felt the same or have any advice to stop feeling this way ? i love my friends and i love seeing them improve and succeed, so i don’t know why the feeling of joy for them is always followed by disdain and hatred for myself

100,"I’ve been seeing this girl for a few months now and I really like her. She says that she has fallen in love with me over the past few months and I can’t say it back because of her over protective parents. 
Even though we have been seeing each other for a few months the majority of the time when we see each other it involves me sneaking into her house at midnight and leaving at around 5 the next morning as if I was a freshman in highschool. We are both college students, the only reason she lives at home is because she is attending a local community college and I am also staying at home while attending a different college not far from where I live. 
We both click without even trying, we both have the same interests, we both do the same things for fun, we both are extremely goal oriented in our career paths and have plans set up for the future. We are similar in too many ways to count but also different in 1000 different ways which makes things interesting.
I would like to say I see a future with her being that we click on so many levels and she is already there with me but I just don’t know if I can get there just yet. Marrying young isn’t a problem with me because it runs in the family and those marriages all turn out to be successful despite the marrying young stigma. The one thing holding me back is our family dynamics. I am very family oriented, my family has been aware of her since the first month i started seeing her. They have all met her, I go out of my way to try to invite her to different family events when she can go and they all encourage me to invite her over more often  but as for her, her parents don’t even know I exist. 
I can’t with confidence say I am going to commit to this women without seeing her family dynamics, how they hold themselves as people and how well they treat there own family and if they are willing to accept me into there family as there daughters partner. She says her dad and the rest of her family is extremely protective over her and they don’t like the men that have been introduced to them in the past. I’m not entirely sure what’s holding her back from meeting them and she gets annoyed when I refrain from saying i love you despite telling her my stance on the situation so I guess I’m asking how to approach this situation?

\-He's an American citizen because his brother was born in Florida and some how he got dual citizenship (we're canadian btw)

106,"Hello everyone,

I am a sophomore in college now and things have gotten weird with covid obviously. Allow me to dump my baggage of issues out here and I would very much appreciate it if anyone even just reads this. 

Problem one: depression 

At the end of last year, I was looking forward to coming back to school. Then everything got weird and it just feels wrong here. The second I got here I immediately felt very depressed. I have no desire to learn or go to class. I know that if I were to transfer it would either be the same or worse, plus I don’t want to leave my great friends here behind. Dropping out isn’t really an option as I would greatly disappoint my family and myself. Just the slog of classes, work, and thinking about how I have an entire semester left makes me feel depressed. I feel like I don’t want to be here at all, but I also don’t want to be home either. I’m feeling very lost in life and somewhat worthless/useless/pathetic. 

Problem two: job

I am generally a very lazy person who has been able to do well in school and jobs by putting in limited to no effort. I am also the kind of person who absolutely hates working. It makes no sense and I wish I could get rid of that mindset since I am broke and really need money. My parents are really pressuring me to get a job and I applied for some jobs on campus and have had some interviews but the thought of having a job on top of all my classes makes me feel super uneasy. 

Problem three: relationships 

I know this is a dumb section but it’s one of the biggest thoughts chewing away at my head right now. I have had one serious relationship in the past but it did not end well. I also understand that having a girlfriend is not an instant “cure-all” and I’m not looking for a girl for those reasons. I’ve heard all my friends say the same “gotta love yourself before you can love someone else,” but let’s be honest, I just want a girlfriend. I have a low self esteem and I feel like I’m not approachable at all, however I’m too nervous and scared to approach any girl. I usually have earbuds in and look either angry or depressed (according to friends), so it makes sense why no one ever approaches me. I have a paradox happening where I don’t want anyone to approach me, but then I do at the same time. And I understand that these are weird times for everyone and everything right now but I feel like this problem still applies. 
I am just in general a really lonely and sensitive guy and I feel like I have no hope for finding a girlfriend. I am super uncomfortable stepping outside of my comfort zone (unbelievable I know) and I have a really hard time going to any events or anything on campus. For me it’s usually classes, then straight to my dorm. I know I’m not helping myself at all but I struggle to get involved with anything. At this point I would be very happy just to have some friends who are girls to contrast my current friends who are similar lonely boys. How do you talk to people?

I don’t know I feel like this is a lot of rambling and none of it really makes sense. I just have felt like shit recently and any time I think about what tomorrow holds I feel worse. On top of that I want someone who would love me and support me and show physical affection but I don’t think it’ll ever happen if I continue being an introverted shut in who’s scared of social interaction. 

Thanks for reading if you did, I’d really appreciate a comment with even the smallest bits of advice for any of my problems. Thank you",24Aug2020,1
107,"I'm classically awkward. I'm worried how I'll handle life and everyday interactions. My guess on how I'm like this is I only talk to my friends (elementary school) online because Everytime I interact with other highschoolers(?) my age I don't really empathize nor relate to them. Every interaction is painfully awkward by me not knowing what to say next to keep it going or me starring to intently. I have had some times where people spilled their troubles to me and I kept providing solutions then just listened in case they just want to rant, but it always end up awkward. Now, I just stay by myself in the house most of the time. The time for me to start working summer jobs is near and I don't know how I'll deal with everyday interactions with em because I lack social skills.

109,"I  recently moved to a new city and living here has really helped me put  some of my old friendships in perspective. Most of my friendships have  been initiated by proximity and convenience rather than the personal  similarities that I've been led to believe friendships should be built  on. I have maybe 2 friends that I truly feel comfortable with saying  that I am friends with them because of who they are as a person and not  because we met in college and ended up being friends because of our  proximity to each other.

My  question is would I be better off just cutting these friends off? I  cherish the times we've spent together, but at the same time I feel like  the only thing I have in common with a lot of them is smoking weed, and  in general they remind me of a period of time where I spent a large  amount of my time depressed and apathetic about life in general.

We  keep in touch a little, but since I've moved away its become readily  apparent that we all have completely different trajectories in life, and  the painful memories that used to plague my mind have finally started  to subside.  I'm hesitant to leave them behind though because I wouldn't  want to hurt them, but every time I talk to them I'm reminded of the  past and how much I hate that particular chapter of my life.

110,"I’m (F16) currently writing this at 5am so excuse the errors, and sorry if this is long but thanks to those that read it. I’ve always been the kid that’s going places. I go to a small school but I’m in the popular group, class president, play sports, set up to go to an ivy, etc. But what no one knows is my mom is an alcoholic. Here’s where I need serious help/advice. The beginning of last year was really the start of my moms downhill spiral of her alcoholism. My parents have the setup where the mom stays home and takes care of the kid (me, and only child), and my dad works for the money of the house (we are fairly wealthy because of my dad, but also him and I aren’t as close as my mom and I). At this same time as my mom began getting worse, the school year started. This is where the man that changed my life came in, we’ll call him Quin. He was my science teacher, the type that everyone liked—funny, made relevant jokes, swore, etc. We immediately became very close, almost like friends. Over the course of the year, as my mom got worse, I began to look up to him greatly as we grew closer. I had never told anyone ab my mom, as it was my biggest secret. I would think about it all day, except in this class where I would talk to him about politics, my future, our lives —-everything. He treated me with a kind of respect I had never seen before, and his validation and praise meant so much more because I had never truly had a role mode IN my life other than him. He has MS, a disease that made him often take time off (he would email me the lesson plans and I would run it over w the sub whatever). Well, the day I went to go tell him about what was going on with my mom because I couldn’t stand the secrets anymore and I was becoming suicidal, he was packing up his stuff. He quit soon after and I was crushed. I reached out and we maintained contact via text. Here I am a year and a half later. My mom has gotten a lot worse and recently went to rehab the last month and been clean almost 2 weeks. In the year and a half Quin has been out of my life I’ve thought about him nearly every day. I feel fucking psychotic. Not in a weird way, it’s just he’s what keeps me going. He always told me how much he believed in me and when things get rough I just pretend he’s still here, always having stupid ass conversations about what life means and motivating me when I’m down. We check up on each other every few months, and the simple text alone that lets me know he’s going okay literally makes me cry tears of joy. The thing is, I’m not sure I fabricated the role he played in my life to satisfy my ego and get me through the hard times with my mom. I want more than anything for him to be in my life again. He is the most wise and enigmatic person I have ever met. All I want is to be able to get lunch with him. To be able to tell him what I was going through with my mom and how he got me through it/get closure. However, I don’t want to weird him out. I am quite sure he doesn’t care about me as much as I do him, and really don’t want to embarrass myself. None of my friends know this, as I am so embarrassed that I relied/rely so heavily on someone that was supposed to be insignificant in my life. I just miss him so much, but at the end of the day I would rather remember him and the strength he gave me in a happy way than embarrass myself.",24Aug2020,1

Example happened yesterday when I was leaving Toronto (we drove) and my 6 year old little sister was in the back sleeping. Then out of nowhere I think of a situation where something hits our car and puts a hole where she’s sleeping and she flys out of the car. This makes no sense, but I feared it because it was stuck in my head. I basically think of the worst outcome every time. Same with if someone doesn’t answer back I start thinking what if she got kidnapped / mugged / car crash or something worse, like when she took my lil sis to go to the Africa section of the Toronto zoo, I called her once and she didn’t answer so i got super scared and thought of these almost near impossible situations.

My mom isn't a rational person, it's always her way and she's always right and she'll twist everything until she finds it fit, and most of the time she'll play the emotion card and say I've done nothing but be supportive and give the silent treatment afterwards.

119,"Trigger warning: sex, rape

So I just recently got married and before marriage I hadn’t ever had sex. (Before you think I’m all religiously repressed or whatever it was my choice to remain a virgin, no one forced me) 
Anyway the wedding night basically sucked. He did his thing and then went to bed and I felt... really unfulfilled. It hasn’t gotten better. Despite my husband giving every single effort to help me enjoy sex (he goes down on me, he buys toys, foreplay, all different types of angles etc) I just can’t ever finish and I for the most part dont enjoy the process. He’s getting incredibly frustrated at me and my slowly waning interest in sex, but honestly it’s getting depressing. The idea of having sex just makes me sad. I know I won’t finish and I know that anything I do won’t help and I feel like this complete waste of a person, and I feel like I tricked him into marrying me. Because I made him wait for sex until we got married and then it turns out it isn’t any good. I know he’s super upset and feels like I misrepresented myself about sex before we got married. I know he thought that I would be more interested in it than I am; I thought I would be. 

All of this is incredibly painful for me to say. And I don’t think it helps that when I was 15 I was raped so sex is already something I feel really awkward about. (And no, I don’t think that’s why I don’t enjoy sex. I’ve been to counselling, I’m pretty much okay with my past) He wants me to go to a doctor, but I dont feel comfortable around doctors. I really don’t want anyone to see me naked unless absolutely necessary; I keep my clothes on even when I’m home alone because it feels safe. 

I just don’t know what to do. I want to make him happy, but I dont want to pretend either. Should I go to the doctor to make him happy? Even if I know they can’t do anything? I feel like the worst person in the world for letting him down. And I feel like I’m broken because I can’t seem to understand why people enjoy sex so much. I personally find it awkward and painful, and it feels like a chore, even though I’m completely comfortable and in love with my husband.

120,"
First off I’m sorry about the formatting, I’m currently on my phone. I’m 19 years old and I have an insane amount of pent up emotion and thoughts that just run through my head at a rapid pace all day, every day and I’m reaching a breaking point. I have so much I want to say that I’d never be able to fit it into one reddit post, but I’m hoping that I can at least get something out.

I think I have depression, I’ve never been to a doctor for it or told anybody about it, but I think I do. For the past 5 years I’ve had horrible thoughts about myself and my life and I can be have a good days, but there is always a sad feeling lingering in the back of my mind. I also have very bad social anxiety and ocd so I’m a pretty lonely person. Usually when people struggle with stuff like this it can be traced back to a bad childhood or something along those lines, but not me. I have a mother who supports me in anything I do and gives me so much positive reinforcement, and a step father who loves me and my brothers and has taken us on as his own. Even my extended family loves me and tells me I’m great. Nobody has ever put me down in my life, yet I still feel like I’m the scum of the earth. I think it’s because I know who I really am and nobody else does. I’m selfish, lazy, the complete opposite of my mother. I’m not physically attractive, nor am I smart or charming. I have absolutely zero redeeming qualities about myself and if I was someone else I wouldn’t like me. 

When it comes to me and my siblings I know I got the short end of the stick. Both my brothers are very attractive and charming people and I’m everything they’re not. I’m so anxious around people I don’t even like going into places like Walmart because it makes me so uncomfortable. The only time I go out is when I need to work. I’m working a job right now because I have no idea what I’m supposed to be doing with my life. My parents want me to go to school and do something, but the truth is I’m too stupid for school. High school was the worst time of my life and I don’t want to do it again. Everyone tells me I’m smart and I’ll do something great one day. People hold me to this certain standard that I just can’t meet because it’s not me.

It’s so unfair to my mom that she has a shitty person like me as her son, at least she has 2 more. I have no ambition the only reason I do anything I to please my mom. Ive never told anybody about how I feel, it’s better to keep it to myself because I don’t want to burden them with my stupid feelings.

I’m sure my family has noticed me change. I used to talk a lot more, make jokes, etc. I don’t really talk anymore unless I’m answering a question. Im so tired of myself. Before anybody says it, I don’t want to kill myself because death terrifies me. I just don’t want to exist anymore. I often wish I could just lay in my bed and not get up ever again. I want to spectate the world, not be apart of it because I don’t have anything to offer. 

I’m probably gonna be alone for my whole life. There’s no reason to pick me to be a friend or an SO because there are so many better options. I don’t understand why I’m like this, I have a good family, a good life, yet I still hate my life and myself. I cry every night thinking about all of this and it’s starting to hurt keeping it all to myself. My parents are good people and I can talk to them about anything, but I don’t feel comfortable talking to anyone. I’ve gotten to the point where I don’t feel comfortable around anyone anymore. I feel so alone and tired and I know I’m just one insignificant person, but I feel like I’m carrying the entire weight of the universe on my shoulders.

121,"My sister and I just moved away for college. We’re sharing an apartment together and we’re only two hours away from home but it’s been really hard on both of us. Like one day, I’ll be fine and the next, I’ll be crying my eyes out. Is there any way to make this easier?",24Aug2020,1
122,"So, quick background:  35M, never married.  I broke up with my long term girlfriend (of 5 years) about 6 years ago (before that, I was in the Army and never had a relationship of more than a few weeks).  Short story is she wasn't putting any effort near the end and I wanted to try and fix our relationship and she was very ""meh"" and dismissive about it.  I found out later she had cheated on me early on.  It definitely affected my trust a bit, and I decided to spend some time sorting my life out and did.  I'm in a pretty stable job, I'm doing a few online classes to complete a certification that will get me a nice career boost, and I just bought a new home.  So, I'm ready to start trying to find someone again.  


The problem I am running into is that I don't really know what to say over messaging to keep a conversation going.  I've talked to about 3 or 4 different ""Matches"" on Plenty of Fish and I feel like if I'm not asking questions the conversation just starts to die.  I don't want to sound like I'm bragging, but I have fairly good interpersonal skills when having conversations face to face in the real world (probably because I'm a teacher), but I just don't have anything to judge how they are feeling when online.  I don't want to be one of those awful creepers that gets shared as an awful conversation, but with little feedback I don't really know how to proceed and what to say to engage someone in a meaningful conversation over a platform that feels so impersonal.  


This whole thing is starting to stress me out a bit and I need some sort of check if it's just me or if this is just the way of ""digital dating""?  


Really, I just want to find someone to settle down and have a family with but I can't seem to get past this dating app awkwardness.  It makes me feel like I'm back in high school, 14 years old, and afraid to talk to girls.",24Aug2020,1

125,"Hi, I'm going to start this off by saying I'm a 14-year-old girl, and the other person involved is 18 and also a girl. We have been friends for about a few months and met online, never meeting in person and not planning to.

Recently, she told me that she had a crush on me, and has had one since around the beginning of July. It seemed really out of nowhere and I was left somewhat in shock. All I was thinking was ""what the actual fuck""  This is a person I hadn't been talking to much recently, maybe sending a text asking how they are around once a week and that was it. I was trying to rationalize it in my mind, thinking that they might not be 18 and I imagined it or that they might not have known that I was 14, but I scrolled back through our messages and saw that we had both stated our ages. Meaning she was 18 and she knew I was 14.

But that wasn't all I saw when I scrolled back through, I was kind of creeped out when I saw the number of times she had called me things like mamas, baby girl, baby, bb, bbyg, etc...

At the time I didn't think much of it and I'm not really sure why that didn't raise any red flags. But looking back on it I barely knew her when she was saying these things, and now she says she has a crush on me? I'm so very confused.

A friend of mine mentioned that she might be grooming me, and I can't manage to shake that idea.

So in your opinion, do you think I'm being groomed?

127,"This goes back waaaay back, since I was a kid and mind you I am an adult now. Anyways, I really don’t know what I should do with my family or myself. 

Some context: I come from a very low low-class, large family with many siblings, 4 older brothers, 1 older sis and another but younger. My oldest brother is a drug dealer. He’s been the middleman for my mom for years as her supplier and seller, meaning she’s an addict (but denies it). My dad has had a past of alcoholism but he turned his life around when I was a teen, and I was the only one who actually actively helped him; despite having adult siblings at the time, I had to help him out. I didn’t mind since I thought it was a great thing though.

My older siblings never helped my dad out, and hates him and does not respect him due to them having to experience my dad during his alcoholism days (these siblings were kids at the moment). He wasn’t the best dad to them, and to me and my other siblings too, but he managed to turn his life around mostly all by himself and I give him a bunch of credit for that. My sisters and most of my brothers love him now, we’d literally do everything for him. I’d do the same for my mom, but she’s fucking up really bad at the moment. She sides with the eldest son( let’s call him Junior, 32, still lives at home, and complains to mom all the time) and he’s obviously her favorite even though she denies it.  

Throwback to a couple days ago, one of my other brothers, let’s call him Tim, gets into an argument with my mom about her and Junior talking shit about him and the rest of the family. She started crying and told him to fuck off and now she talks really rudely to Tim’s dog and hasn’t talked to me or my other sisters at all since then. 

Then, a couple days ago, my sisters and I find out that my mom doesn’t want my older sister here, saying ‘why did she come back, she doesn’t belong here’ just because she’s mad that Tim told her how it is? I know she’s more careful around my sisters and I because we can defend ourselves now, and we know what’s right and wrong. That doesn’t make up for her brainwashing my sisters and I into thinking my dad was the bad guy when we were kids. 

My dad at the moment has had enough of her shit and Junior’s shit. She’s always defending the shit he does and it’s been A LOT. He fucked up my dads credit so bad, and blames my dad for it and for where we live. He’s always asking people for money, is in extreme debt, doesn’t give a single shit about his pet (my sisters and I care more for him than he does) doesn’t pay rent, has stolen from everyone in my family, cashed my other siblings checks, thinks he can tell my dad to move out of the fucking kitchen even though he’s not bothering anybody, and thinks he can do whatever the fuck he wants living under MY DAD’S roof. My dad has kicked him out plenty of times before but he JUST DOESNT FUCKING LEAVE BECAUSE OF MY MOM. I just don’t fucking get it and I need advice because I’m sick of my mom and my brothers shit. If I can possibly come close to explaining how much disappointment and anger I have for them, they’re in the same group as Trump for me. If you read this far: thank you, I appreciate it. 

I don’t really give a shit about Junior anymore, yeah I know you should think the best about people and stuff but this guy is just a giant piece of shit. I literally have no faith in him at all. I’d like to help my mom out but that’s if she wants it, and she clearly doesn’t. Should I just walk away from her? At this point I have my life together enough that I don’t need her and her negativity in my life. But if she wanted help, genuinely, I would. 

TLDR: I’m sick of my mom and brothers shit and don’t know what to do with these people.",24Aug2020,1
128,"Hi, first time posting, let me know if there’s a better sub. 

I (25F) adopted my dog, Cheddar (8-9? M) in October of last year. I’ve had to guess that he’s an Australian Shepard/Golden Retriever/Chow Chow mix based on the accumulated guesses by myself and my friends at the dog park. My dog has been intimidated by my boyfriend(25m) from the start, barking, hiding under the bed when he comes come, whimpering if he comes too close. 

It’s been about a year, and I can definitely see ways he has warmed up to him. He jumps on the bed when he’s home and only goes under the bed to sleep, follows him around when he’a not looking, and only barks at my boyfriend when he gets home, which to me looks like excited, not fear behavior. 

My boyfriend is an amazing guy. I have spent 7 years with him, and he thinks Cheddar will never like him. He doesn’t have a lot of experience with pets.

It was hard to let go of social media at first but over time I got used to it and over time I realized how toxic social media really was and how it was taking over my life. Overtime however I told myself that I don’t wanna go back to it at all after realizing that I don’t really NEED it.

I don’t know if reddit counts as social media but I mainly use it for news and entertainment. 

Fast forward to now. I’m about to start a new life in college, leaving my past behind me. However, I’m second guessing if I need to stay off social media.

I moved to United States Houston when I was 19 in 2010 to study here via green card. I(29M) graduated this summer from college after 10 long years which was painful and made my whole family including my grandmother happy. I became overweight during these 10 years which affected my confidence and health greatly but I lost about 27 pounds last year and keeping off the weight so far. I deeply got into debt but paid off everything from student loans to credit cards and the car I drive and now I am 100% debt free, this also happened last week. I experienced love like feelings for someone after a very long time but because of distance we couldn't get together which still bothers me a bit. I don't like Houston a lot. I work at a job I appreciate but don't enjoy nor make decent money($18/hr). I am looking for a job at the moment but I think Covid situation is going to make it harder. In theory I should be happy because I accomplished things that mattered to me a lot after 10 long years, but I lost excitement in life, I feel like I am missing something all the time.If I am happy for 2 days a week and not happy for the remaining 5 days. I don't exercise much. I like walking 30 mins a day which helps me stay calm and boost my morale. Why am I like this?

First off I’m sorry about the formatting, I’m currently on my phone. I’m 19 years old and I have an insane amount of pent up emotion and thoughts that just run through my head at a rapid pace all day, every day and I’m reaching a breaking point. I have so much I want to say that I’d never be able to fit it into one reddit post, but I’m hoping that I can at least get something out.

I think I have depression, I’ve never been to a doctor for it or told anybody about it, but I think I do. For the past 5 years I’ve had horrible thoughts about myself and my life and I can be have a good days, but there is always a sad feeling lingering in the back of my mind. I also have very bad social anxiety and ocd so I’m a pretty lonely person. Usually when people struggle with stuff like this it can be traced back to a bad childhood or something along those lines, but not me. I have a mother who supports me in anything I do and gives me so much positive reinforcement, and a step father who loves me and my brothers and has taken us on as his own. Even my extended family loves me and tells me I’m great. Nobody has ever put me down in my life, yet I still feel like I’m the scum of the earth. I think it’s because I know who I really am and nobody else does. I’m selfish, lazy, the complete opposite of my mother. I’m not physically attractive, nor am I smart or charming. I have absolutely zero redeeming qualities about myself and if I was someone else I wouldn’t like me. 

When it comes to me and my siblings I know I got the short end of the stick. Both my brothers are very attractive and charming people and I’m everything they’re not. I’m so anxious around people I don’t even like going into places like Walmart because it makes me so uncomfortable. The only time I go out is when I need to work. I’m working a job right now because I have no idea what I’m supposed to be doing with my life. My parents want me to go to school and do something, but the truth is I’m too stupid for school. High school was the worst time of my life and I don’t want to do it again. Everyone tells me I’m smart and I’ll do something great one day. People hold me to this certain standard that I just can’t meet because it’s not me.

It’s so unfair to my mom that she has a shitty person like me as her son, at least she has 2 more. I have no ambition the only reason I do anything I to please my mom. Ive never told anybody about how I feel, it’s better to keep it to myself because I don’t want to burden them with my stupid feelings.

I’m sure my family has noticed me change. I used to talk a lot more, make jokes, etc. I don’t really talk anymore unless I’m answering a question. Im so tired of myself. Before anybody says it, I don’t want to kill myself because death terrifies me. I just don’t want to exist anymore. I often wish I could just lay in my bed and not get up ever again. I want to spectate the world, not be apart of it because I don’t have anything to offer. 

I’m probably gonna be alone for my whole life. There’s no reason to pick me to be a friend or an SO because there are so many better options. I don’t understand why I’m like this, I have a good family, a good life, yet I still hate my life and myself. I cry every night thinking about all of this and it’s starting to hurt keeping it all to myself. My parents are good people and I can talk to them about anything, but I don’t feel comfortable talking to anyone. I’ve gotten to the point where I don’t feel comfortable around anyone anymore. I feel so alone and tired and I know I’m just one insignificant person, but I feel like I’m carrying the entire weight of the universe on my shoulders. I don’t think I’m cut out for life and I just wish I could quit. I have nothing to offer anyone, no skills, talents or anything.

I (M17) have been friends with someone (f16) for about 2 or 3 years. I remember having a mild crush on her for the first year we were friends, then we essentially fell out of contact for a while. About 3 or 4 months ago, we started hanging out again, and she was flirting from what i was able to perceive. (ruffling my hair, finding excuses to cuddle up next to me, constant compliments, etc.) 

Although i have been regarded as attractive by a lot of people at my school, because of my mental health struggles, i have trouble accepting compliments and have avoided relationships because of my fear of abandonment. but recently, i realized i have been falling in love with f16. She says i'm the only guy who really understands her, and she's one of the only people who have genuinely seemed to care about my well-being. 

She is bisexual, and as bisexuals often do, she talks about how much she wants to have a girlfriend, and makes semi-constant remarks of ""how gay she is."" I dont have a problem with that, i'm bisexual myself and fully understand, but it feels like one moment she's got her head on my shoulder and the next she is talking about how much she wants a girlfriend.

149,"So,  I was seeing this girl here and there about 11 years ago but we weren't dating. The last time we got together she was just starting to see somebody else who now is her husband. She got pregnant and roughly 9 months after we hooked up she gave birth. I wondered if it was possible that it was mine but I figured I was just over thinking, I saw them a couple years later and this baby had blonde hair and both of them have dark hair, I do not. At this point I made some comments to friends about it and they didn't seem to think he was mine so I figured again that I was over thinking it. Well, my brother is dating her best friend now and last week he told me that this girl told his girlfriend that she thinks I'm the father but that she(my brothers gf) wasn't allowed to tell anybody, she told my brother and made him make the same promise, being a super awesome brother, he told me. I started looking at pictures of the kid and it's insane how much he looks like me. So now I don't know how I should go about talking to her since I'm not supposed to know, even though I did have suspicions, and one of my friends says that since the kid is 10 now it would just hurt him to tell him the truth but some of my other friends agrees with me that since it's the truth he should know and he could potentially find out if he uses ancestry DNA or something like that anyway which could cause problems later.

150,"I love my girlfriend, and I know she likes me a lot, but I don’t get compliments from her, like ever. I thought maybe if I started complimenting her more often she’d say compliments back, like “your hair looks nice!” “Thanks! Yours does,too!” Nothing works, though, and I can’t help but feel unloved despite me knowing that’s not true. I guess it’s just that I need verbal confirmation of what I already know. I need reassurance or else I’ll just get really depressed.

We’re also long-distance when we’re not together at college, and she never calls or answers my calls. Never. We text, but a lot of times she just won’t respond to texts. She’s super busy, so I understand her not being able to answer when I call, but she also never calls back.

I finally told her over the summer how shit my life had become. Moved out of the house I loved and grew up in, my parent’s divorced and I got to meet the woman my father left my mother for. It was only after I told her all this that she finally said “I didn’t know you were going through that. I’ll call you,” which I appreciated, but I wish she’d just call because she felt like it. Not because I am suffering emotionally. Idk. Maybe that’s self centered of me to ask for.

Even if she had just called me once over the five month break for five minutes, I would have been ecstatic. Didnt happen. She says she prefers talking face to face rather than FaceTime or over the phone so she just doesn’t do that (though one of our mutual friends said she called them late at night one night).

I don’t want to come off as vain or self-centered. I also don’t want to leave her. I realize the stuff I said makes it sound worse than it really is. I just wish I could tell her without making her feeling like I was demanding things. She and her friends have a history of dealing with guys that were demanding and controlling of the time they spent with them, and I really don’t want to sound that clingy.

158,"So firstly, he’s not actually my romantic partner, in the sense that he doesn’t go around telling everyone that I’m his boyfriend. We’re more like best friends, but that kind of understates what our relationship is like. We met in April online, and everyday since then, we’ve hung out together through FaceTime, texting, or playing video games. To further emphasize how unusual our relationship is, we spend easily 12 to 18 hours together doing this every day, and that’s not even counting the time we sleep, because we usually sleep together on call too. 

Now I know that’s unhealthy, but that’s why I’m here. Me and him have talked about this, about how this was only possible because of quarantine and summer vacation, and we know this probably won’t last after school starts again. We’ll still be besties, but we can’t spend time together 24/7 anymore because we’ll both be busy with high school (he’s a freshman and I’m a junior). And that means no more FaceTiming when we both fall asleep, which might be a HUGE problem.

At night, I usually fall asleep with him on FaceTime. I know it might be weird to some, but it just happens and we enjoy each other’s company. And on those rare nights where he falls asleep while playing video game’s and he doesn’t make it to his phone, I go to sleep right away so that I can wake up when he calls me in the morning. However, on the days we DON’T go to sleep together, I always find myself restless and unable to sleep. We fight some days and don’t talk till the next morning, and I spend those nights awake staring at my ceiling for hours until I’m tired enough to squeeze in an hour or two of sleep. Even when we don’t fight and my bestie simply falls asleep in the middle of the day, I can’t seem to put my mind at ease enough to fall asleep because we’re not together at night.

This is a huge problem, I know, and it will probably affect me negatively when I start school again. I know that my bestie also has trouble sleeping without me, and I assume it’s for the same reason in that he just can’t put his mind to rest unless we sleep together. I’ve googled this and come up with results like separation anxiety, but that’s all observed in babies and pets. There’s nothing on mostly grown humans like me. So I guess what I’m asking is, do you guys have any advice on how to deal with this, because school is starting again in just a week.",24Aug2020,1
159," This happened on May.

161,"Boyfriend and I have been together for a year, living together for 2 months. Today we had a small argument and it seems he thinks I am being extremely insecure while I think I am being completely rational. I’m just looking for someone else to help me!

My boyfriend, m, has a girl on his Snapchat who I feel immensely uncomfortable with.

This girl (we will call her A) was someone he slept with before we even started talking. No idea how long ago it was nor do I care to know at this point. 

I saw a red flag with A the day after we started officially dating. He posted us on Snapchat with the caption ‘girlfriend’ and she swiped up with sad faces saying ‘you’re never single when I’m fully single :-( ugh I missed my chance again!’.

He replied with something harmless. But, I never forgot that because who the heck says that?! Anyways, A has talked to him off and on about work stuff (she got a job at his company but diff departments so he congratulated her and such), no biggie.

Today I found out though that she has been saying ‘Miss you m :-(‘ and things of that nature. He doesn’t reply, but in my mind she is testing the waters to see if he will respond in a trifling manner. She also today sent photos to him of her in our city, and saying she’s free. 

It bothers me a lot. He has admitted that she is very flirtatious (not always at him) and that she probably would do things with him knowing he’s in a relationship.

I asked him why he still entertains her, even though she somewhat consistently tests the waters, he says he really doesn’t. I kinda agree, but I asked if he could remove her because she makes me uncomfortable (I also said I’m not mad at him, just at her).

He argued with me (not rudely, just would not un-add her). He kept saying ‘well she’s a friend’ and my whole thing is, would a friend say these things to you knowing you’re in a relationship?

I trust him not to cheat. However, I do not trust this girl. At all. Nor do I like how she speaks to my boyfriend. Am I being crazy for asking him to remove her?",24Aug2020,1

169,"Not long ago I got a message from my friend, ""greg"", that another friend ""tom"" raped this girl(that I later found out greg has feelings for). At first wouldnt give me a name, or details. Greg said he was gonna give him what he deserves.  At another point the females name slipped, and I said, tell shelby (they never gave me  a last name and I know multiple shelbys) to go to the police. She wouldnt, he wouldnt, and I didnt feel right trying to take any action without knowing any details. Greg is the eggagerative/ pretty untrustworthy type and it's hard to see tom being a raper(if that makes sense) but, nonetheless, this is a very serious accusation and if that is indeed what happened, something needs to be done. Well, fast forward a couple days and, from what I was told after doing some digging, tom pulled out his junk and tried to put it in shelby's mouth. And from what I was told, it stopped at that. Now do not get me wrong, i dont agree with this, that's super fucking weird and creepy, but not knowing any other details, maybe tom got a signal and misread the hell out of it? Maybe hes weird and thought it was okay? I don't know. But apparently, it stopped there and he stayed the night until the next morning. Regardless, I do not condone it whatsoever and it makes  me very uneasy with tom. But what am I supposed to do? I dont know which girl it is for certain, greg wants to do serious harm and/or kill tom, and I'm just someone he vented to. I don't know what to think or what to do, that's obviously not rape, it could be molestation if I'm not mistaken and if greg is telling the truth, but as a ban outsider with only partial(possibly) true information, what action am I supposed to take if any? 

TL;DR: one friend said another friend raped this girl, seems like if anything it was molestation and I dont know for sure which girl it was. What do I do?",24Aug2020,1
170,"Pedophilia

I'm 15 and I get horny thinking about having sex with 12 year olds, only though if they look like they're my age or like a year younger. I don't act on it (masturbate) because I know it's gross and just thinking about it makes me super uncomfortable and disturbed, but sometimes I feel like I just have to. I hate pedophiles and they disgust me, me thinking about having sex with children makes me sick and it's cruel that some ppl have the audacity to treat a young girl in an inappropriate manner. But when they look super close to my age, I feel like as I do when I normally find a girl my age attractive and hot. I don't know what to do. Is this normal to feel like this? I'm never going to actually try to have sexual intercourse with a young girl, that's just cruel and disgusting and no young girl deserves that, but I feel like masturbating still. Again, only if they look like my age or insanely close. I feel like killing myself and I feel like I'm nearing my breaking point.

171,"I’ve been seeing this girl for a few months now and I really like her. She says that she has fallen in love with me over the past few months and I can’t say it back because of her over protective parents. 
Even though we have been seeing each other for a few months the majority of the time when we see each other it involves me sneaking into her house at midnight and leaving at around 5 the next morning as if I was a freshman in highschool. We are both college students, the only reason she lives at home is because she is attending a local community college and I am also staying at home while attending a different college not far from where I live. 
We both click without even trying, we both have the same interests, we both do the same things for fun, we both are extremely goal oriented in our career paths and have plans set up for the future. We are similar in too many ways to count but also different in 1000 different ways which makes things interesting.
I would like to say I see a future with her being that we click on so many levels and she is already there with me but I just don’t know if I can get there just yet. Marrying young isn’t a problem with me because it runs in the family and those marriages all turn out to be successful despite the marrying young stigma. The one thing holding me back is our family dynamics. I am very family oriented, my family has been aware of her since the first month i started seeing her. They have all met her, I go out of my way to try to invite her to different family events when she can go and they all encourage me to invite her over more often  but as for her, her parents don’t even know I exist. 
I can’t with confidence say I am going to commit to this women without seeing her family dynamics, how they hold themselves as people and how well they treat there own family and if they are willing to accept me into there family as there daughters partner. She says her dad and the rest of her family is extremely protective over her and they don’t like the men that have been introduced to them in the past. I’m not entirely sure what’s holding her back from meeting them and she gets annoyed when I refrain from saying i love you despite telling her my stance on the situation so I guess I’m asking how to approach this situation?

While I do want to respect my extended family, I feel the best way would be to be truthful with them and to let them see me as I really am. My tattoo has lots of meaning and is very personal to me, so it should not be a big deal. It feels very hurtful because I just want to be accepted and supported.

I wish I wasn’t this fucking weak retard, who can’t keep a promise. I promised myself I would start hating my friend and never unblock him. But I broke that promise 7 fucking times and went back to talking to him. He rarely fucking texts back. He reads my messages too smh.

175,"So basically me and my friend (Person A) have been going to our local library to study together after school for the last 2 years pretty frequently. Since we are only going to school 2 days out of the week and the rest is online, she asked if I wanted to meet up with her to go to the library and study, like me and Person A had done previously and I agreed (this was a month ago). 

Today I got a text from my other my friend asking if me and Person B could form a study group and go to the library and meet up, and we all agreed. This is where I messed up because I can’t manage having two study groups 😔.

You might be wondering, why don’t you just invite the Person A to the new study group that you just agreed to? Well you see the Person A and Person B are actually childhood friends. They were friends back in second grade till 9th grade but they don’t really talk to each other ANYMORE. However 3 years ago when me, Person A, and Person B were all friends they would constantly leave me out and that was the hardest year of my life and I suffered from really low self esteem because of it. I’m scared that the same thing will happen again.

So basically I’m afraid to invite Person A because she will probably ruin the dynamic and leave me out, but I don’t think I can maintain having two different study groups. What do I do?",24Aug2020,1

I’ve been at the gym for 4 days.

I just got word that my grandfather is very sick (don’t want to get into detail) and is likely not going to make it, so I need to move back to my home state ASAP to take care of/be with family and assist with the aftermath.

I contacted the owner and she was very rude about it, stating that there’s no way to get any of the money back, not even for the second month or any sort of partial refund. 

I’m so broken. I already have to break my lease and worry about so many other things in addition to starting classes tomorrow (online).

I joined as a major investment in myself and now I’m stuck basically giving someone a large amount of money to be at a gym for 4 days.

None of my peers are doing these things.

I don't want to keep doing all this extra work without any increase in pay, but I'm also afraid of officially taking on some kind of leadership role. I am really uncomfortable delegating work and the idea of giving negative feedback to somebody gives me the willies. Right now, I feel like an unofficial ""coordinator"" and spokesperson for my peers. Thankfully, they seem OK with this, and have even commented that they are glad it's me who is in this unofficial coordinator-type role because I give others credit where it's due and make sure to get their input on things. 

I guess the advice I'm looking for is how others have handled this situation as far as bringing it up for discussion directly with my manager vs waiting for them to do it, or any resources you may have to help a more introverted and/or conflict-avoidant type person move into a leadership role.

would go to afterschool just so she could sit on my
desk and she wouldn't let anyone sit on my chair. Pretty weird I thought. But it was kinda cute And she was cute so I started texting her and we texted for like a week and then shit got mad dry cause of her, she never texted first and always sounded mad bored so i asked her do u not like me no more and she said no I just don't wanna bother u by texting u too much, anyways same dry texting happens again the next day so i told myself why do I have to put myself out there and go through so much effort for someone who kind of is misleading me and I stopped texting her.

But Then a month and a half goes by and my lonely self wonders maybe
she won't be dry again and i was kinda thinking about
her, so i texted her and we hit it off and we texted and
talked for like 3 months and then at the end of the third month she started being dry again and subtly hinting that she doesn't like me no more so I striked up a conversation about my friend because that’s how she actually got  in contact with me because he gave her my @, and i striked up this conversation because she was always dry when I talked to her about herself or me  or anything but when I would even bring his name out she would get this sudden burst of energy and text a lot about him, and she would say “oh he’s so nice and funny” and then i slowly started thinking she doesn’t like me because she saw my friend and thought he was better then me and it really hurt to see that tbh but i told myself no maybe she just really respects him. But I still stopped texting her. Then a couple weeks later i started thinking about her but this time i said fuck that I’m not falling for that shit again and i said fuck it and unfollowed her on everything so I can forget about her, and it’s worked. Then later I was out with that same friend and I was texting our soccer coach about something through his account cause I had his phone and I see her account near the top and her saying “Good morning ☺️” to him and tbh it did kind of hurt not because I still like her but because the fact she left me to go try to get with my best friend.

189,"Hello everyone. I am a second year university student. A bit about me: I am an honest, hardworking student with a 4.0 gpa and also lots of volunteer experience in my field of study. 

A few nights ago, something so unexpected happened to me. In one of my courses, I received a pretty bad assignment grade (I believe the median was a 39% or something), and I was just pretty confused. I looked at my professors solutions, and I realized that for one of the answers, i got the right answer but still received so many deductions. I couldn't tell what I did wrong. I asked a bunch of others and they got similar solutions and the same deductions. So like them, I emailed my prof for a request. His reply to me (which is the first every exchange I have with him) was this: 

""I have strong reasons to believe that you plagiarized your solutions. I will do everything in my power to make sure you fail the course."" 

Nothing else. I was so shocked... I mean, I didn't cheat!! I emailed him asking what I did for him to make that assumption, and he refused to elaborate. I emailed him AGAIN, and then he finally started to ask me to explain this one line, which I did... I am not going to keep going cause it honestly is such a shitshow and thats not the point of my post, but basically, he has accused a large portion of the class for ""plagiarizing"" something so random and trivial, it literally doesnt make sense. But my concern is his first ever email to me. ""I will do everything in my power to make sure you fail the course"". Is this not a threat? He only sent this statement to me out of everyone he sent accusation emails to. Not only this, but he completely ignored the professor protocol when accusing a student of an academic offence. I am wondering if his email (in particular, that one statement) is something I can get him in trouble for? I will appeal his accusation, no problem, but I am just not okay with him saying this. Like, at all.

190,"I’m asking because I’m not 100% certain it was him, but I’m pretty sure it was. 

So Friday night after coming home from work, I made the stupid decision to leave my bike in the backyard unlocked. I almost always lock it whenever I leave it unattended, even at home. Guess this time I was unlucky, because next day when I went to get it, it wasn’t there. Someone took it.

I figure it’s probably my neighbor Tim. He’s the boyfriend of my sisters friend mom. My sisters and their friend have told me earlier this month that they caught him trying to steal bikes. According to them, he was going backyard to backyard taking bikes. My brother also said he and his friend caught him one day looking closely at bikes in people’s backyards. A acquaintance of mine who lives next door to him also said he saw him coming home with bikes. 

So based on all this, I’m almost certain he’s the thief. I searched the neighborhood but couldn’t find my bike. So tommorow, I’m planning to confront him. I’m also bringing along a few witnesses. Normally, I would file a police report, but I admittedly don’t know much about the bike. A police report would almost certainly do nothing. So I think confronting him is the best course of action to get the bike back. 

Can anyone give me advice on what I should do or say while confronting him given I don’t have evidence it was actually him ?",24Aug2020,1
191,I feel like my gf and all my friends talk about me behind my back but how could I tell like they leave me out of conversations they say oh I was talking to him earlier but I can’t tell you what it was about and stuff like that,24Aug2020,1
192,"So I have night shifts cleaning a school, so I'm there completely alone, no other human or animal around, except spiders and flies which I am always very glad to see now. I figured at first, because I dislike interacting with people, that this would be the perfect in-between job for me, but it's becoming quite obvious that I can not stand the aloneness after all. 

It is fine otherwise, but it also allows my mind to release all these horror scenarios of ghosts and demons and murderers which I haven'thad since I was a child (which is kind of funny I guess, but also NOT FUCKING ONE BIT) and so I have a heart attack every time I turn a corner and there hangs a black coat or a chair is left in the middle of the hallway. And when I come home and attempt to sleep, it takes forever to actually fall asleep. I feel scared to... And then in almost no time I wake up anyhow, from a nightmare. And every nightmare I have makes the burden heavier, worsens my stress. Sleep deprivation certainly doesn't help, it has had me breaking down emotionally at work a few times now.

What do I do?

I feel stuck. Quitting would mean I have to exert myself again to look for new work and I just know it will suck the little life that's left in me right out. I'm fucking tired. How do I fix my mind from this?",24Aug2020,1
193,"Hello r/Advice 

Today I was talking to my father about a trip that was planned by my mother about 6 months ago. Basically the trip was to go to a island and go fishing for a weekend in  a rented cottage with my mother and other sibling. My father however thinks that with this whole virus I should spend two weeks at my mothers house after our trip for isolation. I would normally have no problem with this but my dad is gonna 100+ party with relatives coming down which live in a COVID  hot zone. 

Should I confront him about his plan or should I just go along with it?",24Aug2020,1
194,"I(24) got a new job working in the cafe of a local grocery store in my city. I love my workplace, helping my community, seeing my customers, and working in coffee. Unfortunately, my manager (f/30s) is becoming a nightmare and I'm not sure how to deal with it.

I was clocked out today and waiting for a ride outside when my manager came out on her lunch break and started talking to me. I told her I was writing an email update to our coworkers because I plan to use they/them pronouns exclusively. I previously used she/they. My manager proceeded to tell me ""it's totally cool that your changing your pronouns, but let me apologize now because I'll never remember that."" This is frustrating because I'm extremely androgynous and I work in a setting with multiple nonbinary and gender nonconforming individuals. HR has made multiple statements that our store is inclusionary and misgendering is unacceptable.

My manager proceeded to vent to me (while I was off the clock, writing an email, and obviously unreceptive) about how she's conflicted about politics. She understands all stories in every rape situation she's confronted with (I have no idea how this came up, I don't discuss trauma with people if I can help it because I have severe PTSD.) and she thinks women should just be more verbal in saying no. She proceeded to share details of her trauma with me. 


I'm frustrated. Her lack of managerial skills (our department is a disgusting mess and she refuses to enforce rules) have already driven my decision to switch into a different department. This will take place later this month. I don't know what to do, though. I haven't been at my job very long (2 months), but I don't want to leave over coworker politics. I love my job aside from this.


I want my pronouns to be respected. I hold everyone to the same standard; misgendering is not okay and intentional/repeated misgendering is discrimination that needs to be addressed. I don't want to know about my manager's trauma, I dont want to hear her victim shame survivors of sexual assault. I don't know how to react because tensions are high in our department already, which I know because my manager overshares everybody's business (including my coworker's disabilities). I don't want to overreact or seem like a problem, but I'm concerned about the apparent lack of boundaries from the person that has control over my job. I'm scared to speak out and experience backlash or establish myself as a snitch, but I dont want to stay silent and complacent because it's reallybnegatively impacting me. Is this worth taking to HR, or should I just suck it up? How do I get out of that type of conversation if it happens again?",24Aug2020,1
195,"About a year ago I started seeing this guy. We really hit it off and were spending a ton of time together. One morning he left before I woke up and sent me a text saying “I’ll come back after my game baby”, and then just disappeared off the face of the earth. Four months pass and I get a text from his brother. His brother tells me that he had broken his neck in the game and been paralyzed from the neck down ever since. He was just leaving the hospital at that time and asked his brother to let me know what had happened. It was in the news and I had somehow missed it and thought he was just some asshole who ghosted me!! We’ve been talking from time to time ever since but it wasn’t until I recently moved closer to him (the accident made him have to move in with his family) that we are considering rekindling the spark we had. At this point, he has gained movement from the waist up, but is still in a wheel chair for the time being but probably not permanently. I just want to know how I can plan a good date that won’t be too taxing on him or make him feel uncomfortable. As of a month ago, he didn’t feel comfortable leaving his house. But as of this week, I suggested us going for a stroll on an asphalt nature trail sometime so he can get some fresh air and he said it sounded great!! My only concern is that it might be really physically hard to roll yourself through a nature trail for a long period. I know he’s been in the chair for months at this point but he hasnt really left the house so I feel rolling for a long time might be hard on his arms but I don’t want him to get frustrated/insecure if he gets tired or if he needs me to push him at any point. I just need advice for good summer dates that are wheelchair accessible without making it seem that I am babying him. I know he really valued being strong and athletic before his accident, but I really didn’t care about all of that I just liked him so the wheelchair makes no difference to me. I just want him to feel comfortable and for us to find our new normal without accidentally hurting or offending him. Help please!",24Aug2020,1

199,"Okay this is super cliché. i know i dont need a boyfriend. i am almost 19 and a freshmen in college right now. i havent had a boyfriend since my junior year of HS. i know now that it was such a flawed relationship and i see it so differently now than i did at the time. it was doomed from the start. And as time has gone on, its not him i miss. its the lack of physical contact. not just sex (although that would be fucking awesome at this point) its the cuddling and hugging and feeling the warmth of someones body. its having someone to talk to, someone to be excited to share with. Someone that compliments and reassures you. 

there are so many parts about relationships I dont miss. Being mistreated and lied to. wasting my days being miserable over the unmatched effort i put in. obviously it wasnt perfect 

but now, more than ever because if quarantine im lonely. im in a new school environment where i knew almost nobody going in. Its hard enough to make friends with covid restrictions on campus, let alone meet a guy and start dating him. 


i just need some reassurance here. I dont want another random hookup (although i will honestly probably take that opportunity when it presents itself) i crave a connection. and i just feel lonely as hell right now. i cant be the only one. any advice would be greatly appreciated.",24Aug2020,1

I flirted with her for a while, and then I started to realize that I would always be the one to make the calls, to text first, to start the conversation first, so I’m and so forth. So I said I was done with her and I stopped talking to her for about a month. And throughout the month she’s been trying to text me back but I kept on putting her to the side and telling myself, “I need to know my worth”. And so now a few weeks ago, she slid up on my story and kinda pulled me into a conservation. So we’ve talked like here and there but I haven’t made it easy for her. Like I don’t just throw my self out there and then her not see me as valuable. So basically we were talking and she kept on asking me questions like, “have you ever thought abt us?” Or, “what do you think our kids would look like?” And so on and so forth.

209,"A few years ago, my friend graduated university and started an internship. During this time, she began complaining of feeling winded and breathless when she went for walks. She went to the doctors who gave her blood tests but they couldn't find anything wrong. She took a lot of time off from her internship anyway and told them she would not be able to complete some of her work. At the time, I assumed this was her having anxiety even though she was convinced it was a purely physical condition. I didn't worry too much because she was still doing her life and visiting her girlfriend a lot etc. 

However, over the years the shortness of breath has greatly affected her life. First she said she couldn't get a full time job, then she couldn't hang out with friends and now she just stays in bed all day and never leaves the house. She won't even take her family dog for a 5 minute walk because she says she gets too breathless or nauseated. She no longer speaks to her former girlfriend. 

For years she has been going to doctors for tests and even requesting specific tests and trying different doctors but no one can find what is wrong. At this point I am beginning to think her condition might be entirely mental. One reason for this, is because I saw her laptop and it looks like every day she is reading about people with severe illnesses online and googling diseases etc. I think if you think about something this much, it can take on a life of its own in your head. It seems self sabotaging. Maybe she has breathing problems but then by never exercising, rarely leaving bed, not making proper meals for herself, she is only making her body feel more sick. 

I am worried that she is on a slippery slope and soon it will be years of her never leaving bed and never starting her career and losing years of her life. Do you think I should consider that this is her having only anxiety/hypochondria? If so, how do I tell her or help her? My girlfriend thinks she can only help herself as she doesn't want to be helped but I'm so worried about her. I am probably the person closest to her as her family relationship isn't great, they aren't accepting of her sexuality so I can't rely on anyone else to deal with it.",24Aug2020,1

&amp;#x200B;

I have personally never had any one on one issues with my BFs mom, we have never fought, every time i see her I plaster on a smile and make good [conversation.As](https://conversation.As) far as i know, she thinks her and I are on good terms.I am currently at a cross roads because as of late, everyday he tells me of the mental abuse he endures living with her and i feel completely helpless not knowing how to defend him.

&amp;#x200B;

She verbally abuses him everyday at home, screaming about nonsense, throwing his belongings, threatening his place to stay, saying she is selling his things or is going to throw him out. And I know you're probably thinking, ""what does he do to make her that way?"" and as shocking as it sounds, nothing. My BF is a very kind person, the most amazing and caring person I've met, and other than normal things a full time working 19yo does like leave clothes around or empty glasses in his room, he's not a bad person and it kills me to not know how to help his situation.

Its hard to know what to do now since his previous relationships ended at the hands of his mother and I dont want to be another girl she ran out of his life. Should i speak to her despite what my bf says? Should i just stay quiet and support him while he rides it (roughly another year or so)out before we can live on our own?

We needed a third roommate really bad. We just moved in yesterday and she's been a nightmare. My buddy was off at his parents' last night, and I was home with her. She had a few friends over and that was fine.

An hour or so later a few more of her friends came by and they started drinking. It was fine for awhile, but they got super rowdy and loud. They started arguing outside and inside for like 20 minutes. They said some obscene stuff and normally I don't really care, but we just moved in and we don't really know our neighbors so I was worried about getting a complaint and it was embarrassing. Our neighbors are all like families. 

Today I got home from work, and I wanted to smoke a bowl with my buddy. She came into my room with her cousin( he's pretty cool, and I feel so bad for him) The whole time she was being super obnoxious, rude, and passive aggressive. She then randomly started acting like a child and said she was an N word out of nowhere. we were hanging out she randomly started to say stuff to me that was  very passive aggressive. I had mentioned what happened to my buddy cause 1. it was not okay and 2. he is also someone who lives here, and she started saying stuff like I ratted her out or something kinda jokingly then later she goes, ""Oh my gosh, you told us we were being loud last night. I'm sorry"" It was very awkward. 

I only stepped out when she started screaming that she was gonna break down the door. When I stepped out, she looked at me said ""oh heey"" then just walked away. I ended up talking to her cousin about what was going on, and he told me he was just trying to control everyone. I never once told them they were loud or to be quiet. I just stepped out to make sure things weren't bad.

214,"Hello team. I would really love some advice on this (either from people who’ve gone through it or just good advice-givers!). 

Last September, my mom was in a freak car accident and passed away. It came as a shock to my whole family. My mom was my best friend and I miss her every day. I have an amazing therapist and have made good progress in the first year. But I still miss her. 

My parents lived in the same house my entire life. I lived there until I turned 18 and then moved to a nearby city. I come back for the weekend every month or so with my boyfriend to visit, and have been here for the summer to escape the city during the pandemic. 

My dad (who’s a wonderful person and we have become much closer after my mom’s death, but he’s still not the most emotionally open person. But he tries!) said he would not do anything with the house for at least a year. Now that we are nearing the one year anniversary, he said he’s pretty certain he wants to sell the house and get something smaller. 

This house.....is my mom. She put so much care into it. And it’s the only place I’ve ever known as a home base. I love my current city, but I love knowing this home is here and I love visiting and being in the familiar place and surrounded by memories. I completely understand why my dad wants to move and I don’t even necessarily disagree with him. I want him to be happy, and I think living alone in this house is just too much. 

So for the advice- have any of you gone through “losing” your childhood home? Do you have any advice for how to handle it or ways to remember it or I don’t know. I’m open to any ideas. I’m just so sad and I would love some insight either from people who have been in similar situations or just anyone in general. Thank you for reading!",24Aug2020,1

218,"Pretty sure this is the correct subreddit so here we go.

I (f18) am pretty sure that I should see a therapist. I think I may have some kind of mental illness due to the fact that I am showing some of the signs of them. However, I am very aware that self-diagnosis is not a good idea so I will not be making any claims. If I don't have any kind of mental illness I still think that I need therapy to help me overcome some issues in my life so my life doesn't far of the tracks before it begins as some of the aforementioned potential symptoms are affecting my life (chronic procrastinator, troubles concentrating, overall lack of motivation, and apathetic feelings towards pretty important decisions) But, I'm not here to ask about what you think of my mental state. If I wanted help with that I'd be on r/AskDocs. My question is what should I do if I don't have the means to go to a therapist. One issue is, I can't drive so I would need to be taken on someone else's time or stick to strictly online therapy. But, I'm not really concerned about that one. The big issue is that I don't have money for a therapist. I don't have a job so no source of income and getting one doesn't seem like a good idea given that I can barely handle my college classes and even though I have some money saved up it wouldn't last long given how expensive therapy is and I am counting on that to help me get started after college when I have to start supporting myself. I could ask my parents. They would probably help me out, but I have this thing where I tend to panic when asking people for stuff whether it be a ride, ordering a book I need for school from amazon (even if I plan to pay them back), or if I can audition for a part in a performance. All of those result in me panicking, stressing out, getting really tense, breaking down into tears, and potentially curling up into a ball. One time I even started hyperventilating (another reason I think I need therapy). Asking for something as big and expensive as therapy would probably just about kill me and end up with me walking away before I could ask. Maybe I'm making way too big a deal about this. Actually I know I am. I've probably given way too much excess context so basically...

TL;DR: I think I need therapy. I don't have the money for it. I'm to panicky to ask my parents to help pay.",24Aug2020,1

220,"Title makes it sound worse. ALL my college classes are online now and before it was shut down I was living on campus (too expensive to live off campus in Los Angeles if I’m not even going to class)  so I have been living back home in the Bay Area with my parents. I hate living in my sleepy home town when all my other friends are off at their colleges and my college friends are far away. 

I started dating someone last month and he goes to college in Oregon. I’m F20 he is M20. He wants me to move up there this semester and get an apartment ( my OWN apt, he has his own w a friend, and pretty cheap to live there especially compared to LA) he is in a good frat at school and has a good social life, I know it won’t be the same bc of covid, but I think it would be healthier for me to be living on my own and be around people my age instead of cooped up with my parents for months. 

is it CRAZY for me to go move there w him? If I stayed home we would be long distance. Our relationship has progressed super fast but I feel like I’m in an emotional and less logical mind state. ANY advice would be great!

I've been asking my parents and neither of them have college educations so naturally they don't see the point of college.

I can't visualize a way out of this situation without having a degree. I moved in with my dad at the start of the pandemic and have spent most of my time applying for jobs and all of the ones that would pay enough for me to get an efficiency and not be losing money every month require a bachelor's degree or a technical certification.

I've also spent time as I'm sure many people have trying to learn the stock market and how to trade to gain extra income. I don't see that helping me much either especially considering it's not like I have much money to invest.

At night he does meow a lot and cuddle with us and that was pretty normal before we moved. I'm just really worried since he hasn't been eating as much as he usually does.

236,"TLDR: Feeling trapped in college due to controlling mother. She forced me into college right after high school, leaving me unprepared. She's paying all the finances out of pocket, unfortunately, and was planning this since I was about 12. College was never my passion and tried for 2 years to convince her. Now in junior yr, I definetly want to drop out due to declining health but despite my reasons she still disagrees thinking college is the only way to be successful. What can I say to convince her otherwise? Should I even stay in school?

~~~~~~~~~~

 I was forced to stay at a private college. I'm now in my 3rd year still stuck in school and barely scraping by. My mom had saved and planned for me to go to college since I was 12. Of course, this college was the last choice on my list. 
I dont learn anything, the friends I knew withdrawed. I stopped eating and started sleeping more the first two years. With this whole COVID, it only made my depression even worse. I skipped my first week of classes and I'm already falling behind with homework.
Despite that, I recently applied and (surprisingly) got a $7/hr job at a restaurant. With this, I desperately want to work and not go to school. School was never my passion. I realized from my time there that graphic design is definitely not my cup of tea. 
Back when before/after I graduated high school, I wanted to take a gap year to find out what my passion was... of course, my mother had to say no. 
I'm worried that my health will get worse in the coming fall due to multitasking school and work along with COVID. 
I've explained my reasons (anxiety/depression are temporary problems in her eyes) for dropping but she still says no- after all its ""her money."" Since she handles the financial aspect of achool, I can't really dropout without her knowing...

Hello, I just want to say first off this is something I’d never do. I never open up about this type of thing but I feel like I’m lost And need advice. I never knew my father until I was 10 because he was locked up when I was a baby, he’s a opiate addict/dealer. I love my father but he has put me through stuff no one should have to go through. Very illegal things that i won’t talk about here, I was saving up for a car for for a few months, I had almost $2000 then He got locked up again and called me begging for me to bond him out, even promised me on his mother’s grave he’d never do heroin again. He had promised me that he would pay me back within a few weeks but he never did. When he got out he became worse on the drugs. I went to his house one day and didn’t see him so I walked in his room and just saw him laying in the bathroom under scolding hot water overfilling from the sink going onto his face, I moved him out the way of the water and he had third degree burns all on his face but he did wake up when I moved him. I looked at the sink and he had his needle sitting there, he overdosed. That happened like 2 months ago. He is currently out but he’s going to court for other charges and he will likely go back. I am not living with him, I’m with my mother as of now and she’s not as bad off as him but she is still a drug addict. She’s prescribed Xanax and quite a few other things, She does way more than she’s supposed to, I’ll see her nodding out and walking around like a zombie. If I say something to her about it she will say “I’m not on drugs, there prescribed” but obviously if you’re overusing meds to get High that’s a drug. The worse part is I have 3 siblings here (2 yr old/ 4yr old/ and a 10 yr old)
And there going through this right along with me, except we have different fathers. I was contemplating kms because I felt like I had nothing to live for but I thought of them and knew I couldn’t do that to them. We don’t even have food here even though she gets $1000 in ebt every month because she sells them all to buy more xans or whatever she does with it. I’ve begged and begged her to get help but she dosent care. I’m not comfortable here anymore she also has her fiending/addict friends here staying all the time. She just got a $1500 stimulus check and used absolutely nothing to improve anything here. We don’t even have a working fridge but it’s more important for her to spend that money elsewhere like we don’t have a care in the world or anything to take care of. I seen an eviction letter from our landlord saying that rent was 5 months behind but I’m not sure if he can actually evict us right now. I want to get a car and house to get my brothers out this situation. I hate it and hate they have to go through this. I’ve save up another $1000 almost but I don’t want to get a car that won’t last me anytime so I’m trying to save a little more. I’m just lost and a have no one to talk to, I need some words of wisdom. And if you read this thank you for taking you’re time to.",24Aug2020,1

252,"There's this super cute Hispanic girl that I work with making ventilators

I just label and pack them. She works near the front of the assembly ""line"" where they actually assemble them. So i hadn't really talked to her much before. She usually sits behind me at lunch break but i just hadn't thought to approach her.

I was bugging one of my workers that was her childhood friend to hook us up. While another one of my coworkers said he was just gonna go tell her i like her himself. I said i'd ask her out at the beginning of the shift the next day

Next day comes around and i catch up to her while we're walking to our stations. I was real blunt with her and told her i'd seen her around and thought she was really pretty and seemed very sweet. And asked if i could have her number

She stopped walking and looked a little bug eyed. She politelty told me she's not really dating but said we could still be friends. I told her that was fair enough and that i can respect that. And that you can never have too many friends. (her eyes got a little wide when i said this too) I didn't want to pester her about it or seem desperate 

She said thank you though and sorry. And we went about our business for the day. She went to her station and me to mine.

She disappeared for most of the rest of the day. She was sitting on the other side of the line behind some objects i couldn't see through. Learning a new skill in assembly i presume

She then went back to her regular job which partially involves working very close to where me and her childhood friend work. She came over to where he was and started chatting about how she wanted to learn how to do his job; since that was like one of the last things she wanted to learn apparently.

I was half dozing off since we were about 9 hours into out shift. So i wasn't paying too much attention. She was talking to him for a decent bit; about 5-8 minutes. Then she walked back to the other job she was doing that was close to us.

A little later and she's chatting with our lead that sits near where I work. Me and my coworker were goofing around since work was slow. I tried not paying too hard attention since it was not really my business but she had never talked to him that long. Again it was downtime, but still. They were going for about an hour. Like 20 minutes before break and all during break. When i was coming back from break i'm walking back to my station down the walkway and my lead makes a somewhat subtle hand motion that looks like he's half-pointing at me.  I walk by them and half-jokingly ask what they're chatting about. My lead said something like ""aahh"" or something along those lines and i went back to my station. They were still talking for about 20 minutes after break but moved further back behind some objects so i couldn't see or hear them anymore at all.

My lead is usually very humorous and we have some running gags we say for jokes. It may be nothing but a little later he referred to me as a ""pinche"" and he's never said that before. I was bagging one of the ventilator units and he just said: ""pinche Don"" or something like that. He wasn't whispering or anything he just said it straight to me. I asked what that meant and he said it was an adjective like meaning ""fucking Don"". But it's also like an offensive swear in some parts of Mexico; which is where he's from. He made another statement referring to me talking about ""69'ing"" which i had to google to figure out the meaning. My boss doesn't really address me with these things; not even as a joke.

i would ask if she told him about when i asked her out and if she thought too much of it. But i don't want to make it seem i'm thinking the worst of her. It's definitely not something he'd punish or fire me for. But i'm just wondering where her brain is at. i'm most likely gonna ask anyway when i go back to work on Wednesday

i had trouble keeping up with all these right from the beginning, the pressure of daily exams was just too much. most days i was unable to sleep and woke up with a headache in the morning. i'd feel so exhausted and tired right after waking up. then i started taking mild sleeping pills to sleep at night

from yesterday, started our semester mid exams, with double the syllabus and half the time than before. after studying for previous 2 days for the exam, while taking the exam yesterday i saw that they made the questions unnecessarily complicated so we couldn't cheat by googling. i was able to answer only 1.5 question out of 3.

after this i lost all my will to study for the next exams. i don't know what to do now. i now feel way more tired and exhausted than before . my head hurts. i lost my appetite. i don't know how to deal with this increasing pressure of the exams",24Aug2020,1
260,"This is my first “real” job since I graduated college last year. I’ve had many other jobs before, but I’ve never actually had to quit, I just kind of had an out, for example, going back to school at the end of the summer. I’ve been wanting to quit this job for months but I don’t have the guts to do it. I have enough saved up and I also have a second job (which I like) so there’s no real financial concern. I really just want to quit because I come home from work every day and just cry. I’m mentally and emotionally drained. I’ve been there for almost a year and haven’t really connected with any of my coworkers which doesn’t help things. So I’ve decided for the sake of my mental health I need to quit. Does anyone have any advice on how to put in my two weeks without burning any bridges? I will probably be leaving them a little short staffed so I’m scared they might try to guilt me into staying. I’m scared to even quit in the first place so I feel like I could be easily guilted into staying, even though I’m absolutely miserable.

263,"I have a 7 month old kitten that I bought with my own money a few months ago. At first my parents were against it but eventually let me keep him. 

Anyways my kitten bites sometimes unprovoked. No biggie. It’s a little habit he will outgrow. 

But my family has a problem with using their fingers as a toy. I’ve told them MANY times to stop because that’s teaching him a bad habit. 

According to my sibling, my NDad was playing with my kitten with his fingers. My cat bit him and my dad literally hit him really hard on his back, sending him flying. 

I’m pretty sure this is NOT a one time thing. 

My dad used to be my cats favourite (he better not be anymore). My cat would only get on his stomach in front of him. Cat owners KNOW that is a big sign of love. 

Before anybody gives me this “advice”, yes I am planning on moving out with my cat in the near future. I’m saving up but waiting for these stupid politicians to end this “pandemic” 

I want to tell my dad that this is my pet and that only horrible, evil people hurt animals. And that he should stop or else I will tell everyone he is an animal abuser.

264,"I (14m) need help with my relationship with my mom (47f). My mom works a lot, and the few times when does get breaks I try to give her her space, only really engaging when she initiates or if I feel like I really need to talk to her. 

I do a majority of the household chores, (pretty much everything except laundry, because she doesn't; trust me to do it) and when I see her doing stuff around the house I ask her if she needs help or if she wants me to do it, she usually says no (but occasionally says yes, only if she's washing the last few dishes in the sink before I get a chance to).

 As far as cooking I make my own breakfast and lunch every day, except occasionally on weekends, but during the week she wakes up before me and is usually leaving as I'm waking up so she makes her own stuff. As far as dinner we eat leftovers most days, and as for when we do cook we usually divide up the work so both of us make a part. I often ask to cook the whole thing but she rarely lets me. 

When my mom is tired she is irritable, and since I'm the only person she's ever around when she's irritable and angry (sometimes) I get to experience all of it because she only talks to other people about it when she has calmed down. She always talks about how she's so tired and is doing a thousand things at once (usually saying it frustrated and seemingly targeted at me but I could be misinterpreting it). I say anything about anything and I'm a disrespectful little shit who makes her life a living hell (or at least that's how she makes it seem.) (Also I'm autistic so I could be saying things and interpreting it completely different than how she does).

270,"For some people, challenge feeds their motivation. The bigger the challenge, the bigger the fire in their belly; I want to be one of those people but that's just not my natural temperament. I also have ADHD and OCD. The intrusive thoughts of the ocd feed into the emotional regulation issues of the adhd so even the smallest things can make it feel like my life is falling apart. I'm talking explosive anger, cussing, tears, horrible anxiety, all over things that I logically know do not warrant such a reaction. 

So it's no surprise that I'm struggling in life and I should probably give myself a break. But right now I can't afford health care and I get judged in social situations so that's not easy either.

272,"So my boyfriend (let’s call him Adam) has been best friend with (let’s call him Nick) for about 15 years. Nick has been dating this girl (let’s call her Carly) for about 4 years now. When I first met Carly she was super nice and we all hung out together and it was great. I got introduced to their group of friends and we was very welcoming at the beginning. Carly and I started to have issues with each other about a year ago now. She thinks she’s always right and if you disagree with her she starts arguments. We can be nice to each other but the amount of arguments that have happened have pretty much stopped us from being friends. All of us still hang out as a group but when Adam and I aren’t invited to things they will talk shit about me. My roommate and his girlfriend are in the friend group as well and finally told me what Carly and 2 other “friends” in the group have been saying about me because they hate what’s been going on. Carly and the 2 other “friends” will say that I’m faking having borderline personality disorder and make fun of how I’m 21 and don’t have a license (I have severe anxiety attacks when I’m in the drivers seat from past abuse) and they talk about how they don’t think Adam and I will last because we dated in high school and broke up to preserve our friendship and we got back together 2 years later and we’ve been together now for 2 years. I told Adam about what I found out and now he wants nothing to do with Carly and the other 2 friends but still wants to be close to Nick. Carly and Nick recently got engaged and Adam is going to be the best man so it’s causing us to be around them more and it’s just so hard knowing everything Carly and the other 2 “friends” are saying about me.

275,"I’m 18. This would be my first job. Because they are severely undermanned (i’d be the only other worker besides the manager, who is running the place by herself), i’d be responsible for working essentially every day, weekends and holidays included.

Monday-Thursday: 1100-2200

Sunday: 1000-2200

278,"My Aunt Abby has been fighting cancer for the past 2 years.  Since Abby has gotten sick, she sometimes responds a bit harsh/critically in conversations.  We all contribute that to her chemo/radiation treatments and the “cocktail” of medication which she was never able to perfect to help her comfort during the process.   Abby was was often in a bad mood because she always felt like shit. Majority of the family recognizes that and cuts her slack about it. 

Last Christmas, was spent at Aunt Barbara house. The night was mostly uneventful from what I experienced. Abby was a little harsh on a few minor discussions but every one in attendance we’re all giving their own different opinions so I thought nothing of the night. Topics were random and I cannot thing of any one thing that was a big deal. 

A few nights later during a phone call Aunt Barbara tells Abby that she is mad for the way Abby treated Suzy, the fiancee of Barbara’s grandson. Barbara said that financee left Xmas in tears bc of what Abby said. Abby has tried to find out what she said wrong but Barbara refuses to say what it was that upset the fiancee. It’s a “you should now what you did” type of situation. Abby has tried to bury the hatchet over several months but Barbara won’t let it go. The kicker is that its a known fact that Barbara doesn’t really like the fiancee so why this has caused a big issue is baffling.

Abby’s health has worsened and is now at home in hospice care. Extended family have been flying in knowing that Abby’s time with us won’t be much longer. Barbara is aware of Abby’s health decline and has not made any attempts to contact her or visit from what I understand.  

Barbara herself has battled cancer and lost her own husband with his own long cancer fight. I feel that Barbara more than anyone, knows how shitty you feel when you living with cancer treatments and that that a person should be cut a little slack when dealing with it. Barbara also knows how trying of a time it is going to be on Abby’s husband and adult daughter and should be there to offer support to them.  

The entire extended family are non-confrontational by nature and said it wasn’t anyone’s position to get involved when the riff started but its still a point of contention and hurt. I would never be actively disrespectful or cause drama but its ridiculous to me to continue to be polite and allow this to happen.

Would it be wrong for me to tell Barbara to cut the shit, get over herself and make it right before its too late?  Or should I directly ask the fiancee what it was that upset her so that we can just be done with it already?",24Aug2020,1

282,"So basically I got in an argument with my family about how a women dresses and it then turned into a whole thing about that dressing a certain way will get u certain attention which is dangerous.

He’ll do bad things to you no matter what your wearing Bc people who understand consent would know no matter how “hoey” your dressed. It doesn’t mean yes.

285,"Hi, Sorry if this gets long. Lately I've been having the weirdest dreams, maybe a couple months since it started. (For reference, just turned 16, I am a guy, No diagnosed conditions or any history of sleep paralysis or insomnia I'm actually a pretty heavy sleeper, and rarely struggle to sleep once I'm relaxed) The first time It happened It was terrible, and I think It may have been a form of sleep paralysis. to explain that first dream, The jist of it was I started walking toward the door In a bathroom like the one in a house I lived in when I was very little, Only reversed. I looked in the Mirror to see a blob, only for that to suddenly glitch into/ jumpcut to this creepy gory, smiley face. Simultaneously, the room turned a red hue. I turned around, portions of the room being old or fleshy, only to be charged by NMC2 (or Nightmare Creature 2, A Recurring creature I've seen In several dreams. I fly back, My spine hitting something hard, which I felt IRL. This is where I became aware I was dreaming to a degree. from there, I could no longer move within the dream, my vision locked upward, me laying on my back. from there My vision within the dream flickered for the rest of the night between NMC2 hanging over me twitching/ bouncing it's head back and forth, and a Degraded VHS video looking image with an Image of a face I couldn't quite make out in the center, a blue background with black stripes, and some phrases I've seen appear again and again in dreams following in white text, some of the main ones being ""forget?"" ""You owe the messenger"" and strikingly ""do you remember your name?"". I was terrified and tried my hardest to move in the dream but could not (still unsure if sleep paralysis  or if it was just within the dream, as my eyes were shut IRL, And I still saw the space I was in within the dream. I didn't feel anything touch me, just cold on my back, and a bit of a bump up below me at about mid back)

That first dream was the most vivid and crazy, but I've had others since. NMC2 was entirely new, but I had the return of a character I hadn't seen In a while (But had seen before the above dream) right after that vivid dream, Who I like to call NMC1. I've been seeing him occasionally since I was 12, once a year or less, but I had stopped seeing him after I turned 14, which I was happy about, hes a terrifying fucker. I'm always running or hiding from NMC1 in my dreams of him, and this was the first I'd had in a while. I wasn't aware I was dreaming, And only realized I was when I woke up. In this one I was hiding. Not very vivid or anything, a light coming from the hall through an open door, black except things close to me, a bed in the center, not much else was visible. It was striking to see him after so long though. Theres a reason why I refer to It as a he, I'll explain these creatures below at the end. 

Then there was the second appearance of NMC2. I am walking in the dark, slowly the moon becomes visible and lights my path, I walk toward this street lamp next to this old gate, only to jump seeing NMC2 under it. I assumed he was aggressive, after he charged at me in the first dream, but as I walked closer, he continued staring at me with his terrifying smirk. This was probably where I've got the best look at him so far (described below), text started to appear behind him, scrolling, saying some of the same things from before, as well as some new things: ""Don't forget what you saw"" ""This is your destiny"" and ""do you remember me"". I look up, The moon got a large red ""error!"" over it, I look back down, streetlamp flickers, and then The creature lurched forward toward me very quickly, and that shocked me awake. It seems NMC2 has a slit personality, one side aggressive toward me (charge in the first dream, jump in the second) and the other wanting me to remember... something. (VHS.thing in the first, text in the second) It's very confusing.

These are the most vivid recent ones, though I have several others with these creatures and with others. I want to understand, and I want to know what the hell is wrong with me. These things seem to have some meaning somewhere and I either want these terrifying shits to end or want to understand and come to terms with it if they wont. If you can offer any insight as to what this means, why it happens, or if something is wrong with me It's greatly appreciated. If you want to know about other characters and my dreams with them, Let me know, Im happy to elaborate on those if it helps.

DESCRIPTIONS OF MAIN CREATURES (let me know if you have seen similar in you dreams, or know what these creatures mean)

NMC1: I haven't gotten the best look at it yet, but, it's a lanky creature with short legs too thin to use, it has scythes for arms below the elbow. It has some kind of metal thing (guessing a radio or speaker) that sticks out where a persons voice-box would be. It uses It's arms to get around, and it moves quick, Its unused legs dragging on the ground. It laughs maniacally constantly (in what sounds like a male's voice), but it sounds a bit electronic/ speaker esque (hence my guess about the metal thing being one.)  Its head looks like it's trapped in a helmet of some sort, it shines, but haven't gotten a great look. Very aggressive, reacts to the slightest sound or movement violently and quickly.

&amp;#x200B;

NMC2: A Thin, tall creature, It has a really light brown or creme colored fur that sticks out in spikes and hide its other features around it's face, with matted black fur everywhere else. it has small, beady, pure white eyes that look like they are on top of the fur, and a sharp toothed, wide horizontal, narrow vertical, vicious smile with the same property. It has what appears to be a shackle on it's left (from my view, from it's view, right) leg, with a dangling link or two hanging off of it that make a scraping sound when it moves. It's behavior is unpredictable, it can be either aggressive or passive, and changes between the two quickly and unpredictably. It (or at least it's passive side) appears to be trying to communicate with me specifically, asking questions and making statements, none of which make sense to me as of current.",24Aug2020,1

290,"I was seeing a boy for around 3 months and call me silly but I really did have extremely strong feelings about him and he *said* he felt the same about me. Over around a week he became sort of uninterested and by the end of the week, completely uninterested and told me he didn’t want to continue further. 

He used to talk badly about girls he had been with previously to me and I said to him “you better not say anything bad about me now this is over” and he said “I couldn’t say anything, you’re perfect, I just don’t want a girlfriend right now”. 

We have a friend group and this is how we met so our paths have crossed more than once since he ended it, and he has been nothing but rude, and acted as if I was this crazy ex of his. And yes, I have drunk text and phoned him a few times and always regretted it but I’m definitely at a point now where I won’t be doing that again as I do feel like I am over him completely now. 

He avoids me like the plague, doesn’t speak to me, doesn’t attend gatherings that I go to but honestly, I do the same and I’m not sure if it’s my fault that it ended up that way because at one point, I blocked and deleted him on all social media..

For example, I was hired on as an intern, hired on full-time, then finally  offered a marketing manager position all within a year of working for the company. I left the manager position about 8 months later to pursue a career in the sports industry (being in the sports industry is where I wanted to be all along). I was 22 at that point and still had 6 months left in my master's program. I was accepted into a 8-month training program where I did sales and then went into digital media. I generated the highest revenue amongst my peers in both season ticket sales and group ticket sales. At the end of the program, the team had no open positions, so I unfortunately had to part ways. That was in September of 2019. 

Unfortunately, from September to now, I haven't even been able to land a job or even an interview. Obviously since the Pandemic, sports teams are really not hiring, so I have been applying for jobs in all industries. I've probably sent out 150-200 applications for positions across the US and I've hardly got a response from any. The ones I did get a response from send the generic ""sorry, we decided to pursue other candidates"" email, so it doesn't help me get an idea on why they said no. I've called and emailed asking for feedback, but I never get a response. 

I was able to get a minimum wage job just because I couldn't afford my insurance and prescription costs (I'm a type 1 diabetic, so my monthly costs are high to say the least and I am still losing money every month), but I have no future here, so I am still looking and applying.

I guess what my question is, for those of you that may have gotten a job during this pandemic, what have you done to make yourself stand out? Any tricks you can share with me so I can at least land an interview? I'm confident in my abilities and know that I can be successful wherever I end up, but it doesn't seem that that message gets across to hiring managers. I've sent out my resume to get critiqued several times and it hasn't helped. I edit my resume prior to applying for a position so I can add key words from the job description, still hasn't helped. 

Legitimately, any feedback or nuggets of wisdom will be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",24Aug2020,1

I never want to come out my room because it’s like a haven away from the clutter and dirt. I can’t even walk in my socks in the house because it’s so dirty.

She says she stopped using social media after a couple events in her life that made become homeless. So I was helping her out even tho she lives far away. This kept going on for about 2 years now she has an appartment now and a job but struggles to pay rent ( at best half). She usually pretty sick and the medication makes her extremely sleep and she says she’s sleeping most of the time. We occasionally FaceTime and send pic back and forth most morning.

295,"Alt account because my boyfriend follows my main, and I really don't want him knowing a lot of this stuff. He knows they're bad but not everything.  Maybe a tw? Slight mention of suicide and abuse? Idk, I might be making a big deal out of it.   


I(16f) guess I'll start off by saying that my family is definitely dysfunctional to some extent. They all scream constantly, me and my parents have all gone to the mental hospital at some point this year, 2/3 of us for suicidal reasons. My sister almost went for anger issues as she will constantly threaten to stab people, or tell them she wishes we were dead. To me personally she would say things like that she wished I would have killed myself, or that she wished I'd hang myself.  
My parents are constantly getting back at one another. They're still married but hate each other for so many different reasons and are planning to divorce. My dad was abusive to my mom and us, and she was abusive to us too. Then my dad had an affair and my mom stayed, then my mom had an affair and my dad stayed. She got weight loss surgery and became a whole different person. Now my moms spending thousands of dollars on psychics, getting them back deep into the debt they just got out of, and is never home with her kids. She's not even the same person.  
There have been many cases where she'd hit me for my sexual orientation or out of anger in general. I've bled and been bruised from them. When I got caught smoking pot I had bruises in the shape of x marks all the way down my legs. My sister also has been bruised to the point where she wasn't allowed to wear shorts, and my brother had bruises on his behind. My brothers is the worst part, as he's only 6, and it was because he had an accident. He apparently has health problems, but my parents wouldnt listen to him or my aunt for the longest time when they tried to tell them. It led to him getting s h i t put in his m o u t h, having his xbox thrown against the wall and smashed, getting bruises on his butt, and being emotionally abused on many occasions. My second youngest brother has autism, so he isn't effected the same as us thank god.  
My aunt wants to take the kids but my dad would come too and he threw my sister down the hall just today and she sprained her wrist. He's so angry all the time. They're all so angry all the time. My siblings are just as bad when it comes to anger, theyre just not as strong so their actions arent as bad. I try to be calm and sweet but,, it gets to me too,, and I've put holes in the walls from getting so mad and hit my sister too. and i feel so bad i dont want that to be my normal.   
But,, maybe its not that bad? It could be worse,, and,, all teenagers think their parents are abusive, right? I know they really love us- I just don't know what to do, though. I have mdd and have been suicidal on and off for so long. I'm losing all my friends cause my boyfriend says their all bad influences. I got bad addicted to drugs for a while, and theyre all on them.  I'm just so tired all the time.. and my family is the cause of it all i feel like. but at the same time, i think im over reacting? i want to move out as soon as possible but then what would happen to the kids?  


TL;DR - I feel like my family is the cause of my depression and don't think things can go on this way for any of our sakes, but am unsure if I'm just being an angsty teen, or even what I should do if I was right.",24Aug2020,1
296,"Nearly four years ago, me and my former best friend stopped talking after we got into an altercation where a lot of hurtful things were said. I don’t want to get too into the specifics, but what I will say is I can be forward about the situation in that I was an extremely toxic person back then and he finally had enough of it.

A little over a year after this altercation, specific circumstances led us to meeting each other again in a professional environment since we have the same career aspirations. At first it was awkward and we avoided interacting, but what surprised me was he took the initiative to talk to me individually so that we can break the ice. Not only that, but we also ended up talking and apologizing to one another for a lot of what went down.

Its been about three years now since that happened. Despite the point of talking again being to help make things not so awkward when we would be in that professional environment, we’ve hung out, texted one another casually, and helped each other out whenever we could for one another.

All of this typed out would make someone think “lol sounds like you guys are on good terms again.” And we of course are. But whats been stupidly bothering me is I really do see him as my closest friend again. Even though the whole reason we broke our friendship years ago was b/c of my toxicity leading him to me not being his best friend, Im seeing him in that light again. 

Thats where the question of “what should I do?” comes in. Am I overthinking all of this shit? Should I even be allowed to say he’s my closest friend? I’ve been wanting to talk about all of this and addressing it again with him, but I don’t know if I should or if it’ll rupture what we’ve rebuilt as friends again. He’s very reserved, but when we did have heart to hearts, he said he considered me as a brother in the past. But of course things are different now, and I would never expect anyone to forgive me for the things I would say or did back then. So of course, reiterating once more: What should I do?",24Aug2020,1

Even though my sibling (let's call them K) does some unnecessary things,  I know they have a good heart. my mom, however, I am also on bad terms with. During fights, she will tell and threaten to beat up K or kill herself. Occasionally, she'll hit K. I can't imagine what this has done to K's mental state. They used to cut. So did I, but I got yelled at a lot less. Today my mom told them to get out of the house. Usualky, she'll tell us to go live with our dad or relatives. So K left. K has run away before, but it was always when the Sun was out or on their own accords. I'm really worried about them. I want them to live past 18. I wanted to do something about K leaving. I wanted to scream with all my heart ""Don't Go!"" Hate to admit it, but I'm a coward. We're not the closest, but I care deeply for K. Any advice helps.

This time I ended up calling the police 3 times along with other people apparently. He would wait for the cops to drive away a bit before coming outside and continuing his threats, which is why I called the cops more than once. He would also yell threats towards the police once they were in a neighboring parking lot. I’m small and live by myself so I really am afraid of him acting out violently towards me if he finds out I reported him. Thankfully he saw another person call the police on him, plus I’m pretty sure he is drunk and may not remember.

304,"So the title basically sums it up but for some more details, My partner and I have become the caregivers for my partners 14 year old sister, she was in an abusive household where she could do anything she wanted which included some men over 18 being in the house drinking with her and her other underage friends. Her upbringing has also been filled with seeing lots of violence and sexually activitys (feel like I should say this because it falls into why I am concerned) She has been some what sexually active from a very young age. Now my problem is she is in a relationship with someone in the US, we are in NZ. 

She is very secretive and tells quite a lot of lies about him and they video chat. She met him on discord and the servers that she is in are questionable and not something a child should be in. I can not find him on any of her social medias and when we ask about him she very vague about it. My concern is that he is not who she has said he is because if it was as innocent as it should be I dont understand why she would be so secretive about it, we are very open with each other. I know i could be jumping to conclusions but I am really concerned. I dont want to be the overprotective person and controlling over her but she is very vunrable for something like this to happen to her.

So what I am asking is, Where do I go from here ? And what could I possibly do about this or try get any more information to be sure she is not being groomed by some sicko. If anyone needs more information so they can give me the right advice please ask, I am new at this and am still trying to wrap my head around how to deal with things like this.",24Aug2020,1

No one like a strict person and your one of them

ME: Im not

HIM: Just stop being so strict and let people say what the want and ask for help when they want

You really are

ME: its in the rules and basically every server has it

Does that sound laid back to u

ME: i dont mind if he says it in a promotion channel

313,"I am a 22y/o F who has always been self-conscious about the girlies. For years I had hoped I would grow, but unfortunately I haven't changed at all since my 15th birthday. They're naturally very wideset and in some outfits, appear completely non-existent. 

I understand a set of boobs are not the be all and end all, and I definitely have a lot of self-worth with or without them. 
However, the last few years I've been finding it harder and harder to feel 'sexy' and feminine due to my clean canvas.... 

Now my question, would it be self-absorbed of me to spend 13k (AUS) on a set of boobs? 
The majority of me wants it very badly, however, I'm worried about the backlash or guilt I may receive from friends or family for wanting it in the first place, and spending so much money on it. 

What are your thoughts? Is it self-absorbed? Is life too short to worry about how I look naked? Is life too short to be in a body I'm not happy with?

My whole life, whenever my mum goes to the supermarket, Ive had to come with her and follow her around. Recently, she'll make me come with her, and get me to sit in the car the whole time (she sees this as an extremely generous thing to do). I already help around the house, but anytime I ask to stay home, she starts lecturing me about how we all have to help in a household (I agree with this completely, but even when I offer to do more chores instead of coming with her, she says no).

Sure, if I was an adult, it would be fair for me to come and help with this stuff, but right now, I just feel really sad following my mum around everywhere.

now, because of lockdown, I can't actually come out, so she makes me wait in the car (often for like an hour) then we go back home. I asked her about this and she said it was to get me out of the house, bit when I offer to go for a run or bike ride instead, she says no, because it's 'not the same'.

I know that when lockdown is over it'll be back to the way it was before where I just follow her around all the times (this isn't about not wanting to be seen in public with her or anything, I just object to the fact that anytime she leaves the house, it's almost a given that I will come with her).

When she occasionally leaves me home alone, she turns off the internet. even though she already has software on all my devices.

The answer is simple, right? Just eat less or eat healthier food. But that’s not the problem.
I can eat a 350 calorie brunch type thing at 10–11 am and eat a 750 calorie dinner until 5–6 pm. That’s 1,100 calories. I should, at this point, have a snack to get to my goal of 1500. So I do. I make a sandwich and some fruit. Probably 300–350 calories. Close enough.
At this point I should tap out. Be done for the day. But I’m not. I don’t.

I then, before I go to bed, often have binges of over 1000 calories. I do this in secret. And I hate myself after every single. time.

I make a new weight loss day one entry. There’s probably 300 of them at this point. I swear that that will be the last time I do it. Tomorrow is a new day, and I will succeed.

So it has come to attention that one of my friends may be sleeping with a girl who I was involved with for a few months. 

Me and her were never dating and it was basically a relationship in all but name, as I did not call her my girlfriend and vice versa (her boyfriend) but it was a college fling you know because we still would hook up and hangout. Shortly after the school year ended and she moved back to her hometown I basically just told her “yeah I don’t want to pursue a relationship with you, the distance doesn’t make sense and also I don’t feel that attraction to you” and that was it we were done and some feelings were hurt but I was honest with her and didn’t waste her time.

After this occurs, my friend we’ll call him Jay, suddenly is having a lot of interaction with her on socials (I.E. commenting on each other’s posts on IG and spending a lot of time together on my discord). At this point Jay is aware of who she is/was to me and I more or less have to tell him “hey knock it off that’s not cool”, to which he understands and acts bummed out about and to my knowledge stops talking to her.

Fast forward to now as the school year starts back up and she moves back on campus. I start to notice the same slight interactions between them and think to myself “no he wouldn’t do that”. But low and behold he messaged me “I need to talk to you tomorrow” and my worst fears may have been proven correct.

At the moment ive written a letter to him explaining my disgust with him and further expletives but is there really anything else to do about it other than that if it’s true? Just looking for suggestions to see what other people think about all this. 

Anything really helps thanks!

Ps - this has already happened with another one of our mutual friends where he is now dating my ex girlfriend. So Jay is aware of how hurt this would make me feel seeing as how it has already happened once. :)",24Aug2020,1

325,"I’m seeking some unbiased advice regarding my relationship. 
I have been with my boyfriend for a little over 10 years.
I am 31 (f), he is 33 (m).
We were raised in very different homes, with very different circumstances and upbringings.
He was raised by two doctors, who had a nanny for their sons. My boyfriend was/is a very sensitive soul, who really needed a lot of emotional support from his parents growing up, which he really did not receive because of their busy schedules. They were good parents and provided anything that they needed, but they just didn’t provide for him what he needed because he was so different from them. He was also never forced to “fly the nest” (he moved out but was still provided with some monetary support) until he was in his very late 20s. 
I grew up in a poor home, but I was provided with a lot of emotional support. I definitely struggled with some things and I had to grow up early after my parents divorced when I was 7. I have been financially independent since I was 18.
The first 4 years or so of our relationship were good, but were mostly spent “growing up”, and experiencing quite a few growing pains. He eventually broke up with me (two different times) and left (we lived together the last time). He would come back each time begging to be together again and making promises to change. Both times I had began dating other people and he noticed.
We got back together the last time in 2015, and we have been together (And living together) since. Since then, the relationship has been generally much better with a general understanding that neither one of us would leave.
I believe our main issue is a struggle between him being an incredibly emotional person with very few communication skills because of the way he was raised, versus my impatience with a lack of communication skills and having a hard time being vulnerable because of the pain he has caused me before, as well as scars left over from my parents divorce.
Both things we have been working on.
The biggest issue though for me, is that in the 10 years we’ve been together, we have talked about marriage since the very beginning. Both of us say that we want marriage, he knows I don’t want to have children until we’re married, and we’re asked constantly when we’re getting married, because there’s really no obvious reason why we aren’t.
He tells me that he wants to marry me he knows I want to marry him. 
But he just...never proposes. 
We have talked about it probably dozens of times he’ll tell me “it’s coming”. But then the time never comes.. so I ask him about it again and he tells me his “plan got ruined” or we were fighting or he “can’t find a good enough time/place/idea/situation, etc.
This has been going on for almost 5 years.
It has become a major point of contention. He gets incredibly awkward/nervous when talking about it and it almost always becomes a fight.
His family lives in a different state and almost always, within the first half hour of being there, his mom asks us about wedding plans or marriage plans or etc.
Most recently, We have had a plan to visit his family. I asked him jokingly “what are we going to say to your mom when she asks us about wedding plans?” He said, “ well that won’t be a conversation we will have to have- But that’s all I’m saying.” Clearly hinting that he was going to propose before going. This was about two months ago.
Last week, i found out that I’m not able to go, due to my job during Covid. He asked if I was fine with him still going and I said “yes of course”. I asked him how many weekends were between now and when he goes to visit, somewhat trying to bring to his attention how few there are, without directly asking him if he was going to propose. Nothing. 
Tonight, I accused him of doing the same thing that he has done to me over and over- promising that he’ll be proposing and then it not happening. He said “yes that happened again and he failed me.” I stated “but that’s a choice” and he just kept repeating that he failed me. When I pushed for why and he said “time just got away from him”.
I lost my cool, and at this point I feel so angry and just “done”. I don’t feel like I should have to beg for a proposal.
The issue with that, though, is that otherwise, he truly is the kindest, sweetest, most patient partner. I want to be with him, so badly enough that I want to marry him. But I don’t understand what the problem is?
I’ve tried talking about it 1000 times with him and it just never seems to do anything. He’ll make promises and then he just breaks them.

I'm struggling with finding a career path for myself, specifically one that would be easier for me to get a foot into without a degree. I'm interested moreso in the trades and some construction opportunities, though I don't really know where to begin. I'm going to be in florida for a few more years (could stay longer if I had to) and was looking at some apprenticeships and on-the-job training opportunities, though I don't want to pick a certain path without knowing much about the others. I have a couple major questions:

\-Do apprenticeships generally give 40+ hours? This would be ideal for me.

\-Are there any career paths that involve on the job training and certifications throughout a reasonable time? (1-2 years)

\-What are some interesting opportunities through apprentice/on-the-job training style systems?

329,"May possibly be a silly post, but I need to vent and advice. 

I 23F, had some particularly bad things happen to me up until I was about 19. As a result I have ""drifted"" for a few years now. Failed a-levels twice (like pre- university) - didn't go to university in the end. I wanted to but with everything that was going on and happening I just couldn't cope. Now I am thinking of going back. I feel like I am so far behind though. My friends are engaged, talking about children, have kids or have careers/stability. I feel like the odd one out and if I do go back to university, I feel like I will miss out on dating, starting a family or getting married. (I plan to go back for a long time if I do as I would like to persue a doctorate) 

I mean I know people will go for the ""you're young, you have plenty of time to do things and figure it out""- However, I am also mortal. I am not guaranteed time on this earth. So time is important and it is slipping away. 

I also feel like because of all of my past history/trauma which includes childhood sexual abuse, and basically getting betrayed by everyone I trusted, I have too many issues. I have been in/gone to therapy for years and I still have some major trust and intimacy issues. My last therapist was like ""those may never go away"" (greaaatt) and I read on here all the time how people should prepare themselves for a relationship and not be ""toxic"" by being jealous or depending too much on someone ect. And I honestly do try not to  be jealous (for example) but as someone who was betrayed so badly I am always waiting for the next shoe to drop and reality to sink in. It feels like I never have anything good for any length of time. I'm used to the betrayal. I'm scared it would take me till I'm 65- way past the age where I could meet anyone or have kids myself- to be ""non-toxic"" and ""normal"". I feel like I live with this curse of how other people made me everyday, and it never goes away.",24Aug2020,1

331,"Some background: I (20F) am pursuing a bachelor's of music education with a focus in piano. As such I'm attending a university full time (5 classes this semester). I teach piano to ~20 students a week. I recently started a small housekeeping company that is growing steadily (right now it is myself and one other employee). I am in a commited relationship and make an effort to spend time with my partner. 

I want to get my degree, become an excellent, experienced piano teacher, and grow my company to a profitable venture with enough employees that I can go hands off. I also want to be an excellent partner (at the very least not neglectful). But there is so much on my plate that my existence is ridiculously stressful. I am constantly neglecting at least one of these things, and sometime two. 

So I wanted other opinions: how many things do you think a person can reasonably do at once? I have my education, my relationship, my hobby/passion (that is what the teaching essentially is), and my work (the housekeeping company). Is it unrealistic to expect to do all these at once and succeed? Each of them take a minimum of 20 hours of my time a week. Am I destined to crash and burn if I try to juggle so many things? Or is it realistic to expect to hold everything together and do fine until I graduate, after which I will have a lot more time for teaching and work and my partner? Right now if I had to drop one (not the relationship) I really couldn't decide. I desperately want to keep all of them.

332,"So a few months ago my moms friend had a bunch of kittens she was giving away and my mom fell in love with one of them. She told my sister and I she wanted to get her and asked if we were ok with it. Now this woman has always told me how much she hates cats because she thinks they smell and had never allowed us to get one growing up. I told her I didn't mind if she got the cat, but she needs to realize how much work it is. I told her if she gets it she can't just get rid of it a week later when shes tired of cleaning the litter box and she'll have to make sure she takes her to get all of her shots. I basically gave her the talk you give to a child before letting then get their first pet. She said she was fine with all of it.

So the next day I go to pick up the kitten for her because she had to work. She gave me some money to get supplies. I set everything up at the house and all was well. Fast forward to week 2 of us having the cat and my mom basically has no interest in her anymore. I asked her if she had made an appointment with the vet because she needed to get her shots soon. She said no, so I called and set up the appointment. The day before the appointment I remind her about it and she says she doesn't have the money to take her. So I told her I would take her and she could pay me back when she got her next paycheck. Well she ended up losing her job that week and was unemployed for the next 3 weeks before she got another job.

I took the cat to her next vet appointment and gave my mom the receipt. I even sent in the money to the county for the rabies tag and gave her the receipt for it as well. I've spent $130 total. At this point I have become very attached to this cat and its very clear that I am her favorite in the house. My mom and sister barely pay her any attention. Mom doesn't even clean the litter box anymore, so I took over that duty as well. They even started referring to the cat as mine saying things like ""come get your cat"" or ""your cats being weird"".

I made a comment about possibly moving out soon and my mom asked me if I would take the cat with me since its clear the cat doesn't like her. I said fine I'll take her since she's pretty much become mine anyways. Now here's where the problem is. She still hadn't paid me back for all of the vet appointments.

She and my sister think its not fair for her to have to pay me back if Im going to take the cat when I move because its not really my moms cat anymore. I think it is completely fair for her to pay me back for the vet bills because I never intended to take on another animal to begin with. I already have a dog which is expensive enough. I told them I am going to be paying for everything cat related from now on, but those bills where made when the cat was still my moms therefore she should pay me back.

Am I being unreasonable for still expecting her to give me that money back?",24Aug2020,1

when i started walking back to my car a few minutes later i noticed that they had pulled their car up directly next to mine. i called my friend and told her what was happening/where i was, and stayed on the phone with her when i was walking back. they didn't say anything this time, but they were just watching me. i got into the car, still on the phone, locked it and drove off immediately. then, they pulled out and started following me. they did that for about a mile, blasting their music and yelling. it was disgusting and i was and still am so shaken up and i feel so objectified and low.

I was so excited for this job, I loved my coworkers (still do) I loved the company (still do) and I loved the job on paper.  


I don't know if it's because I've been working from home since such an early stage but I don't feel useful. I feel like I can barely do anything all day, half the time I fill my hours with nonsense or busy work. I don't get fulfillment out of it. I have indicated my desire for more work, more learning, more guidance and while they've tried I still feel like a sub-zero-par employee.  


It is making me feel depressed, lonely, useless. I've been considering finding a different job where I have less to learn or when I can learn in a more practical setting (currently have a desk job, wouldn't mind blue collar work).  


But is it wise to give up after 7 months of exceptional circumstances? Should I just wait out the learning period and working from home? I feel that if I were more trained and busy for most of my days I'd be much happier.

335,"(throwaway account)

Hi guys, I am a 15 yr old kid who is in year 10 and for most of my life I have always been 'smart'. My parents wouldn't hold back when saying that I am a 'bright kid' 'smart for my age' or a ""bookwork"". I have always been around the top of my class in primary school and the beginning of high school. The past three years I was in a school 'program' where my homeroom comprised of kids who need help or need to be pushed. The program ended last year and I am still friends with all the kids in my homeroom. This year has been tough for me and I have always had an underlying feeling that others were better than be, (which of course they are) but now that I am no longer apart of the special program I understand that there are so many students that are just smarter than me. I notice that some people are just more articulate than me or just understand things quicker than me. Some people are able to complete homework straight after school for hours, whilst I can only do it after hours of downtime for only a fraction of the time. 

But I have always dismissed it and always denied the fact that I am slowly becoming stupider. But recently I got a rude awakening, a friend asked the class chat whether we want to call while we listen to an online interview with the careers counsellor. I had absolutely no idea what the call was about and I asked about the call. My friends all asked whether I received an e-mail about the online meeting. I told them no. My stomach dropped when I saw that all my friends were asked to join a meeting about a university scholarship program that was only joinable by invitation. A meeting only joinable by the smartest students in the year level. My friend told me that is was nothing and it was just a random interview that didn't matter much to them. But it did to me. The past few hours my head has been rushing with worst-case-scenarios. I have finally realised that I do not put effort into my schooling like I did before. I have the feeling that if I continue down this path, I will do shit in year 11 and 12 and I won't get the ATAR (Australian Tertiary Admission Rank) I want.

I just can't have my parents thinking I am ""all good"" when deep down inside I'm not. It kills me every time they laugh off how intelligent I am or how smart I have become. Because I'm not.

How can I change my study habits? How can I become smarter like my friends?",24Aug2020,1

And as I got back my stepdad was washing his hands and I had already finished washing my hands I told my mom I would take the laundry out and as I was doing that my stepdad was getting my two little siblings some milk to go to bed he asked me if I was done with my juice it was more than half full. I said no I would drink it later. He has to go and start a fight and say why you know your not gonna drink it just dump it. I say nothing because no matter what I say it’ll always start a fight I got back to folding laundry. He says something I forget because I trained my brain to do that that’s how many fights we get in.

354,"In school, I fell deeply in love with a new girl who joined our class. I had a big crush on her for all primary and high school, we were really close and always talked in class etc. Until, one day her best friend asked me ""What would you do if you knew she (my ex) likes you"", so I talked with my ex and she told me her feelings for me, we started dating and I honestly felt so happy, I don't think I have felt any happier ever since that time. She would always tell me she loved me, that we were gonna get married and make a lofe together. 

Each time we had a discussion she would say how much she loved me to end it. Sometimes I would get annoyied by her in school and ignore her. For her birthday I burned a cd with her favorite songs, when she openned it in class everyone laughed at her and she didn't even say thank you for it or even talked about it. Her best friend gave her a fancy baloon that she took around school for the day and everyone thought I gave it to her. 

However, I was a childish inmature 15 year old who would always find a way to fuck things up with her until eventually she couldn't take it any more and broke up with me. I was sad, cried and had never felt like that before, my apetite decaied, I lost weight and overall feelt awful. 

To make things even worse, my grandfather was feeling very bad and my family had to be away most of the day to take care of him. 

I was still talking with her at the time, like before we dated, but I still loved her but I knew there was no way we could be a thing again and it hurt like shit. 

One day I was just done for, I couldn't take going back to being friends like it never happened. So the only way I thought I could get my life back was getting her out of my head ASAP. The next day, I started ignoring her 24/7, I would literally pretend she didn't exist, ignore her talking to me in person, block her on socials and even pretend I didn't know who she was with my friends. That apparently broke her, she would cry in class and get very upset. 

She also made me a letter saying that she was sad and sorry we didn't work out as everyone said we would. That it wasn't my fault or something I did that ended it, and that she knows I will eventually find someone who loves me. I don't fully remember it as I lost the letter, it was in a folder I sent to my teacher the last day of class, it was too late when I remembered were I left it. 

Years went by, I got into uni and never saw her again. 4 years later I'm one semester away from graduating, I will be the youngest of my class to get my degree and the first to graduate from my friends back in school. I got into the best internship out there for my major, and most of my friends always remember me how great and smart I am. 

Regardless of all this success, I just cant't get her off my head, I see her IG every now and then, stare at her pics and start remembering  my time with her and how a stupid arrogant asshole I was, I didn't know how to appreciate what I had. 

Thanks for reaching this point and finishing reading the post. Guys, what should I do? What do I do to forget about her an move on with life, I always told my self that time will eventually make me forget her and keep on with my life. I'm still into her. Sometimes I think this will all go away the day I male a clousure with her, end things the way it have ended. But she has a BF and has clearly moved on, she probaly thinks I'm an asshole and the worst thing that happened to her.

358,"Forgive me for the length of this..It'll be long, but I extremely appreciate anyone who took the time to read it.

Hey everyone....

I was looking for advice and what you guys think. I'm in a predicament and I'm at a total loss on what to do. I understand how weird it may sound and even dumb at the same time. So please don't judge me too hard.

I'll try to keep it short. I'm a 27 year old guy and have been dealing with medical issues the past 10 or so years, so I really haven't lived a normal life. I don't have many friends and I've never been in a relationship. Never been on a date. Never even kissed. I'm not going to lie, I am very sheltered. Though at the same time, I'm so close to my family because they've stuck with me through everything and helped get me through all my struggles right by my side. So of course I absolutely love them so much, but it makes it hard to do anything.

Just to give a few examples for those still reading (thank you by the way).

I play a lot of online games, so there were these 2 girls that I played online with and talked to for months. Nothing romantic, just a friendship. Turned out that they both are fairly local to me and they wanted for us all to meet up. I already knew where this was going. I can't just up and leave the house without saying anything to the family, so I had to tell them about it. My mom is the worst when it comes to this sort of stuff. Instantly when I was telling them about it, a million questions come. ""Who are they?"". ""What do they look like?"", ""Let me see a picture of them"", ""Let me see their Facebook, Instagram, etc.."", ""Do they have boyfriends?"", ""Where are you going?"", ""What are you going to do?""...the list goes on, but hopefully that gives you an idea. This was probably about 5-6 months ago.

I'll try to keep this part as short as possible.

I've been talking to this girl that I met in April. We met through other friends. Up until about late June, my parents knew something was up because of they way I talked online and because I was writing someone a lot on the phone, when not on my computer. So I had to tell them. My Mom...the ""detective"" instantly tried to find everything out about her. She found that she has a kid. Found her Facebook, which has a bunch of memes and some ""raunchy"" stuff. So they instantly judged her on that and instantly hated her. Over the next few days, I had huge and nonstop talks about what a terrible decision this was and how it's ever going to happen. I legitimately like this girl even though, for now, it's just an online-long distance. They MADE me cut contact with her. They made sure I was not friends on Facebook with her, Instagram, Snapchat, basically everything.

A couple days went by...I was depressed. I couldn't help it and we both started talking again. And to this day, I am still secretly talking with her and trying to be so careful. It stresses me out because I can't be open with her. Cant say how I feel out-loud. And I feel guilty lying to my parents constantly. I don't know what to do..I feel trapped. Useless..

I know..it's stupid and I feel like it because of my situation. But at the same time of course I love my parents. I just don't know what to do. Yes..I still live at home. I don't have a job because I'm still battling with my medical issues, though they are much better. It's not like I want to ""run away"" with this person..but just have a normal?...relationship? If I even know what that is like...

If anybody can provide some advice, I would really appreciate it. Thank you so much. I'd be happy to answer any other questions or give more info...but thank you, seriously.

TLDR; I feel like I can't do anything because of my overprotective parents. I've never had a relationship and don't know how to bring up that I've even been talking to someone and am forming a relationship with.",24Aug2020,1

360,"When I entered university I never had the impression my STEM subject would be the only thing I'd do in life - my plan was to study a respectable subject that I found interesting enough to keep me engaged while focusing all of my energy (either at university or later on in life, when I have a job related to my field of study) on creative stuff.

The reality of the situation was that I got so hung up in my unsuccessful attempts to establish a social life, suicidal thoughts over childhood stuff that I hadn't really had time to address before moving away for university, and the nagging thought that I had chosen to conform by going to university left me too tired and weary that I not only gave up my creative outlets but struggled with coursework as well. I entered university with the idea that, having decided on a subject, the rest would be taken care of by the university, but unfortunately the (retrospectively, a not THAT big amount of) individual studying and homework assignments proved too much for me.

Now, two years later, I need to repeat a year because of how bad I did this year. Naturally, I feel very disappointed in myself. Originally, I was going to take a year off before returning for my third year; I spent a lot of time thinking during the pandemic and felt that, perhaps if I took a year off to just grow socially and get my mental health in check (and of course work, to support myself) I'd be well enough to go back to university and finish my Bachelor's degree. I was going to do some traveling as well for a change of pace but, of course, the need to stay on for my repeat year prevents any such plans.

The idea of simply dropping out and (during my first year) applying for another, less practical degree programme or (during my second year) escaping the education system altogether has been looming at the back of my head all this time, and my year off would probably have been a way to ease into that idea. However as of recently I've been trying to be more responsible and I feel like withdrawing from my studies (which other than repeating some of my courses from last year - not all of them - is my only other option) is losing my entire safety net and akin to dropping a drop of oil into the ocean and hoping it stays intact. I don't exactly have a clear view of what you're supposed to do if you're not within the confines of high school &gt; uni &gt; grad school &gt; job. For the first three (where you experience peak personal growth) five (age wise) or (stretching the age limits) even 10 years I suppose I could take it - not slow but - without any need to settle down, but at the same time I don't want to end up being a 35 year old working an entry level job (though perhaps by the time I'm that age I won't care enough about other people's opinions about my vocation).

Sure, I have (creative) aspirations, and I think I'm intelligent and motivated enough to work towards them, but if I drop out of university and dedicate myself to attaining some other goal I have to ask myself: what's the number of people who actually make it? At the same time, it's becoming increasingly obvious that I'm simply incapable of doing uni/STEM and the other stuff at the same time. And even if I pull myself by the bootstraps for these few years and graduate with my Bachelor's, I'm still going to have to go to grad school before I can even get a job, which right now seems too much of a time investment for what's only of secondary importance and will remain that way even when it pays my bills.

363,"I became friends with a guy through tiktok. He then became my crush. Him and his siblings do live broadcast every night that I watch. They talk about relationships and things they would in a significant other. I am really happy I've gotten to know him and that he has gotten to know me. You know how you can give concerts or legendaries on Tik Tok when you agree with what someone says. Well I was doing that and they will mention your name. He would mention my name normally when it appeared on his screen before. Then, I noticed something seemed different recently. Well at the beginning and the end of the broadcasts its just him. He will play music during this time and tells you to hit him up with a concert or legendary so he can add you as friend, look at your bio on TikTok and even give his unfiltered opinion on profile. So I do and he would do that normally when it appears on his screen like I mentioned before. But now it seems like he waits to say my name.  I can tell that he waits to say my name. I can definitely tell he seen my name appear on his screen. He still says it but why is he waiting for the last second to say it? I am wondering if others on the live broadcast have noticed too. I haven't asked them that yet. It has become obvious to me. His he doing it on purpose so I notice? If he is why is he doing it? Could he possibly like me too?

364,"My sister sits in her room all day playing video games on her laptop and watching TikTok which is perfectly fine but it’s gotten worse. She spends the whole day in her bedroom and never eats breakfast or dinner unless it’s something to her liking like popcorn or ice cream and fizzy drinks. She has mess all over her room and whenever she is forced to clean up she shoves everything under the bed like it’s really bad there is plates and candy wrappers everywhere and dirty clothes she’s been like this for ages and I don’t know if it’s a mental problem or because neither me or my brother had rooms this bad and I’ve NEVER seen any room messier than this other than on those TLC shows. She has no motivation to join any clubs, societies or even do sport and is super unfit. She refuses to do chores or even go for walks. The healthiest meal I saw her eat today was two single fried eggs which I guess are health but other than that it’s been snacking on popcorn and ice cream and she has had her first shower for more than a week today. I don’t know if the eating problem is something to do with body dysmorphia and if she is depressed or not? I genuinely want to help her eat better have a clean room and get some motivation but she won’t do anything, I would bring her to the gym but she would just leave and even then she probably wouldn’t have enough water or food for healthy muscle growth etc. for it to even make a difference.

368,"Basically, I have severe anxiety. My friend/roommate knows about it, but she’s always acted like she doesn’t really believe me. She calls me selfish a lot because I don’t like to go out very much. 

I was very overwhelmed yesterday for a few reasons. My friend invited a ton of people over without asking me, and only told me after they had said yes. I said it was okay because I didn’t want to be the one to ruin the gathering. I had been saying I was uncomfortable with it for awhile so I think that’s why she invited them over without asking me. 

I stayed with them for a bit and when they were deciding on what to do next, I said I had a call and I went to my room. I stayed in there until they all left.

Later, I mentioned how I screwed up a recipe and my friend said I was stupid. She has a history of telling me I’m incompetent and stupid. I was really upset. After a long long silence, she told me she felt like she couldn’t talk to me and how bad it was that I just ducked out of the gathering like I did. I said I had a call. She said I should have told her I wasn’t coming back. I didn’t think it was super important so I didn’t even mention it. I just shut down and stopped talking because I was still upset at her for calling me stupid. I stayed in the room with her even though I wanted to go to my room. She ignored me and made a big show out of it so I went to my room. I called another friend who told me that I need to apologize for shutting down and come clean about my eating disorder and anxiety, which have been causing a few fights because she keeps track of what I eat to prove that I eat too much and I’m unhealthy 

I don’t understand why I need to apologize first when she’s the one that forced me into a situation she knew I was uncomfortable with in the first place. I don’t think it was that big of a deal if I went to my room. 

I feel extremely uncomfortable explaining my conditions to her as well, because she always mocks me or accuses me of lying or tells me it’s a character flaw, not a mental disorder. She also has a hard time keeping secrets and she’s used my disorders against me in the past.

374,"Hey, everyone. I feel guilty even writing this, as I am a 19-year-old unemployed college student living at home. No skills and no specific passions. I also recently got diagnosed with ADHD and while it doesn't severely impact my life, it definitely affects it to some degree. Overall, however, I am privileged to not be negatively impacted by the pandemic since school is affordable and I don't pay the bills. My parents are healthcare workers. I'm literally a brat. 

Anyway... I just finished a phone call with a colleague with this college organization I've been a part of since freshman year. I was very snappy because I felt like I was not included in anything nor did I feel like I belonged in that community. Nobody is mean to me, nobody sabotages me, I just don't feel like I belong, therefore I don't feel like I have a purpose. I'll admit, I do not feel passion for this club. It's easy to be in, it's great resume experience, and it's amazing for networking and meeting many professionals in the community. But, I just don't feel like it's for me. I simply hate everyone. Not even for particular reasons. 

This situation has happened before back in high school when I quit soccer. I hated the people so much and I didn't feel like I belonged. Everyone was distant towards me because they thought I was a bitch. Same with the school organization, currently. I give off the overly confident bitch vibes even though I try my hardest to be nice and sociable towards everyone. Nothing works. I talk, I'm too much. I stay quiet, I'm rude. I can never win. 

TL;DR

Should I quit this beneficial organization to keep myself isolated so I don't hurt others with my mental instability or do I see this as a challenge to mature and get used to this environment since I might be in one like this in the workforce?

Two or three months ago I started dating the 16 year old guy I was talking to. We got along, understood each other and had a good relationship going. But there was one problem. The second person I met around the same time as him was a girl I developed feelings for a month ago. And she's 13. Now when you think of a 17 year old liking a 13 year old, I'm sure your first thought would probably be that that's weird. And definitely illegal where I live. But I wanted to be an open and honest person, so I confessed to her to get it off my chest saying how guilty I felt and told my boyfriend about what happened afterwards. She said she liked me too, but knew it was very wrong. Both of them agree it's wrong, and I know it is. It's hard to read tone through messages, but I thought my boyfriend sounded upset, or at least disappointed. And now the girl thinks all of this is her fault. Unable to withstand the guilt, I left all chats associated with them and blocked them the other day, hoping the guy will find someone more certain of their feelings and overall just a better person. I jeopardized my only friendship with people by opening my stupid mouth, and now I don't know if I did the right thing. All I do know is I regret confessing in the first place, and if I could have a do-over I would have kept quiet.

392,"
A few friends have taken a break from me due to my toxic behavior and I’ve made a LOT of people feel horrible. I haven’t noticed any of this or I pushed it to the side. I’m working on things in therapy starting next week but I genuinely don’t know what to do. I don’t want to hurt people anymore, I don’t wanna make anymore people suffer. I want to be a good friend and just all around a good person. I don’t know what to do. 

For some reference, this is the few things I’ve done
- Hinted at having a crush on my best friends boyfriend and made her feel horrible. I wasn’t a friend to her and she was there for me. (worst thing I’ve done by far and I hate myself for this)
- Ignored people for days instead of talking about my feelings
- cancel plans a LOT 
- Sugarcoat EVERYTHING and I’m never honest
- I lie a lot, i don’t know how to stop really
- impulsive decisions based on confusing feelings. If I think I’m in love with you, I’ll ask you out then regret it the next day and break up with you. 
- Making others feel bad for sharing how they feel because they think I’m gonna get upset or I did get upset. (I didn’t even realize I did this until someone said something a couple days ago) 
There’s probably more but I can’t think of the others. I know what I’ve done is horrible, I don’t need to be ridiculed for it, I just need help. I don’t know where to start or if there’s any alternatives to what I can do. Please please help me. I don’t want to live like this anymore",24Aug2020,1

I dated a guy for a few months and it was the best relationship of my life but we started arguing in the last month and it ended in a heated messy break up, so basically my now Ex, Cole, is posting a bunch of pictures with this random girl doing all the crap we used to do together when we broke up like 3 weeks ago, he also posted a cover of our favourite song “Let you Go” by Machine gun Kelly (great song btw if you haven’t heard it you should check it out, I think it’s on SoundCloud and also Spotify but idk man) , which was our song that we listened to together constantly, we have so many memories together related to that song to the point where when I listen to it I get emotional and remember every little thing involuntarily, like I can’t not think of him when I hear it, and he posted a cover of it with who ever the hell this new girl is like it was nothing, and then he fucking At’ed me! I’m not sure if it’s normal to be upset about something like this but yeah I am, and then 

And then all of a sudden this girl isn’t in the posts anymore there’s no mention of her and all they’re photos are deleted and he took the video down (I’m pretty sure one of my friends told him I was bummed about it idk) plus we still have a bunch of mutual friends so now I’m going to have to deal with seeing the former love of my life 24/7 😞


This is overall a crappy situation and early today he texted me to ask if we could meet up tomorrow and talk and I said yes, and now I’m just nervous and yeah.

This was my first relationship and my first breakup so I don’t really have any coping skills, any advice on coping with a breakup and staying friends with an Ex would be super helpful, also
Anyways I can cool off about meeting him tomorrow and possibly bringing up the video, anyway yeah I just need advice thanks so any advice is appreciated have a nice night guys (:

probably should mention most of my friends are younger that I knew before I meant him and I don’t want to ask any of my older friends because they knew him first and I don’t want them to have to deal with me being upset and all that so yeah thanks guys /:

He also has a kid which I practically helped him raise and I want to stay in touch with her, he also wants me to stay in touch with her, this is all so complicated I desperately need some advice /:

Another thing too and I thought I’d end up marrying this guy one day /: idk if it’s normal for guys to try and make girls jealous after breakups but those posts hurt

So basically quarantine came, lockdown etc yadda yadda, and we’ve kept in contact by playing video games, which is kinda my escape of the world since everything is kinda boring rn obviously and I’ve also had some real lows in this quarantine where I didn’t feel comfortable in my own home (nothing that bad dw abt it) 

We’ve always had a kindoff “agressive” or disrespectful thing around our friend group, everything just joking around anyways and we never really had any real problems because of that, but I’ve seen that my best friend has started to feel like some kind of boss and is always telling people to shut up, and bossing around in general (when we are on voicechat ofc) 

He’s also gotten kinda cocky and all he is looking for in his life is sex and alcohol and drugs and shit, its not that he has no purpose in life but I just don’t agree with the kind of life he wants to be. 

Going back to the purpose of this post, one thing he said to me the other day was “You’re my bitch, you have no say in X” He said that as a joke, but I felt like he really thought of it like that

Basically he’s been really disrespectful, letting people down, skillshaming me (for example), being toxic (which is normal while playing videogames, but when he does it he just goes over the top and is just annoying) and likes to boss people around by telling them to shut up

Today, while we were pn Discord with a group of friends I just yelled at him that if he wants everybody to shut the fuck up so hard to just leave the call, and he answered with “Oh you wanna fight” and “Don’t make me tell you something you don’t wanna hear” and in the end he just stopped talking because someone in the voicecall interrupted him

402,"I'm a grade 11, 16 years old boy from the Philippines and im new to reddit and im on mobile so sorry for any mistakes i make and english is not my native language.

*Background*

My whole family is toxic in their own way that lead to me barely functioning properly as a human.
Me - I'm incapable of creating any kind of relationship and i have a lot of issues regarding my mental health and physical health.
Grandma - she likes to hurt me physically and mentally. (She's always abroad thank god)
Grandpa - my guardian and he's the one making sure that im alive but he doesn't know how to raised a child. (I only see him at night before corona hit)
Father - he neglect me, that's all i can say about him.
Mother - She tried but when my mental health is seriously hurting my life and i call for her to help me she just said to not be a problem to her. And base on my observation she's not the person i could ask for help regarding my issues with my mental health, physical sure but the issue regarding about my mental health I don't know.. (She's really not that present in my life and now she have her own family, like my father)
Stepmom - she hates me even though we don't talk when it's absolutely necessary, how do i know this? Well she just framed me for hurting her daughter with no evidence. (My grandmother believe it of course and everyone just ignores it except for my mom, she tries to explain that it's not true that i hurt my half sister and I don't know how it went)

*My life*

My situation at home is like this (before corona hit) i live with my grandparents house with my father's family but im always alone and they just always keep to themselves. when the corona hit they are here alright but we don't really talk much.

Basically im the one who raised myself and taught myself like common things a functioning human must know and need but because of bad habit and my mental state it's really hard. 

Because of me always being by myself i don't really need to talk so I don't have a communication skills and social life and i didn't get to experience other emotion that much except for sadness and anger so im very weird kid but i quickly learn not to show my sadness and anger towards them or anyone so i begin to act so i could hide it, at first it was very hard but by copying other kid i eventually get the hang of it. 

And if you're asking how my school life is when im in highschool (still is) it's just very bland im basically invisible so I don't really have any problems except when im in elementary im just starting to learn how to control my emotions (im constantly crying out of nowhere and have anger issues) and copy other kids it was very hard at first but i got the hang of it.

*My solution*

Right now i fucking need to get out of here my mental health is getting worse and worse and i don't know how long i have before i kill myself but my options are:
1. Stay here
2. Go to my mother's family (she invited me to join they're family but im am not comfortable about that)
3. Run away (im treating this option as a last resort)

Please i need advice I don't know if my mother's family would help me with my issues because how can a stranger help me when my OWN family couldn't, i just can't trust anyone what if i got worse..
Please help I don't want to make a mistake because i feel like this decision would change my life for the better or worse. (Feel free to ask any questions you have regarding about my life)",24Aug2020,1

My girlfriend(f18) and I(m18) have been dating for about six months but have the strongest relationship ever. She makes me feel at peace and like I have a home and I feel loved by someone who doesn’t make it seem like a chore. We have been wanting to continue our lives in a state that we both wanted to move into since before we met each other and since that and given her religion we have been tossing the idea of marriage around for the next year. My mother and her have been on good terms until now.  From what I’ve gathered my mom has been stressed because of covid and having to work as a owner for a salon. I try to let our arguments which happen quite frequently slide past me because I can only imagine the stress. But they usually end with me being asked to leave and leave everything while also giving them money for college that she insisted on paying. No matter what I do or try, I just have always been at the point of leaving since my mental health deteriorates whenever we have an argument.  What made me make this post In the first place was that today my gf was over and was helping me study for the national registry for EMTs. My mother came in, with some alcohol in one hand which usually gives her courage to say what’s on her mind I might add, and began telling me I should find a BS degree to earn so I can climb a corporate ladder. I said no since I feel like I need the paramedic school more and just my AA of kinesiology which would be fine. She kept insisting and insulted me for not thinking about my future. She said if I didn’t get a BS then she will have my aunt not help pay for my education like promised since I would be throwing my life away and all that money and it can be spent somewhere else. I shot all this down because my gf was still in the room with me and given that I was starting to become upset she tried to at least give some information to her about how the paramedic trade school works that I would be attending to and how a BS wasn’t going to improve my pay or chances of being hired since I would need fire fighter education more. She walked off after I asked politely to leave since I heard and value her concern but I didn’t want to choose that route. She left the house to me and my gf and we didn’t think anything of it. Fast forward to now at one in the morning, as I’m sleeping she comes into my room telling me my gf is not allowed over any she’ll be making me rethink my life since my gf had disrespected her today and how she’s brain washing me. She then proceeded to say that if I want to throw my life away I should pack my bags tomorrow when I wake up and leave.

Hell, I just spent six hours hanging out with ONE friend  after not seeing her for over two weeks and it pretty much sucked the life out me. Hell, after two hours, all I wanted to do was to retreat back home and isolate myself in my room for another month. I had to pretty much force myself to stay another four. And it's not her at all, I love being around her. She's the most supportive and open minded person I've ever met. It's just that being around other people (whether I like or hate them) drains me.

I just wish I wasn't like this. I want to extroverted and social, I want to have a busy life and to go out every weekend but I just can't bring myself to do it.

413,My (f24) bf's cousin (m30s) has been self admittedly singling me out and being rude to me because years ago when I had a class with his gf (now fiancee) I supposedly said the family only liked her more or she was only getting respect because she was dating the oldest cousin in the family. I vehemently deny ever saying this because it's completely ridiculous. A person doesn't get an easy pass to likability and repect just because they're dating someone. I don't personally like him for many reasons but I still try to be respectful and act like a civil human being but he's being an absolute man baby going around complaining about me and referencing this incident to a bunch of ppl to the point that the actual adults in the family are starting to hear things. Normally I would ignore everything because I've learned to not be bothered by the fact that people dislike me but seeing as how I see a future with my bf I don't want his family to think badly of me. Not being bullied would be a nice plus too. I feel any effort put into trying to quell this will be meaningless because this guy is super full of himself and stubborn. I also have a friend who is close with his fiancee and said she knows why he doesn't like me but has never heard of this specific reason before so I feel he's grasping at straws just to defend his immaturity and distaste for me. I'm at a loss and unsure of what the best course of action is. I just don't feel like I've done anything to deserve this. Thanks for taking the time to read and possibly respond.,24Aug2020,1

418,"need some serious help.

hey guys. I’m 27 (F) and my fiancé is 37 (M). we’ve been through a lot in the past 5 years. we have a daughter and we were separated for a year. there were a lot of issues for the both of us that we were trying to work out which resulted in us fighting all the time. 

we recently got back together and one of the biggest issues in our past was the house we live in. he bought it when he was 27 (way before he met me) and it needed a lottt of work. it’s come a long way since he bought it, but since I’ve lived here it’s been very slow progress. our daughters room is completely finished, but when I was pregnant he definitely sped through that because we wanted it ready for when she was a few months old &amp; moving into her own room.

the rest of the house is very old (built in the 50s and 70s) and it needs new walls, new floors, new windows, new ceilings, etc. the kitchen needs new cabinets as well, and there is only one sliver of counter space which can become very frustrating when trying to cook dinner and such. 

over the years, I tried my hardest to not let it bother me. I would just remind myself that it was our house &amp; it was a work in progress. unfortunately, my fiancé hates working on the house, but also doesn’t want to spend money to hire anyone to do it. so I’m dependent on him to fix the house at his own pace. 

I know it sounds like I’m just complaining, but the state of the house makes it hard for it to be comfortable. it just doesn’t feel like home to me because it’s so unfinished and there are days it feels like it’s going to stay that way forever. 

Side note: I know there are homeless people &amp; people who live in poverty. I’m not a spoiled princess. I’m happy to have a roof over my head. that’s why I tried to never make a fuss about it. but we both work and have the money to fix this house &amp; make it our home.

lately the house has been making me feel down and depressed. I have no motivation to clean it or decorate it because it’s unfinished. when I lived with my parents I took pride in keeping my room clean and organized and decorated. I’ve never lived anywhere but here and my parents house, and I’ve told him there are days I dream about buying a new house and just having him move in there with me and my daughter. 

unfortunately, he takes a lot of my frustrations about the house as personal attacks on him because he’s not working on the house as much as he should. he feels he can never do anything right and that it will never be good enough. that then results in us fighting and not speaking. it’s a vicious cycle and I’m trying my hardest to remind myself if we’re going to work this out I need to compromise and be patient, but there is another part of me that feels I’ll be in my 30s still waiting around for my house to be done &amp; be a home. 

is it possible that a house can be a deal breaker for a couple? I really do love him &amp; want to be with him, but I also want to have a home we can take pride in and call ours. I’ll take any advice I can get, because at this point him and I are drowning.

419,"I am totally and absolutely at a loss about what to do. I hate my job so much and the hatred is getting worse. I get treated like a piece of shit by my colleagues since receiving a promotion at the start of the year.

My boss is a nightmare as she hates confrontation and refuses to do anything about any of the people in the team. This has a domino effect and makes my job 10 X harder as nothing is being dealt with. 

The pressure that is put on me is absolutely horrendous and I regularly work until 10pm to try and get stuff done. I have no work life balance and I have no support whatsoever, my team take every opportunity to insult, throw me under the bus and under mine me. 

I’m trying to apply for new jobs at the moment, I totally understand that we are in another recession and a lot of people have lost their jobs. I am thankful I have a job but it’s starting to get to the point where It’s having a huge effect on me mentally.",24Aug2020,1

421,"Heya I just really need some advice on this i guess.
Me: 19F
Previous Partner: 20M
My budgies: Tofu and Cous Cous

So in December 2019, I decided I wanted a new pet and loved how my brother and cousins had great friendships with their own budgies. I had always wanted something like it and had hoped I'd get something similar, a friend I suppose. 

So I did the research, YouTube videos, budgie forums/websites, even local budgie groups on Facebook. After about 3 months of research and sitting on the idea I thought I made the right and informed decision to get one. 
My plan slightly changed of course when I asked my Previous Partner (PP for short) when he wanted one too. I was of course happy to get a second one as it was recommended for them to have a buddy but also meant more work training and cleaning etc.

Its now August and I don't think I am giving them the best anymore. 
Originally I had heaps of time to offer them and train them with treats and make awesome little salads too. But I don't have the time anymore to really give them what they need as I'm practically working OverNight everyday of the week and my weekend job on top of that.
I also broke up with my PP and he has practically dropped all responsibility onto me with them (not like I wasn't already doing it all in the first place) but I feel the extra pressure now that I know its just me. Being away from my birdies has also affected their relationship with me, more timid, less excited to hangout with me and they're less active being in their cage most of the day. (They probably don't get out until the evenings and its like for 2-3hrs at a time)

I love my little girls so much and it pains me to write this but should I adopt them out to a friends aviary?

Would I be bad if someday in the future, I could try again when I knew I could handle it?
And how does one cope with the feeling of abandoning my babies like this?
I'm at a loss at what to do.... I know what is right and what I should do but I can't seem to let go yet.",24Aug2020,1
422,"I love this man so much. From about 6 months into this relationship (both 19 at the time, now we're 21) I have happily imagined moving in, getting married, traveling having kids...I never really doubted it. This all changed slowly in the last 3 months or so. A few days ago it hit me that I'm not sure I wanna marry him anymore. His OCD and anxiety was an issue for 2/3 months last summer and but things were great from September to April-ish this year. This rough patch is so much worse and he keeps saying it'll get better and he doesn't need help, but that's just not true. I want him to get a real diagnosis for his OCD, currently he is just relying on a few free therapy sessions he had last year where he was told he probably has OCD. I have dealt with him confessing various bad things he has said/done or thought and comforting him, even if it's something horrible about me that he confessed cos he needs it of his chest- like finding X woman we know hotter once or worrying he was jealous of his friend for dating this girl he once had a crush on (which could all be OCD, but again, no real official diagnosis yet so?). If he would learn to manage it better and get diagnosed i would be fine again.

I cried over something he said over the phone a few nights ago, he didn't mean it but it still hurt a lot and I thought "" the right guy wouldn't hurt me like this, accidentally or not"". He was super apologetic and  whenever this happens he tries his best to cheer me up but it shouldn't happen. Part of me started thinking maybe I'll meet someone just as good someday, minus this issue. At the same time, he really loves me, we are perfect together outside of his mental health issues but if he was the one would this even happen? I feel so terrible for being so indecisive. He is my life basically- we got each other into the other's hobbies, my room is covered in presents he has bought me, he is my best friend, I have no friends outside of our mutual ones.The thought of leaving him makes me feel unbareably sad. What should I do?",24Aug2020,1
423,"I’m 19, going into my sophmore year in college. I used to absolutely love school but now it’s nothing more than something that’s just happening. I have an ok support group, I play football (which has been cancelled now so one of the few consistent things in life has been taken from me) where I can talk to the coaches, and I do semi regularly. I have a decent friend group, but I’m pretty clearly the black sheep of the group and don’t fit in as well as everyone else, and it feels like half the time most of them don’t want me around. I don’t struggle with class work at all, I made the deans list last semester without opening any of my text books. I also am not really facing any significant financial burden.

I’ve narrowed it down to three primary reasons I feel so shitty, or at least I think these are why:

1. I’m a political science major, so I’m hyper aware of most of the major things going on around the world and that leaves me feeling awful, especially seeing that everybody is at each other’s throats right now about trivial high school bullshit and can’t see anything from another point of view. One positive of this is that politics is something I’ve been passionate about for as long as I can remember.

2. I don’t think I really deserve any of the good shit happening to me. I’m only playing college football because of my size (I play left tackle and I’m 6’6” 330 which is NFL height). I only played one year in high school so I’m incredibly raw still and no matter how hard I’m working I’m still behind everyone else. This frustrates me and a lot of people around me. I’ve gained a lot of respect because people can see I’m genuinely trying to improve and I’m rarely in a bad mood

3. I have a general sense of worthlessness. I’m really apathetic towards myself and don’t see the positives that everybody else seems to see about me. Everyone I’ve known has told me I’m a good person, or that I’m funny, or XYZ. But I just don’t see it. I’m not sure why I can’t but it’s just a mental state I’ve been in since about a year and a half ago.


Anyway TL;DR: My mental state is pretty shitty because I’m constantly aware of all the bad in the world, I don’t think I deserve to be where I’m at, and I generally just feel a lot worse about myself than others do.  

I appreciate any help I can get, and apologize if this is confusing because it’s 4 am and my dorm room is about 90 degrees",24Aug2020,1
424,"So my boyfriend and I have been in a relationship for almost a year. I feel like he is the one and we talk about marriage and our future all the time. Hes 28 and I am 27.  We dont currently live together but I am there most of the time and just come back to my place when I need to grab clothes. We are just waiting for our leases to end to move in with each other. He has a 4year old daughter with his ex who he has been on and off with for almost 10 years. They haven’t been together for about 2 years and I am the first girlfriend since her. They had a very toxic relationship and will always talk shit about his parenting, the way he looks, and just about everything he does. And he will only talk to her if its about his daughter but somehow she will always end with these rants. When we first got together she somehow found pics of my ex and I (probably on my ex’s social media) and she would screenshot them and send them to my boyfriend and would say’ “oh she will for sure go back to him” “shes a party girl she doesn’t want you” “shes going to cheat on you” and I had no idea who she was and shes never met me or knows any of my friends. So she doesn’t know me at all to be saying anything. So whatever I let it go because she is obviously bitter he moved on and he defended me and said she crossed the line and handled it. We are very close to my family so of course his daughter will come with us to family functions and his daughter would go and tell her mom about her new grandparents (my parents) so a few times she would call and freak out on him “who do you have my daughter around” and he would say, “I know our daughter is safe so just worry about her during the times you have her and Ill do the same” but she keep talking shit saying she needs to meet me and see who her daughter is around because she doesn’t want her daughter around a “drunk hood rat” and a “broke fat bitch” which my boyfriend will completely shut her down and tell her to stop talking shit about me because I am far from that lol and I completely love their daughter. We get along so well. So I completely understand meeting and her knowing who her daughter is around so I am all for that but do I meet her if all she has done is talk shit about me without knowing me.  I am not scared to meet her. I am scared to meet her and have her be disrespectful to me and then I have to say something back because I wont allow her to me disrespectful to me again and she would definitely be the fighting type too. Then I feel like I would also be disrespecting the daughter because that is her mom and I just want to being that little girl happiness not her mom and I having all these issues.  So do I wait it out until she can finally handle herself to be mature or do I meet her hoping she would shut the fuck up lol",24Aug2020,1
425,"So I'll be turning 27 soon, and I have to ask why shouldn't I kill myself? The last 4 years have been hell for me and I have very little going for me at the moment and my will to live is dwindling. I will try to give you guys my reasons why I don't want to remain on this planet w/o giving you my whole life story.To begin with this year is an election year and I just have a bad feeling that Trump will be re-elected whether from some bs or people simply not voting. Besides the politics which I don't want to get into, I have been dealing with a chronic illness since High school (Liver Transplant) which requires me to take multiple medications every single day which just serves to remind me of my medical issues that I'll have to deal with for the rest of my entire life. On top of that I cannot drink alcohol because of said medications, and being a dude I find this to be one of the worst things about dealing with a chronic illness like mine. And in terms of school I have no clue what I'm going do. I'm about a year from getting my bachelor's but since my school has financial hold on my account for about 10k, I can't return or transfer out until I pay off that debt. Tbh my grades also took a downward spiral within these last couple of years, as I've been dealing with some mental health issues. I had met this one girl at my university who I caught feelings for instantly, unfortunately for me she already had someone before meeting her but I still can't help but think about what could have been if I had taken my shot and told her how I felt. I didn't because I knew she already had somebody and it just wouldn't sit right with me (Fuck having a Conscious). Years pass by and I still hold those deep feelings I had for her and she easily became my biggest regret in life. About a year after this while still attending classes with my heart in pieces, I find out that both my parents were diagnosed with cancer (Thankfully they're doing a lot better now) which just put me in deep hole that I'm still sitting in. And again I can't drink so there's no avoiding the pain that only thing I have to numb the pain has been weed and even then it's not enough to help with the shit I gotta deal with. So again tell me why I shouldn't kill myself?  
Please I want you people to be real with me, I'm not here for the sympathy just a reason. (Apologies for the long read I did not intend to write as much as I did)",24Aug2020,1

427,"Me (24f) and my bf (28m) have been together for just over a year. We have really complementary personalities and we love each other a lot. I have a high sex drive and he doesn't. The first months were great but now a year after we have sex every couple of weeks. 

The problem is that for the majority we always do it before bed. He cums very fast and we never go for it a second time. He can't really get hard a second time most of the time. He always goes down on me and tries to make me cum but I've reached this point where I'm very sexually frustrated because the whole process is done after 10'. 

As much as I appreciate his efforts I want to have more actual sex. I literally masturbate so often to relief myself and I've gotten to the point where he can tell I'm frustrated every time we are done with sex. I've tried talking to him about what he likes and what I like but he really doesn't talk a lot about it which is weird because we really are great at communicating in general. I've told him I love it when he is dominant and he says he likes that too but I can tell it's not his thing at all and he is just putting effort to be more dominant. I only admitted I like it because I wanted us to start being more communicative about the whole sex issue but every time I try to talk to him about what he likes he is way too generic about it as if he is kind of avoiding it? I thought maybe he is embarrassed so I try to tell him about my more embarrassing kinks (not the worst ones so I don't scare him 😅) thinking he might open up more but nothing. I really want to please him, make him more confident and im ready to put the effort but I really don't know what to do at this point. 

Please give me some advice. I never had issues because I am so open minded about sex and it's easy for me to talk about it. I love him so much but I'm scared. It's only been a year and I'm THIS frustrated. I thought I could live with it if I just masturbate a lot but I can't... I want him.",24Aug2020,1

435,"This year (hell this past life) has been pretty rocky. I left my home state to do something else and haven't really started anything substantial at all yet. It's like I'm tired of trying anymore and not caring and only worrying about rent and food and showing up to my job. I've been stuck for years after high school with people in the past in my head and haven't been able to add new people in place of them. Honestly the remaining time at home was holding on relationships I knew were past their expiration just for sake of convenience. 

Tried a dating app for a while, fixed up my profile, liked a bunch of girls, and paid for the service to see my likes but nothing has come back. I'm considering that I just don't relate to the world and it doesn't relate to me. All these girls say they like dogs, they're tall so be taller, I see their pictures and can tell I wouldn't be their ""type."" I feel like an old man looking at teenagers or something. Separate from that I ran into a girl in person and finally felt some kind of connection but haven't gotten a text from her or anything. (She has my number, I don't have her's) Anytime something similar happens it's like this open then shut door and I feel dumb for trying to enter it.

I check and recheck social media and wind up with really nothing constantly. Am I supposed to run myself thin to get any connections in a world that barely cares if I rot? I came under the impression that I never had true connections with past people since they're not around anymore and it felt relieving but then it hit me my memories have been filled with lies and air all this time. Sometimes it feels like my only reason to stay alive is to fight any pity given to me if I die and I'm here out of some strange spite. 

I don't believe anything is especially wrong with me. It just feels like I've been marked or trapped in a cycle (like someone being homeless then trying to break out that lifestyle) and all it's done is make me cynical and ask why would I want to be in this bland world against any type of individuality?

While watching the movie, she was on her phone browsing through apps and loudly playing videos. Or talk through the movie about something completely unrelated to the movie all together. She's done this while we're together listening to music. She'd loudly play something completely different (at the same time) that just throws the vibe OFF.

441,"Since I was a kid I’ve always been an independent person. My parents never really bought me clothes, food, or gave me a safe place to live so a lot of my energy was devoted to finding those in ways that were pretty questionable. But I never focused in school. Never focused on any life skills. Never learned anything useful except certain skills needed for criminal activity, like being people smart. 

I always thought that my life was going to figure itself out and I was gonna end up in a good spot regardless but nah. Once I hit 9th grade I started getting put on medicine for what appeared to be a schizophrenic episode, but rally was just gaslighting confusing my brain so badly I couldn’t tell left from right (literally at one point). My therapist believed my dad when he said I was schizophrenic and drugged me so badly that my whole high school career went down the drain. I performed so low out of having such a fucked up body and foggy brain that despite being gifted &amp; usually high performing , I  finished with an almost below 1 GPA. Eventually though I did some self therapy and realized it wasn’t any illness at all. And once I rebelled and dropped the medicine the previous psychiatrist told me I probably actually never needed it to start. 

So Now, I should’ve been in my 2nd year of college. But The first one failed cause I wasn’t able to choose my classes on time so I had to go with second choices so — I didn’t get motivated to push through the constant psychological abuse to go anywhere. And the second time around my parents couldn’t make up their minds on helping me fund college. (And I for sure can’t balance paying for everything of mine plus college. Not yet) 

So here I am now. Having once seen a bright future ahead of me, I don’t see anything. I’m working a night warehouse job with my mom cause I don’t even have a drivers license to drive to my own job. I’m hoping to get my license but my “instructor” is my dad and he uses it to further psychologically abuse me and try to instill doubts of my abilities in it. 

I can’t get a better job because I don’t have a degree and my self worth is higher than this but at this point it’s a grandiose self worth cause I have nothing to show for it at this point. I’m just hoping in my mind I’m worth more than $400 paychecks. 
I don’t see any real way of turning this around cause not only does my whole family not support me, they actively sabotage me. Steal my money, psychologically abuse me, and try to make sure I don’t feel like I can have a good future. 
So no efforts come to anything in the end. feels like there’s no hope and I just don’t know where to go from here.",24Aug2020,1

445,"Over the quarantine ive slowly stopped communicating with my friend group as I realized this is my chance. The only reason I hung out with them is because I didn't wanna be friendless in high school. My friends are constantly acting on ways that cause me stress, anxiety, and overall feeling annoyed. I've stopped conversing with my ""main"" friend group and now am trying to figure out how to get out of my current mini group, consisting of me and 2 other people. Those two constantly make me the butt of jokes, and call it ""bullying m/n"" and it's honestly annoying. Why do I have to be ridiculed all the time? And then when I try to do the same thing they act as if I've just kicked them in the throat. It's honestly ridiculous, I don't even care to tell them to stop anymore, which I shouldn't. I'm just allowing people to kick me down for their own humor. My one friend on the group bought me concert tickets for my birthday and I really wanna go but not with them, absolutely not with them. I fake my feelings around them and pretend to be happy an cheerful when in reality I dislike them, I have a strong dislike towards them. They constantly appologize and try to make themselves look innocent and helpless, riddled with anxiety. I used to joke about my own struggle with anxiety with them but now it's just annoying, not every conversation has to be about our fucking anxiety. Not every conversation has to be the same repetitive thing about our past, it's absolutely boring. Now my other friend acts secretive cause they don't want to be made fun of, the irony. They just bother me, I can't describe it but every time I'm around them I'm annoyed. All in all I hate my friends. I no longer want to be friends with them, I've had these sentiments for a long time.

I got bullied as a kid, and my life has not been easy because of how I look. Ive tried becoming friends with people but I just cannot put the energy to friendships anymore and I’ve been alone for the past four years. I have social media accounts but not much friends online. I’m a nobody both in real life and online. however I like the memes I like reddit, I just don’t like how much of a loser I am on twitter. Nobody ever likes my tweets it is embarrassing. Some cool people follow me and they must really pity me because no one ever talks to me.... I wonder why they still follow me they should just unfollow!! Because Immboring and not fun!! If I were fun I think they would at least try to talk to me.

But anyway..... yes, I’m a nobody. I feel like shit. I have no idea what to do with my social life. People treat me different because im ugly. And that is why I act weird. Because I havent been around people my age much.

448,"Due to a mental health crisis I have had to take leave from work for 2 weeks until I get signed off from a psychologist to return to work (i work with children) 

I am in severe financial hardship at the moment and had cut off alot of my spending. The issues I'm having is with my gym and personal training. 
They total just over $165 a fortnight.
I need to cut these as I'll only be getting paid around $500 this fortnight and rent is majority of that. 

I'm in contracts and I really don't know what to do. They don't take into account financial hardship - ive already tried asking and reasoning - 
is there anything my doctor or psychologist could do?

I am in a country that does not Fully understand ADHD and Dyslexia but somehow even after being diagnosed. I have been managing. I don't have access to meds and I don't think I need them.

The issue is as we work with a client and it requires sometimes to do a lot of communication internally. usually in internal communications app does not support Grammarly or at least does not show up there. When I ask for help and I muck up spelling or anything my lead responds with. *""Please correct all the typos in the thread. This shows how committed are we towards the work.""*. I also know he might hold my ""unprofessional communication"" during increment no matter how hard I work. I understand that its cause my workplace may not get it. Most people don't understand. I also don't put it on my resume as I don't want to be denied a job.   


But every time this is pointed out. I  panic start reading each and every letter. ponder over them for 15-30 min losing more and more time.

I wanted to talk maturely about what happened but it seems that they hate me and want nothing to do with me. I’ve been called psychologically unwell and falsely accused of using people by them and it really still bothers me so much. It broke me. And it bothers me that people like my ex are so happy while not feeling any remorse for 1.the horrible things they called me 2.the lies they made up about me 3.using me as a rebound when he knew he wanted the other girl. I am so hurt and still miss him for some reason. The whole conversation is just me apologizing to him, otherwise I wasn’t allowed to talk. I should have just never reached out again but I kept trying to fix the issues and I really can’t let go or move on.

I’m really worried about my mental health. I always had depression but a year ago I was confident and liked who I was.

464,"First things first: I am not living, nor planning on studying in the United States. I am living in the EU and plan on studying here as well.


So, CoVid pretty much turned my life upside down, which is why I decided to go back to college and get a degree in psychology.

As part of the application process, you must take an entry exam, which determines whether or not you will actually get accepted. The exam takes place once a year and only about 20 percent of applicants pass the exam every year, and while I have been studying for months now and feel well prepared, I also find it quite reasonable to think about a plan B in case I do pass said exam.

Right now, the plan B I had in mind was to move to the university’s city anyway, find a part time job, save as much money as I can and use the year (and the experience from this year’s exam) to prepare myself throughoutly for next year’s exam. 

Does anyone have any input? Any criticism? What can I do to get the most out of the year? How does one balance studying while also working a job? Also, what can I do to really prepare myself for studying psychology (besides studying the material required for the entry exam)?

Thank you so much in advance",24Aug2020,1
465,My husband and I have been together 11 years married for 6. We have 4 young kids ages 7-3. At this point we haven't taken a vacation together the two of us because no one can watch the kids and the little one is just old enough now that we'd be comfortable leaving. We moved out of our home state of NY 5 years ago. Since moving away we have not made any friends. I feel like I have become completely isolated. I don't drive so the only time i go out is once a week to the supermarket. He is completely content with spending every waking moment with me. I am too for the most part. Any time I have brought up the idea of making friends he shuts it down because we should be enough for eachother. As a stay at home mom of 4 who works from home and spends my life taking care of everyone elses needs my sense of self gets lost. I think its important to have time for myself and time with friends. In a few weeks there is going to be a surprise birthday party for my bestfriend in NY. Her fiance wants to fly me and her mom up to be there for the party..the biggest surprise of all. While we live in Florida I think I should take the quick weekend trip up there for the party. My husband can't understand why I would ever want or need to leave him. He said he should be enouh for me. When I try to explain that I never go out or have any social interaction he looks at me like I'm crazy and brings up the handful of times friends and family has come to visit. Is it wrong that I feel the need for more time with friends and family than that? I dont understand how he thinks that is social interaction. I am generally just fine with things the way they are but ultimately I would like to have friends and get togethers.

466,"I used to talk to this guy two months ago but we both got a bit busy and things faded a bit. We hung out two or three times. 

I was thinking about him and liked him so I texted him that ‘I think it’d be fun if we could get to know each other again’ and his response was ‘sounds good’.

He’s not really a dry texter and the text was sent a 3am so I’m not sure if he sent it in his sleep or if that response is genuine. He had deleted tinder last I knew. 

Either way I have no idea how to respond. ‘Sounds good’ as a response seems a bit like a no just because there’s no engagement or attempt to set up plans.

470,"I'm thinking of dropping out, I am entering my 4th year of IT engineering school and it's gonna be a year now that I feel really underwhelmed by it. I believe I was depressed during high school and my first two years, but experiences last September cracked me open and I am in a way better place now. I went for IT bc all my teens were spent on a computer and I enjoyed basic coding classes but the deeper I go and the more I am annoyed. 

I've been thinking since the beginning of the year in doing Data Science as a back up and a way to continue my degree, which I am trying to pursue. But I am required to find an internship and I can't seem to.  

I don't know what else I could do so am thinking of taking a year off to find out and explore parts of myself that I haven't before due to my mental health/not being aware.

When I think of staying I feel stuck and not moving forward with my life, obstined in something that I don't know makes me happy.

Dropping out makes me relieved of a certain weight but in the meantime I am really scared of abandoning the hopes that I had at a good life, and 'waste' my year in doing activities that won't help me in moving forward.

471,"So, I’ve browsed reddit for ever but never posted or commented but I truly need some feedback with an odd situation im in. 

Long story short, I met this man (around 50 year old) ((this is entirely platonic. This is is just a weird situation)) who’s like a therapist but calls himself an emotional integration teacher and has a degree in spirituality and philosophy or some shit and is self proclaimed and somehow legally does therapy without doing “therapy”. And he’s actually quite smart and his technique is simple and I admire it and he’s taught me a lot and became a close friend a mentor. 

After completing an initial 5 sessions with me, a 20 year old female ((a very gay androgynous female in a committed relationship. Once again, no weird shit at all in even the slightest, I promise)) he took a liking towards my ability to articulate and process information and he could tell that I am a writer and a good one at that. (I’m typing this super lazy it’s like 5 am this isn’t a good rep of my writing skills lol) 

So he chose me and asked me if I could help him with this ‘project’. It’s basically a book that he wants me to write as a “co-author” to him. He eventually brought in his friend (a married woman just a bit younger than him) and his other friend (used to be a client of his years ago in the 90 day mental health program substance recovery place he actually professionally works 9-5 at) and decides we can all collaborate. 

So we start having weekly calls for months straight discussing the books and his “11 session/chapter method” and I’m very eager. I’ve expressed, without sounding too crazy naive and enthusiastic, that in very greatly to do this and work with him and that I feel a sense of purpose finally able to work towards my goal of helping people/advocating mental health.

He never really lays out a clear outline of anything. He never says anything about financial compensation, but that the books dividends, once published, would obviously be split between us all and I would have my name on the front since I will have wrote it and I want to start my writing career, right? 

So I’m like fucking stoked in my own head right.. just doing everything I can to help him for free. The other two friends of his are busy w their own lives and kind of fade off into the distance in regards to this project, mainly. And I’m over here trying my best to work on this with him and shoot Brain storms over for months because I really care and felt a sense of purpose in this. 

He never really goes hey, I really appreciate your time and effort and I’m grateful for your role in this project etc. or some variation of thanks so much for basically writing my book for me. And he goes MIA a lot, and he’s “busy with his clients and sessions and work at _____ (workplace)” and just kind of plays things off as usual and is very go easy and nonchalant seeming. 

So then I spend 6 months beating myself up trying to work on a book that’s not really mine but kind of mine but not really mine.

And tonight, I found myself sat up in bed trying to edit document one of the lessons for this and this and that.. just sitting there at 3 am tediously editing it just because I fucking enjoy it and the method has helped me a lot and I want to help others. Apparently, my girlfriend has tried to tell me this before, but she’s very very intuitive. She’s not naive like me (I have very high functioning autism but I still possess a child like naïveté) and she sees shit for how it really is.

She tells me “hey, you’re up here working all night editing this mans papers for him.. he makes it seem like you’re working on this together but honestly you’re doing all this work for him. He doesn’t give a shit, ____ doesn’t give a shit (his friend), and neither does _____ (other friend) and you barely do but you still try to. Don’t you ever wonder why it doesn’t feel right really? It’s not REALLY your book. These are things people PAY editors to do. They PAY people to do these things. I think it’s not what you think it is. I think he sees a vulnerable 20 year old that doesn’t know what she wants to do except help people and loves to write and is eager to do this because he knows you won’t question it. He knows you’ll just be happy to do it for him. But like any artist or worker, that’s your time, energy, and effort you spend on this and you don’t get a cent. Just the promise of MAYBE money if the book even sells and works out. Doesn’t something seem a little odd to you?” 

I try to just say hey I appreciate the concern but honestly I’m just happy to practice my writing skills and do this so I can start somewhere (haven’t gone to college yet so I’m obviously not super “”qualified”” but he still picked me??)  and. Blah blah blah sometimes the reward isn’t money.

And she goes okay but that’s exactly why he chose you. BECAUSE you feel that way. But money’s important and he sees you struggling with it, he’s your fucking therapist basically he KNOWS what’s going on in your life and how vulnerable you are and that you’re obviously not gonna be financially stable at this age etc etc.

And I’m like shit...... wait a second....... 

So does anyone have an opinion? I always need validation on these things, if you will. I’m too anxious to confront him but I think I’m going to have to. Does this sound like he’s using me/taking advance of me/has hidden intent/knows what he’s doing and SHOULD pay me??

I try to not get in conversations with her but she won’t stop starting them and I would just block her and be done with it but we’re going to the same school next year and I don’t want it to be super awkward.

474,"We've been speaking online for many months now, probably half a year now. He regularly reaches out to me to update me on things, and I also ask about how he's doing regularly. Whenever we talk, just listening to him talk makes me feel suffocated and worried about his options. He says he likes that we talk, but sometimes after a talk he will say he only feels more angry at God. (will be explained in a bit)

 He feels a lot of anxiety, regret, and apprehension for something that he's done and its consequences. He basically did something unethical and is risking ruining his career chances once caught, the reason he even was able to bear with his life (no he has not done anything super malicious or evil, he basically lied to impress someone). He is not at all thinking logically, even when we try and break down his thought process and he can clearly see for himself he's not thinking straight. He hates himself and feels like the world is plotting to ruin him. We're both very religious, and he has this mentality that he should sin so that God can hate him and be doomed to Hell. I know to non religious people this seems ridiculous, but imagine that this guy has been prioritizing God all his life and now he suddenly feels hated by him and feels incredibly guilty and doomed to Hell. It's an awful feeling. Like ruining everything you've been working towards all your life.

He says if things don't go his way this time, he will probably travel somewhere far away and kill himself doing something noble like purposefully putting himself in dangerous situations to help others(he enjoys helping others). When he talks about these things, he seems to only feel worse. He can't afford therapy as of now. I feel that as a non professional I am only making him feel worse, when he starts to talk about everything he starts to feel even angrier than before. He regularly wants to talk about it though. Am I doing the right thing by listening to him vent for hours even though it only increases the negativity he feels? Or is venting important because of how incredibly guilty he feels? Are there some ways or books I could read to try and better help him or am I just making things worse? I've asked him if I'm making things worse but he always says no. Yet from the way the conversation ends.. I don't think so. :(",24Aug2020,1

476,"I am insecure. I have gotten better over the years, but I still get that gut feeling of insecurity when my husband hangs out with his ex. I don’t know what it is, but it’s just there. As much as I want to say, “I don’t care have fun!” It’s not how I actually feel. 

It’s not by choice. His friends having a birthday dinner and she will be there. I told him I don’t feel comfortable with her being around him ONLY because she’s known for being a huge flirt and has gotten passed around the squad. Out of the 5 people that are going, she’s slept with 2, made out with 1, dated my husband, and the friend that invited her is now pursuing her as a love interest. She currently has a boyfriend that isn’t going to the dinner or the beach trip. 

I used to be friends with his ex in high school, but I ended the friendship because she was talking a lot of shit behind my back and I can’t possibly respect/trust someone who does that and smiles in my face acting like I’m their best friend. 

I’m trying my hardest to be supportive and encouraging him to be there for his friend, but the ex being there really makes me uncomfortable. I voiced my opinion to him and he said he’ll cancel, but I feel really bad about it. 

His friend had this whole entire 4 day beach house trip planned out with the boys and my husbands ex and I begged my husband not to go because I just couldn’t bare the thought of them being half naked the whole entire time getting drunk on the beach together, cliff diving and jet skiing while I stay at home with the 2 kids working 15 hours a day, studying for my classes - on top of that clean, cook, and care for everyone. (My husband has 3 siblings living with us) 

So yeah I feel bad for making him fake on the whole beach trip and his friend was really sad about that, but I don’t want to make him miss out on his friends birthday dinner either. I want to feel comfortable, but it’s just not sitting well with me. My anxiety makes me want to leave out of his life so he can be with her, but obviously that isn’t logical or reasonable.

477,"I am worried about my niece. She's a lovely 5 year old who started school this year. Her school allows virtual learning, but she is currently going to an actual school. Last night my brother called me frantic. He found out that for the 2nd time his gf (nieces mom) cheated on him. He kicked her out. My brother has had full custody of my niece for the last 2.5 years. Her mom hasn't been in the picture. It's court documented that he has full custody. His gf...ex-gf, has been back for 7 months up until last night. I just wanted to give a little background before I get into my worry.

My brother works a job that pays $15/hr. He works 40/hrs per week, but his checks are only around $360 after paying back child support to his \*other\* ex for my nephew. My brother works from 6am until 6pm. My niece goes to school from 730 am until 3pm. From there she goes to day care until 6. The daycare closes at 6. My brother and I's father is 69 years old. While I'm sure he'll do it, he won't do it happily. I do not live anywhere close to my brother. The only family he has is me, my mom, my dad, and my aunt. That's it. We have no other family. My mom and I live out of state. My aunt lives about 3 hours away, my dad lives about 40 minutes away. I've offered to let my niece come stay with me, but my brother doesn't want her to and I honestly totally understand. I am 12 hours away, it would hurt his feelings. We travel for work but we are here on a job for the next 2 years we think. We live in a fifth wheel, so we don't have a ton of room. While I want to help my brother by letting him live with me, it gives me extreme anxiety. He's lived with me a number of times when I was single and living alone. It never ended well. I've always been the person to pick up the pieces, but always end up getting shit on with hostility. I can't deal with that. I don't know what to do y'all. Does anyone have any advice? What I can do for my niece? I honestly have zero idea what I should/need to do. And am quite terrified for her.",24Aug2020,1

My stepdad is a racist, macho, homophobic, transphobic, conservative piece of shit. He oppressed me since I’m 15 and even bursted trough my door and completely broke it and didn’t respected my privacy whatsoever when I was a late teen.  There are thousands of crazy stories. Once he pushed me against the wall with his hand around my neck when I was around 16, because I didn’t respect him and argumented against his stupid worldview and his cold and heartless character. He is also that kind of guy who threatens to kill himself when my mum wants to break up with him. That happened everytime for the last 7 fucking years. This mofucker also really thinks he is my dad and better than everyone else. Recently when I visited my mom, he was kind for the first few minutes but later laughed at my life decisions and I just can’t ignore this piece of shit anymore. Talking and convincing my mum with her gender roles and bullshit is a real fucking hard task too, furthermore when she is a manipulative retarded Karen herself most of the time. I don’t want to tell my whole life story with him and my mum, because it’s mentally exhausting and this shit was also a huge factor why I was suicidal in the past, but I just can’t control my anger no more.

480,"My mom and dad have been divorced for 10 years, and she has been remarried to a great guy that treats her well financially. My mom and dad have always bickered on money, specifically about my dad never paying child support or any level of support for me when I was growing up after the divorce. My dad stayed in the same house that my mom and dad owned together and he had many troubles with paying taxes and upkeep, which my mom would typically front. My mom put me through college from her own money excluding my scholarships, despite my dad saying he would help out. 

My dad recently had a stroke that has left him mentally and physically incapacitated, and because of this he’s living in a nursing home off of Medicare because of his lack of income or savings prior to his stroke. However he had a condo that got auctioned from a tax sale, which all the money went to my mom. 

Now my mom and I are in the process of cleaning out the house and are planning to sell it since it’s no longer in use. My mom wants at least half of the selling price since she’s a co-owner, but she is talking about taking more for my dads missed child support and lack of college funding. My mom and I both have a POA for my dad. 

As far as advice, I want to get something out of my dads properties but with my mom taking the full amount from the condo, and now talking about taking more than half from the house it seems a little unfair. My mom owns the house 50/50 with my dad so can she even take more than half? My mom did help me a ton with college and in raising me so is it selfish to still want money from the house? I’m at the age where I’m trying to get money for a house down payment, and this would help a lot.

I’d appreciate any input just to get an outside perspective.",24Aug2020,1

482,"Hi everyone,

First off, I want to thank you for reading my story/question. I feel like that's something I should say off the top, whether or not it's standard practice (this isn't a sub I frequent often), but I don't want to burden anyone if they don't feel like reading a bunch.

I'm a 25-year-old, gay, white male. I have a very hard time communicating with people and maintaining friendships. Conversations with people rarely get beyond the task at hand (like a school or work assignment) or small talk; I really don't know much about anyone's personal life, except for the people I live with.

A major problem I have been struggling with recently is coping with people cutting you out from their lives/telling you not to talk to them because you said/did something that made them feel uncomfortable.

Right now, I'm in graduate school, and was running for a student government position earlier this summer. In my nomination letter, I wrote the following statement (edited to remove identifying info):

&gt;Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. talked about how equality doesn’t happen until Black, Latinx and other communities have the ability to “cash a check” through which they can achieve equal societal status. Just making the law equal for all isn’t enough; we need to give underserved communities the platform and tools required to have the opportunity to become equal.  
Since joining the program, I have made it a priority to help “cash a check”. I have held internships through which I have supported people in majority-Black cities, and I am the only white person in our cohort who made the effort to work with minority students in both major school projects this Spring.

This statement angered one of the Black female students I had worked with in the spring, who felt like I was tokenizing her. That was the opposite of my intent, which was to prop up the needs of minority communities, not prop up myself. What's awkward, of course, is that I'm running for a political position, so I kind-of have to talk about the work I've done/efforts I've made to garner people's support.

So anyway, she texted me, saying in part ""If you wanted a pat on the back for working with someone black I wish you would've picked someone else."" I tried apologizing to her, talking about how much I respected her as a person and validating her feelings on the issue, but she didn't understand/accept the apology, saying ""You don't need to use minorities for points. You think black people get a cookie for every white person we work with?? No, not at all... You're an adult. Tighten up."" (That ""tighten up"" really pissed me off - it's not like I can just instantly learn what the right thing to say is, like a neurotypical person could - but I didn't bring that up to her, because I didn't want to create more conflict.)

2 months pass. I'm giving her space, to allow her time to process her feelings before reconnecting. This past week, I sent her a check-in text, asking how her summer went and sending her a video of my dogs. She responded by saying ""Can you not contact me unless it's work related. Thanks.""

This is an example of the most recent situation where I've been cut off/given the silent treatment. However, it's happened to me at least 5-6 times since I started undergraduate school 7 years ago, and I lost my post-undergrad job because my boss cited communication-based work conflicts I had with colleagues. I've never told anyone outside of my nuclear family about the intense social difficulties I face, because I work in communication-centric fields (like journalism and politics), and I've been worried that I wouldn't be offered work/school opportunities if people knew I was bad at interpersonal communicating. My two most recent internships ended on good terms, mainly because I was working on mostly independent projects where I didn't have to work with other people; however, I want to be a college professor in the future, so I'm going to have to be able to effectively communicate with administrators and students.

I want to know if there's effective ways adults like myself can both communicate better themselves and have the intent of their words be more primarily acknowledged by others, which would help me to not get cut off or the ""silent treatment"" again in the future. I also want to know if there's anything that can help me ""get over it"" when the cutting off happens, i.e. not dwell on it/become depressed over it (which has happened to me every time this situation has come up).

All support is welcomed, even if you're not sure of the answer yourself. :) Thanks in advance!",24Aug2020,1
483,"Hi, I am 24M with an almost 1 year old daughter. I introduced my friend “Jeff” 25M to my fiancé when we started dating 4 years ago. Jeff has always not made the best decisions financially, attempted suicide by car crash, harshly criticized by his family, and now has a child with a woman who is not a good person. Over the past few years he has done some very impulsive things like letting his buddy tattoo him with terrible looking tattoos (his friend did get better but the originals looked like a child made them if I am being honest). He also got into weed, which is no big deal, I smoked casually in high school but he slowly made comments about how he has always wanted to try coke etc. He now has done almost every drug out there. Anyways over the years over all this he has continued to get more and more distant. He will tel me we are going to hang out and never show up because he got too messed up. Every time I see him I never bring up his mistakes and never judge him hoping it will bring him back close like the good days but he continues to keep his distance. Have I done something wrong here?

486,"**IK THIS IS LONG BUT PLEASE BEAR WITH ME🙏**

Im an 18 year old girl. I do not have any suicidal thoughts, I don't hurt myself either but I feel very lost and not well mentally. I don't know what's wrong with me, I have more than I need in life and loving parents and friends and I am grateful for that but no matter how much I have and how much I keep on gaining (whether materialistic or not), I feel empty and as though I have absolutely nothing. I was a happy healthy kid until I moved to Sweden 6 years ago when I was 12 going on 13. I use to live in the Middle East but my family is open and international so most of my friends there were still international. Anyways, I think I experienced culture shock in Sweden, fell into a depression, lost 20+kg (had anorexia and I got it treated and been fully recovered for 2-3 years now). Also, Ive done horrible things, always went to extremes (but i think thats my personality). Here is a list of things I did:

-At 13, i downloaded a dating app and started talking to a 30 year old guy there and told him I wanted to have sex but have no experience. We ended up meeting up, he did not force me to anything, was very nice I literally could have said I changed my mind and went home but yes I do realize he is a pedophile now. Anyways, that happened. And it was all my decision.

-At 16, I started texting guys online who want to buy sex. Cuz it was quick easy money and I could buy all the meaningless things I want (my family is upper middle class so as you see, my decisions are very irrational). I ended up selling sex 4 times between 16 and 17 years old me so it wasnt a regular thing. None of these times was I abused or anything, they were all nice and between ages 22-30.

-At 17, I met a guy online that I wanted to sell sex to. He was 28. I went to his place, we ended up talking for hours, he was very nice and wise. We then tried having sex but it didnt work cuz i was too stiff and shy. I insisted tho on meeting him again but no money involved cuz i kinda liked his company. Met him again 6 more times just for a chat and some light foreplay but then I stopped meeting him 2 months ago and told him it was not right for us to do this.

-I use to steal money from my parents because I was too afraid to ask them for money. I stopped doing that later tho cuz they caught me. Thats when i started the sex thing (cuz it paid A LOT). Then i got a waitress side job (i still have it now).

-I dont smoke (only when drunk so once a week for the past 5 months). I take drugs but only occasionally. I have done ecstasy 3 times (so good!). LSD 3 times (also very good!) and weed once. I go to bars once a week with my friends, we get drunk, some guys approach us, meaningless sex, then back to normal life the next day.

-I never tried killing myself (except when i had anorexia). And I dont want to ever kill myself. I want to stay forever young (not possible) but as contradictory as that sounds, I love life and there are so many things I want to do.

-Ive never had a boyfriend but I regularly go on dates with guys I meet through apps. Its always tho like one date then sex then we don't meet again. And it makes me feel empty afterwards so i need to stop dating for a while I think.

-Ive been betrayed by friends in the past. Now not anymore. Its rather me who betray them. Like as soon as I feel im getting closer to someone, I take distance and that might seem rude but whatever.

-I have feelings but I cant rly show them. Ppl have told me im cold. I do show my feelings tho to my very close friends or to my parents. I feel tho that I have cried so much in my life that i currently cant get myself to cry anymore.

-I live with both my parents and I havent talked to my dad in 5 years now even tho we live together. He has done nothing wrong to me and keeps treating me with love and I dont deserve that. Idk why I dont talk to him, it started when i had anorexia. I just dont like his personality and way of being (interrupts people, talks in a very agressive way, etc.). I do see myself in him sometimes and I hate it.

-With all that love I receive from people in my life, I still dont feel like I have the love I WANT. I think I want a guy to love me romantically and not only use me for sex.

-Even if that might not be true, I think that whatever guy that approaches me only wants me for sex. Also, i am very dirty minded idk why and i hate it. I want a guy to love me for me.

-I have many hobbies (art) and Ive been called talented so its not like I do nothing with my life. I also always was amongst the best students in class.

-When I was between 10 and 12 years old. My sister who is 2 years older than me introduced me to a game she called ""spa"" that we played during bed time. Basically we fingered each other and tried to have sex. It always felt weird for me tho.

-ive probably done more horrible things but i currently cant think of anything.

Anyways, my day to day life is full of action. I work, i go out with friends often, regularly meet new people and I have my hobbies. Yet I just feel EMPTY and like there is smthg wrong with me. I dont think im normal. All my friends call me weird but that they love it. Anyways that is not the point. Just please tell me what is wrong with me.

The issue I face is the last train is at 21:00 to the area I'm looking at, while I'm more wanting to be out for longer, as these social events are important to me, (they help me a lot with dealing with depression and isolation), they tend to go on til 23:00 and others 3am (D&amp;D can get intense!) 

I've tried budgeting living closer to the events so that it's walking / taxi distance, but the inceased costs make it just too much. If i could drive it would make this a whole lot easier, but I'm medically not allowed to.

489,"Hopefully this is a suitable subreddit for this post; I considered relationship advice or personal finance but I think this subreddit is the most fitting ?


My (21F) boyfriend (21M) &amp; I have been renting a house together for close to 2 years now. We're lucky to have an excellent landlord &amp; I'd say our rent is a good price (875 CAD per month for a 2 bed, 1 bath house with a big front &amp; backyard) however, money is tight. Bf is a restuarant manager who brings in around $2200 per month; I got layed off recently &amp; getting a new job in our small town has been impossible due to the ongoing pandemic. Besides rent we have our phone bills, internet bill, and heat/power bill (which on the average month adds up to close to $500) but then of course there's the cost of groceries and our pets which really has no average.


If we lived at my parent's house, they'd want $400 a month total so we'd save around $600 per month. It'd be shared laundry &amp; kitchen at their house.


Saving the extra $600 would be great (it may seem like nothing to many but to us it's a pretty good amount of money right now) however, my mother &amp; I do not get along &amp; my father doesn't like everything about my boyfriend.


My mother &amp; I's relationship was tainted when I first started showing symptoms of my (later diagnosed) anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, &amp; OCD. She didn't believe in such mental health issues &amp; would ridicule me for it. During my panic attacks, she'd yell and tell me to get over it. She just did a lot of shouting in general. (something that really triggers my anxiety) She is still very much so the type of person who yells to get their point across or just yells whenever frustrated.


My father ridicules my boyfriend &amp; calls him a ""candy ass"" because my bf isn't the best when it comes to vehicles &amp; being a handyman.

490,"I'll keep the background as simple as possible. We were 18, met on an online video game, added each other on Facebook and we bonded. We started an LDR, visiting each other as often as we can. About a year into it, things got rather unsettling. They would get angry over the tiniest things, things that didnt even matter, they'd go off at me and would ghost me for days on end, then come back without an apology like nothing happened. 

What made it end though was them getting angry over something so juvenile that they ignored me for three weeks. What happened was I mentioned watching a play-through of a game on YouTube. The PS4 had just come out and I knew I wouldn't be getting one for a long time, so I watched someone play it instead of waiting.

Not only did they get angry about me ""spoiling the game for myself"", they got so angry over me defending why I did it, they ignored me for *three weeks*. 

I only messaged them asking them to stop ignoring me for about a week before I gave up. I realised I was in something toxic so I stopped trying to salvage it. After another two weeks, they started messaging me again so I just ignored them. I didn't want to give them the chance to make me feel bad or guilty so I decided not to return to them.

Months went by, they messaged me again, asking me what I wanted them to do with the stuff I left at their place. Didn't want to fall for that trap, so I ignored them still.

I abandoned all facets of social media so they couldn't find me, up until the point I had to have Facebook for work, but I made it with a nickname and a fake last name so they couldn't find me. I didn't add any family members or friends, didn't make any posts or upload any photos so no one could see that account and know who I was.

Its been five years, but somehow they found the account. Since they aren't a Facebook friend, any message they send doesn't pop up, so I have no clue what they've said, I only get a notification saying ""so and so is trying to contact you"". That was yesterday, and now they've found my Skype.

I am a closeted bisexual guy.

I pretended to be a girl on omegle.

It started out with me just wanting to meet someone.

No one wanted a guy, they were all straight men.

It started out with covering my cam and talking.

Then sexting.

It was quarantine, i was bored and horny.

I put on my moms bra and stuffed it.

Hiding my face, i pretended to be a girl by wearing one of her revealing shirts over the bra.

I loved it when these guys showered me with attention.

They loved me eventhough i didnt have a good body.

They made me feel special and sexy.

I pretended to act like an overly sexual woman.

Doing crazy motions and pretending i was a woman.

I tricked many straight guys and loved when they gave me validation.

They made me feel like a ""girl"" in the sense of how a guy would treat a girl.

I am in a country where homosexuality is illegal.

No guy has ever remotely treated me like these guys on omegle did.

I did it consistently for a few hours everyday for less than a week.

It was addicting and i couldnt stop thinking about the validation and love i was getting.

I stopped as it was no longer bringing me joy as men wanted to see me as a boy.

They were some straight guys who were into only my body and that made me very uncomfortable.

I stopped but did it once again a few months later. I loved the validation but i hate what i have done.

493,"This is a throwaway  just in case certain people see this.

So my fiance is bi and we've been together for 5 years now, for the last 4 months we've been planning our wedding,We are supposed to be getting married in November.

The other night she asked me out of the blue if for one night before our wedding she could have have sex with a women of her choosing, She said she already knew someone she had in mind, but all she needed was my permission, When I said to her that pretty much sounded like cheat to me, and she got frustrated and said it wouldn't be because it would be in the family, I asked her to explain and she said she had my Sister(24) in mind. I then asked her how it wouldn't be cheating and kept in the family when she needed to think of how this would affect my sister to as she is also In a relationship, My fiance said to me we would keep this between us three. I straight up told her no and left. After I left the first thing I did was call my sister warning her to if by any means my fiance suggested anything out of the sorts to her to let me know, My fiance is strong minded, In her way she would try her hardest to get what she wanted.

While away from my fiance I sat down in a park near our own and thought about things, I realised that in the past my fiance has something to say about how many people she either slept with or her short term relationships, It was always bad things to the point I would always make a joke of saying ""Are you jealous'. Which she always got mad at. She always would flirt with my sister at family gathering  and all honesty I don't think my sister cared that much because she usually  had some girlfriend of boyfriend she bought along as her date.

Last September My sister started a relationship with her now boyfriend, She always talked about how sweet and funny he was, and on the forth of July is when the family meet him, He seems like a great guy and I know for a fact my sister is very happy with him, Even when I think back to the forth I remember my fiance being very quiet when we first meet him, and after we left I asked what she thought about him and seeing my sister happy the only answer I got was ""Yea great nice guy"". I expected more considering she's meet my other two siblings and always had nice things to say about them.

To me I feel l'm starting to feel like she is super attracted to my sister or something, It makes me mad really. I know my sister would never think about sleeping with her, And I know since I warned my sister, my fiance will sometimes will want to meet up with her alone and my sister insist's on our other sister being there now to.

I'm not actually sure I want to go through with my wedding now, I feel like I've given my fiance all the love the support and everything she wants just so she can have a moment with my sister.

497,"So, me (23F) and my niece great relationship and she is open to me with anything, which I love and support.

Last weekend she came over and told me some things in confidence. 
Her father (not biological) has anger issues which he’s been dealing with for a while now. 
With everything going on pandemic wise, he’s been stuck at home jobless. 

My niece is on her vacation break, together with my younger, 8 y/o niece, so it’s most of the day just the three of them.

My younger niece probably has autism, but her parents have not yet gone to a doctor with her. 
Because it’s not been diagnosed or anything, I wont go to deep into this subject, but my niece is very emotional.

My older niece is the complete opposite, she doesn’t cry much and she has a real strong personality.

Now here’s the story.

My 11 y/o niece told me that everyday, her dad wakes her up and then leaves for a few hours to hit the gym.

By the time he comes back he expects her to have done: 

- Dishes from previous night
- Dishes from the morning
- Made breakfast for her and younger sister
- Wake younger sister up and get her ready
- Clean up the house (vacuum, taking off dust)

When he comes back, all he does is sit on his bed and be on his phone. 
Its just my two nieces there, basically, until something goes wrong.

I.E: My older niece likes to be outside so she doesn’t have to be around her dad all the time, so she went for a walk to pick up some groceries which she had to anyway. 
When she came back she put off her shoes down the stair, instead of up the stairs, and left them there.

Her dad came home, saw the shoes and lost all control and cursed at her, how irresponsible it is to leave them there because he could’ve fell.

The next day, he does it himself, so my niece told him the exact same thing he told her: I could’ve fell.

He told her to watch her steps then and stop whining to her dad.

My problem is that I don’t want this kind of behaviour around my nieces. 
My oldest one can handle it, she’s strong and will speak up.
I’m worried about the younger one.
It now has happened multiple times that they arrive at my house for the weekend, and she collapsed crying into my arms because she was so happy to be here instead of there.
She’s 8.
Her dad tells her to “cut the crap” and “stop being a cry baby” whenever she cries, after he yells at her. 

all of this infuriates me, because this isn’t everything that has been happenening.

I’m really scared one day he’ll lose full control and hit them or anything.
I want to talk with my sister (their mom) about it, but we don’t have a good connection at all.
Its my nieces that hold us together. 

I’m worried they will say i’m being too involved into their parenting and that they will cut the weekends i’ll get to see them.

I thought of breaking up with her on the spot but i knew it would only do me more harm than good at the time but here i am a year later still feeling the same pain. We took each others virginity, i didnt see myself with anyone else and ik its bad but i still dont see myself with anyone else. its so hard to let go because of all the time and efforts put into one person would just feel so wasted but im starting to get the feeling she left scars deeper than i thought. My original idea was to just have myself experience someone else just like she did but of course no one wants to have sex with someone thats taken so it really hit my self-esteem, both things actually, her cheating and me not being able to find someone else as easy as she could. But anyway it didnt go as planned and now i feel the only way ill be able to do what i wonna do is to break up with her and just get out there and start looking for new experiences. My gf says shell support me and be there for me after im done, she said she'll most likely still be very upset but still be there and that she wouldnt leave me. But even then, im not so sure i should rely on that. I really dont want to leave her but i know i owe it to myself to experience new things as she did, especially wen it was behind my back and I'd never forgive myself if i went my whole life without experiencing someone else but no one wants to do things with someone thats taken and thats y im so stuck. I always thought my gf was enough for me and i wouldnt need to look for new experiences but if just me alone wasnt enough for her, y should only her be enough for me. This whole thing has been in the back of my head for so long and i just dont know what to do and thank you if u just read it even if u didnt comment, anything helps.",24Aug2020,1

503,"
I transferred to a school closer to home. I live offcampus.

Here’s what I’ve done to try and make friends and how it resulted.

I joined an improv club and went to a meeting. It was obvious that everyone knew each other. I didn’t really participate in the activities and didn’t talk to anyone much but it was my first time. After I joined them to eat and talked a little bit and then they left and went to hang out And I didn’t go with them. I saw them on campus a few days later and each time I saw one of them neither of us said hi and just walkEd past each other. I didn’t go to any more club meetings

I play basketball almost every day in the gym in between or after classes. I see a lot of the same people but rarely talk to anyone. Sometimes I interact or chat a little bit about the game. I’ve met a few people through this When I play really well and they ask me what year I’m in and if I want to play more. One person invited me to intermural team and I said I would join but they picked up someone else at the last minute. Sometimes people say I will text you when we play but that’s never happened yet.

Sometimes I work in group projects and one time I kind of liked my group we would chat about other stuff besides the project And they would sit next to me in class. But we never became close. Usually it’s like this with groups for me, just chatting but never hanging out or anything. Not talking much to one another after projects done and never seeing each other again.

I did an acting class and while some people seem to know each other and talk each other during breaks I just went on my phone Or I got coffee. Didn’t really get to know anyone, and although I worked with a couple scene partners, We just did the assignment and didn’t meet up and didn’t get close. They were girls so maybe it was harder to make friends?

Finally I met one person playing basketball who was super friendly When he realized I was in his class, and I ended up helping him study and tutoring him basically. He gave me a ride A couple times and invited me to go to an NBA game. We ended up not going and even though we texted a few times and met up to play basketball a couple times things fell through and we stopPed talking.

I’m not in any clubs or activities, I don’t live on campus I don’t have any roommates, I go to school and leave after my classes are done. Except I actually play basketball a lot And even though I meet a lot of people playing I don’t really talk much and it hasn’t led to any friendships. Am I doing something wrong or is this just natural?",24Aug2020,1

One day I started boxing and my friends and I quickly realized that my boxing abilities were far above average. However I kept getting injured until one day I broke my scaphiod in my wrist. The doc told me I needed an operation and that it would take a while before everything healed. He told me that my wrist weren't conditiond properly and that I was punching harder than my bones could handle.

I remember my mother telling me that I had weak bones as a childand I am not sure what to do about. I ate healthy and also trained my wrist, but it still wasn't enough.

506,"So I'm a 25 year old high school drop-out who is tired of working menial, low paying jobs.
I don't want to be stacking shelves in a department store until I'm 70 only to retire on an abysmal superannuation with nothing to my name.

Up until recently I couldn't stay out of trouble. I had huge problems with drugs and I'd always let my anger get the better of me.
This year I have finally (after 10 years of constant use) got sober, bought myself a car, got my driver's license, bought a nice motorcycle, and paid off all my debt. This has got me thinking, why stop there? 

Even with my recent strides, I feel that without a decent education my life would be a complete waste. 

All my work colleagues are younger than me, and are finishing their studies at university now, which is a really depressing reminder as to how I fell off the wagon.

My childhood was for the most part dysfunctional, and my adolescence even more so. As a result I was left behind and only skimmed my way to year 9 before I dropped out. I feel like I missed out on a lot of the basic foundations from which a tertiary education would be built upon. This is a massive problem as I aspire to go to university, but as you can imagine, for someone that can barely write an essay, the every aspect of this is VERY daunting.

Are there any resources out there that I can engage with to evaluate my current skills, and see what needs work?

I'm interested (but not necessarily proficient) in numbers and mathematics - think physics, engineering, accounting, etc.

I would love to walk into my nearest university and enrol in a degree, but I feel like I would be setting my self up for a very costly failure without some form of counselling or support. I don't even know if I'd have the required skills to make it through the STAT test. 

I need a concrete plan, but have no idea of how to go about achieving (or even setting) academic goals.

Now I just feel like I'm completely broken. My mental health has just about taken its toll on me and I never really got much help as kid or teen because boys were told, for a lack of better words, our feelings don't matter. I'm having trouble holding down a job. I had a decent one but got into with my supervisor and was eventually fired. I had a somewhat good work ethic there but when a higher up doesn't like you its pretty much over at that point. My biggest problem is I have such a hard time standing of 8 hours and I seriously have no idea why that is. I've tried different shoes, stretches, etc. I've worked hard to get the things I have know and I feel like all that is going to go down the drain. At times I don't feel like a man or even an adult. I feel like a helpless child again. I don't know what to do. Both sides of my family equally suck ass so I don't have an uncle or grandpa to talk to. Actually both grandpas are dead.

508,"My cousin is 2 years younger than me. He was always comfortable with being vulgar for a child: taking off his clothes (I remember him even doing it couple of times in front of adults), touch, kiss, etc. As we grow up, he stopped doing this kind of things to me. And I just pushed it to the back of my mind, and part of me thought it can be part childhood sexual exploration. So I guess I tried to normalize it, but I know it was kind of traumatizing for me because I always knew something's not right with his behaviour, and I always felt disgusted by him and avoid being alone with him, even years after it stopped. I just wasn't exactly sure why I avoid him as I tried to erase these memories. 

Yesterday I found out that he sexually harassed my sister and my other cousin, Both are 3-4 years younger than him, and it occurred when they were in middle/ high school. which means he was in his early adulthood. (So it was about 10 years ago). 

Today, his life is an absolute chaos. He studied abroad, got kicked out of school, so he didn't graduate university. Also he's ALWAYS high, drinking, irresponsible. He was also raised in a broken home with a lot of conflict between his parents. Also, some people from the family gave themselves permission to meddle in their conflicts. So his parents weren't attentive for their children, but rather drowned in conflicts. 

I freaked out yesterday when my sister told me about the harassment. And I told her I believed her because he was that kind of person since childhood. And his vulgarity was quickly brushed off as ""humour"" by the extended family. Most children explore sexually by themselves which is normal, or with another child, which usually doesn't repeat itself because the parents are the ones to stop it by educating them on their bodies, privacy of their private parts and others', etc. 

My sister and I have the urge to tell everybody in the family about his fucked up behaviour. But on the other hand, I absolutely don't want it to end up being a macho-conflict between men in my family. Because it definitely can be, since unfortunately that's the tone my family and my whole community sat up for themselves. That's why a lot of women in my family, including me, avoid being involved in family activities in general. So part of me knows that the problem is WAY bigger than him being a sexual harasser, it's the whole family and community enabling these kinds of behaviour without bothering pointing it out as an actual problem.

So as feminist as I consider myself to be. I'm actually afraid to speak out, and I know that he himself is a victim, and I wouldn't want to crush what's left from his sad life he's not aware he's having. But also, part of me is not bothered he has such a sad life.

I don't know what to do. Should I tell the whole family? his family? him? isn't it pointless? can't I just kick him in the nuts and move on with my life without anyone knowing why I did that? 

I need your advice!

512,"Ok so....I despise the term cringe but I'm going to use it very much in this post, hopefully it's not too overwhelming.

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier I was going through a old conversation online to find something and while doing so, I stopped at some messages I sent like, a few months ago, and looking back at it is PAINFUL to me. And it's ridiculous because it's not even terrible things. I just cringe at it because it's from me.

For example I stopped at a one month old message of me to a friend wishing them ""goodnight, sweet dreams, sleep well"". Now I guess there is nothing wrong with this message or nothing to be ashamed of. But for some reasons, while I read back that message, I literally held my face in my hands and wanted to curse at myself and I kinda had a thing in my head where it went like ""*oh my god I'm so embarrassing, I'm a shame, the person I sent it to must have cringed so bad, I'm such a idiot, why am I even talking to people, I'm probably so embarrassing, I should have just said goodnight, it was too much*"". 

Or this other time where I looked back at the time where I opened up to a friend and vented about he way I felt when I was feeling down, at this time my friend helped me and it comforted me but same thing; now looking at it again made me cringe so back just thinking about the fact that I even talked about how I felt.

&amp;#x200B;

Every moves I make, every words I say, I just look at all of it even before I say any of it and just already regret it. It can literally be about anything normal, nothing important or truly embarrassing and I would still want to cry and talk about how much of a embarssment I am and how much I must make my friends cringe.

&amp;#x200B;

A few months ago I started doing YouTube videos. I was happy about them.

But then after a few months, I looked at them again and just cringed at myself so bad I privated most videos and I thought about deleting my channel and I'm still thinking of it, because even for my newest videos, I still have this ""ew why did I do that i'm such a idiot people are probably cringing"" feeling.

Last time I opened up a Instagram account where I post pictures I took of plants and flowers. I was pretty happy with it but now I want to delete the whole account because I'm ashamed. Even though it's literally.....just pictures of plants.

&amp;#x200B;

Even with my family, I can make jokes or say some things and then I just go ""*oh no why am i so unfunny and dumb i must be the most hated person here they must be so ashamed of having me as a kid that was such a bad joke that was so cringe*""

I keep hearing my friends making funny jokes, being smart, and then I just look at my flavorless jokes, my low IQ and it makes me feel like I should just cut contact with them and never talk to anybody ever again because they don't deserve to have such a embarrassing person with them.

There is only one friend out of like 15 that I don't cringe back at everything I say.

It's so bad to a point where even the thought of telling my mom I love her makes me embarassed.

And I can't stop thinking about how much people and my friends must cringe at me.",24Aug2020,1
513,"Hey, Reddit. 

Apparently, what is happening is literally making me feel powerless. My dad hired me to make a website which works great and does meet the criteria that was required. The organization paid the full price, and everything has been doing great. The problems began when he started to tell me that I need to administrate the site and that ""the money was already paid, so I'm obliged to do so"". I calmly explained to him that I charged for the development, not for the administration, and that I'm not going to administrate the official site of a (big) association for FREE. 

He told me that if I worked for some time for free, they might start to pay me, which (dumb me) accepted to do so, until today. He always demands me (screaming) to perform work for free, which I really don't feel like doing (because I'm not getting paid for it). Also, he screams at me and gets violent when I do a tiny little mistake... I told him that he shouldn't get bothered since I'm doing a favor, and that if he does not want mistakes, he should better hire someone, or at least pay me for the job (see, if I'm getting paid, I'm absolutely going to deliver quality, but why the hell would I deliver excellent quality for free? the demands are just going to grow more and more, and I'm not willing to take this anymore).

He gets mad and says that he is always providing for the house (yes, I get it... but still, that does not mean that I'm your employee, and I don't scream at you (demand you) to bring food or whatever).

I'm not really sure how to solve this shitshow, I'm already tired of it. There is always threats and shit if I don't do the work. I really just feel exhausted and absolutely disgusted every time I get an e-mail from him. I just can't handle this anymore. I was playing some chess today, and then he went to my computer and asked me ""Oh, so you care more about chess than what I sent you through e-mail?"" I calmly responded that I will post the contents of the e-mail once I was done with the match (it was a god damn 3 minute per side match), and same shit again, starts screaming and then said ""Its fine, if you don't want to do it, don't do it."" I really felt that sentence as a threat...

515,"I (M15), have recently been struggling with my mental health.
I’ve always felt like something about me was a little off, and recently, mostly due to this COVID situation, I think I know what’s wrong. I’ve always felt that I’ve had severe anxiety issues. When I was younger, I remember feeling anxious and nervous over the slightest things, and even in primary school, I would stress over things that were so trivial, like a quiz or something else. I know, that may just sound like a simple worrywart personality, but as I’ve come into year 10 of high school, I’ve noticed that these issues have progressed. Some nights I find myself unable to sleep properly, as my mind is racing over possible things that I haven’t done or situations that could result from my actions, and as a result, I’ve become really reserved and nervous all the time. I don’t even know how to describe what I feel, but I just have these thoughts in my head of what I haven’t done and things that I have done that I didn’t think I did well in, or things that aren’t even related to school. Now, this may just be a simple case of school nervousness, however with quarantine, I’ve noticed my mental health become increasingly worrisome. There are some days where I wake up so tired, not physically but just, tired. And I feel like nothing in the world is worth doing anymore. I recently took a day off of school since I felt so anxious and flat that I just didn’t want to get out of bed. I don’t want to believe that I could have anxiety or depression, since most of the stereotypes that come from these mental illnesses in my school are all “omg so edgy, they have a mental illness so they’re edgy and emo”, and I just don’t want to be grouped into such a category. I also don’t want to talk to my family about it, since it’s such a touchy subject, and everyone I know always thinks that I’m this happy, amazing person, but I know that I’m actually hiding behind a facade. Please, if anyone could help me, it would be amazing. I don’t want to live my life without knowing if I should seek help from a therapist or if I should be worried about these feelings.

516,"This is okay with most of my friends, as expressions of love/appreciation are appropriate and evenly distributed. However, with my online best friend, I’ve noticed it gets kinda ridiculous. 


Both me and him have these constant feelings of wanting to say “You’re awesome!” or “I’m really proud of you”, etc etc. We have been friends for two years and went through a lot together, purely through the internet. I know these are good signs, and it’s true that I love my friends more than anything. Me and him always seem to want to superimpose those types of phrases everywhere in our conversations. When I talk to him I feel all kinds of “My friend is awesome and I’m so proud” and I feel a very strong need to express it, leading me to overdo it with the compliments. I believe it’s a similar case with him.


Now, of course I’m fine with this, but I feel like this says something is missing. I really need a way to show appreciation even better, one that will really drive the point home that I love and appreciate my friend. IRL it’s way easier, online is a bit of a challenge. What can I do?",24Aug2020,1

Before Covid hit my country, I was pretty satisfied with the life I was living, not super happy, but things were fine - I have been battling depression and GAD for 6 years and was finally in a place where I felt stable. 

Then, sh\*t hit the fan and for a while, I was isolating at my parents house. Then, about 2 months ago, my country started opening up again and I went back to my own place. I was able to meet my friends - safely - again.

523,"Kinda weird problem but, my dad buys juice drinks, which are ready to drink straight from the carton, unlike juice drinks that need water.

We'll have a carton and share it through the family (there's 4 in the house) because it's labelled a ""family sized"" carton. But, I've noticed that sometimes I'll go to have a drink, and the juice will be... Carbonated??

About half an hour ago, I went to go have a drink from the fridge, when I realised that the carton seemed like someone have forced air into it, like someone puffed it up. I thought it was weird, but I opened it, and it made a kind of noise which a fizzy drink would make when you open it. Now, we've had this carton for about a week, and it was fine, it tasted like a normal juice drink, and is about 1/3 full (or 2/3 empty lol) at this point.

I pour it out into a cup till its half full, when I realised that it was fizzing. I saw the little fizzy bubbles rising at the side, so I naturally thought ""this is weird."" I then thought that ""oh, maybe dad put something in it to make the most of it."" I smelt the juice and it smelt like wine almost, but not as strong. (My mum has diabetes, so we don't drink alcoholic wine, only non-alcoholic wine.) I took a sip, and it matched my hypothesis; it tasted like non-alcoholic wine, but with the taste of the juice drink. I tipped it down the sink, as I told my mum and she told me to bin it, as it might be unsafe.

But that's what's so weird. Who would put non-alcoholic wine in a nearly empty juice carton??

I can't help but notice that they've been posting sensitive stuff about their family (mainly about not feeling valued) and this has caused them to become suicidal. I'm not really sure how to help them but their posts has been ongoing for a few days now and I want to help in any way.

527,"So, I just learned that my sister has been hiding the fact that she sees her ex again. He's the most toxic, stupid guy on earth who humiliated her by cheating on her twice. They were together for 5 years and when he first cheated she left, he stayed with the other girl for 2 weeks, then this girl dumped his ass so he came back to my sister. She was ready to give him a second chance (knowing that two weeks earlier he said he didn't love her anymore, that he stayed with her for pity and because she's the one providing money). 2 weeks later he cheats on her a 2nd time with the same women (the neighbour) : this time he was with her for a month. My sister finally realised that he was a dumbass and a manipulative piece of shit and that the first time he came back to her it was because he probably needed money and a girl that will do all the chores for him (he didn't do shit in the appartment). But two weeks ago he harrassed her on the phone, so I checked his facebook only to see that the neighbour dumped his ass AGAIN. And of course he thus comes back to my sister. After a day of harassing her with calls (he even sent ME a message to get to her, and I told him to leave her alone and that she was happier without him), he suddenly stopped. My mother had the intuition that my sister answered to his last call (while she said she blocked him), ans she did something I highly disapprove of : she read her journal. And that is how we learned that she not only answered him but now sees him regularily and wrote that ""she wants to believe that it will work"". To me and my other sister she said that she sees another guy for a sex-friend relationship, but know we are starting to doubt it too : I think it's a complete lie to justify the fact that she spends time outside seeing this trash of a man. But now our hands are tied : we KNOW that she is totally lying to us, hiding her relationship, while telling us how she realized that he was an asshole, that he made her depressed, that she is much happier without him. But it's all fake... and we cannot tell her we know because she will never forgive my mother for invading her privacy by reading her journal. 
And in the meantime, we cannot just do nothing while she's making the worst mistake of her life. She was finally starting to be happy again, to get her life on track : he will destroy it like he did the first time he came back then left her. And I cannot say that I don't feel betrayed, how could she lie to us? We were here to care for her when she was in million pieces and now she decides to hide the truth? I just want her to wake up, but I don't want to risk losing her for good, especially to this trash dude. He's just waiting for the opportunity to turn her against her family and have total control of her.",24Aug2020,1

I've never won at contests, but I was close. I feel like I will never achieve anything in life and I will be a street cleaner.

I'm not leader material and I'm not one of the popular kids who everybody, teachers and students, like. I didn't have friends for the first few years of middle school.

The only subject I'm good at is English (not my first language). That's the subject I will go on to university. I'm one of the best students from English in my year, but I'm not recognised. Every teacher is in awe from another student (she's very good at Chemistry). Many other students are going unnoticed because of that student. It became ridiculous. Every teacher tells us how intelligent she is, and things like that, and it's sometimes like we, the others, don't even exist. We feel like we're inferior just because of one goddamn student who happens to be good at a ""harder"" subject.

I'm getting tired of going unnoticed. If I'm just as good at a different subject as her, then why am I overlooked? Some of us stopped trying, because teachers refuse to notice us.

I've dealt with so much shit from teachers and students alike, I became tired. My mental health started to detoriate.

533,"Prepare for rambling and a question!
So long but short, in 2007-2009 I attended highschool in Tennessee in a county we won't name, county high school so as you'd expect, from all over the county. While attending I was ready to drop out as credits didn't transfer properly ( Ohio school where 21 credits to graduate to where I was where 32 were required). I changed my class schedule around to have weight lifting for gym, during this time I met the most incredible girl, granted I'd been around in high school but something about her was very different and just amazing. We hit it off and texted and chatted quite often. I dropped out and obtained my GED and went back to Ohio. Later I returned and we still frequently chatted and she was obviously into me by her conversations but I was scared and took it slowly as my feelings, although wanting her, I was scared because of how amazing I found her to be. I started to make a move, but I dragged my feet and contact dropped. Time passed and I again returned to Ohio (2010 ish) I again made contact and she was still flirty but now in a relationship, we still spoke of hanging out and even me coming down and spending a week in Gatlinburg together but then again silence stepped in and we didn't chat a few months. Next time we spoke, she was married on a whim to her once not serious boyfriend but now husband. I felt literally sick to my stomach but continued to friendly communicate. She later vanished as they then shared a Facebook. Needless to say I met someone and have been with tht person 9 years now, we have children together and live together. I am nothing but faithful and swear to a  self standard to be such. 

Occasionally my mind gets trapped in a deep state of elaboration whether about a period of time, a creative idea,  potential of the future, so on and so forth, I have tried a couple times to see how said past flame was doing, from afar of course but to no avail as if she disappeared, but two days ago I was in my deep elaborative state and was looking through old high school yearbooks and pictures from the time and seen her, and instantly was drawn back into the thoughts emotions and made many realizations that made my curiosity peak, I realized that at that time I was in love with the girl and that has made me question so many things. I opted to see if I could track her down, which I did, and found she's still with her husband and they live a fairly happy life, but I feel like I should reach out but don't know to the extent I should reach out (of course over messaging) but I feel that I'm tied up as she was the amazing thing I left dangling in the wind and was to afraid to reach for when the wind picked up in fear I would break it as at that time I was the person.  Of course I'm not going to try and leave my current long vested, hard worked for relationship, or ruin it by being ignorant, but I'm just curious to the what if and the how it could of as well as to how she's been over the years.

Question time!!! Should I attempt to reach out? To what capacity? Should I avoid temptation to communicate? Should I ever speak of this outside of this platform? Who has been here before and what did you do?

I am a very analytical person and give advice slot, but my mind won't give me advice without questioning, (ADHD). So my attempt to  process in a linear train of thought is being plagued by my omnidirectional thought process.

534,Ever since I finally called it quits with my ex I’ve been on a highly defensive mode where I didn’t let anything ruin my good moods. No matter what happened to me I stayed optimistic and hopeful and it helped me get through that initial break up stage. Now that it’s been about 5 months and schools starting up all be it online I am now starting to feel that empty lonely feeling you get when your single. I have a lot of female friends who you would think would have any interest in me but my ex keeps them all at bay because they all know how toxic she will be if I started talking to any other girl.

537,"I just found out that my classmates have a group without me inside. 

Actually we had a group assignment in the past, and they create a group chat for the assignment. I was on a different group than them at that point.

Apparently they still use that group chat until today while mine was already inactive. Which explains why i do not know anything about what they are talking about at school. I had to ask them what's happening and they told me about it. I already know about this earlier but i try not to think about it too much. I am more afraid that my other classmate that was in my group was invited to the group that i was not in with. 

We are getting along i think and I already had forgotten about it. Sometimes I would be clueless about what they are talking. It is like I was absent from school and i don't know what happen when i was absent. I refuse to accept the fact that i was just being left out. 

But today was worser. They plan to go hangout during semester break. They were chatting on their group chat without me inside. I knew it because one of them are talking about it during lunch as if they tried to hurt my feelings. 

I was thinking what was the reason of creating the group chat i was in the first place. Why would they left me out? Did I offend one of them? Why is this happening? I might not realize that i had offended them in some ways but why i was treated with this kind of treatment.

I had already bad experiences back in high school where i do not even have a friend and i was a total loner at school. Hanging out alone at library during lunch, like a total loser. Now those feelings are back again, those suicidal thoughts are back again. Here, i am getting to this new school to get a fresh start to make new friends, to hang out with them to have fun to get back what i missed in my youth days. It was fine in the first few years, but now it was different.

I do not want to find out that my other close classmates was invited in that group while i was not invited.

I do not want to have a drama with them because i will be spending another few years with them in this class.

547,"I’m currently staying with my aunt (31) and I’m growing tired of her. I’m (19f) btw. So I came to visit my aunt a week before the world was shut down due to the pandemic. I was planning to stay for a couple of weeks but obviously got stuck. She offered to pay me to sort of nanny her kids through a government funded program, which took so long to sign up for and actually didn’t end up getting payed until July although I began watching her children in may.. so that was the first huge issue I had. 

We were drinking everyday together during quarantine.. 

she’s been irritated with me because she feels I almost neglect the kids. I have problems with substance abuse and have asked her many many times to quit drinking with me because I just can’t say no. If I see everyone else drunk I have a very hard time controlling myself. I also make very impulsive decisions; many things like fighting with my boyfriend because he won’t let me drive, or saying things out of a hurt place.. for example last night I told my boyfriend that when I leave the state, he won’t have to deal with my aunt anymore) and have a hard time recovering from the amount we were drinking (splitting a fifth per night.. if not more.) I’ve recently been cutting down immensely on the amount I’ve been drinking and distancing myself from my aunt. 


she also introduced me to her best friend (21m). We started liking each other a lot and have been dating since April/may. She constantly gets mad that I want to go home or back to Cody’s house rather than hang out with her while she’s drinking or even sleeping at her house in general is too much sometimes. 


So now here’s the latest story that really got to me..


Last night my sister was in town visiting, I invited her to the river where my aunt was spending time with her new boo. We all got invited to go to his house and bbq. While we were there I ended up getting a little tipsy and wanted to go home. I couldn’t really be social and really wanted to go home as it was 10 pm and I had to get up the next morning to nanny anyway (yeah.. I’m a responsible alcoholic 😂😂). I asked my sister to come home with me and she said that she would be ready in five minutes so I went out to the car to wait for her. I ended up talking to my aunt for about 15 minutes because she was trying to get my boyfriend and I to take the kids back because she apparently was too drunk to drive so I said we would come back right after I dropped the kids off to come back and get her (because this is something she does a lot, tries to get other people to babysit her kids when she’s drunk and still wants to party.)

We were at the house for about 20 minutes to give her time to prepare herself to come home. When we got back to the house my sister was furious with me and tasha was missing. No even her boo thing knew where she had gone. We all go outside to look for her, we eventually find her and she’s refusing to come home. My aunts boo got her in the car and drove her home. While we were on our way back, my sister said that my aunt told her I had left and asked that she didn’t tell my sister that I was leaving and apparently the whole house. She also said that I wanted to go back to the house because I wanted to fuck my boyfriend. My sister said that everyone was taken aback by the fact that I would do that to my sister and they said that I was super rude for that. Now I’m starting to think that maybe she does that all of the time but I just never hear about it because she’s been turning people against me? 

Everyone that we hang out with sort of keeps their distance from me. I’m really hurt right now and I don’t know what to say or if I should bring it up at all. I have plans to leave in the coming two weeks. This obviously isn’t the first of many experiences like this that happen, it seems, almost everyday. Any advice ??",24Aug2020,1
548,"Okay so this embarrassing even though nobody will no it's me that ad its a throwaway, But..

So Since December I've been dating my amazing girlfriend and have enjoyed every moment of it. But if anything I feel like I'm embarrassing myself anytime we have sex.

And this being because she is my 4th girlfriend I've ever had and sexual partner, For me in the past and even now for me to talk to most women is extremely hard to do. I never went out when I was younger and had a one night stand or I've never been on any dating sites, and it literally been 4 years since my last relationship So definitely I feel like a teenager all over again.

My girlfriend(27f) on the other hand has had a few no strings attached/casual flings and quite a few relationships, Don't blame her really, She's absolutely stunning.

Before we started dating we were have a casual fling for 2 months and even though she seemed satisfied, These last few weeks I feel like something has changed with her and the sex is even more amazing, Amazing to the point that now I feel embarrassed enough that I wont keep up with her or finish quicker, Which throws me into a panic attack which freaks her out.

I don't know how to tell her how I feel, I feel like at some point she will grow bored of me and find someone else. Which for me will be hard to deal with because I see myself with her for a long time.

Should I embarrass myself more and tell her ?",24Aug2020,1
549,"CW: r\*pe

BACKGROUND: I have a 1yr4mo old Jack Russell named Moose. He was an angel of a puppy to train. About six months ago he started acting differently, I took him to the vet who said he was most likely going through adolescence. I scheduled to have him neutered as one of the behaviours he was exhibiting was dog-on-dog humping. The vet, his dog walker and I all think it's because he gets overly excited around other dogs, but it could be a dominance thing. The neutering didn't happen as the clinic shut due to coronavirus and it only reopened in June. At this point I went back to the vet who said by now it was a learned behaviour and it was probably pointless to neuter him as he doesn't exhibit aggression, so I decided to leave it. I consulted two other vets who agreed. I know the humping is a problem, and during his teenage phase he forgot all cues (recall, sitstay, etc), so I bought a training programme and began following it. He is getting a lot better, especially at recall and sitstaying, but whenever there are other dogs around, I can't get him to listen to me, so the humping remains an issue. It's not like it happens every single time, but maybe 2-3 dog encounters we have per week out of 12-15 (we live near three dog friendly parks) involve humping. It's uncomfortable and awkward which is why again I'm trying to train it out of him.

ISSUE: Two weeks ago my BF was walking Moose at the park near mine. It's a very small community around it, all dog owners know each other. We'd never seen this woman before. Her two small dogs were off the leash, they came to Moose who was also of the leash. Moose started playing with one of them, and soon began to try to hump it. The woman, who we'll call C, said to my BF ""You need to get him neutered. I've had pitbulls and rotweillers and if he tried to hump them they would've killed him, rightfully so."" She kept pushing like you have to neuter him etc, and my BF just sort of brushed it off and left. He didn't tell me about this encounter.

The day after I was walking Moose and bumped into this woman. She said ""Oh yeah, I remember your dog, he tried to rape mine yesterday"". I was a bit taken aback by her use of the word rape to describe something between animals. I'm a two-time rape survivor. It was a little shocking, so I awkwardly laughed. Moose was playing with her dog and once again tried to hump it. She said, ""Your dog just raped my dog, he's trying to rape my dog, you need to get him neutered. Why do you care about his balls, just get him done. We're staying away from you now."" This was all very aggressively said and she got within 6 inches of my face. Two weeks pass where I see her from afar but avoid, but this morning I was walking Moose and there wasn't anyone else around so I let him off the leash. I spotted her at the end of the park and so did Moose, and he immediately went over to her dogs. She said to a stranger sat by where she was standing ""That dog is a rapist, he's tried to rape my dog."" When Moose got to her dogs, he was sniffing and sort of bounding around trying to play, and one of her dogs was playing back, but she kicked my dog and said ""Get your rapist dog away"" and kept kicking at Moose, hard enough to have him tumble back. I ran over at this point and said, ""As someone who's been raped twice I find your use of that word very offensive. Animals don't know consent. They can not rape"" She said she didn't give a shit about what happened to me and that my dog was disgusting and that in 30 years of owning a dog she'd never seen such a ""disgusting rapist"". She said if he went near her dogs again she'd kick him and me too, and she said she'd kill him. Moose was scared of all the yelling so he ran away, and I went after him. I got him back on the lead and was extremely shaken, and when I was leaving the park I saw her by the door.

This is where I know I was wrong. I asked her what her name was, to which she replied C\*NT, and spelt it out. I said ""I know you are one, but what is your name?

Saying rape this rape that, just go"" i said this woman just attacked my dog and i and he went ""just walk away, you're cursing in front of my toddler, what is wrong with you"" and the woman yelled back ""yeah watch your mouth you're disgusting"" and at this point i was having a panic attack and ran home.

551,"Hey folks,

 I have this vision of a video game that I have thought about the last couple of years. I REALLY want to make it come to life. I am a power engineer by trade, so I have that type of problem solving mindset. My goal is to create the game on my own. I do not know how to code, or where to begin. I want the games graphics to look top down, similar to that of Stardew Valley.  
 Does anyone have any ideas of where I can begin? I don't mind taking years and making my dream game come to life! I think I really need to create this and let other people experience it! I am not doing this for the money, I am perfectly content with my lifestyle right now. I am doing it to share this game that I have in my head that I wish I could play, with the rest of the world!

 **I need to know how to:**  
1) Learn how to code the game. (What coding language should I use?)

2) Learn how to create pixel art for the sprites in the game. (What program?)

3) Learn how to create video game music to create the atmosphere that I want to convey. (Least important at the beginning for me)

4) I want to know the best way to layout the overall project, like what should I have written down as a flow chart or something like that, so that I can measure my progress and see where I am at. When goals are met, check it off, or something like that. That will ensure motivation on my end.

&amp;#x200B;

 Anyone in this field, I would really like some advice! I know it is a long hard road, but I think it will be well worth the effort in the end!

   Thanks.

558,"This is going to sound like a rant but I graduated from college in December of 2019 (about 8 months ago) with a degree in Childhood Education but while I was student teaching I realized that I did not want to be an educator. Therefore I never did my certification tests because why would I spend hundreds of dollars getting certified for a career I have no interest in, after spending $65,000 on a degree I don’t want to use. I was substitute teaching before COVID, but since then have been unemployed as all schools are shut down.. I don’t know what to do with my life. I feel like major garbage all the time and have since December. Prior to choosing teaching in college I was an art major but played around with a few other ideas and took classes in biology and psychology, business, etc to try and figure out what I liked... I felt like everyone wanted me to be a teacher so I chose it because I was good at it but I HATE IT. 
I think that to be truly happy I need a career with a creative outcome, a creative product from my hard work. I don’t know what that entails but I’m open to pretty much everything. Painting used to be a passion of mine but I feel like I have no passions that I’d like to make money in. I’m only 23 and I feel helpless, I feel so lazy because I’m not working and desperately want to work but I want to find something that I enjoy.... I don’t know what to do, I know this just sounds like a rant of me reiterating but it’s depressing. 
I’ve applied to lame jobs like office assistant, office admin, etc. but to no avail each time because I don’t have any experience in an office, the only thing I have experience in is serving and teaching. The two careers I don’t want to go back to. I’m stuck in a state of wanting to try new things but not being given the opportunity.

560,"I'm on mobile so sorry in advance for any formatting issues.

So my boyfriend and I recently moved to his parents old house. And with that house is Pumpkin. He's a sweet little orange cat who hangs around the neighborhood and as of late, has been in our backyard 24/7. We suspect that is because when we moved in, he was allowed to waltz in and sit/lay while we worked around him. We foolishly allowed him to do so because he's such a big sweetie and we didn't think it would lead to him lurking and trying to get back in. He's also fed by the entire neighborhood, us included. 
Here's the dilemma, Pumpkin has an owner. She keeps him outside all the time is seems and a few years ago she had gotten a second cat who immediately got the same sentence, outside in all weather and seemingly no care for their safety. 
If Pumpkin was a stray we would have already taken him in and made him a 100% indoor cat, but he has an owner and I have no idea how to ask her if we can have her cat. It upsets me because if my cat was no where to be found for even just one half full day I'd be panicking and looking. Today seems to be the 3rd or 4th full day and we haven't heard a peep from her. So reddit, how should we go about this?",24Aug2020,1
561,"Today I've come to the sad conclusion that I've unfortunately reached the lowest point I have ever been in my life. 
Let me give you some context as to what's going on:

- This year, I am entering my Senior Year of High School. I live in Canada, and here, the marks you earn during your Senior Year are the marks that Universities use to choose whether you are selected into their programs. Hence, if I get my act together now, I can get into Canada's most prestigious universities.
- Particularly, there is one university I specifically want to get into. It's the best one in Canada for the field that I want to get into. What's special about this university, however, is that they basically have entrance exams you need to do well in for you to get into their programs. This is another thing that I have to worry about. And if I get my act together, I can study hard for those entrance exams and do well.
- Also, I want to get good at some hobbies. And once again, if I get my shit together, I can get better at those.

Here is where the bad part comes.

Recently, I have been in a complete rut:

I've failed to get any productive studying done. I've got some done, but not nearly as much as I would have wanted.
I've been trying to quit porn since May of 2019 with little success. I've used porn to cope with feelings of stress, incompetence, and loneliness. I feel that porn has causes me further loneliness and as well as brain fog. But I've been relapsing extremely often recently (usually weekly). And whenever I relapse, I get really depressed that day and fail to do any work. Additionally, since I relapse and get lonely, I start thinking about my girlfriend who I broke up with 3ish months ago. That doesn't help either :/

And to top things off, I have no social support. Throughout my earlier years of high school, I had a WAY bigger social group that I could talk to about stuff. They could support me when I needed them. And I could talk to them about usual life stuff too. It just made life a whole lot happier. That's all gone now though. I've tried to get help from my remaining friends that I haven't lost, but they either don't care or ghost me. It just makes this thing a whole lot harder man.


I know things could get worse, but in my eyes, I've hit rock bottom. I'm not looking for pity. I'm looking for solid advice. I have this great opportunity to get everything I've ever wanted in life. But my porn addiction, a lack of self-discipline, and a lack of social support has really led me astray from my goals.

So what should I do? A better question is what would YOU do if you were in my situation?

Thank you for reading this. I genuinely appreciate it.",24Aug2020,1

To start off, I just graduated high school, I don’t feel the need to automatically start going to school again so I’m taking a year off &amp; I’ll decide if I go back after. My boyfriend and I have been dating for a little over two years now! We’ve broken up for 3 months in these two years but found our way back to one another because we truly love each other &amp; are each other’s bestest friend’s. My boyfriend starts college IN SCHOOL today, and I am so terrified he’s going to meet someone knew there (not today per say but just generally down the road when he gets comfortable in his new school with new people) I’m scared there will be a girl that looks like the stereotype of his “Dream Girl”. He’s left me once before for someone else and came back realizing it was a mistake &amp; told me this is what he for sure wants but when he did.. he BROKE me! I was so heartbroken but I still loved him SO MUCH so I took him back forgiving him of what he did but something in me stopped, stopped caring as much, I didn’t feel as much for him when we got back together, but NOW as of today, I’ve realized I’m now that vulnerable girl I was when I first fell in love with him, I was OBSESSED with him before he broke my heart and when we got back together I put up a wall and tried so hard not to let myself get so close to him again.. but I did! And now here we are once again wondering when he’s going to rip my heart out of my chest again for a girl at college 😅 I’m terrified of the simple fact he’s done this once before..for a girl he barley knew. I feel as if now that he knows he has me wrapped around his little finger again he’s going to hurt me, he doesn’t show signs he says he loves me truly and what he did in the past was in the past for good and he’s realized “I’m the one for him” but something in me won’t let my mind go to peace that he’s not going to hurt me again. So, now here I am preparing for this break up that I see coming my way again, preparing to pick myself up once I fall from this. But why? Why do I feel like I’m going to loose him again if he says he’s here for good and has told me numerous of times he made a MISTAKE and that’s all it was. I just need advice on how to put my mind at ease, or anything to make me feel better about the fact he’s going to college and he’s going to meet other people and there could be sparks flyin with those college girls, while I’m over here waiting patiently for him to get home so I can see him every night. Should I prepare for the worst? Or should I believe his words of trust and truly start thinking he won’t hurt me? I just don’t think I can afford the cost of another broken heart from this man..Pls let me know :(",24Aug2020,1
565,"Hi all.

I seem to have a problem with a thin skin. People really really can get me riled up online, esp on reddit. For example, I posted something, etc, and got attacked because I was a woman and was called a bunch of lovely things I won’t mention. Another example, I post in dating advice because my love life hasn’t been amazing and I get comments from folks who are like you can’t have dating problems, must be fat and ugly and crazy because women don’t have issues dating and not being virgins. Or I’ll get called stupid or something and it makes me so so upset, to the point it ruins my day.

566," My heart feels broken and torn in shreds. 

I am experiencing a huge swirl of emotions and can barely concentrate, my heart, my soul is all stirred up. I am in knots feeling anxiety unlike I have ever experienced before. The truth is I have been dead inside for such a long time, I can not even remember the last time I felt anything close to this. I felt numb, unresponsive, not even the sensation of touch stimulated me. I was lost in a world void of emotion and care. 

Right now, my world seems to be upside down . I can not seem to control this feeling and I feel alive again. Like a breath of fresh air has been breathed into me, like color has been introduced back into my life. 

Before now, I had given up on myself, my soul was rotting almost stagnant. My self-esteem became lost and so did my inspiration which dried up.  I was basically living day by day accepting any excuse I could come up with. Excusing it by saying “Take it day by day”. I have been denying myself accepting my own selfish desires as what I really truly want which is something I have not pictured for myself. I have not been able to make a single major decision lately,  

Recently, I watched an amazing show that motivated and inspired me to change my life, to begin some soul searching. I knew something had been wrong for so long but I could not place a finger on it. This show helped me to realize I am not looking for a safety net but a way to fly. I need to get my head out of my ass and I want to break out of this shell or rather the cage that I have created for myself.  It inspired me to move, it sparked something inside me to change the way I am living. I decided to do better concerning my health, life and mind. 

I want, no I NEED and desire growth, emotional growth, mindset growth. I am lacking in so many things and I feel like I have finally begun to feel my heart beat again. All those times that were cloudy and filled with indecision. It feels maddening,  I feel like jumping over a mountain, I feel restless, I feel angry, sad, lost, desire, despair and so many more things. I started a new routine of good eating plus I was able to exercise. I can not get this outside of my head, it is like it is playing on loop over and over again. 

It has been two weeks and I still feel the same. I feel a desire for change to better myself. I can not seem to seem to rest, eat, sleep, my mind is thinking about what I can do, what is possible to do. I feel trapped, unorganized, chaotic, like I need to move, like I no longer want to sit still and watch the world go by. I thought this is the life that I wanted, I thought my dream was unobtainable but after I accomplished it what I found out is I sacrificed my happiness to get here. 

I have decided to get counseling for myself to help me go over these feelings. 

I have no idea what is causing this or how to handle this but, I need advice. 

I feel unsatisfied, unhappy with my life, marriage, past experiences and so much more. I want to better myself but I do not think my spouse wants to. I feel as though I gave up on myself and love. 

I have a spouse who has been astounding but, the feeling of trust and security that developed from being with my spouse is fantastic but, after everything, it just is not enough. They developed into an unhealthy apathetic person with little care towards the world or anyone. Getting an emotion out of them is really difficult to do. Shutting off their emotions then placing them upon me, closing themselves off from reality while I guided them through everything. No friends, no morals or cares in the world about anyone else. Imagine a spouse with no care for themselves or for anyone else who constantly gives you an apathetic “I love you”. With no emotion or care.Among the 1000 of others problems we face, they have chosen not to get help, refusing any sort of guidance or therapy. I feel like we are not on the same level, we married out of convenience not love. We got together out of friendship not love. I spoiled them, i took care of everything because they lacked the ability to do so. I feel like doing a 1000 things but, they only play video games. It has become a toxic relationship, and they still come up with excuses from getting help. I no longer have the same feelings as I did before. I feel out of sorts. I feel lost at what is going on, what I should do, what I desire and how to change. If it effects our relationship than fine but, i need something and I do not understand what it is.",24Aug2020,1
567,"So I (14F) want to become a self taught contortionist.

Here is some background information about me.

I took gymnastics for two years at school (ages 7-8) but quit at 8 years old because of a really dumb reason (didn't like the leotard). And I managed to learn a bridge from the ground, a forward roll and a super bad middle split over there.

At the start of 2019, I started Taekwondo, which enabled me to get my middle split and forward split.

At the start of 2020, I started getting really interested in contortion/gymnastics. I stretched a lot and I managed to teach myself (in order) : Cartwheel, getting up from a backbend, backbend from standing position, chest stand, contortion chest stand (not really but the tips of my toes can touch the ground).

The only things I can't get is the handstand, elbow stand and headstand. I can do a frog stand just fine.

Also, because of the COVID-19 situation, I don't really have access to a trampoline park where I can try out some tumbling skills like front and back flips as well as access to gymnastic gyms.

Does anyone here have any idea on how I can do a handstand? I figured that I have some upper body strength since I can do a bridge but I don't have a lot.

How can I improve my upper body strength?

TL;DR : 14F wants to become a self-taught contortionist but doesn't have enough upper body strength to do handstands.",24Aug2020,1

All women working there are middle aged but few days ago this young brown haired girl started working there,  she's about 20-23 years old . Usually i come in and greet her and she is always nice to me and always ask me do i need help, I'm honestly too afraid to start flirting with her cuz I might be fooling myself that she likes me and she might be nice to me simply cuz it's her job to be .
I had birthday 2 days ago and i had to buy some party snacks so i saw this as oportunity to do something subtle .I paid my bill and as she was serving another costumer i pulled out two little bars of chocolate and said - hey , it's my birthday today and I want you  to take this candy as a small treat from me .
From what I could tell she wasn't annoyed and she smiled at me saying - oh that's nice , i wish you all the best and kinda kept smiling at me in the cutest way ever , i then  said thanks and  have a good day and left a store .
Next day i came in ,i was opening a fridge and I heard a loud hi behind me , it was her , she had a wide smile and I responded with same manner 
Big difference this time is that she actually greeted me first , usually i was always greeting her first and she would do it out of politeness , she didn't went out of her way to greet me at all .
What should I do?  i plan to initiate some small talk and eventualy ask her if she wants to go to a cup of coffee but i don't want to make her uncomfortable cuz she works there and it might come of as creepy , and also her boss might be watching her or she might be uncomfortable because of her colleagues .

570,"Back in 2019, my sister and I were renting an apartment together. Not like an apartment complex. Just a place out in the suburbs where I pay to a landlord. The house is only 5 rooms. There is the living room, kitchen, the bathroom, her room, and my room. One of the main problems with the house was that it was it had a few rats in it. We thought it would be alright and buy a few rat traps to take care of them. The rats were gone within the first 2 weeks we were there. We both paid half on the rent and utilities. I am always clean. Almost everyday of the week I would be in the house cleaning. My sister had not always been the cleanest, but she would still clean up after herself. After a while, she had went through a bad break up. I mean like full on depressed. I would always try and comfort her, but she would get defensive and lash out at me. It got to a point where she would not clean anything and eat everything. Instead of moving on, she started to act clingy toward her ex. Even to the point where she decided to work as a server at the same job he was at. After the new year, she finally let go of him. She had moved on and began enjoying life again.

In 2020, my sister decided to move out because she was afraid of COVID-19. I tried to talk her out of it, but it wasn't just about covid. It was about distancing herself from her ex. After she left, I had began to clean things up. I went to clean what was left of her room to find rats, bedbugs, and cockroaches wall over the floor.I did not know that there were rats still in the house from when we had first moved in. I decided to take care of it myself and not worry her about it anymore than what she had to. The room was done after a day or two of cleaning. Getting rid of the bedbugs and cockroaches were easy. I got them out of the house in less than a month. The hard part is the rats. Everything in the house is clean now, but rats always show up when I am not at the house. I am not at the house over night because I work graveyard shift. They eat and destroy things.

The rats in the house have been a big problem since the beginning of the year. I have a cat named Sam that I had kept inside so he could take care of them. He is a tuxedo cat. It ended up being a mess because he kept dissecting them and leaving me ""treats"" He took care many of them in the house, but they just keep coming. I decided to put him on border patrol and leave him outside while I am gone to take care of them. I set up glue traps with poison inside the house to get rid of them. The glue traps did not work most of the time because other rats would rip apart the trap and run off into the walls. It also ended up stinking bad. I realized it was going to get expensive really quick, so I bought rat traps instead. I bought 24 traps and set 4-6 in each room. I have been coming home now for about a month and have been catching 12-18 at a time. The other traps were snapped, but they were empty. 

My mother is one of those cat ladies. She has about 25 cats. I know she is crazy, but she is my mother and I love her. I borrowed 5 of them to help clear out the house. These cats are not nearly as big as Sam is, but they still can hunt. I went to work the same night that I had borrowed them. I had left food, water, and got an extra litter box for them. I was hoping for the cats including Sam to take most of them out. I came home in the morning to find that they had in fact taken out quite a few. Unfortunately, one of the cats were lost. It looked like there were bite marks all over her. My cat Sam was laying on top of her and would not get off. When I would try to touch him or her, he would hiss and start swatting at me. I sat next to him for a few hours. He finally got up and walked off in the bathroom to hide behind the water heater. I buried the cat in a shoe box. Rest in peace Jinx. It tore me up because I had let them into the house and did not realize that they were not nearly as big and strong as Sam is. Some of my traps were busted so I bought more. I took the other cats back to my mom. I could not bring Sam outside. I came in the next morning to find a huge rat caught in one of the traps. It was probably the biggest one I have seen. Its head was snapped inside the trap, but it was still alive and running around. Sam was in one of the corners growling and hissing. I went to get my vermin rifle to put it down. When I came back in, Sam was just tearing him up. Yelling really loudly and tore him to bits. 

This month Sam finally decided to calm down. He went outside and was starting to be happy again. I bought more poison and instead of using the glue traps, I used a bait holder. I came in the house from work on my lunch break to check the poison container and found the rats are too big for the bait holder, so they ended up tearing it to shreds. I also had found my poison container ripped to shreds. There was 15 in the package left after I had set up the bait holders. All of them were gone. I am now here this morning questioning myself whether I should keep fighting these rats, or just let it go and move out. Thank you.

TL,DR: My house is infested with rats. After fighting all year trying to get them out, I find myself this morning asking whether I should stay or leave.",24Aug2020,1
571,"So I've been thinking about quitting drinking and I decided yesterday I would. I have no drinking problem by any means, I just decided that it was enough.

Everytime I thought about it, it would always come back to the same excuse: I am more fun when I drink.

See the thing is, I met a lot of people at the pub. And everyone I meet thinks I am a very kind, energetic positive guy. Which does warm my heart, but I don't feel like I am that person when I'm sober. When I drink I always know what to say and can be funny. When I'm sober I feel like I'm boring as hell. 

From my 19th until my 21st I didn't drink because it triggered my anxiety. I didn't have any friends. Now I have a lot of wonderful friends and I keep meeting a lot of amazing people.

They honestly like me for me, I just wish I could feel that way as well. I don't want to have to drink to be the guy I want to be. I wanna drink to have some fun, so that means I have to regain my confidence. How do I do that?",24Aug2020,1

I literally wake up everyday and it's the first thing I think of. I worry almost 24/7 that someone I know in real life finds these pictures. There's no way for me to get them down and they'll stay on the internet forever, which makes me feel even worse. I know me worrying about it won't make the pictures disappear but I still regret it so much.

Does anyone have any advice on how to cope with this? I feel so embarassed and I'm already suffering from depression which makes everything worse.",24Aug2020,1
577,"Hi all,

I have a 13 year old cousin who just lost her mom. I haven't seen her in person for six years since we live cross country, and when I say her mom was not popular in our family is an understatement. Our family used to be very close. When my uncle got married, that closeness dissolved because nobody liked her. My cousin's mom wasn't really there for her. She was always travelling and shopping and never payed attention to my cousin, and likely spoke ill of my mother and her family to my cousin. That being said, I was close to my cousin when she was young but had to move across the country and we lost touch because of her age (and my own, I moved halfway through high school and really struggled initially). This December, her mom got very very sick. I detested the woman but the way she died... I wish that on nobody. It was a horrible, slow, painful death with a lot of ups and downs. I know my cousin was not close to her mom because of her mom's sort of neglectful behavior and there's been a lot of odd behavioral things with her. For example, she adamantly refused to see her mother when she was put in the hospital before she passed and refused to come home from a friend's house after her mother's passing. 

This is a very complicated situation. But my cousin, like me, is an only child. She has no siblings, my uncle is a trainwreck right now, and my grandmother is not what I would call a sufficient support system for the child. In the past, I have been discouraged from reaching out and being too too chummy with her, because of the poor familial dynamic with her mom (brought on by her mom). I feel like I should be there for her however. I have been an RA, a teacher, and a mentor to many students and I realize that when kids are struggling like this they often need someone to reach out, because they don't know how themselves. However, I don't even know, because advising your own situation is always harder.

I have her snapchat and her instagram. How would you reach out, if you were in my situation? Should I wait for this to blow over more, or should I let her find her own path?",24Aug2020,1

579,"So the other day I helped a coworker do some work in his area at a factory we both work. Today I receive a text from a supervisor asking detailed questions about the job. Turns out there was an incident. 
I have basically figured out how this incident probably happened and it’s because my coworker removed a part, to get one part working. Turns out that part he removed it critical. 
He also did it while I was away and I came back and he had everything operational. He set the part he removed to the side and we left.
I’m worried I’ll be written up or fired for this but I actually didn’t do it. I suppose I’m accountable since it was a team job. But he’s older and more experienced and i just thought he knew what he was doing. 
I’m not sure if I’m boss has figured out the root cause, I’m tempted to tell him my theory but I also don’t want to throw my coworker under the bus. But I also don’t want to word it in a way that seems like I did it.

580,"I'm thinking of finally seeking professional help for my mental health issues, and I have a feeling that they're going to offer me SSRIs, as my family doctor recommended them years ago when I told them about my depression/anxiety.

How have SSRIs, or therapy, affected you?

I'm somewhat nervous about taking them. I'm afraid that they're going to make me bland, and rid me of the parts of my personality that I'm fine with/enjoy.

582,"My gf lost her first bf, a complex and complicated relationship and too much to describe here, a little over a year and a half ago.  She has wrestled with the guilt of his death.  They had a thing going on where he wanted to get back together with her and she refused because of their past toxic relationship. The next day, after she refused him, he died in a car accident.  

She believes that she was the cause of this, her refusal.  Of course, I’m not sure what the cause was, but even if her refusing him contributed to a suicide in some way, that doesn’t mean she was to blame.  She was protecting herself and if he committed suicide, then he had so many problems to work through that can’t be attributed to her; if he committed suicide, then he had a lot more going on than a relationship refusal that he needed help with.  Either way, she is thinking that he committed suicide because of the timing of his death, no one being able to tell her what happened, her past experience with him, and it’s all seeming to be a fear that she’s manifesting. 

She’s being unfair to herself.  She also can’t get any definitive evidence of a suicide unless she asks her ex’s mom; the long death certificate isn’t public record in SC, where he passed away.  She also asked the mom and she hasn’t responded.  

I was thinking about contacting the police department where she has a friend and asking if they knew what happened, probably won’t work.  I was also thinking about messaging the ex’s mom, and I know it sounds strange, but telling her about the stress that this is putting my gf through saying that getting some info about what happened may help her come to peace about what happened.  I know it would be rough on the mother, but I hate to see my gf go through so much pain and suffering, thinking that she was the cause of death for someone who was important in her life.  

So, would it be too strange to message the mother and ask about what happened?  I can’t think of any other plan to be hands off and let her continue going to a therapist, which I think is important regardless of what happened.  But, I think the clarity and closure would help her.  Otherwise, it takes 50 years for a death certificate to go public, and that’s petrifying to think about that time spent suffering.  

I don’t know what to put into a TL;DR and I apologize.  Just want my gf to be happy.",24Aug2020,1
583,"They kept going out (his mom, dad, sister cousins, neice and nephew, all his aunts and uncle. He has a big family) and we would see photos through facebook. My husband got mad because he wondered why we weren’t invited. This happened 3 times in a row.

He called his mom last night to ask why we weren’t included in those hangouts. His mom assumed we were busy at work but according to my husband he told her we were free those days and were struggling to find things to do (his words). Now he said both his mom and sister feel so guilty for not inviting us. My husband told his mom they should of called us instead of assuming we had work. By the way we live 5 minutes by car from his parents. So its not like we cant meet up with them. He also thinks the photos were thrown in our faces.

Was my husband right confronting his mom? He was upset he saw everyone go out together 3 times (they posted pics on facebook) and didnt ask us.

585,"My direct senior has been hinting that I might be able to get a pay raise, or I should at least ask for it, (he's not that clear, as I said  he's hinting). 

I had the meeting with the CTO (It's a startup), about concerns, review, compensation etc. I'm a nervous person in general and this is my first job, (it's been 6 months) and I just said, ""it's fine"" when asked about the compensation. I didn't really know how to ask for more, cause idk if I should rn, as a fresher and all. 

Later I realised what my direct senior was telling me, to ask for the raise, cause my reviews are positive so probably they were prepared to give it to me.  So I talked to him today again just telling him casually that ""lol I messed up, understood what you were saying much later"" and he said ""there's no right time, you can talk whenever you want, we'll have to be the ones to ask for a raise, they won't give it to us themselves etc.""stuff like that. Pretty clearly saying that I talk about it. 

But here's the issue, I don't feel comfortable just calling up for a meeting (we're on WFH) and then saying that I misspoke the other day and I'd like a raise. Plus I don't have a great reason to ask for it I guess? Even though they did say I was picking up things quick and my performance was good. 

What do you guys think? Should I go for it rn? Or leave it and maybe talk about it a couple months  later when I get more responsibilities? (I talked about it, and that's about to happen soon)

587,"Some background: It’s me, my boyfriend, and his best friend living together. Me and BF have been together a couple years now. Friend has lived with us for about a year now. I moved in with my BF a little before his friend did, but I think it was always a plan for them to eventually live together. 

So... He’s not a bad guy or anything, gets on my nerves as much as any other roommate does to anyone. No one is perfect. But anymore it’s just general unhappiness. They both work the same shift and have the same off days, so there’s never any time where me and the BF can enjoy each other’s company alone in our own home (don’t even mean just for sex).

I can be friends with the guy, I mean I AM friends with the guy, but certain people just don’t live together well. I feel like a total bitch for wanting it to be just me and my BF again. But at this point, I can’t handle living with his friend anymore. He’s just not a compatible roommate for me. He probably has no issue living with me overall, which makes me feel like more of a bitch. 

Am I crazy for feeling like he’s not a compatible roommate for me? Am I a bitch for wanting it to be just me and the BF? How do you even go about nicely discussing this?",24Aug2020,1
588,"When I was in high school my best friend was this girl who was in all my classes. I loved talking to her, it was almost like an addiction, I felt so comfortable and happy whenever I interacted with her, I felt like I was on a pedestal like there was this unique connection I had with her that made us so compatible. Of course, she's also gorgeous and athletic and funny and she has an accent and she has issues but not enough of them to stop her from smiling at me every day. It was that smile that I still see now that fucking kills me. I really liked her smile and her laugh. I'm talking in the past tense not cause she's dead but because I never really knew just how much I liked her until, of fucking course, I messed up and let her go. 

We had hooked up a few times, she was my first kiss actually. Oh, she's also the best kisser I've met to this day, whoopty fucking doo, but I digress. I don't know what it was, whether there was some deeply rooted issue with me and my anxiety, or if, at the time, I just didn't know what I really wanted (maybe I simp-ly (haha) wasn't ready for a relationship) but I messed up. At prom, which I took her too, A friend had asked me specifically (right in front of her) if we were together. TBH, even though we never said it, I had always thought we were, and I thought asking to confirm was kind of a technicality at this point. I mean, we hooked up at every party, we held hands at school, we talked constantly, and I'm aware now that just because we did all these things does not make us together, I'm very aware of that, but at the time I was just like ""FUCK YEAH!"" (I was also a bit drunk). After that, I spent a good chunk of the night with her just asking me if that's what I wanted, and me saying yes, and her asking over and over again. I was really confused about why she kept asking, it only goes to show how well she knew me. For some reason, totally unprompted, a wave of anxiety flushed over me later that night while thinking about it. A huge fucking tidal wave. It made me claustrophobic, I felt like I couldn't breathe and I needed to escape the situation. I left that night still acting sweet towards her, but I also left a bit early. In my mind, I was doing something wrong, but I didn't know what.

The next morning she snaps me to ask if we're a thing, and me just thinking about it again got a massive rush of anxiety, so I basically said that that wasn't what I wanted, which is so fucking awful when you consider how close me and this girl were and how many times she had asked me the night before. So, she got really upset. Very mad at me. We argued alot, I tried to justify myself as best as I could, but to be honest I couldn't find a reason, just a feeling. That was 2 years ago. I had a girlfriend later that year, for like a week, because the same anxiety came back to me and I had to break it off, she didn't mind as much, I essentially blamed it on my mental health because I didn't know what else to do. We ended up hooking up again when I was a senior and, hey, guess what, that fucking feeling came back again and even though she didn't want to be my girlfriend, I just wouldn't hook up with her, I tried to physically escape the situation by saying we should go back to the party or whatever (it was just one time). 

Here's where everything gets really bad. Later in my senior year she gets a boyfriend. I think nothing of it at first, I'm just like, good for her, at this point we're just really good friends. Then, slowly, I start catching feelings right before me, and her, and the rest of my friends are about to leave for uni. Like. What the fuck is wrong with me. Why do I do this, how is my brain programmed in this emotionally destructive way? I eventually get so attached that I start to cry at night, I felt like shit all the god damn time, I would go for runs in the middle of the night to a nearby lake just to scream where there were no people. I still don't understand it to this day. I tried to confess my feelings to her, but because I'd been doing a lot of drinking, apparently I had told a bunch of people at my school about this, who of fucking course told her, but I cared way less about that then I did about what happens next. For a whole week, I write everything down that I want to say to her, not to get her back, just for my own sake, for closure. I write everything, I express myself as honestly as I can and put my heart on these pages. I finally decided to man up and try to tell her at a school party. I catch her moving between floors of the house, I look her in the eyes and say ""hey, can we talk outside for a second?"", it was just about the scariest and most difficult thing I'd ever done. This was when I had figured out that other people had told her that I still liked her or whatever because without saying anything, I saw a small nervous smile creep onto her face, as she slowly moved away from me. My heart sank. My eyes glossed over and rolled away from her with pure fucking disappointment, I turned away immediately. I said nevermind. Realizing how lethal her reaction was to me she then tried to get my attention. She's a good person. All I could udder as I walked away from her was ""nevermind"" or ""just go to the party"". I can't really remember which one but it was one of them. I went outside, sank into a chair, and drank, I had never felt so humiliated or defeated. She came to console me later and we had a bit of chat, it wasn't the one I wanted, it wasn't closure, it was just painful and embarrassing, and her eyes were full of pity. I had tried multiple times to cut her off on social media after that, but we had agreed to stay friends (I don't fucking know why I did that), and she essentially kept roped me back in. 

There are more details I could go into, but while writing this I still just have so much rage I kind of want to end the story. It's been well over a year since I tried to her my feelings, over that summer and when I went to university I thought about her every day, until I slowly thought about her less and less, until I thought about her rather infrequently. Over COVID, she reached out to me to invite me to a picnic (my best friend was attending and he's really good friends with her so he wanted me to come). I thought I was ready to see her again. I was still super confused but I thought I was ready. I wasn't. That night we got drunk, and I texted a bunch of my friends how much I fucking hated myself and how much I wish I was a different person, it was bad. Relationships are my vice, as is she. I sought online therapy which I'm currently in, directly after seeing her. It's not helping, so I look to reddit for honesty and feedback.

I have one question. Not how do I get her back, not how do I fix my emotional wreckage, I just want to know, how the fuck do I get over this person. I didn't see her for a year and then I see her once and I feel like my life is in shambles. I want to forget she's ever existed, but I need to take this battle head-on. What have you guys done to get over an ex? I just want an answer, any answer, even if it isn't the right one.

So I’m starting to wonder if my schedule is not the only reason they don’t include me. I don’t know what I should do and I can’t see anything I did wrong. This has bothered me for a few years and I thought I’ll get over it but I can’t.

My family says I’m handsome all the time but I don’t take it seriously because I’m pretty sure that happens to everyone. I’ve had some little kids from the place I volunteer at say that I’m attractive but I can’t really take it serious because they’re little kids. Some girls at my school have said I was hot but I could tell if it was a joke or not. I’ve never had a girlfriend but I’m not sure if it’s because I’m ugly, the way I act isn’t attractive, or both. Maybe because I’m quiet

My face is flat from the side and from the front it looks round. I feel like my eyes and mouth look weird. I saw someone say to take a video of themselves while eating to see how they look and it looks even worse on video. I just move weird and look ugly. The video made it worse. Whenever I look at myself in the mirror I don’t think I look that bad but for some reason on my camera I do. 

I want to just accept it but I can’t. Usually I’m good about accepting things I can’t change but I know looks are a huge factor in life. It doesn’t help that I’m asian which is the least desired race for women. The only thing I have for me is I’m tall, smart, and a hard worker. I workout frequently but I’m at a high body fat right now (probably around 20%) so I don’t think my body is something going for me right now but I’m working on it. I’m not sure if low body fat will help my face or not. I don’t really have acne. Im half Filipino so

592,"I regret it everyday and I have since the last time I did it. I even regretted after every time we did something. I hate myself for it and don’t find the way to forgive myself or ask for forgiveness to him since I love him and I don’t want him to get extremely affected by those acts. Nowadays I am still unable to show him proper affection since I feel disgusted by what I did.


Since I was really small I remember how while I was half asleep or something my sister (I have a younger brother and sister, she is older than him) she would kind of play and pull down my pyjamas and look at it or even touch it (I kinda liked it I guess so I looked for it perhaps... I was maybe 5-8. 


A couple years forward, when I was about to get into middle school or so (I was getting quite bullied at the time, which led to 4 years of strong depression through middle school, in fact this year was the one I had planned to end it) I brought it up to my brother as a game to touch each other and see who lasted the longest touching (neither of us finished and NEVER did) and he accepted. I felt bad afterwards but I did it again, maybe it was a way to get some kind of attention or love... I am not very sure why I could do such a disgusting thing. 


The game lasted almost two years, doing it maybe 10-20 times a year sometimes he would start it, I understand that by them we were both beginning to understand our bodies and how they worked but I still find sickening that I did such a thing. I never forced him to do it and no meant no.


We got caught once, naked in a bed and since then we barely did it again.


Nowadays I am still haunted by it. I have a beautiful girlfriend I love but I can’t look at her in the eyes when I think about what I did. I wish my brother the best since I want him to thrive and be loved and not to experience trauma for my actions,  but I just can’t bring myself to express him love even though he even asks me for it, maybe for a hug or for a kiss... I just can’t give them to him, even though I wish I could.

My mom ended up watching her for about 4 months while living at her own place while I was still homeless lol. I eventually moved in with her, she stopped paying rent so I was homeless again not even six months later. So mom kept my dog again because she could have dogs where she was. Eventually we ended up moving into my aunts house together and I had my dog up until March. 

My mom convinced me that separating my dog from hers would emotionally kill them. Told me how dependent they were on each other and blah blah. So at first I agreed to switching off half the time that way they could slowly get used to being apart. But she ended up convincing me to let her have her after months of arguing over it. 

Then I get a call this morning from my mom saying I need to take the dog because they got a  new puppy and their land lord says they can only have 3 dogs and not 4. 

I just signed a lease with roommates and with all of their animals we are at our max (over it actually) of the amount of animals we can have.

But i seem to get along with boys more than friends, it could be because I have a lot of brothers.

So one of my guy friends at college. I have known him for three years now. And this past friend, I started feeling things.

I couldn’t explained. We didn’t text as much as we did before, or talk even in class. 

We talked few times in class, but not as much as before. Before we would get a seat next to me, and talk my ear off. We would make comments like sexy, your hot, you look good today. He would put his arm around me, he would hug and ask me to let him hug me all the time. 

He would always sit next to me, close to me. 

Like he has no filter, he says what’s on his mind.

The thing is that this year he got a girlfriend, he still called me sexy and stuff but I knew he didn’t mean it because it’s his way of talking to girls, he got used to it.

The amount of pictures we have together is a lot. 

So I’m 20 and he’s 18 or 19. I

I guess I don’t know why I think there’s a Chance of us, when really there isn’t.

He would always take my phone and go my snapchat or take a picture of himself on my phone, and he would be sitting next to me and looking at me and teasing me and playing around with me. 


And he took my phone and he did this cute but weird way to add him self on my snapchat, and I joked around saying I will block you when I get home and he said no man come on he said laughing, he’s so cute.



The reason I haven’t acted on it, or said anything. Was because of his girlfriend. 

And because of our age difference.

What should I do? 

We’re both going to university this year, he went to a different uni, and me too.

I don’t know if it’s the never seeing him again, that’s bring these feelings. 

I don’t know what to do.

Disclaimer:

I don’t know if he’s with his girlfriend. I say this because he doesn’t post her anymore, before he would post them on dates, with friends, and just him complimenting her. Now for e past 5 or more months no post of them together.

602,"I (19M) started my first year of University this year in January. I chose to study Computer Science, because at the time I didn't really have any idea of what I wanted to go into career wise and I thought that Computer Science would 1) be a pretty safe bet because the opportunities for work are fairly broad and 2) I always had an interest in game design.

I know that alternatively I could have chosen a Game Design degree, but after some conversations with my parents, we decided that Computer Science would be safer because if I am unable to find work in the game design field, there would be more opportunities that I could utilise with my expertise that I would gain from my CS degree.

The problem is, I'm absolutely hating it. It's not that the work is too hard for me or that theres too much work. I knew that university would be hard, I wasn't expecting it to be a breeze, but the real issue is that it's hard, but I get zero enjoyment from any of it. I have friends that love to code in their free time because its something they enjoy, but I'm not like that, i dont hate coding, I just dont get any enjoyment from it. I obviously understand that no matter what degree you choose, there will be times where you dont enjoy it, but in my case it's been 8 months and I've never been so depressed because of something before.

The issue that I need advise on is, what do I do? I can't necessarily drop out, because firstly, I don't want to have wasted almost a whole year of my life, and secondly, all the money spent on this year would all be for nothing. I'm just so stuck on what to do. I would be fine with just sucking it up and powering through it, but it's a 3 year degree, plus its advised that I do my honours, but i just hate it so much that i lose all motivation to put a lot of effort into it. I've achieved relatively good marks so far because I want to make my parents proud, but I don't see me being able to continue that. If anyone has had a similar experience, please let me know what I could do. I feel stuck and I don't know where to go from here. Thank you",24Aug2020,1
603,"So I just got out of a long term relationship, but recently started talking to someone new who I am really into. We click in so many ways, we are attracted to each other, and serious about moving forward.

So anyway, over the course of us talking, I was getting really horny thinking of being with her and all that. And had no problems getting erect and such acting upon it by masturbating. And we decided that we want to meet together and move things forward.

All of a sudden, I can't get hard for shit. The date for us meeting is approaching. Porn isn't working, nothing is working. Even when I talk to her and gets sexual, I pre-cum but am not getting hard.

What's going on here? I'm petrified of meeting her and me not being able to perform. It takes so much effort to even jack off now, and I use to be able to do it many times a day.

I'm kinda concerned. And I don't know whether to bring it up or with her or not.",24Aug2020,1

606,"So almost 10 months ago I met this guy.He was 17 at the time and I was 18.So we started talking(as friends ofc) and we came to find out that we had so many things in common , we would text everyday and we really really enjoyed talking to each other.Ngl when we first started talking I only saw him as a friend cuz I didn't want a relationship at the time so I wasn't really interested in him but after 1 or 2 months I think I caught feelings .I genuinely believed that I had never liked someone more in my life and he was perfect for me.Our conversations were so diverse and he was so respectful and caring and that made me fall for him even more.BUT I started noticing that maybe what we had was more of a platonic relationship.We would flirt but I was too shy to admit that I had feelings for him and I wanted him to make the first move.I was head over heels for this guy ,I thought we were a match made in heaven like I was convinced he was ""my person"" but I saw that our relationship wasn't going anywhere so I slowly started to give up and accept the fact that he probably doesn't like me and that we should just stick to being friends.So a few months later I met this other guy(21) , I wasn't really interested in him but I thought that maybe if I talked to him it would help me take my mind off the guy I liked.Sooo at first it was very casual he was really into me and we started talking everyday and that eventually led to sexting and like meeting up to have sex.At first it was just pure attraction, I was just a girl he was sleeping w  but as the days passed by he changed , he would tell me that nobody had ever made him feel this way and he didn't wanna fall for me but he did and wanted to make our relationship work .I definitely didn't feel the same connection I felt w the other guy at first but then I started realizing that maybe I liked him.I'd think ab him all day.But our relationship was very toxic he had anger issues( he wasn't abusive or anything but he could be moody and childish sometimes) and I had commitment issues and at the same time I couldn't get the other guy off my mind.He asked me to be his gf and I said no cuz I didn't feel like I was ready and he respected my decision.We would fight almost everyday but we would still go back to each other and I felt like he truly cared ab me.So I would talk to both of them daily until one night I was talking to the first guy and he had admitted he had feelings for me.I legit got butterflies and couldn't stop smiling.But I felt like I owed the other guy an explanation.Idk if it's possible to have feelings for two ppl at the same time but i truly docare ab both of them but I thought it would be unfair  if i continued to talk to both of them so I made a decision.I chose the first guy and at the time I thought that was right decision.But now I'm not so sure, I can't get the other guy off my mind and things aren't going well w the first guy.He said smth ab how he wants an open relationship and believes in platonic sex/cuddling w his girl bsf and stuff like that which completely caught me off guard cuz I don't think I'd be comfortable w that.I still have feelings for both of them but I miss the other guy so much and idk what to do cuz I know I hurt him(he also struggles w suicidal thoughts and depression) which makes things even worse and I think I might have made the wrong decision.I want him back but I also don't wanna give up on the guy i'm talking to cuz I do think   we have smth special.I know I'm selfish but I can't figure out what to do and it's killing me inside.",24Aug2020,1

609,"Let's start at the beginning I guess.

So, my younger cousin has always been a bit more on the feminine side. There's nothing wrong with that, of course. He liked to play with barbies and baby-dolls when he was younger, and his home life has been horrible. His dad used to beat his mom, they were both on drugs, and the mom left with his younger ""sister"" (it's up for debate if my cousin's father is the father of the little girl). They're back together now and off of drugs.  
A lot of my family members (25+ ADULTS) have been snooping on my cousin's instagram, and they got me to do so while we were at a family gathering for a birthday parties (me and my younger cousins were the only ones that wore masks, but they were present). Of course I claimed that I didn't find anything, but there were comments to where he was openly saying he was bisexual. I messaged him about it last night, and he fully came out to me. Our older cousin, the one that was arrested for CP and was babysitting children, has been pestering him to ask if he was a ""faggot"". Little cousin kept saying no, and the older cousin said ""Good because your daddy would kill you if you were.""

I know my (great) uncle. And he probably would kill, or at least beat, my younger cousin. A lot of my other family members (all male) would also probably beat him, or even kill him. We live in the sticks. They're racist AND homophobic assholes. I'm scared for my younger cousin and I don't know what to do. I told him that if he ever felt unsafe to tell me and I'd drive down there to get him ASAP. I work part-time, but with it being a family emergency I'm hoping I wouldn't get fired for up and having to clock out to go get him.

I don't know if I should call CPS, or just.. Go get him now. He hasn't said he feels unsafe, but I am scared for him. I want to cry. I'm 19 and I've not even come out to my family (also bisexual) despite living over an hour away from them.

I just need advice. As of now I'm the only one that knows this. I told my mom since she's one of the only other people I could trust with this crap. She's also afraid for him. If I called CPS I wouldn't be able to show my face around them, and I'm fine with that. I just don't know if I should go ahead and call or.. Wait. But I'm scared if I wait it will be too late, and I don't have physical proof that my uncle would hurt/kill my cousin for being Bi.",24Aug2020,1
610,"I'm 22 years old, a med student, I can paint, I can play piano, I read a lot (mainly philosophy), I can program, I have a healthy social life and so on. Most people think of me as somebody highly creative or somebody who is extraordinarily smart because of all those ""interests"". 

I'm not. I'm not creative. I'm not really clever. I hate every second of doing whatever I named above. I have absolutely no fun in life. So why am I learning all this stuff and why do I put so much effort in a career? Well, because there is nothing in this world that I'm interested in anyways. So I might as well put my efforts into those efforts that society sees as the most common and useful ones.

I do not have any interest in other people. I do not have any interest in things. I do not have any interest in hobbies. Even quick pleasures that the brain is hardwired to enjoy like delicious food or sex are of almost no importance to me.

611,"All my life, I have been close with guy friends, I have also been close with girl friends.

But i seem to get along with boys more than friends, it could be because I have a lot of brothers.

So one of my guy friends at college. I have known him for three years now. And this past friend, I started feeling things.

I couldn’t explained. We didn’t text as much as we did before, or talk even in class. 

We talked few times in class, but not as much as before. Before we would get a seat next to me, and talk my ear off. We would make comments like sexy, your hot, you look good today. He would put his arm around me, he would hug and ask me to let him hug me all the time. 

He would always sit next to me, close to me. 

Like he has no filter, he says what’s on his mind.

The thing is that this year he got a girlfriend, he still called me sexy and stuff but I knew he didn’t mean it because it’s his way of talking to girls, he got used to it.

The amount of pictures we have together is a lot. 

So I’m 20 and he’s 18 or 19. I

I guess I don’t know why I think there’s a Chance of us, when really there isn’t.

He would always take my phone and go my snapchat or take a picture of himself on my phone, and he would be sitting next to me and looking at me and teasing me and playing around with me. 


And he took my phone and he did this cute but weird way to add him self on my snapchat, and I joked around saying I will block you when I get home and he said no man come on he said laughing, he’s so cute.



The reason I haven’t acted on it, or said anything. Was because of his girlfriend. 

And because of our age difference.

What should I do? 

We’re both going to university this year, he went to a different uni, and me too.

I don’t know if it’s the never seeing him again, that’s bring these feelings. 

I don’t know what to do.

Disclaimer:

I don’t know if he’s with his girlfriend. I say this because he doesn’t post her anymore, before he would post them on dates, with friends, and just him complimenting her. Now for e past 5 or more months no post of them together.

612,"So recently me and my cousin saw this show on TV called “The Loud House” which we enjoyed. We liked the premise, but it gave us an idea based on our own lives that we thought would be a much more interesting premise. However, we’re not sure if it sounds too insensitive to others despite the story being based on something true.

So basically, I’m a white dude. My mom is Dominican, but my dad is Italian. My grandma is a brown Dominican lady who speaks no English and I only speak English. I have 7 cousins on my mom’s side, but all of them are black. I would say I lived a relatively cushy life compared to my cousins, who grew up with many more struggles than me. We all grew up together and despite having a different cultural upbringing, they treated me like they would any of their non-white cousins and I treated them no differently either. They lived with less restrictions from their parents, which was the opposite of how I grew up with my dad. When I would go to their house, I’d get the same amount of freedom they did. This led to a lot of funny stories that we would want to tell. 

Most people are usually shocked/interested when they see us together, especially nowadays. I think while also telling funny stories, we can include many impactful lessons that we learned from each other. Not everyone is lucky enough to have the experience of a diverse family. However, I think “a white guy growing up with black relatives” seems a bit insensitive, but I dunno.

Any suggestions on how we might be able to improve the premise? Is the current one insensitive?",24Aug2020,1

I don’t want to explain very detailed, because it will be such a long read(I wrote it and I was like - nobody ain’t reading this shit man, so I’m rewriting rn).

People started noticing. My behaviour is sometimes even arrogant when we’re at a table and someone starts talking about business or investment opportunities and I know he or she is a fucking peasant. I’m like alrighty I’m off this meeting. It’s especially bad with acquaintances and new people I meet. I’m highly judgemental. It’s great when someone starts explaining to me something that I developed tho. I have literally zero respect for most of the people. They can’t think man. The can’t negotiate. They can’t argue. They can’t use logic. That’s why I love reddit so much, cuz at least here I can find logical and methodically thinking people who deserve respect.
But anyways, It’s also fun for me when people start giving me dating advice when they don’t even have a girlfriend or haven’t had one in years. Or financial advice when I earn more than them and obviously put my finance degree in use. 

So my question is, should I just get used to this trash people? Should I continue trying to avoid them(which I think may not be possible)? Or are they even trash, am I the trash one? Or how can I stop judging? What the hell is wrong with me? 
I just wanna live happily and greet people and like them. Rn I have to fake it like “yeye nicely done” when actually I’m thinking “oh man this chick is dumb as fuck, could have done it much easier.. damn you idiot you put this to waste and that went wrong..”.

My brother (17) has been sneaking weed pens, vapes, and apparently going to friends houses getting drunk (or coming home drunk and hiding it), as well as helping his friends selling overpriced vapes, cigarettes, etc to younger kids. He thinks he’s he’s smarter than everyone in the family and on a major (high horse) about everything. We only found this all out because he told my friend (23) who he thinks is “his friend too”. The other issue is my cousin (F20) is living with us because her family is literal trash. She is use to getting black out drunk, smoking pot, and vaping which is not allowed in our homestead. Now apparently (according to my friend) they (my cousin and brother) are planning to drink the wine in the fridge and fill it back up with water and or go for walks and do any and all smoking  they want. My brother also believes he has my father wrapped around his finger and will get him anything and everything but he doesn’t know our parents communicate. (Btw my dad is overseas so I (F25) am doing my best to help my Mom out with whatever I can) Apparently my cousin and brother have “plans” which my friend is concerned about and told me the two of them (cousin and brother) should not be trusted or alone together in the house. My brother told my friend that he said “she (my mom) won’t suspect anything because I don’t get in trouble” (when in reality he does nothing to help around the house unless is benefiting and won’t come with us to places unless it’s benefiting him). We (my mom and I) have also filled my Dad in overseas with all this info so he’s not caught off guard when he finally gets back home.

623,"I'll try to be the more concise I could be, but if you need more details I'll post them in comments.

So 3 months ago a friend, out of nothing, hit me with a very long message in which basically he gathered his oppinion, and the oppinion of 3 friends of mine more, where they said that I was an obssesive person, and some other things. Of those 4 friends, one is the closest one I have, the other is also a very good friend (the one who texted me) and the other 2 entered the group nearly 1 year ago. On the message ""they"" said that this wasnt a thing of one or two days ago, that it's from some several months ago. 

As of right now, I've talk to my closest friend (we will name him as 'A') and my very good friend (and we will name him as 'B'), but with B I've been talking since the day he wrote me the message nearly everyday and now we are better friends than before, and with A ... I talked him a week after the long message (with the advices of B) but things doesnt end up well, bc I apologize for things I have to apologize but he wanted me to apologize for things I didnt do or that werent a thing to apologize (like telling him to watch a football game in a way I use to do with everyone bc it's funny, telling them 'you have to be right here at x o clock or I'll punch a granny on the street', but obviously, if anyone tells me that cant go to my proposition, I wont punch a granny, but as of nothing, the friend that knows me since I was 4, gets annoyed bc of that joke bc he said that I was being obssesed with him and I was coercing his liberty (sic)).

I've talk to B a lot of times about this problem, he says that if he would have to write the long message that wrote me again, he wouldn't wrote not even a 10% of what he initially wrote, bc he no longer agrees with the other ones on that. With A I talked some weeks ago, and things are going good I'd say, not as good as I'd like but clearly better than before. But there are 2 more ""friends"" that are causing me many troubles, bc they are talking trash about me to my other friends. 

One thing clear here is that 3 of 4 of my friends dont have a very good communication with me, bc they told me their problems with me via B, and they wanted me to talk to them bc of problems they didnt say anything never. I found out about the problems bc B has been telling to me, bc he is in touch with the other 2 friends.

The problem I've come to talk with all of this context is that I'm on a situation in which I dont know what to do, bc another friend told me that those 2 friends tell him that I've done some shit, and for me he seemed to believe what other 2 told him. B has said everything he knows about the annoyment of those 2, and every person that hear what are the reasons bc those 2 are mad at me repeats the same: 'they are overreacting and exaggerating the things'. B has told me several times that he has said to those 2 that what they are doing aint correct, bc they are overreacting and things arent exactly how they says.

Should I ask my other friend what did those 2 told him? Am I obsessed? There is almost no probability of those 2 not telling the truth to B of bc they are mad at me, but what if my other friend knows something we (B and I) dont know? or what if those 2 have exaggerate the things and know my other friend believes I've done something that isnt true?",24Aug2020,1
624,"I've been with my 23 Y.O boyfriend for about 2 months now. (plus I've known him for 5 years) and I've recently got to learn quite a bit about his parents... His mum and Step-dad... And I need advice about their parenting. 

[I want to put a side note - My boyfriend is mildly disabled with Cebral Palsey, Autism and Dsyfraxia. These do not affect his mental abilities in anyway shape or form. He's capable to control his body, move freely, walk, talk normal etc so far it seems to just effect his speech because he makes a humming noise after ever sentence and his bones click all over his body due to the CP other than that 100% fine]
1ST)They lied about how bad his conditions was. They baby him and they always tell me how he can't do anything on his own, think for himself, that they have to do and control everything in his life. - before you ask, yes he lives with his parent and No not by choice.
2ND) they took his bank card, got it cut then had all his disability benefits, UC and other money related stuff transferred to his mums account. She refuses to let him have a bank card anymore... This was because he got scammed into giving £2000 on a dating app one day when he was 19. They also told the bank about his memory relapses (which rarely occur, it's unnoticeable) so now the bank refuses to give him another bank card to him and informs his mum. The Bank didn't ask for medical proof.
3RD) They make him do all the house work. Which isn't bad in itself like that's normal for anyone... But they're bungalow MASSIVE. I don't know the exact measurement but these people are very wealthy with a 3 acre garden with chore lists in every room bullet pointed with about 7-11 jobs for every room that he must do everyday including the lawn. Nothing wrong like I said but... They refuse to do any cleaning themselves because they're too tired after work and don't have the time. They leave it for him to do every day from 6am til 9pm. With a break round about 12pm to 4pm.
4TH)They make him pay £450 GBP + £50 Food per month as board money to live in a box room. He lives in a tiny room and that's it with maybe a wardrobe, shelfs, TV and draws. Plus his mum is a self employed cleaner which is good n all but she always doesn't do her job. She's recently kept doing do 2-3 houses that pay maybe 30-50 quid for her services and then keeps cancelling the big pay (£100 an hour or upwards) because she can't be assed to work and then lies to her husband saying they cancelled on her. Thus makes the family short for the rent. My boyfriend and the husband then have to add another £125 quid to the £500 they pay indivually. my boyfriend board money = £625. 
5TH) They steal off the poor and keep stuff to themselves. I recently donated all my excellent quality toys, clothes, make up, shoes, teddies etc to this lady his mum mentioned who was left on the streets because her husband has a side chick and chucked her and their child out with nothing, no money, no clothes but the ones on their back, no food etc. I gave them all the stuff I could including essentials and food and we brought them back to my Boyfriend's so when ready we could go to the emergency accommodation she was in (thank god!) and hand them to her. It was to my horror that I found stuff in her room used by her, in the cupboards for her grandkids to use and in her wardrobe. She took it all including extra bits I mentioned, I was heartbroken knowing she took something away from a desperate women trying to get her life back on track. We even theorised that she may have lied to me and there was no women in need to begin with.
6TH)She will do anything to rid of their children's love
She likes being the main women and the centre of attention.She's tried bribing my bfs older brother's wife in to leaving him for a big whopper of cash because she wants him to play by her rules and only care about her.Recently she has started talking behind my back despite how nice I've been and giving to them they talk shit about me and do not even reason with my mental issues like depression and social anxiety and to top it all of their talking shit about my poor nan with dementia and her hoarding issues. She uses my presence as a threat to my boyfriend that if he doesn't do as she tells him and does what she wants his life to be then she will do everything in her power to ensure that he never sees me again.
7TH) She wants to put him in a sheltered home. I had no idea what these were, I had to do some research but apparently he wouldn't be eligible to go in one because he's not over 55 with severe life changing physical or mental disabilities nor is he old and people like him who are young 25 and under usually end up in special care homes? She refuses to let him live where he wants, have his own life or independence
He's a normal human like us all. Yes his disabilities are there but they are so un-noticable! For example when he had his driving test no one knew he was disabled til they finished and read up on his files. It's near to nothing. You can't tell its there, but apparently this is what she wants because their so bad that he can't live without supervision and care. 
They're the type of people to put on an act and pretend it's worse than people think and that their good people but then behind close doors the abuse and manipulation continues. 
I'm concerned for my boyfriend's future. 
They're already punishing him this week after I was round because they didn't get what they want....Punishing. 
 he's becoming suicidal about it all and is incredibly unhappy. They say it's life skills for him for when they one day die. He's crying every night overwhelmed with them still being unhappy, lecturing him with how he has to prove himself to them, he doesn't contribute at all to the house, that he'll get kicked out if he doesn't keep with their expectation etc.

Can anybody help as to what I might be able to do?",24Aug2020,1

629,"Hey guys, just felt like sharing my covid story if it's alright, I really need to gett this off my chest. It all started in March, when I first got the virus, and it kinda detrimental to my mentality, not like I became crazy but like ..I was sitting here sick as a dog, not knowing what tomorrow would bring during those days. But you know where I live (NYC) people were dropping left and right at one point so even though I'd like to say I never got THAT bad...at a few points during the sickness I kinda wondered..how bad will it get, you know? I did not end up in a hospital (and probably would not have gone anyway as I felt that would have been a death sentence) But i don't know, not gonna say anything like I was close to death or anything. I was far from it (at least I think) but it just makes you think, how short and fragile life is like literally, here one day, gone the next, and I guess I just kind of realized..I'm not happy with my life, like I haven't been living life to the fullest. Like don't get me wrong, I have a good career, pays well, I live decent, pay my bills/rent with a decent chunk to spare every month and save up. Not saying I m rich by no means, but by that token..I just feel empty with my current line of work. Like I am not doing anything, It is unfulfilling, no mental stimulation, just go to work, do some work, go home, rinse and repeat the next day, and it just kinda hit me hard, because as said, the job treats me well, get paid well, pretty food benefits, annuity , pension, strong union etc. so..how can someone feel what I'm feeling towards a job that takes care of them so well? And I'm kind of thinking of leaving it, as crazy as that sounds..but it's kind of scary doing something like that at my age.",24Aug2020,1
630,"All my life, I have been close with guy friends, I have also been close with girl friends.

But i seem to get along with boys more than friends, it could be because I have a lot of brothers.

So one of my guy friends at college. I have known him for three years now. And this past friend, I started feeling things.

I couldn’t explained. We didn’t text as much as we did before, or talk even in class. 

We talked few times in class, but not as much as before. Before we would get a seat next to me, and talk my ear off. We would make comments like sexy, your hot, you look good today. He would put his arm around me, he would hug and ask me to let him hug me all the time. 

He would always sit next to me, close to me. 

Like he has no filter, he says what’s on his mind.

The thing is that this year he got a girlfriend, he still called me sexy and stuff but I knew he didn’t mean it because it’s his way of talking to girls, he got used to it.

The amount of pictures we have together is a lot. 

So I’m 20 and he’s 18 or 19. I

I guess I don’t know why I think there’s a Chance of us, when really there isn’t.

He would always take my phone and go my snapchat or take a picture of himself on my phone, and he would be sitting next to me and looking at me and teasing me and playing around with me. 


And he took my phone and he did this cute but weird way to add him self on my snapchat, and I joked around saying I will block you when I get home and he said no man come on he said laughing, he’s so cute.



The reason I haven’t acted on it, or said anything. Was because of his girlfriend. 

And because of our age difference.

What should I do? 

We’re both going to university this year, he went to a different uni, and me too.

I don’t know if it’s the never seeing him again, that’s bring these feelings. 

I don’t know what to do.

Disclaimer:

I don’t know if he’s with his girlfriend. I say this because he doesn’t post her anymore, before he would post them on dates, with friends, and just him complimenting her. Now for e past 5 or more months no post of them together.

All the comments say that at this point it’s not a friendship and that we should stop hanging out with them. I decided that I needed a week from talking with this friend to try and figure out what to do so I left the group chats telling them I needed a mental health break (which is true). She proceeded to get annoyed with me while on call with another friend saying “Why does OP have to do this? Why does OP have to be petty?” 
That pushed me over the edge, I’ve done so much for them (they’ve said that directly) they do nothing for me and then they call my mental health petty. I don’t want to have to deal with their behavior anymore. 

The problem is, I still care about them, I don’t want to be friends but I feel like if I stop talking to her she might hurt herself. That’s the last thing I want. But I can’t take this anymore, any advice on how to cut them off?",24Aug2020,1

How should I tackle this situation and what should I say when the results come out? How should I calm him down and make sure the outcome is peaceful?

Update: I broke up with her because mike had a threesome with me girlfriend but I’ll just call her rose and mike. Then mike told rose then rose told me a different version of the dream, she just said that it was with a different girl not her but she told her other friend that I’m close to and she told me because she thought I deserved to know and as I ever one expected I got mad I confronted her about it but she just said it’s just a dream and that he was really disgusted by it. But I’m a really jealous person and her doing all the stuff from part one made me even angrier so I told her that how I’m I supposed to know he didn’t wasn’t lying about being disgusted maybe he did want to have sex with you, which this made her angry at me so I just said that she probably want to as well and from how much she talk about him and being with him. So then she was trying to say that mike was sorry about wat he thought of and was ashamed about it. But at this point I had no trust in him so I said I didn’t believe in a single word he said anymore so I have her 2 options it’s either don’t mention a single word about him or say his name around me or leave me for him. Which she didn’t want to choose so I chose for her and decided to break up with her and she just thought I was sick of thinking I would even be doing that with her cousin by marriage and they figured this it like 2 months ago.

643,"The post is a bit all over the place hope it makes sense. 


We only had sex once on August 3rd and we used protection. On August 21st she texted me that she got a pregnancy test from a doctor and it was positive. I was very surprised because we used protection and scared. Over text I asked if she was going to get an abortion and she said no and got a bit defensive and said however involved I want to be in the baby's life Im going to have to pay child support. I started freaking out and told my close cousins about the situation and they started telling me that some things aren't adding up and that we need some information from the girl. So I texted her telling her we need to call each other and talk about this. She said yes that we can talk after she gets off work. So I waited until then and tried to call her but she didn't answer she texted me saying she was tired and was already on the phone With another friend. She said she would rather just text about it. but I said that this is too important for just text and that we should definitely call. She then told me she would call the next day. I told my cousins about this and they said it was weird that she doesn't want to talk about this immediately. The next day I did have a conversation with her and got some information from her. I asked her when she noticed her period was late and she said she noticed a ""few days"" after we hooked up. I told My cousins they said This didn't make sense most people get worried that they miss their period when it's like 4 to 6 weeks late but not just  a few days. I asked the girl how far along the doctor said she was and she said 2 to 4 weeks along. I asked if she had any other sexual partners and she said the last time was in May. I also asked her if she talked to her parents about this and she said yes and that they weren't mad and that they are on board with how she plans to deal with the situation. I told her I need some time to think about stuff and we hung up. After that I texted her that I would need some documentation proof and that I would need her parents numbers so i and my parents could talk to her and her parents. She sends me documentation proof and she does have a positive test for the 21st. But she doesn't send her parents numbers. She says that her parents don't want to talk to me and that anything I have to say can go through her first. Me and my cousins also thought this was weird how her parents know about this situation but don't want to talk to or have any contact with the boy who got their daughter pregnant. I texted and said that this situation affects all of us even our parents and that I think we should all talk. She started to get a bit defensive again saying that nothing in this situation affects me or my parents because the baby will live with her and her parents will pay for everything. Thats where I left that conversation. Me and my cousins just think this whole situation is weird and not adding up. She noticed she was missing her period only a few days after we hooked up and us using protection. her parents not wanting to talk to me or my parents at all. My cousins also think it's weird she wants no support from me and is already talking about child support. And all this in only 18 days. On the phone she also sounded a bit weird she was very not shocked about the situation she didn't sound worried about anything she was just giving off a weird tone.

I tried smoking weed to help numb the pain, now I can’t even smoke anymore cause i smoked so much to the point I start to get anxiety and so in my head so I stopped smoking weed not to mention the munchies would be so out of control. 

Food has always been a healthy way to numb the pain. But now I see my thighs are getting bigger, new health problems according, and overall I honestly think I’m starting to fall into this weird funk.

We were together for five years. He was spiraling down an addiction and depression and I just didn't realize. I couldn't make it better. He became obsessive and controlling. He was manipulative and aggressive. He threatened to kill me and all. So I left. 

I asked for an RO and got one. We never spoke after.

Now with the pandemic it was I who missed him. I felt like I needed to see him and talk to him. To get closure or whatever, I have no idea. I just knew that I needed to. 

I hit a wall because apparently he also blocked me everywhere.

I sent him a sms. he answered. We talked.

And it felt like everything made sense again.

Granted, we only talked once, we did so for hours. He actually came over and we spent hours going through a lot of the shit that happened. And I got to tell him everything because I wasn't scared of him anymore. And he acknowledged everything too. 

We ended up on good terms and left the possibility for another meeting. 

I'm just scared that I know where it may lead. But I want to believe this can be a good thing? Would it be really bad to do this? What if he changed? I know I changed a shit ton.

656,"I'm gonna start with some background so you could understand the story a little better. Throughout my years of middle school I was bullied, tormented, and humiliated by others because I didn't fit the social standards. I was essentially an outcast. During my first year (6th grade) there was a girl that pretended to like me, which I fell for, and then humiliated me in front on my entire grade. For the 2 years after that I became known as that kid who got rejected in front of the entire school. That left me with some trust issues.

Going into highschool, I felt normal, like I finally fit in. There were a few people from my old school that came to my new school, we didn't know each other back in middle school but we became good friends. There was another kid from my old school that came as well. He was kind of annoying, but we slowly became friends too. He had a sister, she was a year older than me, she was entering her sophomore year as I was entering my freshman year. At first I just saw her as a friend's sister, and nothing more. A month or so goes by after the new school year started. Everything is good and normal. My friends were talking about Instagram when one of them brings up my Instagram page. At the time I was no where near where I am now (36k). I only had around 1.7k, which to my friends was alot. Me and my friend's sister spoke a few times before that, but when she found out about my page, we started to talk more. She followed me and I followed her back. For the record she was private, and I was public. A few weeks pass and I suddenly develop feelings for her. She was so nice and kind to me, she made me truly happy, which is something very few people can do. A few times a week my friend, his sister, and our group of friends went out after school. She always walked next to me and we'd sit next to each other. We took the same way home so I saw her very often. 

After Christmas break another friend that was in our group asked me if I liked her. I said no, only in a platonic way. I said this to avoid people finding out I had a crush on her. He told me that she did things with ""bad"" guys. I pushed it off, but then I noticed that she was hanging out with the kids in the school who were known to not have a good reputation. Me being extremely immature I slowly became distant from her because I didn't want to repeat what happened in middle school. I didn't want to go through someone betraying me again. I didn't even ask her if the rumours were true. I suddenly questioned myself if I trusted her. I unfollowed her at the end of my freshman year and we haven't spoke since.

Flash forward over a year later. August 22nd 2020 to be exact. I had a dream where I spoke to her. It was extremely random because I didn't even think about her for a long time. When I woke up, I checked her page, and to my surprise she was still following me, plus she was active. It's not like she abandoned her account. 

Feelings started rushing back to me. And now I'm here in present time typing this because I feel guilty over indirectly ending my friendship with her over a rumour. I don't know what to do. I want to reach back out to her but I'm scared, scared that she might see me differently.",24Aug2020,1
657,"A close friend attempted to take a photo of my thigh, while I was wearing tights, with the flash on. She turned her phone away because I turned round to speak to her, but I saw the flash go off and the phone being pointed at my thigh. I don’t know if she took photos before that without the flash. I have ignored her since, I never want to speak to her again. I don’t know if I can report it to my college as I have no evidence. What should I do?",24Aug2020,1

659,"This is a Throway account. So I come from somewhere where there isnt a lot of active covid cases at the moment, but I try to take all the precautions I can. A lot of people where I live don't take this seriously though.

I do freelance video work and recently got offered to fly with some of my clients somewhere, and then carpool from there to a different city, then drive back. All in all the driving would be about 12 hours.

Anyways it happened very quickly, in the meeting and at first I wasnt sure they wanted to carpool.

Then once I realized that was the plan, I asked politely if they would be willing to get a covid test before the trip (but now I realize the results probably wouldnt have been back in time for the trip), and one of them was very rude, saying, ""not a fucking chance, if you are worried, just wear a mask in the truck like we would on the plane"" and another saying they didnt think it's necessary since theres not a lot of cases
 That alone is a red flag. I do have a previous business relationship with these guys but I don't like that attitude.

Anyways, I should have just said I wasnt comfortable with it right then and there, but honestly i have anxiety issues that play into indecisiveness, so I waited.

Not sure if theyve bought the plane tickets yet (which would be about $200 for 3 people including me)

I've decided I'm not going, and I know theyll be mad, which I dont care. But the thing is, im not sure how to tell them. The trip would be in 2 days. I could just be upfront and say, look I've changed my mind and I'm not comfortable with this.

Or I guess I could just say I have a sore throat or something tomorrow and dont think I'll be better by the scheduled trip or something. But if they havent bought the tickets, I dont want to cause them more harm and not be able to refund the tickets (depending which airline they went with).

Anyways, what would you guys suggest doing? For your information usually I try to be as honest as possible. But as I said before, I have anxiety issues that make this type of confrontation very uncomfortable for me. I know I should probably get used to it considering it's my job though",24Aug2020,1

My brother abused me from 7 until I ran away to a college 12 hours away but the repressed memories of his abuse bubbled up while away and when I came home from summer I was about to tell and when he knew that and I denied to let him touch me he said “I’ll punch your teeth out if you say a word” (he’s 6’5”) but when I told my dad he “kicked” my brother out to live with my grandmother and that’s the moment my aunt started. Two days after she said to my dad in front of me “we need to stand together as a family in HIS time of need”.  Even more recently she said to me “you should’ve kept it to yourself”
So holidays I never got my aunt or grandma only my parents, she wouldn’t even call. And whenever my parents went to visit their son and his spawn my aunt and Satan (as I call my brother) and they’d bad mouth me. So now my grandmother died and before she did my brother set himself and his family in there as “caregivers” (he took any narcotics prescribed and would put her in homes just long enough that they wouldn’t tip into any of her money cause he wanted that will). When she died he expected to be given third house.
My aunt is buying them things hands over feet but now she’s giving them 50k and when my dad said “what about your niece” and she just goes “she doesn’t need it the way he does” 
I don’t even know what to do, do I write her a letter and ask her what I did to make her hate me? Wish she falls down the stairs? I’m just lost....
Even my mom I have an issue cause the only therapy she spent the entire time excusing my brother and anytime she’d visit him (he was 35 living with my aunt not working or having graduated even community college) my mother would come down and say to me “it’s YOUR fault your brother is depressed”",24Aug2020,1

But, even though I have made it clear on mutiple occasions that I dont want to be with her she continuously tries to come onto me. The latest and worst time being on a night out, when I got really drunk (with a group of our friends not just her) and she took me into the bathroom and proceded to snog and feel me up. I remember this happening but I was deffinitely too drunk at the time to fully acknowledge what was going on. (I may have led her on?) According to my other friend she was not as drunk as me, so I feel as though she may have been taking advantage of the state I was in but I can't be sure she wasnt also out of it. Either way now I dont feel comfortable getting drunk around her and she's in my group of friends so I just dont really know what to do. I don't want to cause a scene or anything/create a rift in our friendship group. She's a good friend most of the time but I'm not sure I can get past this? Should I try to give her another chance or was this a step to far? Or was this just my error in judgement and me getting too drunk?

665,"I have a 12 year old son and 5 year old daughter. My son is autistic and has ADHD, he's diagnosed and medicated, suffice to say he has some issues processing certain things. He usually lives with his dad, specifically because he used to be violent towards his little sister, who then was a baby. He's been spending more time with me recently due to the lockdown and his dad being a key worker, and... yeah. I heard him whispering which he only ever does when he's up to no good, so I go to investigate and he has the 5 year old's legs spread, directly and intentionally touching her genitals through her clothing.   


She seems fine but does't want to tell me what he was whispering, he's freaking out and denying everything.   


Also to head off the concerns about grooming and him getting sexual with her - he saw two adults touching in that way in public when he was 6, and had issues for a while copying it with other kids his own age. He's recently discovered porn thanks to a kid at secondary school, which I assume is what's prompted this most recent incident. All that to say, I'm fairly confident there's no sinister reasons behind his most recent behaviour, though it's something I'll be mentioning to his support team, namely his therapist, regardless. My biggest concern rn is what I do specifically in regards to safeguarding my daughter, especially considering we've had CPS involved before specifically because of his threatening and sexual behaviour. He's 12 and I don't want to sound like I'm vilifying him, but I also don't want to get in legal trouble regarding my daughter's custody or anything like that. Not to mention, obviously, I don't want any harm to come to either of them. My son isn't acting maliciously, but he doesn't understand the potential harm he can do and I'm not convinced anything will change that.

668,"**TL/DR: The only company in the past year to offer me a job has a history of favoring white employees. I have worked with them in the past. As a white woman, should I take a new job with them, or refuse to work at the company and continue to be unemployed?**

I've been unemployed for almost a year now. The fact that my field is basically nonexistent right now due to the pandemic cutting employees/shutting down companies as a whole makes it even harder to find anything relevant to my degree or career. I only received one job offer this entire year, in March, which was then taken back when their offices closed the next day but I was told to get back to them later if I was still interested.

Within the time that their offices were closed, the Black Lives Matter movement made national headlines and the company posted something on social media. Many employees took to the comments, writing about how the company never respected their employees of color, how corporate always talks about promoting-within but it is usually only for white employees, despite there being very few white employees in the retail positions (which is true, I was usually either the only white employee or one of two, maximum, over my time of working there). The corporate office, on the other hand, was predominantly white women. For the longest time I promoted how much I appreciated working for a company that focused so much on empowering women. I realize now that it was just white feminism and that their version of feminism was not inclusive to all.

Thinking about my time at the company, I realized how many times white privilege affected me. If I made a mistake, or if I missed a shift (there was one time that I called off less than two hours prior because I got tickets to a show that were nearly impossible to find), it would be forgotten by the next week while others were fired over these same actions. My schedule changed every few weeks due to classes, internships, and other commitments outside of school, and it was always accommodated while others in my same role had to miss family commitments because their schedule ""couldn't"" be changed. I knew that I was frequently skating on thin ice so I didn't want to rock the boat any more than I was, but it was an ongoing joke within the location that I could do anything and I wouldn't be fired over it. At first, I thought that I was just my manager's favorite -- managers always have favorites -- but one time an employee in a higher position than me (and one I was very close to and trusted) mentioned that if I wasn't white, I likely would have been fired a long time ago. That moment has always stuck with me, especially when I applied to go back to their retail position and I was offered a corporate spot instead.

On the other hand, this is the only company that has offered me a job in the past year. As of September, it will officially be a year of being unemployed. I feel so conflicted. I actively know that I will be working for a company who does not treat their employees equally, and yet I have done nothing about it, and I don't know what I *would* be able to do about it. It makes me so sick that at the time I recognized the favoritism but didn't put the pieces together even when it was flat-out said to me. I feel like I was previously in a position where I could have done something and now I would be at a lower position in this new office, a place where no one would listen to me if I said anything. 

I think my main question is, after these considerations, should I go back to the company if they offer me a position?",24Aug2020,1

I suggested to him to get help from a psychologist but then he said he doesn’t believe in any of that stuff ,

And the worst part is, it was a shitty relationship all around. She was incredibly abusive to me, constantly taking shots at me to bring my self esteem down. And this incredible loneliness I feel has caused me to make some very, very stupid decisions, including engaging in high risk sexual behavior, such as unprotected sex, and losing money paying for it.

675,"Hello,


So I recently moved into University for my first year (and what a year to do that lol). I need some advice about life, and I figured y'all would be good to ask.


So a bit of pretext: I am a straight white 18 year old male who has never had a girlfriend but has been on a date (she asked me out). I was too insecure to ever really try and date earlier on, but I'm a lot more confident now and have worked through some issues, but know I'm kinda stuck cause I have no experience dating people at all and idk how to proceed. I have never had trouble being friends with girls or anything, a lot of my close friends are girls, but idk how to actually go about dating/flirting/any of that stuff. My parents aren't any help here cause a) they're separated and b) my dad is hardcore into like the red pill, guys should be alpha asshole thing, which just isn't who I am (he advised that I should date two women at once in college because ""that's the college culture"", just to give you an idea of the quality of advice I got. I do try not to be an asshole and I'm not going to follow through with his suggestion). 

Anyways, I don't really know who to turn to. I just have no idea what I'm doing. I guess my question is, what should I know before getting into the college dating pool? My current understanding of how relationships should work is that you hang out with someone for a while and if you seem to like them as more than friends, you say like, ""hey, I like you, and I'd love to ask you out on a proper date. Wanna get coffee sometime?"", or something like that. If she says yes, great, if not oh well, I can still be friends with her.

Is that like the correct framework for approaching things? I hear a lot of conflicting stuff like ""ohh nice guys finish last"" but that doesn't really seem to match with reality, I have friends who date non-assholes all the time. And like I said, my dad is hard into the red pill stuff so I don't exactly get good advice at home. My mom's advice is better, but a bit antiquated. I just need some help on this front.

676,"I’m 24. Almost 25. I’ve rented my one bed room apartment for about a year and a half. The rent is $1,173. I live in NJ so the rent is always expensive here. 

I’ve been looking online at some mobile homes to purchase. I love the thought of actually putting money towards something that I will eventually own. I did the math and with the 20% down payment, the apartment cost and mobile home monthly cost are about the same. 

Housing in NJ is expensive and I can’t justify spending 250k on a condo or townhouse when I can get a 75k or less on a mobile home. 

It seems perfect right? Well... kind of. 

My issue with the mobile homes is the resale sucks. I am not sure how long it generally takes to sell a mobile home but it takes awhile. In addition to this, you can lose money easily when you sell it. You could buy it for 75k and have to take under that when you sell it.

Now I don’t plan on moving this year. Or even next year. But I hate throwing money out the door on an apartment that I’ll never own when I can own a mobile home.

What do you guys think I should do? Stay in the apartment and save up for a condo/townhouse? Save up for the down payment on a mobile home? 

At my current job pay rate (which changes quite often because my companies gives me a raise every six months and I’m being promoted at the end of the year which is an additional 10%) I can save about $10,000 a year.",24Aug2020,1

679,"I am not sure if this is the right place. My bf is middle eastern and when I call him a weird operator picks up. There is a lot of static and it sounds like it’s from a WW2 era. The operator sounds menacing and has a weird authoritative voice. It’s pre-recorded. 

This has happened 3 times in the span of 2 years. Every time it happens I try to run and get my iPad to record it but I have been very unlucky.

There are 2 versions of the operator. The first version will say the phone is disconnected and # does not exist. However, it will give a # that does not belong to my bf. It reminds me of an old movie from a WW2 era 

The second version is creepier. When I listen to it I feel like I am in trouble even though I have not done anything wrong. I also don’t remember the 2nd version because it freaks me out too much. It sounds like an FBI voice from one of those movies.",24Aug2020,1
680,"My mom and her boyfriend have been dating for a couple months now and they have been very happy together, and he seems very generous; he mows her lawn, he pays for their dinners, and in general he’s a soft spoken but nice man. However, in my opinion, he seems a little too generous.

Although they have been dating for a couple months, her boyfriend wants to pay for EVERYTHING for the family. For example, on fourth of July (after just starting to date), he paid $300 in fireworks for our annual firework tradition. Naturally, I shit bricks because our family isn’t the richest family in the world; my mom lives in a small town and works two jobs to support my sister. (My brother and I moved out a few months ago and we support ourselves) Recently, he paid $300 of clothing for my sister when going on a recent trip to Chicago, which was eye opening to me. My sister doesn’t see a problem with it, neither does my brother.

Yesterday though, I went grocery shopping with my mom and her boyfriend because my girlfriend was at her parents’ house for the weekend, and I wanted to spend more time with them. When paying for my groceries, he offered to pay, which I politely declined. I put in my debit card before he put in his credit card. This made me uncomfortable because I have the internal philosophy that if I receive help in any kind when living on my own, I shouldn’t be living on my own in the first place. I feel insulted when someone tries to offer help and they aren’t confident that I won’t survive on my own. In other words, I’m very independent and I was raised under the notion that money isn’t a thing to be fucked with, since I was raised in a lower middle class household, and with divorced parents.

When putting away my groceries into the trunk of my car, he offered to help. I politely declined again, because I feel guilty when people help me. But, I just accepted because he’s just putting groceries into my car with me. Whenever we got to my car, he slipped cash into my pocket and told me not to tell my mom and he wanted to help out. I got into my car, and I realized he gave me $500.

To provide more context, he works a very high paying job (though I won’t say what to keep everyone in this story anonymous), and he lives a modest lifestyle, so he earns more than he pays for his payments. 

My financial situation is stable, and my girlfriend earn a net $2000/month from our jobs. We don’t need money, and we are fine. 

I am very conflicted in this situation, and I resorted to family members, and friends for their advice and I got a range of responses. My brother and sister told me
to just spend it, my grandma told me to tell my mom, my girlfriend + her parents told me to just keep it / spend it but be cautious of what he does, and my older coworker told me to give back the money.

I want to give back the money, but I’m aware that he absolutely will not take it back. If I do end up giving back the money, how will I give it back in a way that isn’t direct?

I plan to tell my mom, but how do I do it that doesn’t cause a rift between her boyfriend and her?

If I end up keeping and spending the money, how can I prevent this sort of thing from happening again? I’m just gonna use it for PC upgrades if I end up keeping it.",24Aug2020,1
681,"Hi everyone 

I’m 29 years old and a female. My two best friends are guys who are 27 and 28.

I was studying for a degree in psychology and has to drop out two years ago because of bad mental health. 

I ended up working at a gas station to pay my bills. I had zero friends as during my bad mental health time we hadn’t kept in touch. 

I met these two guys as they both worked there too and got on really well. We hung out outside of work and became really close. One of them is autistic. 

Neither of them drive so I would often be the one driving everyone around and dropping one of them of at their girlfriends all the time. 

Recently I’ve been feeling like my life is a mess. I either want to get back to studying psychology or get a better job somewhere else but every time I bring this up with these guys they act like I’m being uptight. 

If I say I don’t want to work there anymore as I feel worthless and want to do something better they’ll tell me I’m being judgey and give me these quotes about how happiness isn’t about your work or getting money but how you spend your time and all this stuff. 

They just seem like they don’t want me to go any further and stay working where they are. 

This is gonna sound mean but even being around them makes me feel like a failure. When I’m around them I just feel like I am not working hard. They like to do stuff that I enjoyed in high school, playing video games, eating fast food and just driving around having fun which is what I get but sometimes I want to do something a bit more grown up and actually feel like I’m going somewhere. 

I feel like such an idiot when I’m with them and as if I can do more and if I ever talk about this they try and humble me into being grateful and not to be so stuck up and yes, I get that but I do want to be richer, buy a nicer place a nicer car and go on holidays and just stop acting like a child who wants to do something fun

They don’t drive and don’t have any intention of doing it, they just don’t have any goals or motivations and it’s really bringing me down as I can’t be like that. But I understand that they have been there for me when I have no one else. They’re nice guys and we do have fun. But i feel being around them just makes me feel so bad. And I don’t know what to do cos I don’t want to hurt their feelings if I just cut them off. But there doesn’t seem to be a way of doing that as they’re always there and constantly texting me to hang out and do stuff.

683," I have this great, amazing friend of three years who used to also be my caregiver. Doris is my adopted auntie and the epitome of unconditional love. Over the past three years we spent 20 hrs a week together talking, cooking, going on adventures, everything you can imagine. Doris comes from India and has two adult daughters and 6 grandkids--each daughter has 3. One lives in the same town, the other in California.  


Recently Doris' SIL got transferred to North Carolina. She and her husband were told to pack up and move along with their family. Doris did not want to go, but she had no say in the matter. She started having panic attacks and got depressed. Being early 60's she was worried about finding a job. She is a special ed TA and the district in NC is on a hiring freeze. The TA job she had up here pays significantly more plus she enjoyed the caregiver job a great deal. Her husband is quite a bit older and used to take care of financial matters, until his memory started slipping. Doris had to take over and needed help navigating through many things. She relied on me for advice on technology--computers, phones, Facebook, etc. How to list stuff for sale/find movers/banking issues. She had always struggled in school, and tended to be gullible/easily manipulated. She also shared everything that went on in school. I helped her with lesson planning and writing reports.  


Since her move Doris and I have been in touch weekly. She and hubby are living in a tiny apartment above the garage in the kids' house. Rent is free for right now. No job leads whatsoever. Money is tight and will run out by November. This place does not have a living room, just a tiny kitchen where the windows don't open and there is no exhaust fan. Two tiny bedrooms. Doris has to cook outside on a hot plate. She is having lots of trouble constantly climbing stairs due to knee arthritis. Her husband has always yelled a lot and is now even more stressed living in a ""shoebox"" He no longer drives. She cannot navigate the new city--everything is nearly 20 miles apart and traffic is terrible. The grandkids have had European au pairs the past 3 years. When the latest one went home, I assumed they weren't getting another one, and would have Doris help with grandkids as a part time job. Surprise! Another live-in nanny arrived all the way from Chicago.  


Last week Doris called saying she had decided to return and even had an apartment picked out. School starts on the 28th and she was supposed to attend some training She planned to stay with me for the first few days. She was supposed to update me once she was on her way.  


This Thursday she called me in a panic, incoherent and crying. I had never seen her in such a state. Her speech was so jumbled, it sounded like a manic episode. She had just spoken with my social worker who offered her a substantial raise for helping me. Doris said the kids were forcing her to stay, and at the same time not letting her work or giving her any financial support besides the free rent. I was not sure if they had taken her car keys, or if she was locked in the apartment. She was unharmed physically but shaken to the core and extremely upset. Now Doris isn't normally a drama queen, but does lie under pressure. I am worried about her. If she felt guilty about disappointing me, why make up outrageous stories about her husband, the nanny and the cats all being sick simultaneously? If she's manic, then she can't tell reality from fantasy. I have no idea what to think and I feel bad that I can't offer more help.",24Aug2020,1
684,"So... maybe the 'again' isnt really in place here. So a bit about myself. Im (22m) a social confident and easy talker. I dont have huge problems starting a conversation or keep it going or something. However i never had the guts to ask girls out, or I 'friendzone' them myself (in the way that I see them as friends and cant imagine them being more). So my coping was Tinder... even tho i personly hate it. It gave me the confidence to be 'flirty' etc. I met someone there, had a relationship for a year, and now am single for over a year again. I really would like to go on dates etc. Again. But, were do I start? Were do I 'meet' girls (so to speak)?

When I go out im always just chatting with friends. On my study I somehow dont find everybody intresting that way and well tinder was a one time thing (tried it again 2 times, but only 1 not great date came out of it)... any help?",24Aug2020,1
686,"uh this girl and I had a long history together. we were together for about a year and 4 months when i broke up i wasnt thinking much of it, and she was hearthbroken. I've been chatting with this other girl i'll call her girl2. So we were chatting and I was thinking this is great like nothing can be better, also she found a boyfriend so still i didint think much of it, she had a couple of boyfriends, i didnt hook up with girl2 we were far away from eachother, now me and my ex started chatting like we wanted to stay friends, i asked her to hang out. She agreed then we hook up that day. So already im begining to love her again, we go home she goes to her cousins. 

That day she hooked up with my best friend who ive known for years. Ive fealt dead i didnt know what to do. i was angry so i did this..
I said if you dont brake up with that guy ill send your nudes to your sister, which would have been the end for her but I was bluffing. So the anger washed away and i said to her im sorry he is just going to use you i was angry etc. We get back together and everyhing is great but her family finds out about that they call me to come to them i get there they basically tell me to stay away from her. So i go home i think about it and i say to myself im not giving up on this girl i broke up she still forgave me so i have to have her again. 2 weeks pass by nothing she doesnt have her phone i have her account btw. nothing happens then one day im logged out of her account and i try to talk to her but she doesnt want to she blocked me and now my friends are talking to her and they are supposed to hang out and of course i will be coming as well. but she has a boyfriend she wont tell me who it is or anything so i dont know what to do how do i win over her again..

692,"So I live with my childhood friend and my boyfriend in a double master townhouse. 

Living with her the first year or so was fine, didn’t have many issues, we just signed on our second year and now she’s acting like a child and being petty. 
I take on the rent/utilities coming out of my account, for the last few months I’ve struggled to get money from her on time. I literally just got her utilities that were due August 1st yesterday (August 23) and not without asking her for them 6 times and either being ignored or being told yes I’ll do that and then never does. 

Another example, we come home from a dinner at my grandparents and she has ice packs (from her weekly good food order) taking up half the freezer and my boyfriend has food he wanted to meal prep therefor needing to freeze some. He messages her asking if there for anything (as she keeps them for no reason sometimes) she says yes I need them for camping next weekend and he said can we take them out until the day or 2 before, my food will be gone by then and you’ll have lots of time to freeze them. Well she decides to blow up come running downstairs from her room yelling about how she has nothing in the freezer ever and slamming doors and grabs them out of the freezer and throws them in the trash. 

Unless I’m way off base this seems like a crazy over reaction to me. This kind of reaction is becoming more and more common and it’s getting really frustrating. I don’t know what to do anymore, I want to call her out for being a child and not paying her bills on time yet going out to eat and get pedicures while still owing me money. But I don’t want to lose our friendship either but we all agreed going into this living situation that we would be open with each other if there’s problems so that it goes smoothly (100% her idea as well, she’s lived with at least a friend and a boyfriend before and it didn’t work out and I’m starting to see why). 

So what do I do? I can pretty much guarantee that if I try to talk to her about it she’s gonna blow up again, we just signed our new lease that starts sept 1 so we’re stuck this way for at least another year.",24Aug2020,1
693,"I used to be pretty popular, everyone liked me, I think most people considered me attractive etc. I’d always had lots of friends, I never had any trouble getting girls or anything like that.

Then a while ago something happened that I won’t go into for the sake of brevity and it destroyed my confidence pretty much entirely, and now I don’t really have any friends left and female interest in me is nonexistent.

I’ve been gradually building my confidence back up but I’m still quite nervous with people.

I’ve spent a while now talking to this girl who I really liked, and I was thinking of trying to work up the courage to ask her if she wants to go for a drink with me, a big step for me in terms of rebuilding my confidence.

But then today she replied to one of my messages saying “look I don’t want to be rude but I don’t know why you talk to me. I’ve tried to be kind to you but honestly you give me a weird vibe and remind me a lot of my psycho ex. I would really like it if we could stop talking please”

And now I just feel like total shit. I am weird, I know I’m weird, I’m always nervous and anxious and fighting the urge to apologise for my existence when I talk to people. I just thought I’d made a lot of progress and was almost back to at least acting like my old “normal” self and it turns out that I’m actually pretty unpleasant to talk to still.

For context, this girl is not a mean person. She is always kind to everybody, she does charity work all the time, she has this thing where she makes sure to give a compliment to everybody she talks to each day, she’s like *relentlessly* nice. She’s been humouring me for months now, being polite whenever I spoke to her even though she apparently hated speaking to me. She just reached her limit.

696,"I feel like i'm losing my footing, especially since school's started again, and all of that because of an ex-friend.
Two years ago, i transferred to a new school to do my Abitur (basically high school i think) and for the first few days, i've been alone and by myself the whole time, until in the middle of a lesson, a girl began to talk to me. She just asked me some stuff and we went on to talk about more casual stuff. I felt so happy when i got home and couldn't stop smiling, as interacting with other people is pretty hard for me. Anyway, after a few more days, we kind of became friends and it stayed that way until our first ""fight"".
After us being friends for about 5 months, she overstepped a boundary of mine and i got a little aggressive and squeezed her hand a little. The rest of the day and for another whole 3 days, she completely ignored me, while i didn't have a clue as to why, until i messaged her and asked her, to which she responded that i hurt her and that she wants to cancel contact to me. At this point i had already apologized twice and proceeded to apologize another time.
After realising i lost my first friend at the new school and the person i've up to that point always hung out with, my heart just broke in two, but eventually my sadness faded and turned into anger.
One day after 4 months of painfully trying to deny the other's existence, she came up to me and apologized for what she did and i also apologized another time.
Then we were friends again and grew even closer than before, but after about 10 months it felt like i was traveling back in time.
On that day we were in the bus together like usual and she seemed kinda weird to me, barely talking to me and instead talking with her brother. 
After getting off the bus we also went in different directions, because she didn't go the way we usually go and at this point i figured there was something wrong with her.
We had some special day at school so all classes got into one big room and i arrived after my ""friend"" i asked her if i could sit next to her, as my other few friends haven't arrived yet, and she told me that she wants to have someone else sit next to her, also kinda a friend of mine (lets call her H). So i was like ok fine and sat on the seat next to the one for H.
Just a few seconds later she called me and was like ""I want to break of the contact to you"" and practically being like, i don't want you to be my friend or a part of my life anymore.
For next 30 minutes or so i tried holding myself together, only semi succeeding at doing so and letting a few tears flow and sniffs out, while some teachers were presenting something.
After that it was this ignoring championship again and it became normal, but the thing is that she (nor me), personally has not even once talked to me again and not even explained why she broke contact from one day to the other. The only ""hint"" i've gotted was from another friend, the one i've mentioned before: H.
H and my ex-friend have become really good friends over the last year and almost always hang out together now and she managed to tell me a tiny bit on my ex-friend's reasoning for doing what she did.
H told me it was simply because i'm not a normal girl.
For context: i've had my hair short for about one and a half year now and she is one of the few people that knows i'm biromatic and also experience gender dysphoria and at first i thought she'd have some problems with it due to her expressing some homophobic thoughts in the past. To my surprise she didn't seem to have a problem with it but after what H told me, i'm not too sure anymore.
So after like 2 years of being friends with me, she suddenly realized i'm not your ""average"" girl and decided to dump me like that.
H and another friend told me to forget about it and to just forget her, but they don't understand how hard it is to see and painfully try to ignore her every day. Unfortunately she's friends with everyone i'm friends with so often i'm just by myself instead of having to even just stand next to her.

It's suffocating me more and more every day, but no one understands me sadly, but oh well i guess. I really hope some of you will.",24Aug2020,1

Instead she said, ""You have to graduate this year but next year we can talk about public school. Well come around next year and everytime I tried to talk to her she wouldnt listen or she would change the subject. Im at my first day of school right now and remember how much I hate it.

My friend is a bit obese ( 5'6 300 pounds so you have an idea ) and unfortunately I'm not attracted to that. I know it is shallow to focus too much on the outside but I'm just not into that. I honestly don't know what I could say. I know all my friends are just gonna hate me the moment I say no since they all know exactly the reason why I will. Bunch of hyprocrites that's what they are. Fuck me man. Why did she have to say in front of everyone. I know I shouldn't have gone to that goddamm party. Maybe I should just find new friends lol.,24Aug2020,1
699,"So for the past 6 years or so from when I was around 17 I have probably masturbated to porn anywhere from once a day to once a week depending on how busy I was. On average I would say once every three days or so. At first, I justified my behavior as a preventative measure because once a week like clockwork if I did not ejaculate at some point I would release while sleeping, which was frankly very annoying.

Anyways, for the past two weeks, I have been abstaining because I recently discovered that I cannot maintain an erection when around real women in the bedroom. I haven't been in a relationship or had sex since I was 18 in my senior year of High School and only recently started trying to meet women again. The first woman I met that I wanted to sleep with after this 5 year-long dry spell was I would say average looking but had a great body. However, when we were getting down to do the deed, I could not stay erect. No matter what we did, my erection would only stick around for maybe 30 seconds at best and penetration was basically impossible because it would go flaccid as soon as it neared her vagina. Obviously, this was extremely embarrassing and I honestly felt like a failure of a man. The next day, I tried masturbating to porn and had no issues whatsoever so clearly the issue is a psychological one rather than a physiological one.

At this point, I am very concerned that due to my excessive viewing of porn from a relatively young age, I am unable to get off on real women anymore unlike when I was in a relationship and may have an unhealthy addiction to porn. Not to mention that after two weeks literally any advertisement with a scantily clad woman gives me an almost irresistible urge to watch porn again. Will this issue go away eventually if I abstain from viewing porn for long enough? Also, any tips on avoiding the temptation to watch porn?

TL;DR: I may have an addiction to porn that makes me unable to maintain an erection around real women. Tips on how to solve?",24Aug2020,1

And I've been engaged before and this is so much more than that. Maturely and respectfully, he has stated that he is very much in love with me and wants us to have a future together, but there are things in his life that he needs to deal with over the next few months. He's are finances, his mother is failing Health, figuring out which coast to stay/buy a house on, finding self confidence as he's extremely self conscious. So the current agreement is that we are together but not together together? We only live about a half an hour apart, so we text throughout the day and video chat every other day.

I don’t get any formal benefits from it, since I don’t have a formal contract: no paid vacation, no social security, not anything. I get paid for every hour I teach and one of the advantages is I only have to work for as many hours as I accept (in theory, because in real life I’ve been pressed to accept new students by my direct boss and employer) . 

The thing is, I spend too long planning each of these lessons and what I charge for each of this hours is really low. My husband has a stable job and we are not in a desperate need of the extra money I make with the classes, but you know, I like knowing that I’m bringing something to the table and that I can be financially independent if I need to. 

During the quarantine I started learning art , and illustration, and I felt more alive than I had in a long time. I practice as much as I can everyday, but I feel like teaching online takes away so much energy from me, that I am not being able to work on illustration as much as I’d like to.

715,"back in high school I dated a guy for almost 5 years, we were in the same class, and basically did everything together, I had no other friends and stood almost 24/7 with him. We broke up one year and a half ago, after he began a pointless fight with me and I didn't back down. Our relationship wasn't healthy, because of my insecurities and his personality, it was in fact quite abusive. I was so dependent on him, that before the break up, I tried to leave him for almost a year, without ever having the courage to put an end to it, so in the end, when he broke up for nothing, I was even relieved, though I believe he wasn't expecting. After all this time, I haven't ever seen him again, I didn't even went back to his house to get my belongings, actually I told him to throw it all out, still he won't leave me alone. He tried to see me lots of times, he asked me for friendship again in all social media (when he broke up he blocked me everywhere), made his mom text me to invite me over, and keeps texting me every now and then to talk about his life and our past, he even asked me several times to tell him about my feelings about him, about how I see him and feel about our past. I never told him I didn't want to talk to him anymore, although I do believe I made my point clear enough. He keeps trying to be my friend as if nothing had happen, and openly admitted he wanted to come back.

I’ve literally only ever liked 1 guy and I thought he liked me too but he played me apparently he only sees me as a friend which is fine maybe it’s a sign I shouldn’t be in a relationship like I said in the first place plus I’m not an emotionally open person and I just can’t see myself liking anyone like that cuz truth be told I been thru a lot of hard stuff in my life and nobody was thefe for me at all, I did everything alone so I feel like I don’t even really need anyone either",24Aug2020,1
719,"I've never written a text post before but I'm desperate. The people in this are all just teens, Including me.
I am female (straight) , my friend is female(bi?), and the person I like (PIL) is male.

I've known my friend for a year. Over the course of that year I've listened to her worries and gave her advice to help her. We're really close. Recently, I met her friend (PIL) who I ended up having romantic feelings for. I talked to her about it and she always helped me out with it. 

It turns out she's very close to him as well. She started saying things about liking someone who was a straight girl and had been liking them for a year. Later on in a conversation with PIL, he mentions that he knows someone that likes me. The hints all point towards my friend. I say that I'd been suspecting someone recently. Later that day, he asks who I think it is. I realize it's true, it's her. I end up talking to her about it and she admits it. I promised to treat her normally. I don't know if I'll still be comfortable talking to her about my problems. 

It was so fucking horrible realizing I never had a chance with PIL because he knew she liked me. It was also fucking horrible that I could potentially lose my friend who I'd been close to for so long. I end up telling PIL that I actually like him  and he says that he can't take my feelings seriously. He says he sees them as a joke. He says he's not ready for something like this because of his age. (I respect his opinions.) I feel like my friendships are being stomped on. He promises he'll still treat me like normal, he doesn't care that I like him. I need space from them so I'm not going to talk to them for a while. They're the only two people that talk to me everyday and I don't know what to do without them.

I started school, and its still online for me. I start at around 8am. Before school started, I had a pretty shitty sleep schedule. Something along the lines of sleep at 6am and wake up at 3. However, most of the time I would sleep at 6 and be forced to wake up at 1pm by my parents, which is like 5 hours of sleep. It would cause little problems because it was the summer and I generally snuck in a couple of hours of sleep during the day.

Now that school started I sleep at 12:30 - 1:00 am and wake up at 5:30 - 6:00 am which is because of habit (I assume). Now again, this wouldn't be a problem if I was left to sleep during the day, but I am not. I am constantly woken up by my parents to ""do something other than sleep all day,"" that is after doing 3 hours straight of Math followed by an hour of Chemistry. 

So I can't seem to get more then 6 hours (5 at night + 1 I manage to sneak in during the day) of sleep and I don't know what to do. Its not like I sleep to avoid doing work because I do work. Advice?

I want to be a photographer, and videographer (preferably for weddings, and small businesses and stuff) I also want to be a content creator helping people develop their skills in Photo/Video.

I graduated Highschool in 2019 and didnt pursue college because 1 its expensive, 2 Im horrible with test and school in general, 3 I was already getting jobs with conferences and other places so I didn't think college was necessary. 

Where I need advice is, Im barely making any money especially with Covid-19. I cant find a Job, and practically everyone is telling me to not attempt full time Content Creation and when I do my life picks up speed and I have no time to even make videos.

I have tried to get a job for dozens of different places and a majority says they arent hiring and when they are they never hire me. 

So Im left wondering.. Am I wasting my time looking for a job when I could be working on making content and building my name as a photographer/videographer? Or am I wasting trying to be a content creator when I could be looking for a job.

I have promised myself to not be stuck In a 9-5 job and instead work for myself so I can be there for my future family when I need to be. But at this point Idk what to do or where to go. Whenever I ask for advice its usually one of 2 things.

Go to College and get a good paying job.

736,"So.. I’m 28f. My mom and I never got along. I never really understood why. It started when I was very young, physical abuse, criticism on my looks and personality, being sexualized. I was never good enough despite my grades, my talents, and my ability to adapt to difficult situations and I was extremely independent early on in life. 

We had been getting along recently- the longest stretch of civility in fact ..6 months. 

I told her I had been struggling with panic attacks and have decided to go to therapy to get to the root of it because it’s getting in the way of my day to day. 

My panic attacks are generally self inflicted- negative thoughts about myself, criticism and self hate that spiral into overheating and crying spells. 

I originally thought they were feelings resurfacing because of my fathers suicide 5 years ago that I didn’t fully handle but quickly realized what was happening when I told my mom I wanted to start going to therapy when she called me on Friday. 

She immediately became more concerned with what I was going to tell the therapist about her vs why I wanted to go. She is fully aware of how I feel about the way she speaks to me, and I have gone no contact plenty of times to work on my mental health. 

She asked me a question that she has asked before and I stupidly answered anyway. “Do you think I love your brother more than I love you?” I said yes. I told her I know you love me, but I know you prefer my brother and that’s okay. 

She was being kind at first, letting me explain why I feel that way, and how her comments made me extremely self-conscious and often end up hating on myself and questioning my abilities. 

What I didn’t realize at the time was she had been drinking, and it blew up. She finally said what she felt about me and I don’t know if I’m relieved to finally understand or if I’m just numb to how bad this really fucking hurts: 

1. It was hard to be my mother. I made her feel unimportant because I wanted to do everything myself from an early age. 

2. She believes I am prettier than her and it made her feel self-conscious 

3. Calling me a slut when I was getting hit on at a bar she brought me to while I was underage was her way of protecting me. If I didn’t dress in a tank top than I wouldn’t have gotten that attention. 

4. I was the smart one and talented one but lack people skills 

5. I never wanted to cuddle or be close and that hurt her feelings. 

6. I apparently think I’m better than everyone because I use big  pretentious words  

7. I’m hopeless and unloveable because I don’t want to be loved and my husband must hate being around me and that is secretly why I’m unhappy. 

8. If I had just let her dress me and acted like a normal girl this wouldn’t even be an issue 

I honestly don’t even know how to feel about it. On one hand I wanna say fuck you and move on but she is close with my brother who is going to be having a kid soon. I want SO badly to be part of my nephews and brothers life but I have a feeling I won’t be welcomed. 

My mom always lies to my brother when we have disagreements about how she treats me and lies to him often about how I feel about him. 

She alienated/criticized my father in similar ways which I whole heartedly believe was a major part in his decision to take his own life. 

Idk what to fucking do... I’m so tired of feeling like there’s something wrong with me. I have a great job, my husband is so freakin amazing, we are almost ready to buy a house , I should be excited! - but this woman makes me feel like I don’t deserve a damn thing",24Aug2020,1

so I(14) was doing an online math assignment it was easy, I was having fun. my older brother who took this class back in school came in and checked to see what I'm doing. he was complimenting me at first about how fast I am at learning the stuff, he says 'yeah you're good.' then goes back to his room. he comes back and sees me start solving the problems, he sits with me and starts solving them as well. he then asks me if I want to compete with him, whoever gets problem 1 the fastest will win.

743,"Hi there,

Let me explain the situation. Buckle up, it’s a bumpy ride.

My mom and dad purchased a home in December 2016 - a house they very well could not afford. 

My mom committed suicide in September 2018 which completely shocked the family. 
Obviously we all thought my dad would sell the home and move on, instead it made him more determined to “fight” for this home.

My boyfriend and I welcomed our baby boy last September and have been living with my dad. He has let us rent out the large basement from him - it has been nice to not have to pay as much as a condo from a stranger. 

Recently my boyfriend and I looked into purchasing a home. The sellers pulled the home off the market due to some financing issues (we were really upset) my dad recently proposed we sign on to the mortgage here with him, gain some equity and in 3/4 years we can take our portion and buy our own home. 

We thought this was a good idea so I got in contact with the mortgage broker my dad was speaking to. My dad is not the most forthcoming person and quite frankly, is not trustworthy. The mortgage broker basically started the conversation by stating how “this would save my dad” - I quickly asked him what he meant by that, and basically, to cut the bullshit and tell me the truth (because I never get the truth from my dad)

He explained my dads house is IN FORECLOSURE and basically he needs my boyfriend to sign on to the title so my dad can keep it. He further advised my dads monthly mortgage payment is $7,300. WTF!?!?!?

I’m honestly SO upset. I have an 11 month old baby, going back to school soon to better my career and was depending on living here. I can’t afford to move out. Now I feel like my dad is a dirty liar and I’m disguised by this home. This all seems like a joke. 

What do I do? Where do I start? Do I sign onto the mortgage?

Any advice is appreciated. Thank you.",24Aug2020,1
744,"Before COVID I (25F) had a great routine and balance. Now, everyone has been working from home since March 14th and corporate has just said this will probably continue into next year. At first I was so happy. I’m a natural introvert and felt mentally drained after work. But I also felt productive and active in my life. 

Now, I stay at home all day every day. I don’t go out on weekends except occasionally to see close family. My husband is an essential worker and so he still goes into the office 3 times a week and is able to interact with his coworkers. 

My days are just bleeding into one at this point. Today, a work day, I’m doing basically the same thing I was doing over the weekend. I can’t bring myself to care about work anymore. I’ve basically just been saying I’m doing stuff that my boss can’t really check on at all. I have a pretty under the radar job but when I’m needed I’m very useful and active in my role. I just haven’t been active much during quarantine. 

I’m not sure what to do at this point. I’ve tried getting into exercise, which I’m still doing and is helping somewhat when I do it (probably twice a week average). But some days I can’t bring myself to do anything. I lay on the couch and play video games until my husband gets home and then pretend that I had a busy work day. Laundry is piling up. The house is a general mess and I just don’t care. I haven’t taken a day of vacation this year because where would I even go? My husband can’t take off work so I’d just be sitting at home doing the same thing. I just feel mentally tired and frustrated. I feel like a caged animal. I have hobbies (gardening, cooking, whittling, video games, reading) but they just don’t seem like enough anymore. I think I’m losing it.",24Aug2020,1
745,"So I don't even know where to begin, my sister who is about 19, refuses to go anywhere even when we try to get her to go to her favorite places, or her favorite restaurants. On regular college days, she would only go to her classes and come right home, she never has a life or gets excited about anything. And I suspect that she's depressed, but my parents refuse to get her to a therapist. It's been getting very worse with corona, since she never leaves anywhere now since college is online, and she refuses to interact with anyone, and I just think that's unhealthy on so many levels. Her health is even deteriorating, she's been getting very thin and she was already diagnosed with an iron deficiency years ago. I can't help but feel very sad that I can't do anything, because I think that she already doesn't even want me to talk to her because we argue a lot. I only come in and try to advice her but she always assumes the worst in my intentions, even though I only want to help her. I'm just at loss, because I feel like she changed a lot over the last few years, and it pains me to see her like that, just isolating herself from the world.",24Aug2020,1

749,"I am currently a supervisor in the x-ray department of my hospital. I work evenings so i get an additional $3 per hour. This puts my average pay at about $30/hr.

I recently became CT certified so I can do run the CT (Cat Scan) machine and get CT images for patients. 

This usually means more money. 

I applied for a CT position much closer to home, only a 20minute commute, (right now it's 50minues both ways).
They offered me the position, same shift, but at $23/hr.
The shift differential would make it $26. So, yes less than I make now. 

I honestly don't know what to do. 

It is closer, and I'd be getting CT experience and I wouldn't have to do any supervisor stuff. 

I feel like they low-balled me for the certification and the Bachelor's degree that I have. 

I called them back and negotiated for more money. HR said they would call me back. It's only been an hour but I seriously don't know what to do. I was not expecting to make less as a CT tech than an x-ray tech.

750,"Before quarantine I was a bartender for 4 years. I loved it, but may not return to it. One thing I really loved about the job was that in the brief conversations people have with bartenders they often reveal things that are important to them, like being adventurous or exploring a hobby or favorite topic. So if I could identify these things I’d always toss a compliment towards it. Like if someone seemed to know a lot about illustration I’d say “it’s incredible how much you know about this stuff I had no idea. It seems wonderful” and then hit on a couple of the talking points they made. 

I don’t bartend anymore and basically only interact with people comfortably via videogames. Quarantine and stuff. I throw some compliments at my buddies for video game stuff but I miss the connection from before.

755,"Hello,

I’ve been with my SO for 4 years. I definitely cant imagine my life without him and I love him. We met in Nashville. I’m from the singer songwriter world, he’s not. But he has a great job and is extremely supportive of me and my endeavors with music.

I’ve been sick of Nashville for quite some time and so has my SO. With me it’s mostly because of the soulless clique-y nature of the music industry here (I’m guessing that’s the music industry in general). Everyone you run into seems to have a large ego and it’s hard to make friends if you’re not a “good hang” and know how to schmooze. We have good friends in Atlanta and I have relatives so it makes sense to move there because our lives ( I think) would be drastically more full for the reason of being around people we know. Also neither of us are from there so it would be a nice fresh start. We both kind of decided we’ll move there when our lease ends.

I’m excited by this because I’ve been ready to get out of Nashville for a while, but I’m having some doubts. I’m almost 30 and these are the years where I maybe should be somewhere that is an industry mecca like Nashville. On the other hand, Atlanta is a large city with lots of places to still play and with the internet it doesn’t really matter where I live anyway. I can still write and record, and if touring becomes a reality it’s in a good location. 

I guess I just always thought if I left Nashville it would be to another city like Austin where I fit in more musically. I’d never considered Atlanta. 

I guess that’s all. Am I over thinking this?",24Aug2020,1

758,"I've been working non-stop for a few months and I started to show physical symptoms of my stress in the form of some chest pain and many small patches of hives on my arms and legs that have been appearing over the course of the past few weeks. So, despite my desire to continue working to earn money or keep my clean house I decided that today I would do absolutely nothing in an attempt to de-stress. While I'm still anxious about not doing any of the chores around the house, it was going kind of well for the most part, but my roommate is a person who is very involved with his friends and one thing he does is refer them to me when he needs help solving their problems or managing their drama. This bothers me a lot on a daily basis because I'm not comfortable around people I don't know well, especially when I'm at home, and I hate sudden responsibility. However, I usually agree to deal with these things as a favor to my roommate. 

Today, I had told him that because my stress has gotten so bad, I needed today to handle it. He's out of the house to work anyways, so he didn't have to do anything at all to help me with this. Yet, he still sent me a text saying that one of his friend's girlfriends was going to come over to grab some things from the apartment and I would have to help her get them. It doesn't sound like a big thing, so I'm worried that I was overreacting a little when I told him I didn't want to be asked to deal with it today because I wanted to de-stress and even this thing that seems like a small favor to him is big to me because I have to get dressed and deal with a stranger and go through the house to put together whatever it was I was supposed to give to her. After I expressed my frustration, he got mad but said he'd tell her to come by a different time. I still feel like maybe I overreacted, but I also just wanted to have one day in the last few months where I didn't have to do anything for anyone but myself. As I normally do nothing but run back and forth between my jobs, my house chores, and helping out his friends who I don't even know. 

Was I in the wrong here, and how could I have better handled this?

763,"TLDR: My friend has a drug problem that surfaced earlier this year and after months of trying to help and being lied to I'm not sure how to continue our friendship.

Hi. So my friend lets call him A, has a coke problem. Now I'm not entirely sure about the specifics because A managed to hide it from me and my bf until recently. We first realized in April that they were using very often. At this time we had been planning for the three of us to live together and were waiting for the paperwork. When we learned were both very upset with them and didn't want to continue the friendship at first despite how close we all are, but decided to try and help instead. I've tried to be there for them and help them come up with ways reduce the usage until they could stop. Sometime in June I thought we had managed to get through to them and continued to support A and let them know how proud we were. Fast forward to a couple weeks ago when we noticed how often A tended to disappear into their room. This was one of the main tells that A was using. We didn't want to outright accuse because we know they've been having a lot of mental strain and could just be in bed trying to relax, which was understandable. So I asked them very nonchalantly how they were doing with no longer using coke, instead of accusing them to see what they would say. Obviously A said they were still clean and I believed them. Now we come to today. Today my bf let me know that A had asked to borrow some money he owed our connection (we all smoke marijuana). It was in the hundreds but I didn't think anything of it just told bf not to lend A the money. Then bf lets me know the money was in fact owed for coke, because A fessed up to bf. On top of that a friend of A and bf, is likely going to be moving in with A. I consider her a friend of mine but not close enough to be comfortable giving her this news. I worry she will end up in a situation where A uses her for drug money. As he was doing with by before we knew what was going on. A does not know that I know. A also does not know that I'm at the end of my rope emotionally after being lied to so blatantly. And at this point I'm not sure what to do about any of this.",24Aug2020,1

767,"Little background, I am [F 24] with a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering, and I want (more like need) to get my M.S. to do what I want in the field. I have chosen a school and program, but it is out of state (Colorado). The out-of-state tuition is crazy, and I cannot afford it, but I can definitely afford the in-state-tuition. Of course, you have to have residency in a state for a year to be considered for their in-state-tuition. This program does consider lowering, if not covering, the cost of tuition for Masters and PhD students (more likely for PhD), but it is nowhere near guaranteed. I missed the deadline to apply for Spring '21, so the plan is to apply for Fall '21. I have almost no doubt that they will accept me into the program I want, but financially, they have to award me at least in-state tuition (if not a complete coverage of my tuition, because I guess that is possible) for me to afford it. That decision would not be made until May '21 at the earliest. The other option is, I could move by this December, and then even if they don't award me lower tuition, I can have the lower tuition for Spring '22. But that means not attending school for over a year longer, which isnt what I want to do, I dont want to live somewhere that expensive and not attend school. I also have had many jobs in fine dining/restaurants, so that was what I was depending on for income, until Covid-19 changed everything, and now nowhere is hiring, so I wouldnt even be able to save money and just work. So I'm stuck on what I should do. I also already figured out a roommate to help lower the cost of living, but this is still a ridiculously expensive place to live. My mental health is also not the greatest living due to where I live now, but I've done it for 24 years, I guess I could do it for one more. 
I'm not sure if I should move now, and guarantee lower tuition for Spring '22 (but risk losing a lot of money due to no job/moving expenses/cost of living), or wait to move and in the meantime save more money and cross my fingers that I am awarded lower tuition so I can start in Fall '21. 

Tl;dr: I can move now, and if I still have money, afford guaranteed in-state tuition for Spring '22, or I can wait, and hope that the school awards me lower tuition for Fall '21, and save more money where I am in the meantime. Unsure of what to do.",24Aug2020,1

I started zoom classes at my community college today and found it was less than pleasing to my learning style and method.

I have thought about taking a gap year in the past but mostly thought of it as unnecessary because most of my friends were preparing to go onto campus and go through the experience together, I didn’t want to be behind them or miss out on anything. However as this pandemic has progressed a few of my friends have decided to go ahead and take a gap year.

The ad she posted was harmless, and after talking with her, it seemed like she just wanted her kid to be outside more and have a positive female role model with similar interests. (I put on my ad that I'm an art major, kid also really likes art.) Seemed nice enough, and I had an in-person meet with them the other day, and I walked in and basically knew exactly what was up. 

Lady is R I C H. Upper-middle white suburbia rich. I walked in the door and the house felt bigger on the inside. I saw the kid coming down, and it was pretty obvious that she wasn't straight, preferred to spend time online with her internet friends and had little interest in whatever her mom was forcing on her. 

We talked about routines, ideas etc. With the mom in the kitchen, but I could tell she wasn't giving honest answers. When me and the kid were alone, she spilled it. Essentially, the mom stalks her EVERY move. House is bugged, wifi and all devices are routed through a vpn and all messages are checked through an app called ""Bark."" Mom found out the kid was gay, and didn't like that, essentially believes the internet is turning her kid gay and making her depressed; when in reality it's the opposite. Kid told me a bunch of stories about how shes taken all of her electronics away and is forcing her to go to in-school classes at a christian academy (during covid). She's had sitters before me, and apparently they all followed the mom's word, I'm the first one who isn't a nutjob. 

I joked that I would sneak around and secretly let her on my phone hotspot/drive her to her friend's house (that the mom hates....), but I don't know how much I can do for her. I feel for the kid a lot, because I was in a VERY similar situation at her age. I want to be someone she can trust and help her, but I'm not too sure what I can do without risking my job. Help?",24Aug2020,1
789,"So I did something a long while back to a friend of mine that was pretty hurtful and wasn't done for any good reason. What I did was selfish and I feel extremely guilty and ashamed about it. At the time that it happened, my friend knew what I had done as well. We've never addressed the incident or talked about it openly, but I'm relatively certain that I had hurt them. I have no idea if they think about it all. 

However, despite all that, this person is still my friend. Many years have passed and I feel closer than ever to this person. Our relationship is great right now and if things were to continue as they are, I'm certain this person will be around for the rest of my life.

I don't know what to do with my feelings of guilt. With Covid and being distanced from everyone, I can certainly tell I'm depressed, and I can't tell if me wanting to apologize is just a self-destructive act or not. I don't know if digging up the past just to get something off my chest is selfish or not. But I did wrong to someone I care about, and I don't think that it's okay to just not address what I did.",24Aug2020,1

791,"Long story short, I (17 y/o male) had sex with my girlfriend (16) about 2 weeks ago. We’ve been together almost a year which seems like longer because we talked a lot over summer break and with covid we had 2 extra months of summer. I really fucked up yesterday, I was doing my laundry and left a receipt on top of the washer and it had among other things a pregnancy test on it, and she read that. 
They had like a half hour to an hour talk with me and told my gf’s mom... I know this is all my fault and my girlfriend was up all night crying because shes scared her mom is going to be really mad at her when they finally talk. We weren’t planning on doing it again (neither of us really cared for the sex part, more the foreplay). 
Anyways, what should I do to comfort her?I feel like me saying “everythings going to be ok”  is just annoying and not helping. Also, what do I do about my at home situation, I don’t even feel comfortable being around my grandparents right now, let alone talking to them.",24Aug2020,1
792,"Hi I’ll try to make this as short as I can. 

Today I [M17] was invited for a virtual meeting for job shadowing, it consisted of a speaker talking about the major ( IT ) and the work force environment. In the end I asked a question about the jobs variety and availability, he said that IT jobs are in demand but also can be decreased since that systems are evolving and could do some work faster, more reliable than a human ( the example was monitoring a server ). 

After the meeting, I wrote what I understood and it struck me that since that I still have 1 year to finish high school plus an additional 3 to 4 years to finish university and that’s an extended period of time. I fear that I won’t be able to find a job around that time since that tech always evolves. I know that with it evolving much more jobs will be needed but also there’s a possibility that a designed system could do all the work and not needing someone. It got me anxious and I cannot get the thought out of my mind that there’s a possibility that I don’t find a job in my major and feel that all that I studied is not going to get me any where.",24Aug2020,1

Fast forward a few years later and due to various circumstances, me and my friend's crush got to know each other better and we were flirting with each other intensely. So one day I decided to indirectly see how my friend would feel about me and him.

795,"Hi r/Advice,   


I had originally planned to post this in medical\_advice but wasn't sure if it would really get much attention so I figured maybe here is a better idea. I'd also like to say that I'm actually at the top of my life in terms of mental health and am doing great overall, I just don't know what to do about this situation.   


As the title says, I'm an 18 year old with a tumor, I have a Lymphatic Vascular Malformation on my back, it's non-cancerous but will eventually take my life as far as I know without treatment. I was born with it but only found out about it (granted I knew about it because its a fat tumor on my back obviously) on October 4th, 2018, from there through a series of doctors and misdiagnoses, I found myself at the Cincinnati's Children Hospital (one of three specialist hospitals for what I originally was misdiagnosed as), I began having scheduled visits every 3 month and went January, April but did not go in July because we had missed the spot, unfortunately these visits really didn't do much, they just kept informing us about what my tumor does, and gave me four compression vests, which is a treatment method that helps stop the growth of my tumor but doesn't do anything else.  


I was originally going to go through Sclerotherapy, but unfortunately September 5th, 2019 of last year, my father got diagnosed with Stage 4 Brain Cancer and eventually passed away December 17th later that year, unfortunately I also lost my health insurance and my family's been recovering ever since.    


My back pain isn't bad but it's definitely getting worse and at times it is excruciating, I'm really lost in terms of what to do, I've thought about getting my medical records and trying to file for disability as I worked at Walmart for a short while and couldn't due to my body essentially shutting down along with some other unfortunate circumstances.    


None of us have health insurance now I believe.",24Aug2020,1
797,"Here’s the situation: 

I signed up for a leasing program for an electronic retailer store because my mom needs an air conditioner. The leasing company required me to make an initial payment with a card, but I ran into some errors, so I bought a couple of products with cash (that I was originally going to buy via leasing) and left. I have a working card now, but I’m short $30. 


I do not have any people to borrow from. I was thinking if it would be a good move to return one of the merchandise I bought then rebuy it using the leasing program. If I do that I’ll have extra cash in my pockets, however I don’t want to look suspicious or anything.

800,"I live with a roommate. Said roommate is an only child who has never had to share spaces, or anything for that matter. Last night, I was doing work out in the only room with AC in it, when she came in and announced she would be using that space. I was in meetings and had to go on mute because she was being so loud. I couldn't leave that space because it is way too hot elsewhere in the house, so I had to stay on mute and type my answers during meetings. Just now, she told me I cannot come out of my room because she is using that space for a meeting. I hate staying in my bedroom all day and try to never do it, and I have work in a few hours, so I'd like to get out there and make lunch and eat and relax before.

I was kind of okay with last night, thought it was a bit rude but it's a common area, so whatever, we can share it. But, I think it's incredibly obnoxious of her to tell me I can't use the area while she's in a meeting, even though that's exactly what she did to me last night, causing me to have to go on mute for my meeting. I am very non confrontational and don't want to have a fight with her, but I feel like I'm living in her house.

We both play video games and honestly I never truly enjoyed playing with him and that’s completely fine. But I’m not a huge sexual person, I mean sure at first when I met him I was cause it was exciting and new (but I still kinda have trauma from my first relationship ever and the person who I lost my virginity by getting screamed at and shamed and ignored for not wanting to have sex.) (Little details from this story is my current got mad because I wasn’t in the mood and he totally exploded and kicked me out as soon as I was above to leave he kept trying to pin me down, not to rape me but get me to stay and kept shoving me but that’s not the point.) I think I lost romantic interest in him, but I still love him. I have this internet friend who I have been friends with for almost a year, and he help me through my lowest points and through suicidal thoughts, I’ve always expressed my care and love for him in a friendly way, we will call him T. So recently I’ve became more and more obsessed with T. Like if I can’t play video games with him that night I’ll get kinda bummed out or I’ll wait til 3am for him to finish his games with others (and no he doesn’t keep me waiting around all night, he has other friends) But I think I’m starting to have a small crush on him, there are a few things stopping this like being from different states and his religion, but T and I have always had the strongest connection ever, and one of the greatest friendships ever and I truly do adore him. And no I don’t want to leave my boyfriend for him, that’s so selfish and wrong but with the past fighting with my current relationship and spending more time talking to T I can’t help but allow T to grow on me.

Extra: if my bf calls me cute it’s like normal but if T calls me cute I get extreme butterflies. I don’t wanna shamed for it but I really can’t control it.

Extra2: the other night I got drunk and confessed that I had a crush on him but T didn’t really wanna take advantage of the situation cause I was drunk and then in discord he was making a comment how he was trying to sleep but didn’t want to leave me on read and kept picking on me for what I was saying and was saying it was cute 🥺",24Aug2020,1

Anyhow, the issue is my family is Christian, and my grandparents are very Christian themselves, believing in God and all that.

These past few months have been stressful for me after I graduated with a MS in computer engineering. I thought with a couple internships under my belt and a good GPA I'd be able to find plenty of jobs in the area which is the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill, NC area (this area has a lot of tech companies), but I've been job searching since May, and I haven't been able to find anything. I also expanded my job search to all of North Carolina around a few weeks ago but still haven't found anything. I apply to around 6-10 jobs/day. I've been living with my parents for a month, and I honestly can't stand it.

The reason I want to stay in NC is because my closest friends who I've known throughout college also live here, and as a socially anxious introvert, it's difficult for me to make friends, especially during this time. This friend group is also the best and most supportive friend group by far I've ever had, and I can honestly say it would be the first time I really missed people if I stopped seeing them. 

Here are my options:

1. Stay with my parents for a few more months (or however long this COVID shit lasts) and keep applying to positions I'm less interested in for the sake of living in the area
2. Start looking immediately for out-of-state positions that I am interested in and move away from my closest friends and family

817,"Posting this again because I posted It wayyyy too late last night and no one saw. Pls help if ya can.

Hi, Sorry if this gets long. Lately I've been having the weirdest dreams, maybe a couple months since it started. (For reference, just turned 16, I am a guy, No diagnosed conditions or any history of sleep paralysis or insomnia I'm actually a pretty heavy sleeper, and rarely struggle to sleep once I'm relaxed) The first time It happened It was terrible, and I think It may have been a form of sleep paralysis. to explain that first dream, The jist of it was I started walking toward the door In a bathroom like the one in a house I lived in when I was very little, Only reversed. I looked in the Mirror to see a blob, only for that to suddenly glitch into/ jumpcut to this creepy gory, smiley face. Simultaneously, the room turned a red hue. I turned around, portions of the room being old or fleshy, only to be charged by NMC2 (or Nightmare Creature 2, A Recurring creature I've seen In several dreams. I fly back, My spine hitting something hard, which I felt IRL. This is where I became aware I was dreaming to a degree. from there, I could no longer move within the dream, my vision locked upward, me laying on my back. from there My vision within the dream flickered for the rest of the night between NMC2 hanging over me twitching/ bouncing it's head back and forth, and a Degraded VHS video looking image with an Image of a face I couldn't quite make out in the center, a blue background with black stripes, and some phrases I've seen appear again and again in dreams following in white text, some of the main ones being ""forget?"" ""You owe the messenger"" and strikingly ""do you remember your name?"". I was terrified and tried my hardest to move in the dream but could not (still unsure if sleep paralysis  or if it was just within the dream, as my eyes were shut IRL, And I still saw the space I was in within the dream. I didn't feel anything touch me, just cold on my back, and a bit of a bump up below me at about mid back)

That first dream was the most vivid and crazy, but I've had others since. NMC2 was entirely new, but I had the return of a character I hadn't seen In a while (But had seen before the above dream) right after that vivid dream, Who I like to call NMC1. I've been seeing him occasionally since I was 12, once a year or less, but I had stopped seeing him after I turned 14, which I was happy about, hes a terrifying fucker. I'm always running or hiding from NMC1 in my dreams of him, and this was the first I'd had in a while. I wasn't aware I was dreaming, And only realized I was when I woke up. In this one I was hiding. Not very vivid or anything, a light coming from the hall through an open door, black except things close to me, a bed in the center, not much else was visible. It was striking to see him after so long though. Theres a reason why I refer to It as a he, I'll explain these creatures below at the end. 

Then there was the second appearance of NMC2. I am walking in the dark, slowly the moon becomes visible and lights my path, I walk toward this street lamp next to this old gate, only to jump seeing NMC2 under it. I assumed he was aggressive, after he charged at me in the first dream, but as I walked closer, he continued staring at me with his terrifying smirk. This was probably where I've got the best look at him so far (described below), text started to appear behind him, scrolling, saying some of the same things from before, as well as some new things: ""Don't forget what you saw"" ""This is your destiny"" and ""do you remember me"". I look up, The moon got a large red ""error!"" over it, I look back down, streetlamp flickers, and then The creature lurched forward toward me very quickly, and that shocked me awake. It seems NMC2 has a slit personality, one side aggressive toward me (charge in the first dream, jump in the second) and the other wanting me to remember... something. (VHS.thing in the first, text in the second) It's very confusing.

These are the most vivid recent ones, though I have several others with these creatures and with others. I want to understand, and I want to know what the hell is wrong with me. These things seem to have some meaning somewhere and I either want these terrifying shits to end or want to understand and come to terms with it if they wont. If you can offer any insight as to what this means, why it happens, or if something is wrong with me It's greatly appreciated. If you want to know about other characters and my dreams with them, Let me know, Im happy to elaborate on those if it helps.

DESCRIPTIONS OF MAIN CREATURES (let me know if you have seen similar in you dreams, or know what these creatures mean)

NMC1: I haven't gotten the best look at it yet, but, it's a lanky creature with short legs too thin to use, it has scythes for arms below the elbow. It has some kind of metal thing (guessing a radio or speaker) that sticks out where a persons voice-box would be. It uses It's arms to get around, and it moves quick, Its unused legs dragging on the ground. It laughs maniacally constantly (in what sounds like a male's voice), but it sounds a bit electronic/ speaker esque (hence my guess about the metal thing being one.)  Its head looks like it's trapped in a helmet of some sort, it shines, but haven't gotten a great look. Very aggressive, reacts to the slightest sound or movement violently and quickly.

NMC2: A Thin, tall creature, It has a really light brown or creme colored fur that sticks out in spikes and hide its other features around it's face, with matted black fur everywhere else. it has small, beady, pure white eyes that look like they are on top of the fur, and a sharp toothed, wide horizontal, narrow vertical, vicious smile with the same property. It has what appears to be a shackle on it's left (from my view, from it's view, right) leg, with a dangling link or two hanging off of it that make a scraping sound when it moves. It's behavior is unpredictable, it can be either aggressive or passive, and changes between the two quickly and unpredictably. It (or at least it's passive side) appears to be trying to communicate with me specifically, asking questions and making statements, none of which make sense to me as of current.",24Aug2020,1
818,She will snap me but after I reply she won’t reply back she doesn’t do it all the time but it’s a lot of the time. I don't know if I’m worrying too much about it or not. I mean she might just not have anything else to say but it’s like why do you even snap me if you don’t want to talk? I’ve went on a date before with this girl but she wasn’t feeling anything so we stayed friends but I still like her a lot. I just feel like I don’t matter that much to her even as friends.

819,"Cross posted in r/amazon

I recently moved to a large city. My apartment building does not have a locked mail room or lobby, and unfortunately nearly every single one of my amazon packages have been stolen so far. I have added delivery instructions to call me at my cell phone number listed if possible (I am usually not able to hear the door bell in our unit) and each time the driver just leaves it either outside on the sidewalk or in the stairwell, to which I come out every time to check and see if it’s there and it’s always gone and they have not called or sent a message. 

I have had multiple people tell me to get an amazon locker, but the closest one to me is a 20 minute drive, and I do not have access to public transportation or a vehicle, so it wouldn’t be a viable option for me. I order from amazon because it’s the most convenient and I don’t have to purchase an uber to go grocery shopping or shop for essentials. 

Now, amazon has either refunded me or replaced every single item that’s been stolen, and I have been filing police reports, but still no word back from the police Dept on the status of my stolen packages. 

I guess my question is- how many more times will amazon send replacements/refund me before they just stop altogether? Sometimes my replacements get stolen as well but most of the time I have at least been able to keep my replacement items. I just feel awful having to keep messaging customer service 80% of the time when a package says it’s delivered but it isn’t there. I probably get 4-5 packages stolen per week, and actually receive maybe 1-2.",24Aug2020,1
820,I had sex with someone yesterday and I don’t know anything about their sexual history which I know is really bad but I didn’t plan on it and it just happened. Anyway I’ve noticed two large red bumps on my inner thigh close to my anus. They’re itchy and look like big insect bites. I’m really scared that it’s something else and I don’t know what to do as my parents don’t know I’m sexually active. I’m 18 by the way and everything was consensual. I just need some advice on what to do. Thank you,24Aug2020,1
821,"I have never really thought about it in that sense until someone pointed it out to me. Multiple people did but I guess I was just really oblivious to the fact. It started when I was 16. He was 28. He was my parents best friend which is how I knew him. He was very kind to me and I took a liking to him in the sense that he wasn’t a total asshat. Most of my dads friends were rude people that used him and it felt like he finally had a friend that didn’t do that and was also friendly to me. I appreciated feeling welcomed, I guess. He didn’t live close so he’d spend weekends here to hangout with my dad and I guess at some point he started being more than friendly to me. I was a virgin at the time. No big relationships, I was more focused on school. One night we rode ATVs which we did before in the past and we stopped and were just sitting there and he kissed me and at the time, I felt really overwhelmed and confused but I liked it because I felt wanted. Things escalated over the next few years and he was the person to take my virginity and I was under the guise that I loved him. I really really liked him. He wouldn’t let me tell anyone about our “relationship” though and I was confused by that and it would make me feel bad about myself. I never understood it for the longest time. During my senior year of high school, my parent found a new partner and really liked them and was considering getting engaged and she was a total witch and I hated her. She was super rude to me and I’d talk to ole dude about it and he told me to move in with him. Several hours away from home. He said I could wait until I graduated and he’d help me move. And he did! I ended up going through with it because my mental health was awful and I was super depressed with the whole family situation going on. So I did it. I was in a completely new area and I knew nobody. I became dependent on him because I was lonely, I missed my friends. I missed my family so much. He told me I shouldn’t talk to them and with everything going on, I figured he was helping me so I ignored them. I confided in some coworkers about the situation after a few months of living there and working and they told me that it was not okay and explained it. I had never thought of it that way but now that it has been said to me, I can’t stop thinking about it. I really regret everything that happened because it put a strain on my families relationship and I love them so much. They still don’t know, I haven’t told them. I’m too scared to tell them out of fear they’ll hate me. Was I groomed?",24Aug2020,1

823,"Disclaimer: First post. This is really hard for me, but I feel like I need help.

**Current Situation:** I'm at 26 y/o gay guy . The problem is that I really like sexual foreplay and stuff. That gets me off, but I don't like trad. sex. I like meeting up with guys for like hj, bj, and some fetish stuff, but it's always NSA fun. I really enjoy these tbh, but I feel really fucked up in my group of friends who are mostly straight and are all settling down, getting married, starting families. Even though they try to include me and stuff, I feel like I'm such an outcast and a failure. It's getting harder and harder to relate to them, so I feel pressure to settle down too....but given what I like sexually, it's really hard. 

I've seen a therapist and we've worked towards a few options for me to take: 

1) **Continue:** Maybe I just haven't found the right person yet and I should just keep doing what I'm doing until I do find the right guy.

2) **Change what I'm looking for:** Start looking for someone who will separates the sex from the emotion. I've heard of people (guys OR girls) who are just looking for companions in life, and maybe I find that one person who would allow me to do my 'activities' on the side? (probably pretty rare though)

3) **Change my behavior:** What I'm doing isn't conductive for my future, so I should work towards fixing my sexual practices to fit a monogamous relationship. Therapist said that this would be the hardest, and would require a lot of sacrifices, but if I want the 'traditional' relationship, then I would have to work towards it. -- well as traditional as a gay couple gets.   


**Background:** I'm out to my parents. They're kinda supportive. I've dated 4 girls and a guy before. The guy was the most recent relationship (2 years). Emotions felt good but the physical attraction fell off quick...and I feel like that with a lot of people. Also, I live in a pretty 'straight' enforcing community. I've pretty much tuned my behaviors at a young age, so it's not like I'm gay &amp; proud or anything like that. though more power to those individuals! It's just an added layer of pressure.

Anyways, I'm just looking for advice. Has anyone or anyone you know experienced something similar? I've tried asking a lot of friends and therapist for advice... I didn't want to admit it as a problem because of how embarrassing this is. But if you made it this far, I really appreciate you reading it and I'm all ears. Thanks!",24Aug2020,1
824,"Perhaps this may not be the most appropriate of subreddits for this, but I feel like I need to figure out how to do this and whether it is even worth attempting again. Earlier this year I have joined a certain sub that I would rather not name here and spent a couple of months on there. I had quite a lot of fun there, suffice to say it has also helped me overcome certain issues in life that I would not have otherwise dealt with and I have formed quite a few friendships with many good people. About 3 or 4 months ago however I have left it, due to me losing my Reddit and Discord accounts, due to my losing access to the Gmail account tied to both of them and the Reddit account getting nuked later, which I presume got either hacked or pruned by Reddit.

Now I feel like rejoining, however, I feel like I would have a hard time getting back in after months of absence and I have lost quite a lot of content and my hard-work when I lost that Reddit account. How should I proceed here?

828,"So I met someone online a few months back, and after a couple weeks talking, he asked me out. I agreed. When we first started talking, I was excited at the prospect of dating someone again. It was part of helping myself get over my previous relationship, which ended pretty dramatically and abruptly (not going into detail here because my IRLs and boyfriend know the story, could end up being identifiable information). But being with him just isn’t what I want any more. He’ll pop up out of the blue with random facts or information he wants me to know about, but isn’t there when I really need to talk to him. I’m a bit grossed out by sex and don’t really like discussing it, but he was constantly talking about what he would do to me. He’s inadvertently offended me several times, and just could not work out why I was upset no matter how many times I carefully explained it to him. I want out, but I don’t want to hurt his feelings. Is it better to hurt his feelings than to stay in a draining and unfulfilling relationship? I feel like I liked the idea of a relationship more than I like him.",24Aug2020,1
829," So, some background: I belong to a group, where most of my good friends are.  I also have other groups, but i consider this the main one and i care about it the most.  There are about 7 (ages 15-16) main people (including me) , who have been always with the group throughout the years.

 During the summer, new people join and hang with us. Usually we don't accept them straight away, but after some time they become our friends. If you don't tolerate somebody, it's not a very big problem, because new people usually leave us, when the summer ends (They return to their old friends or understand that there's not much to do in the autumn and winter) This summer, 2 guys joined our group and i absolutely hate them (I will call one Mark and the other James so it is easier to explain). Okay, that shouldn't be a problem because they will leave, when the summer ends, right? No, it's pretty much impossible, because they have achieved a very good relationship with all of the people in that group. 

 But what is the problem with them? There are a few things that disturb me and they are all pretty stupid. I'll start with my main problem. The guy named ""Mark"" likes one of the girls in our group.  I also happen to like this same girl and for a very long time now. But the problem is that this girl already has a boyfriend, who is also in our group. That's why i have been pretty passive with that girl, but i have built a very good relationship and trust level, so i have a good chance, when she eventually brakes up with her boyfriend. But now, this Mark gets along with her annoyingly well.  They are like best friends. It causes me a lot of stress, when i see them together. 

  The other problem is that he has stolen my place in this group. When they are at someone's place, partying or just sitting and talking, i can rarely go there, because there's always this excuse ""There are too many people, there is not enough room."" It is understandable, but it makes me very sad, because before them i was always with my friends and i was never left behind . Also this same problem is related to James as well.  One other thing that annoys me is that these two look like idiots. They are this type of men, that get along with girls and other men usually don't like them. It is hard to explain, but i hope you understand. one important detail is that nobody knows that i hate them, so it is easier to mess with them.

 And why am i talking about it? I need suggestions on how to tolerate them better or if anyone knows some ways to get them out of this group (can be a very mean way, i don't care), then please comment. I also couldn't fit all the details here, so if something isn't clear, all questions are welcome!",24Aug2020,1

832,"Hi everyone! I'm struggling a bit lately and was hoping for some insight from you all.

TL:DR: I keep finding out that my ex-boyfriend/current friend wasn't loyal to me throughout our relationship and it's doing a number on my self worth. 

For a quick backstory, I had dated this guy for four years; two years in college, two years living together post-graduation. While we were together in college, he was hellbent on keeping our relationship a secret and not telling our friends. His reasoning was so that he could focus on schoolwork without our friend group getting up in our business. I'd catch him being kinda flirty with other girls, but he reassured me that he's just naturally a flirty person and nothing was going on. Still, my gut was telling me otherwise and when I'd bring this up to him, he'd get pissed off, tell me I was being overdramatic and jealous, etc. I had tried to breakup with him a couple of times because of the flirtiness, but he'd sob and get on his knees begging me not to, so I thought that meant he cared. I began to believe him and was convinced I was a crazy, immature girlfriend.

This past January he broke up with me and honestly I'm glad he did. He was a mess, I've never seen him so upset, he said he really didn't want to do this but knew it was best. He told me he was having mental health struggles and, even though I had a lot of sh\*t I needed to get off my chest about things he did in our relationship, I just told him that I'd be there for him if he needed anything. We've remained friends and continued to hang out as a group. Post-breakup, I've found out more and more about crappy things he did in our relationship and it's eating me alive. For starters, he got back with his highschool ex (who lives across the country) the WEEK after we broke up which, even though he denies it, pretty much confirms that they were talking behind my back while we were together. I've also found out about him messaging different girls and flirting with them but then telling them he didn't want a relationship (never mentioned that he already had a girlfriend), he would tell people he was single, he had a tinder ""for the joke of it"" but I found out later he was trying to meet up with people, found out he was making eyes at my friend's girlfriend, etc. I don't think he ever physically cheated on me, but he was DEFINITELY emotionally cheating. He's recently started making sexual gestures at me when we all hang out and telling me I'm pretty. It makes me upset because it's disrespectful to both me and his long distance girlfriend. I don't want her to have to go through the same thing I went through when we had dated. I'm in a weird place because he's a great friend, but was an incredibly hurtful boyfriend. 

Even though I'm not romantically interested in him, it's been killing me to keep hearing these tidbits of information. I'll be doing completely fine, but then I'll hear yet another story about him flirting with girls behind my back that just knocks me out. And seeing him flirt with me while he's with someone new confirms that he was probably doing this with other girls when we were together as well. I'm having trouble not blaming myself. I feel like I wasn't good enough or pretty enough or sexy enough. I feel he was ashamed that I was his girlfriend and that's why he never publicly acknowledged he was in a relationship until after graduating. It just feels really crappy and I'm scared that every relationship I get into will be the same. 

Has anyone ever dealt with something like this? How do you find value in yourself again? How do you move past the things that have happened in the past?

Thanks!",24Aug2020,1

For context I will be starting the next step of my academic career at a new High School in 6th form (equivalent Junior) - it's the best place for me to go to study what I want whereas my friends are all staying at on at the same place.

836,"I’m a 13 year old male. I have really bad anxiety and paranoia, and possible depression. I’m going to just say what happened.

Today started off as normal, the last day I’m staying at my dads until I go back to my moms place. Browsed reddit for a while, ate and all that. Then I start talking about something with my dad, and he turns it into a lecture about how he hates my mom and my stepdad because my mom “cheated” on my dad with my stepdad, even though I full well know she didn’t.

He starts saying that he wants me to keep some of the stuff that I brought over to stay here at my dads. I try to argue against it a little but he insists and gets a little mad at me. I end up just walking to my room to cool off for a while and then when I come out he asks “Can the stuff pleeease stay here?” as if he’s a child or something.

I end up saying that I wanna bring my stuff with me because it’s... my stuff. And I just try to go back to my room but then he says “Y’know what, no. I paid for it. It’s mine. Your stepdad and mom don’t get to use that shit.” And I storm off to my room once again and try to vent to my sister who has been through a lot of the shit ive gone through with him.

Also, by shit we’ve gone through with him, I mean as in he broke my sisters shit, try to get my mom arrested for child endangerment, and he also used to BEAT my mom. I fucking hate him. I then figure out my sister texting him about something and he calls me over to ask what I was texting her about, and I of course lied to not make things worse.

But I’m scared now, considering that he’s emotionally abused me, beat my mom and broke my sisters shit, what if he finds out about the texts I sent to my sister about him? I’m scared he’ll hit me, beat me or some shit. I always think of the worst. What if he does something to my family when I’m back home? What do I do?

844,"hey all! so I'm still processing all this (and I will for sure reach out to a therapist / professional) but I'm also kind of looking for advice / talking things through myself, I haven't even told my wife about this yet. So here goes:

I just discovered a couple of weeks ago that an uncle of mine molested my sister when we were younger: she told me about it. I wasn't given specifics (nor did I ask for them) but from what I gather it happened when she was like 14-15 (I am 38 and she is 35 now). This was a blow to me on two fronts- not only am I devastated for my sister, my uncle is somebody who I spent a lot of time with growing up and has always been a role model to me, so it was really hard to learn this about him.

I immediately went to my mom, and I discovered that my mom, my aunts, and my grandmother all knew about this and decided to say nothing. Their reasoning is that he makes by far the most money of anybody, and he is directly supporting several of his siblings (and by extension my cousins) and his mother (my grandmother), and were he to remove that support they would be in dire straits, especially since as he's gotten richer everybody's started to take more and more of his money (including me, though I will never again take a penny from him). 

While I kind of get this line of argument, I don't think it's sufficient. I am quite sure my other sister and my other uncles would react the same way I did, and it seems monstrously cruel to let them continue to take the money of someone they think they respect without knowing the whole truth about him: I think (hope) they are made of sterner stuff than they're getting credit for, and that we would figure out a way to keep the family going even without him.

Additionally, even putting aside the pain and hurt he put my sister through, there are plenty of other children in the family: who knows who else he's done this to, or might do this to? their ""solution"", as far as I can tell, has been to just make sure he's never alone with any of the children in the family, which feels so very, very wrong to me (Also how can you make that decision for the other parents?! assuming they don't know...) Additionally, the fact that my sister is telling me this now seems to me that she's ready to confront this and is looking for help in doing so, given that she never reached out to me before like this. 

I'm not in a position to be able to prop up the rest of the family, but I am having a really hard time believing complicity is the right play here, and to be honest I'm feeling a lot of anger towards the rest of my family and the whole coverup and I can feel it building even as I write this out. So I guess the advice I am asking, from others with a level head, is this: 1) what is the right move here? do I confront him? do I raise it publicly and confront it head on? and 2) if I should keep quiet, how on earth can I face him again at family reunions? how can I face my family? I can't imagine just laughing and making small talk knowing what I know now.

847,So I’ve been getting harassed online now for about 3 years. This person has such hatred towards me to the point where they’re threatening to leak my nudes to my parents. I’ve been dealing with this for so long that I’m used to it. But lately they told me they’re gonna send videos of me and pics to my parents and tag me. Idk who they are bc they hide behind anonymous accounts. I need advice bc I’m just in a panic now. What should I do? I’ve been wanting to track their IP address but don’t know anyone or how to do it.

We're college kids living in a street where most houses are rentals, and most people aren't taking COVID seriously.

We were having a few people over in our backyard. Neighbors hollered to ask if they could come over. We said nah, we're trying to keep it low-key, some other night, have a good one. Real polite. 

One of them said, ""Just trying to meet the neighbors,""  all aggressive-like. They left our yard, and thirty seconds later a beer bottle smashed into the side of our house.

Obviously it's not a huge aggression but we don't want to take it lying down because we don't want some assholes thinking they can push us around.
 
We'd also not rather confront them directly. We could contact the police, or the manager of their property, but we don't really have any evidence.

852,"My mom has an old cat she doesn't care about much. I've been taking care if her well for the past year. She has hyperthyroidism. She's on a special food to keep her thyroid levels in normal range. She's also been consyipated, but the vet can't figure out why. She also keeps scratching her neck raw, but im applying ointment, and have a cone on her. Lately she's barely been eating. Shed acting normal, but I suspect her hyperthyroidism is getting a hold of her, because she's lost a little wait, and she keeps yowling at the door, and escaping outside. I called the vet about it, and they reccomended I brought her in to get weighd, but I've put thousands of dollars torward her, and while I could afford to do more, I'm not willing to put in anymore mentally or financially.  Told the vet that, and I was thunking of having her euthanized. They said I would have to bring her in to be examined first.. they called my mom, and said we dont have to bring the cat to the vet. I think its cause shed convincing the vet that I'm making all this up, and the cat is fine.. It's not my cat, and I didnt expect it to be so expensive.

853,"This has honestly been a complete gut-punch to my day. There are tedious little things at work I forget to do sometimes, but I generally work on some of the most successful accounts at my company -- largely because of *my* efforts.

Today my boss reaches out (since we're all working-from-home this week) and wants to have a call over my work. From the moment we get on, it's like I'm in front of a one-man firing squad, that he's *seriously* implying I'm not doing enough work.

The shitty thing is, we have this guy we hired last year, who *constantly* fucks things up. But, he's also constantly asking for more work, despite his screw ups. I feel like I'm being compared against him, despite the fact that I think it's far more important to manage 4 successful clients than 5-6 that you're constantly having to make other people double-check your work.

It's just... it's super deflating, but also makes me a bit angry. I literally woke up at like 3am Saturday morning, and just decided to do some extra work, to ""stay ahead"" of things.

854,"I'm a full-time college student this semester as I'm working my way into transferring next semester, I also work 18 hours in the week. I recently found the skill of cutting my boyfriend's hair because during these times, it's hard to go out. I started to learn and with the help of my boyfriend and following youtube videos, I'm a decent ""barber"" but it takes me hours to finish up a cut. We've also split the cost of these really nice clippers and trimmer, so I automatically let my boyfriend keep them because really, we'd be the only one using them or his sibling could. I live in a household with only girls, and my dad is the only male.

Once I had asked my dad if I could practice cutting his hair but he was defensive and didn't want me to. Now all of a sudden when he has no place to go to, he wants me to do it, whenever and wherever. He doesn't consider if I'm busy, or if I have homework/classes. When I often bring up to him that I have stuff to do in the day, he says ""but you always have time to play video games, dance, or watch shows!"" Keep in mind that although I'm 20 years old, I haven't touch my console in months due to being busy, and I dance because it's a hobby that keeps my mental health in check, and I watch shows in my free time because I need ME TIME. 

The first time I cut his hair, he constantly put me down because I had kept asking him what kind of haircut he wants. He told me, ""I thought you knew how to cut hair? If you're not comfortable, then I'll go to my friend's salon!"" This struck a nerve and hurt me because he often says a lot of hurtful things and he NEVER understands, because shit never gets through his head. I was tired and honestly I gave up a lot of stuff in the day just to deal with this kind of attitude when I could have been doing my summer work or working on my own stuff.

Fast forward to today, he texted me in the morning telling me to ""cut his hair."" No, ""can you cut my hair today please?"" or ""Are you able to cut my hair today?"" I had already planned a day to go to my boyfriend's house because life has been terrible at home, but now it's even worse waking up to this negative energy and I can't even go to my boyfriend's house now. When I told  him I didn't have the clippers, he got mad and said ""What do you mean you don't have the clippers? I thought you were gonna cut my hair? You said on the weekend!"" And yes, I did say I'd cut his hair on the weekend, but he had work all day and came home at night and never informed me an hour or two ahead about these things acting as if I can drop everything I'm doing and cater to him.

I told him that I have stuff to do today and he got angry with me, and he was telling me to contact my uncle for clippers. I just shut my door and let him deal with it. He expects me to do things for him all the time without realizing I have my own life.

We already sold almost everything we have, sold our phone, all we have is our laptop that I am using to continue working. Last week our landlord visited and is asking for the rent, we were not able to pay our rent for about two months now since my grandparents catch covid and all of our money is used to support them, my grandma is still at the hospital alone, fighting for her life and all, while our grandpa didn't make it. We used our savings paying for hostipal bills and cremation, (they are living with us) also, we are on strict home quarantine since we have direct contact with them so going out and looking for money to pay her is not really possible at the moment. I still have work that is paying me weekly, that would be around 50 USD. It's a great help but without our business, it's nearly impossible to survive, I have my parents that is in their 50s and two brother that is below 16. I was looking around, reaching out to old friends and classmates to borrow money since our landlady that she will kick us out next week if I wasn't able to pay her, I can't blame her though, she is just running her business. No one is willing to lend some money, but some old classmate reach out to me that if im serious on earning some cash, he knows someone that is willing to buy kidney for a patient. They are willing to pay me 500 USD. and that's a lot! I can pay our rent and that will help us survive for a few months, and if they were some spare we can save for the hospital bills of my grandma. All I have to do is to pass some physical tests then we will proceed to the operation. 

It's sounds like it will save us. But I'm afraid what will happen next? They will remove one of my kidneys then after that what will happen to my body? Am I still be able to work normally? Can I still function normally? Is it worth it?  I don't want to tell my parents about this they will not approve it and it will hurt them so much, so I cannot ask them for advice.

I wouldnt say I'm an arrogant person. I dont stick my nose up at others, I treat others with respect, I waitress myself, I'm generally a nice person. I'm not Canadian but I do that thing where I apologise for everything. What I've been told though, is that I am stubborn, and hate admitting that I am wrong. Which I think has some truth. So after thinking about it and reading stuff here and there, it sounds like an it's ego problem? I dont like to admit that I am wrong, and while I'd apologise for little things, it takes a lot to get me to apologise about the things that really matter, like in an argument with my partner about something I've done. 

And at the same time, I am stubborn about things that I am adamant about, even if it's not in a good healthy way, because again, I dont like being wrong. Like my partner would tell me what my actions would result in, but I'd refuse to believe him, and then continue doing it my way, but he turns out to be right in the end. And admittedly, it has happened a few times. But I am stubborn because even though he has pointed out what might happen (and it has shown that I would do better to believe him), I am always thinking that there is a chance that things might go my way instead and so why not take that chance. And that's all I am thinking of in that moment, instead of what is already pointed out to me. And when what he says comes true, he'd go 'I told you so'. Not in those words, but you get it.

862,"Hi,

To give some context I have been involved with this person for a year now. We dated for 4/5 months and haven't been together since January. We have built back up our relationship since then after he kept trying to have contact with me and over the last few months have built a really wonderful friendship. 

I do have feelings for him and the more we talk the strong they get. I know that he basically worships the ground I walk on, I am not saying this to be big headed. He regularly tells me how thankful he is to have met me, what an amazing person I am, he thinks about me all the time etc. He really fought to have a place in my life again and there is definitely a better level of respect between us this time around. I think he realised what he lost when I stopped being a part of his life earlier this year.

The thing that really bonds us is our mutual love for the same things, our ambitions in life, music, art, just lots of things. We hold the same values and for the most part our aspirations align... apart from when it comes to kids. 

We have never ventured into this topic of discussion seriously because we haven't been together long enough for it to reach this point. However, I have mentioned that I would like a child of my own at some point. I am only 23 but he is 29, nearly 30. He has no interest in having another child as he already has one. The birth mother of his child lied about being on the pill, didn't tell him she was pregnant and abandoned the baby in the hospital for him to deal with. So I do completely understand why he feels the way he does considering parenthood isn't something he chose the first time around. 

I really love him and adore him, his son too. I haven't met him but I always encourage him to show me pictures of him and to speak about his son because I know how important he is. As his partner or his friend I want him to be proud of his son and speak freely about him. I just question if pursuing anything more than friendship would be wise because I would be waiting for a hypothetical that may never happen and I want to have the choice on whether or not I want to have kids. If I were to be with him and wait a few years, due to our age difference he will be in his mid 30s and in a different place in life. We kind of are at the moment with me being 23 and him 29.

However I also realise how good we would be together and I can't say with honesty I could continue being his friend. If he were to meet someone else it would hurt me too much and I don't want that to happen. We haven't met up in person due to Covid but I just know that my feelings would get the better of me. They already do when we are just texting- I cant help but fall for him. I am human after all. I just need some guidance and maybe some advice from people who have been in my shoes.",24Aug2020,1

865,"So, I have been battling this alone since I was 13. I have never spoke to my mom about it because I was there when my sister died and I saw what she went through and honestly, I was terrified of bringing it up because I saw what she went through and I feel like I do not have any standing in comparison. But realistically, it has affected me tremendously and it has now come into my daily life full force. 

I am 27F. My sister was 5 weeks old when she died from Bradiacardia Disease that went unresolved at the hospital. She was a twin. Our sister, her twin sister (now 14) is alive and well. This may be long, so please hold tight.

At 13 I woke up at 2am to my sister crying. Her name was Hannah. This still bothers me a great deal and I still blame myself because at 13, I didnt want to get up and help my over-exhausted mother. So I sat in bed and listened to my sister cry until eventually she stopped and I went back to bed. I assumed my mother woke up to nurse her but honestly, I dont know if that is when she died or not because I never asked. This still haunts my every day life. The ""what if"" kills me and I, all around, hate myself for it. The following morning at around 5am I woke up to my mother in complete freak out mode. Screaming bloody murder. Crying uncontrollably. I now realize that it is a cry that only mothers possess. The cry of a lost child.

I remember jumping out of bed and running to my moms room. I remember seeing her holding my lifeless sister in her arms and watching her trying to breath life back into her. I remember my mom repeatedly saying ""Its no use. Shes dead."" repeatedly, as my step father was on the phone with paramedics. And I watched her collapse to the floor, pulling out her hair, beating that floor continuously with her fists as she was begging god over and over again to take her life instead and just let her baby live. When the paramedics came back inside, they told her there was nothing that they could do. That her baby was gone. 

That ambulance holding my sisters lifeless body sat in our driveway for what felt like hours. Multiple people showed up to console my grieving mother but she wanted no part of it. She paced our yard. Loop after loop after loop. Just walking around our home trying to calm herself. She became afraid of my sister (Hannah's twin), was going to suffer the same fate. After all, Hannah was the strong twin. Hope, her twin, had a bad heart. So, after the ambulance left, she brought Hope to the hospital and refused to leave, having Hope admitted to the NICU for further testing. That night I slept with my sister in my chest (she was 3 at the time) and every half hour it seemed, I was wide awake and freaking out thinking my sister wasnt breathing. This 3 year old was my pride and joy. My baby, so to speak. And I was terrified of losing her too.

The next day DHHS came in and removed my 2 brothers from the home, with the clause of there being a ""mysterious death of a minor"" within the home. That night I took my 3 year old sister and ran. I took her far away because I thought dhhs would take her from me. And eventually (2 days later) they did. They placed her in the custody of her father, who molested me. I buckled my sister into the car seat in his vehicle as she was screaming and crying from being taken from me. I had no choice. She gave me a lollipop and told me to remember her. I still have it. 

We battled foster care for a year. I was put into 4 different homes. I was taken away from the rest of my siblings. Eventually I was placed in a home with 2 recovering alcoholics. They were good people. But at 13, I didnt care. I started drinking and smoking a lot. They gave up on me 4 months in. But eventually, my mom did get us back. It wasnt the same mother I knew. She became mean and neglectful. I dont blame her though after watching what she went through and most people dont understand that. 

Now my question... should I bring it up with my mom? It's been years. But I now have 3 kids of my own and I still have nightmares of that night, usually around July 1st, when my sister passed away. However, now instead of hearing her screams in my nightmares, I hear my own. Instead of watching my mom holding her lifeless baby, I dream of myself holding my lifeless children (who are very much alive and well).

This is going to be quite long so get ready (I will be saying some history so it adds up to the title):

I am a 17(F) and lets just say.. my relationship with my mother is not that good- it really isn’t.
My parents always argue, and sometimes I argue with my mum so much to a point that I start having panic attacks which results in me shutting of my emotions for days, weeks or even months. 

I started this thing where it’s really unhealthy but I tried to stop expressing any sort of emotions towards my mum so she won’t give anything back: this means that I’m getting as little contact as possible with her so I just go on with my life without talking to her in days which makes me feel.. really good about myself.

Now I’m going to quickly add some history about my current events:

These past few years (around 2018-2020) have been extremely horrible and hard to go through, mainly because of my mother. There have been events such as my sister leaving with her boyfriend that she just met (literally less than a month) without having any sort of stable education background from secondary or college to back her up just in case the relationship doesn’t go well- that’s another thing that I will post later on but basically because of that any sort of action I’m doing that my sister did before I would get compared to and would be said that i will end up just like her and that I’m “copying her” but that’s another story: 
and my fathers heart attack that completely changed our family- for the worse. There have been other issues such as long and exhausting arguments between my parents that have caused one of them to leave but then coming back ( those sort of arguments happen around 2 times a week)- it’s become so normal that me and my young brothers just ignore it when that happens but sometimes the arguments turn from vocal to physical such as  my dad wanting  to beat my mother so I have to interfere and stop them from causing any harm. 

Now I will talk about me and my mother’s relationship:

I’m just going to start straight off by saying that she’s toxic, manipulative and self centred: I really didn’t want to speak rudely of her  but she has harmed me so much that most of my sui**** attempts where because of her: she would argue with me for the smallest things possible for example : I clean the whole house top from bottom without her touching anything as she has other things to do: I don’t mind it as I listen to music and I have been doing it for years now so I finish quite quickly but if she finds the smallest thing she goes absolutely crazy and then proceeds her in yelling at me about how other girls do so much work and that I’m useless and that I’m lazy and so on... 
she always talks about me behind my back, after a heated argument with her she would go to my dad and COMPLETELY TWIST MY WORDS and create scenes that never happened and when I tell my dad the actual truth she gives that bitchy teenager look of looking up and down at you while giving a disgusted face and let me tell you it infuriates me so fucking much when she does it,  I literally want to hit her. ( I know it sounds horrible but she has been so toxic to me through all my life that I can’t mentally stand it anymore). Not only that but then she starts swearing under her breath in front of me and then she says “watch when your dad isn’t home”

She always plays the victim card and I mean ALWAYS even though everyone tells her it’s her fault she won’t own up to it because she came from a rich background and she knows she isn’t wrong and that I shouldn’t judge her because I have never been a parent so I don’t know what it’s like and that you should never speak rudely of your mother because she gave life to me( I know it sounds fucked up that I don’t understand myself) she has this quote of saying “you can always replace a dad but you can’t replace a mum because the mother made you not the father” so basically if I was in her mindset this means( and some of these she said herself) “you can have any sperm from any sperm donation from any man but the mother will always be a mom” pretty fucked up right? And she also says “a mother can be a prostitute an alcoholic ext ext but you can never judge her”- I agree with her on that but then she completely contradicts herself because she starts judging other women and saying “ oh she looks slutty what a whore” or “who the fuck would even marry that bitch she’s so ugly “ and she would compare her weight with everyone especially fat people, making fun of their curves and weight and saying “ how will she fit there ahahah “ and once again she’s completely contradicting herself because she’s literally a fat bitch herself but anyways, no mom losing 5 pounds doesn’t make you go on the next extreme weight loss show but anyways you get the idea.

One major event that completely made me hate her was when she found out I was cut**** myself (legit because of her but I could never tell her that) and she then proceeded to compare me to my sister because my sister tattooed herself with needles , poking herself and she thought I was scarring myself and writing words on my arm to look cool ( I don’t know where the fuck she got that from) and I told her that i wasn’t trying to do any of that and it was self harm because I was really depressed and I did try to take my life on many occasions: I told her about how I felt and all the events that added up on that but she didn’t know that children can feel sad, stressed or depressed because they weren’t parents yet apparently so she proceeded to yeet me across the room and drag my hair- such a supporting and loving mother right?

The most painful event that I ever had was when I told my mother that my sister se****** as****** me when I was young (around 6-7 for around 2-3 years without me realising that what she did was wrong and when I told her about it she said “it isn’t even that bad at least she didn’t put anything in you and your still a virgin” and the most fucked up one was “ her boyfriend didn’t do anything right? It wasn’t a boy it was just her a girl? So because it’s a girl it’s not a big deal your over reacting” and when I tell you I snapped I fucking snapped I told her how the fuck can you say that, it took me YEARS to confess this one secret that I have hid from you for so fucking long and she knows how s****** as***** is like because she experienced it so I don’t understand why she had to compare herself to me because she said “ I had worse you know so stop over reacting your still a virgin”

There are so many more events and I feel like if I write anything I will create a whole fucking book, much more than the entire Harry Potter book collection so we will move onto the main part of this:

Now that you have a brief idea as to how she acts like I will talk about this year and the most current events such as today even and why she makes me extremely uncomfortable:

So up until February 2020 I didn’t get my period at all and I went to many doctors because all the females in our family got their period as early as 8 years old and I was the only one that was 17 and I still didn’t get it. Of course I get that any parent would be concerned about that but she goes as far as to checking my pants to see if there was any blood and one time ( this is very fucking disgusting) I saw her putting the clothes in the machine and then proceeding to look at my pants and then omfg I can’t even type this without making me cringe and then she legit smelled my pants. I swear to fucking god I legit came from hell and back and I was about to yeet myself off a bridge.
Ever since then I have been hiding my pants in my trousers or even my shirts so when they go to wash she won’t notice them and she would put them directly in.

Up until the end of April I finally got my period but she would talk about it so much that she would randomly bring it up at the dinner table while everyone is literally eating and it makes me so uncomfortable as I want to keep that to myself so I try to hide it as much as possible without her knowing anything. 
She would even go as far as to tell everyone that she talks to about my later period and it makes me really uncomfortable.

Now onto the most recent thing:

This year my mum has been really clingy towards me like she would hug me and kiss me and I’m going to be completely honest and say I fucking hate it when she touches me or even talks to me, every time she touches me I proceed to go to the bathroom and scrub myself with soap until I feel like I’m clean and every time she hugs me I back away and she gets mad and says that she will take me to a therapist If this continues going on and that she’s my mum and she’s my family and why am I being so distant towards her.( I don’t like it because she hugs me really tight and then my breast touches hers and it makes me feel really uncomfortable but I could never tell her that because then she would say that she’s a woman and that I shouldn’t be uncomfortable) She always says to look at her but i can’t stand it and when I have to, it literally makes my blood boil and it gets me really annoyed so I then blur my vision whenever she forces me to look at her (idk if everyone can do that basically I can control my vision to go from clear to blurry so then I won’t see her face at all.) 

She would also come into the bathroom as I’m taking a shower and I absolutely hate it because of my past I cannot stand anyone to look at my body and she knows that but she still proceeds to enter the bathroom and look at my nak** body while I’m taking a shower even though I tell her not to. She always looks at my private parts especially my br*****  and because I’m the only girl in the whole family that has such small breasts I get made fun of and she would always compare me to other girls.

The most recent thing that has happened is that I refrain from giving her any sort of emotion so I look at her with an emotionless face but that gets her angry because she has “sacrificed herself for us and that she did it for nothing because I’m unappreciative while others have nothing and that I should be smiling every second because I have everything that I could ever want”

I’m much more closer with my dad because we joke around and have a great time but then she gets jealous and proceeds to tell my dad lies which separates us even more so I given up on trying to have any sort of bond with any of them because at the end of the day it just brings more arguments.

I don’t know what to do anymore and I’m so lost as to how I will continue my life when I have a mum like her.",24Aug2020,1

873,"I have many stories of unruly customers from my four years working in a fast food restaurant at the mall. I'm not here to talk about that, I want to know if there's anything I can do to fix my problem before I definitively decide on therapy. 


I finally left that job in February right before covid shut down the US. By the end of my time there I would always be grumpy and rude to customers, I knew I was being like this but just couldn't stop. I found something in almost every interaction to be irritated with. I dreaded going in every day. I was bitter and unhappy and it showed to my customers and I felt bad because they deserved better service than what I could provide. 



That was at the end of my time there. Since I've left, it seems that every night when I can't sleep (which is most nights) my mind will wander and it almost always goes back to specific unruly encounters with customers. I can't help it. I can't stop it. I've tried venting about it and letting it out, but that hasn't helped either. I'm wondering if I'll ever forget my time there or of ill be haunted forever and if there are some coping strategies to help me stop thinking about it all the time.

874,"2 young siblings, one of which doesnt really care about preparing for the future, just is careless

24, just finished college (paid for by myself), got a job recently (high stress with above average pay, money is a plus ), moved out 1.5 years ago

raised both siblings since they were born while i was a little kid

Heavily abused by whole family (either by neglect of what was going on or by direct contribution to abuse), reported it to the police several times (3+), nothing was done

recently reported it again and my siblings were removed from my parents house and put into my and my grandparents care.

My grandparents expect me to just buy a house for us to live in after all this bullshit, ive no idea where my siblings will go, ive no idea where i will go.

I dont want to buy a house, im fucking 24, i just got out of 20 years of abuse, what more do you want from me for fuck sake.... im still putting myself back together while moving on from the fact that everyone ignored what was being done to me, neighbors, school, everyone.

Why am I here? Well Ive the ability to leave in the foreseeable future 2+ years, but my siblings will be left with my grandparents and ive no idea what will happen, how they will help them off the ground without me.

Im just waaaaaaaaaaaaaay too tired of life, constantly having to think for other people, constantly being responsible for other peoples shit. I had some relationships with people of the opposite sex, but ive never had time or space to build anything with them, ive literally not lived a day of my life so far and i want to leave.

while i was growing up i was told i cant be responsible for them my whole life etc etc

I cant justify turning my back on them meanwhile just being too tired to keep putting up with this.

Im not sure where to turn, if i was in their shoes i wouldnt expect anything from anyone, but literally having the ability to help them pay for college or something that would get them off the ground.

What would you suggest i do? Buying a house assuming id even be able to afford it, in this current situation its an instant no, id need to somehow save my whole salary for 1 year to buy a house and cover all expenses.

Anyone in a similar situation just walk away from it all, hope they make it? I feel like its bullshit for me to do, but im exhausted...

Im too tired to even think at the end of the day, i guess my question is, is it justifiable for me to buy a small house to for me and them. I dont want them to constantly be with me like a ball and chain, by the time one of them will be able to leave assuming they do college or some form of training ill be \~30, the other id be 35-40.

Most common ages for male suicide are between 30-35, as of right now i know im not going to do that but fuck if this keeps going for 5-10-15 more years its that or i walk away and never talk to any of them.

I cant organised my thoughts any better than this, im exhausted. if someone responds great, if not, nothing new, thanks for reading",24Aug2020,1

876,"
This is going to be quite long so get ready (I will be saying some history so it adds up to the title):

I am a 17(F) and lets just say.. my relationship with my mother is not that good- it really isn’t.
My parents always argue, and sometimes I argue with my mum so much to a point that I start having panic attacks which results in me shutting of my emotions for days, weeks or even months. 

I started this thing where it’s really unhealthy but I tried to stop expressing any sort of emotions towards my mum so she won’t give anything back: this means that I’m getting as little contact as possible with her so I just go on with my life without talking to her in days which makes me feel.. really good about myself.

Now I’m going to quickly add some history about my current events:

These past few years (around 2018-2020) have been extremely horrible and hard to go through, mainly because of my mother. There have been events such as my sister leaving with her boyfriend that she just met (literally less than a month) without having any sort of stable education background from secondary or college to back her up just in case the relationship doesn’t go well- that’s another thing that I will post later on but basically because of that any sort of action I’m doing that my sister did before I would get compared to and would be said that i will end up just like her and that I’m “copying her” but that’s another story: 
and my fathers heart attack that completely changed our family- for the worse. There have been other issues such as long and exhausting arguments between my parents that have caused one of them to leave but then coming back ( those sort of arguments happen around 2 times a week)- it’s become so normal that me and my young brothers just ignore it when that happens but sometimes the arguments turn from vocal to physical such as  my dad wanting  to beat my mother so I have to interfere and stop them from causing any harm. 

Now I will talk about me and my mother’s relationship:

I’m just going to start straight off by saying that she’s toxic, manipulative and self centred: I really didn’t want to speak rudely of her  but she has harmed me so much that most of my sui**** attempts where because of her: she would argue with me for the smallest things possible for example : I clean the whole house top from bottom without her touching anything as she has other things to do: I don’t mind it as I listen to music and I have been doing it for years now so I finish quite quickly but if she finds the smallest thing she goes absolutely crazy and then proceeds her in yelling at me about how other girls do so much work and that I’m useless and that I’m lazy and so on... 
she always talks about me behind my back, after a heated argument with her she would go to my dad and COMPLETELY TWIST MY WORDS and create scenes that never happened and when I tell my dad the actual truth she gives that bitchy teenager look of looking up and down at you while giving a disgusted face and let me tell you it infuriates me so fucking much when she does it,  I literally want to hit her. ( I know it sounds horrible but she has been so toxic to me through all my life that I can’t mentally stand it anymore). Not only that but then she starts swearing under her breath in front of me and then she says “watch when your dad isn’t home”

She always plays the victim card and I mean ALWAYS even though everyone tells her it’s her fault she won’t own up to it because she came from a rich background and she knows she isn’t wrong and that I shouldn’t judge her because I have never been a parent so I don’t know what it’s like and that you should never speak rudely of your mother because she gave life to me( I know it sounds fucked up that I don’t understand myself) she has this quote of saying “you can always replace a dad but you can’t replace a mum because the mother made you not the father” so basically if I was in her mindset this means( and some of these she said herself) “you can have any sperm from any sperm donation from any man but the mother will always be a mom” pretty fucked up right? And she also says “a mother can be a prostitute an alcoholic ext ext but you can never judge her”- I agree with her on that but then she completely contradicts herself because she starts judging other women and saying “ oh she looks slutty what a whore” or “who the fuck would even marry that bitch she’s so ugly “ and she would compare her weight with everyone especially fat people, making fun of their curves and weight and saying “ how will she fit there ahahah “ and once again she’s completely contradicting herself because she’s literally a fat bitch herself but anyways, no mom losing 5 pounds doesn’t make you go on the next extreme weight loss show but anyways you get the idea.

One major event that completely made me hate her was when she found out I was cut**** myself (legit because of her but I could never tell her that) and she then proceeded to compare me to my sister because my sister tattooed herself with needles , poking herself and she thought I was scarring myself and writing words on my arm to look cool ( I don’t know where the fuck she got that from) and I told her that i wasn’t trying to do any of that and it was self harm because I was really depressed and I did try to take my life on many occasions: I told her about how I felt and all the events that added up on that but she didn’t know that children can feel sad, stressed or depressed because they weren’t parents yet apparently so she proceeded to yeet me across the room and drag my hair- such a supporting and loving mother right?

The most painful event that I ever had was when I told my mother that my sister se****** as****** me when I was young (around 6-7 for around 2-3 years without me realising that what she did was wrong and when I told her about it she said “it isn’t even that bad at least she didn’t put anything in you and your still a virgin” and the most fucked up one was “ her boyfriend didn’t do anything right? It wasn’t a boy it was just her a girl? So because it’s a girl it’s not a big deal your over reacting” and when I tell you I snapped I fucking snapped I told her how the fuck can you say that, it took me YEARS to confess this one secret that I have hid from you for so fucking long and she knows how s****** as***** is like because she experienced it so I don’t understand why she had to compare herself to me because she said “ I had worse you know so stop over reacting your still a virgin”

There are so many more events and I feel like if I write anything I will create a whole fucking book, much more than the entire Harry Potter book collection so we will move onto the main part of this:

877,"So, you could say I'm a normal 16 year old boy who likes skateboarding and working out. I've been told I'm a really nice guy, but I'm also a very very shy person. I live in Ireland, and you are probably think I would be seen as a ""cool kid"" as I workout and skateboard. The thing is that I'm actually one of the odd ones out, well that's how I feel anyway. A lot of teenage boys wear all black, smoke, drink and put on a fake North Dublin accent in order to seem tough. When you walk past these guys in the street minding your own business they always have to say something in order to intimate you. I was once walking home from school and was called a ""faggot"" for going to an irish speaking school. Me and my cousin just told them to ""fuck off"" and they did. I was approached by three guys in a park once while I was with my friends, they tried to intimate us by pointing a toy gun in our faces. My two friends just went along with the joke and put there hands up and pretended to be scared. I was in a really bad mood at the time and I didn't give them the attention they were looking for, so I kept looking at my phone. He then grabbed my phone and kinda shuffled away hoping I'd chase him. After I realised they walked pretty far with my phone, I had to do something. So I stood up quickly and shouted ""give me back my phone you cunt"". He turned round quickly and said ""what the fuck did you say to me"". I repeated what I said. Him and his friend started pacing towards me. I felt safe enough seen as I had my two friends behind me and they are both very strong. I grabbed his shirt and kept calling him names. I let go of his shirt as it could cause him to hit me. He kept pretending to give the phone back. I was shit scared that I was gonna get hit. All he wanted was for me to fight him, this guy is well known around here and I knew where he lived and his name, but he didn't know me. He ended up giving the phone back and walked away. I was so shaken up, this was the first time something like this happened to me. My friend walked me home as I was too frightened to walk home myself.

Ever since then my anxiety around these type of guys has spiked. I went out skating and saw a group of guys on bikes headed towards me. Three of them go to my school so I knew they wouldn't do anything to me. He said ""what's the craic"" as he passed and my heart sank and the anxiety kicked in. I just nodded at him. I really don't know what to say or how to act around these guys. Sometimes they try to intimate me and then I get defensive and just tell them to fuck off, then they suddenly want to start a fight. I get so nervous around these guys because if I say one wrong thing I could get myself into some serious shit. Some of these guys are really nice. If I started having a conversation with these guys they can be really nice and they don't wanna intimidate you.

Sometimes in school one of them would ask me a simple question, and Id be terrified even though I have absolutely no reason too. A lot of these guys like me in school even though I don't talk to them much. Like I'm not one of those so called ""weird kids"", I'm an alright looking guy and I've had a girlfriend before. I just don't know what to do when I'm around these people. 

Does anyone have any advice for this kind of problem. I'm not looking to become friends with any of them, I just want to not be so nervous around them and I want to know what to say one of them tries to intimate me. I'd say well over 60% of boys in this country are like that, or they try to be. It's like these guys are completely faking who they truly are in order to be cool. They seem pretty confident but in reality they are probably forcing it in order to look confidence. 

If anyone has any advice for this i would really appreciate it.

879,"It is second time when it happens. In the first time, when I leaved from my grandparents, I started cry at night, because I was afraid that they can die and I thought only about it, I can't stop cry, but after about a hour I slept. At morning everything was better and I stopped think of that(It was 20 or 25 days ago). 

       So it happens again, I leaved from them and I literally don't wanna talk, don't wanna hear anybody, don't wanna read. I am so afraid that they can die and it kills me. My grandma is a great woman, tomorrow she talked with me about my life, she gave me some advices that really works. I slept in one room with my grandpa, every night he turned on radio and this radio was like lullaby(I really love it). 

       I can't believe that they can die, I want to see their faces again and again, I want to hear their voices again, I want to talk with my grandma again, I want to read with my grandma again, I want to listen to the radio with my grandpa again, want to watch TV with him again.

880,"There’s this guy, I’ll call him Steve. We first met last summer and became and became very close friends. We agree that we understand each other on a really deep level. 
Steve and I go to different high schools, so once summer ended we started seeing less of each other but were always in the loop. Every time we hung out, even though it wasn’t as often, we always had better conversations than I can say I’ve had with most people. He’s witty and very sweet, and we have a lot of the same interests in common. 
Recently, we reconnected, and last night we admitted that we’d both had on and off feelings for each other. After that it was really awkward because neither of us are sure what to do now, so we agreed to hang up and talk about it tonight. 
I want to be in a relationship with him, but I’m not sure it would work out. 
Steve is going into junior year and I’m going into sophomore year, but we’re two years apart in age because he redid kindergarten. I’m having trouble telling if that’s a big deal or not. I think it would be fine, because there are way worse age gaps in high school dating and there’s no weird power dynamic between us, which is usually what would make the age thing weird. 
Also there’s the pandemic. His mom is super strict on social distancing so we wouldn’t be able to go over to each other’s houses.
I’m interested in pursuing this because I have a really strong connection with him. However, I’m afraid that if we start a relationship we’ll run it into the ground somehow. Is it worth it to try?",24Aug2020,1
882,"Hey guys, I'm new to Reddit, Just signed up like two days ago, and this was one of the most recommended pages (forums? Groups? Maybe it's forums). I really hope you guys can help me and give me unbiased advice and opinions through the wonderful tongue-loosening agent that is internet anonimity. 

Any way, I have what may be a pretty disturbing question that is going to have to be preceded by a confession: I was raped. Now that we have that out of the way, it happened in college about 3 years ago after a party. It wasn't one of those gray area things where we were both drunk, either; I really didn't want it, and I was preeeetty explicit in my insistence. Like, screaming, kicking, fighting level insistence. Not gonna go into the details of all that (if ya want, you can ask, but I don't wanna make this a novel soooo...) but long story short, I'm a girl, he was a guy, biologically superior, obviously I was pretty easily overpowered. I mean, dudes get raped and abused all the time too, obviously, I'm not downplaying that. Anywho.

Here's the weird thing that's gonna lead into the question: I was completely fine afterwards. Like, emotionally if not physically. I literally didn't even cry, I legit just took a shower, did my homework, yes, my homework, and watched YouTube. I went ahead and waited til we both  graduated while keeping track of the guy, sent an anonymous email to his boss telling him the whole story, other things were uncovered, and suffice it to say he's gonna have trouble getting jobs from now on. Such a shame, all that work too; but that's why I waited. 

This is going on too long, so here's my Q: why was I okay? Why am I still okay? I hardly even THINK about the incident, I never have. So, I legit need to know if there could be something wrong with me or my emotions.",24Aug2020,1

884,"Background : I grew up raised by mainly my mum as my dad worked away from home, she was an aggressive alcoholic and hid it from my dad, she would drink throughout the week and get aggressive and abusive with me both physically and emotionally, to this day she is still the same however a little better as she works now, which keeps her busy. I have a phobia of both of my parents drinking nowadays as it always leads in chaos, because of this I leave for atleast a full day everytime they drink so I don’t need to be around them.

Problem : I don’t drink often, once a week max, I work full time and need to travel, which is difficult as I’m only 19 but it’s the choice I made, I ended a relationship of 2 years in February this year for several reasons, but secretly the main reason was that the girl had moved to university and would drink on average 4 nights a week, it repulsed me, I would be scared of what was happening at nights, she would sleep in all the next day, and would be hungover and tired when I did get to see her.

I recently entered a new relationship and really like the girl, but she has also just moved into a dorm, same as my ex, and this new girl is a bigger drinker, when uni begins in September I am worried the same will happen and I will spend nights worried for her, and for myself and what may happen when she’s drunk, I know it’s an issue with myself but I don’t think I can handle her going out every night till god knows when with all her guy friends from uni and then being MIA for most of the next day.",24Aug2020,1

That being said I have several relatives that have gotten Covid so far and there are a dozen or so cases in my town currently. 

I am very thankful they are throwing this party for me and my baby so I'm worried if I say anything they'll think im ungrateful or they may cancel it.

We made enough food for everyone that would come, prepared enough drinks, space, etc. However when it was time only two of my friends showed up. At 3:00 I finally texted my friend asking where he was. He said he was at home and after more prompting he said he wouldn't make it because he had chores. I let it go for the moment but this really pissed me off cause he gave 0 warning and we would have prepared less food had we known. He wasn't even apologetic which ticked me off even further.

Do you think there is sort of a ""method"" or process to popularity or fame?

I know it's important to have a skill and something your good at . But when do you draw the line ? When do you say to yourself, ""I'm just good"" , nothing more ..

I've been street dancing for years. Putting out footage and putting in time to learn . But I've noticed every time I upload something of me dancing, I get barely any type of reaction from friends and family, on Facebook.. compared to some other people online that I don't think are that good that get much more appraisal...

It's just frustrating ...
Don't know if it's me or why people can't show me love like I kinda expect them too .... I mean, it isn't the only thing I'm looking for but it would be nice .

On the contrary, every time I upload a pic of me and my girlfriend, or something lovey dovey about us , boom, it blows up with likes and comments . Just seems nobody is to really care about my entertainment side ...

890,"Heads up, I'm high so my English might suffer a bit.

So I recently graduated with my Master in Accountancy and have been working with a major audit firm for the past 2 months. The work is killing me, I'm not keeping up. I don't mind the work per se but we keep a timesheet and I always feel like I'm spending way too much time on something and end up working extra after work and during weekends to make up for it. This weekend I got fed up of using the only time I have for myself for work, I don't want to do this. I specifically studied so I can work office hours and then leave my work behind when I get home. So I thought I'd get over my anxiety (I suffer from anxiety and depression, FYI) and ask my manager how much time I should be spending on a specific task that was giving me trouble. And she confirmed my fears that it shouldn't be taking me so long. We went through it together and it was shorter because we didn't check the work but I don't feel comfortable not checking it before moving on. Anyway, in the end she told me it's acceptable for now that I spend a bit longer because I'm still within the budget for the client (but we will need these hours later, so I feel like I'm screwing my future self over)

I'm so overwhelmed and upset constantly, I'm considering maybe quitting the field and working something 'easier'. Maybe retail I guess. I can't think of many options. I understand that they still have their challenges but maybe hopefully I'd be better able to handle them. I used to enjoy waitressing. At this point I'll be rambling. Any advice?",24Aug2020,1

893,"A little back story: 

We met in school at 15/16 now 23/24. We broke up in 2016 and didnt speak for two years until we ran into each other in a train station of all places. Before we dated we were best friends- we did everything together and it was great. 

Then we started dating and I admittedly got jealous of how many girls he had as friends. He would mildly flirt with them. One time he stayed overnight at a female friends house and he said I was abusive because of my jealousy. To stress, I didnt have a problem with him being friends with them- I had a problem that there weren't boundaries. But maybe I was in the wrong- I was abused sexually by a family member when I was younger and every family member I've relied on has, in some way, betrayed me. I don't have the greatest meter for what is healthy and I do have trust issues, though he knew that when he started dating me and I have tried to fix them with therapy ect. 

Anyway, when we would fight he would hang up on me and ignore me. Wouldn't talk. I told him it bothered me and I would prefer to discuss it with him and fix the issues. But usually any fights would result in him disappearing for hours or days and not talking to me at all. He broke up with me in 2016, we were both away on holiday. He did it by text after ignoring me for days right at my birthday. What triggered him ignoring me was I had made a joke that by the time we got back from our respective holidays his best friend,who genuinely loved his sister, would probably be dating by the time we got back. It was completely innocent and he knew his sister and friend had a thing. I chased him constantly in the relationship and after- then I gave up. I was devastated. I haven't dated and just focused on me. For two years nothing.  

Then I randomly ran into him in the middle of one of the busiest train stations in London. We talked. It was great. I had hope. He said I should come up to where he was and see him and rekindle. Things weren't working out with the girl he has been with since breaking up with me. I pushed for some commitment/honesty about how he felt and it blew up. He ghosted me the exact same day he had 2 years prior. I didnt hear from him for a while then randomly he starts messaging. 

Most of it is niceties of how we are doing in our respective lives and what's going on but then there is the ""I dont want to cut contact with you/ you're the one person from my ""old life"" I want in my life"" ""I miss talking to you."" Bits that I don't like. It feels like he is pulling me back in. He is never consistent with communication and will randomly quit talking to me- he's usually busy with his new girlfriend when this happens- and then he comes back. I've blocked him but then have guilt or doubt that I'm being mean. 

When he said I was abusive during our relationship, it made me feel terrible it still makes me feel terrible. That was the worst insult you could give someone who has been abused in the past. So it's made me doubt if I'm being over reactive and mean. If I am actually doing the right thing. 

Am I wrong to cut him off? Am I crazy? I feel like this isn't healthy and that he is gaslighting me but I've been wrong before...",24Aug2020,1

897,"My mom is a nice lady, but she hasn't understand life at all. She taught me things during my childhood that are incredibly naive. For example that the only thing that matters in life is to be happy. That hard or difficult things should be avoided if it causes too much effort. That it is ok to give in to instant gratification at any time. And so on.

I'm 21 now and I understand that this is wrong. Not just from a personal point of view. There are many studies who actually prove that it is wrong empirically. Instant Gratification is really dangerous. Happiness is not the same as goodness.

But I completely lack any kind of discipline. When I didn't want to go to school my mother would just let me skip it. When I wanted any kind of fast food my mother would get it for me. She basically taught me my whole childhood long that I only have to do stuff that releases dopamine. 

It's not like I'm a failure I go to med school and stuff. But I still lack discipline. Of the 24 hours a day I sleep 8 + hygiene so let's say 15 hours a day to use productively.. And of those 15 hours I do something useful for maybe an hour a day. Which means I could be 15 times as productive if I were more disciplined.

898,"I am feeling majorly guilty right now, this has all kind if happened so quickly.

Everything kind of started a few months ago. We were camping, and it was a drinking by the fire kind of night, I was feeling pretty drunk and had a few tokes of a joint. Everything started off fun were all listening to music talking, drinking and dancing. I like dancing, and have been wanting to learn country and this girl is quite a good country dancer, and were all dancing switching partners and she starts dancing with me. One thing turns to the next, its getting super late, everyone is pretty turnt, she starts telling my mom that she wants to have sex with me (super weird) but I'm thinking she's got to be crazy drunk right now. Anyways that night she wants to go look at the stars and wants to kiss me, but I was drawing the line well that night, telling her no it can't happen and so forth.

Anyways... fast forward I tossed it up to a crazy drunk night and I'm feeling I did right and drew some solid lines. Well yesterday I drink a little too much, more then the camping night. Again same scenario were all dancing to country, she starts telling me to close my eyes and feel the music, puts her head to mine (weird) I'm thinking, but I'm pretty drunk and in hindsight feel I may have been instigating what's to come. boom, we finish the last dance and I am not locking eyes or anything and she just straight up kisses me! I didn't expect it or even see it coming, I remember being super drunk and feel super guilty cause I feel like I may have come off as flirting when we were dancing and God I feel just awful right now. I feel I failed at drawing lines this time through, and it has been in no way malicious, I don't even want anything, I did not want the kiss or to aid in her cheating on her husband things are really spiraling out of control at this point. I feel like I should've been able to handle it better and just feel like I am very much in the wrong. But on the same token I also feel like this shouldn't even be happening cause this is not at all on my radar, I am not wanting this, its just happening it is so weird. I don't know what to do, or how to handle it. I am trying to think if I am at fault, what I could have done differently to avoid all this, am I guilty for dancing and my mind is just spinning.

It gets worse! So I go off to bed, her and her husband are sleeping over cause to many drinks were had. I wake up in the middle of the night with her in my bed! she had snuck in and was talking to me. Me, half drunk, in a complete daze and confusion had no idea what was going on. I kind of just ignored her as she spoke for probably an hour trying to cuddle up with me and I feel like a piece of shit, I didn't tell her to leave but she was telling me how in love she is with me and I was telling her this cant happen. But, I am still drunk even writing this I hardly remember the conversation. I remember that I basically just started ignoring her and was falling asleep again. But, I also remember I ended up scissoring, which I have so much guilt for too like what the hell was I thinking, why would I even do this or instigate all this further. I know I was drunk and half asleep and didn't ask her to sneak into my bed AND I SLEEP NAKED. This is not okay. I feel like shit this morning, majorly guilty and embarrassed. I am usually super respectful and coherent when I drink, this is so not like me. It's causing me to fear myself and my ability to stop this. Like I feel in hindsight this is partly just cause I haven't had any affection from someone in a long time, and I guess it kind of just felt good to be cuddled and wanted. BUT I know its definitely not something I want or am actively seeking or make into a thing.

Am I in the wrong here? like what could I do better. I am definitely going to avoid dancing with her, drinking too much around her to impair my judgment calls. I mean we don't even talk to each other through calls or text or nothing like that, its just so weird and random. As of today I realize that this may not just be a drunk thing for her, I feel like she's actually having feelings. Something is off.",24Aug2020,1
900,"Essentially, recently my small town school district was featured on the cover of the New York Times for sending out hush-hush emails to teachers, saying that they are not to talk about if they have been exposed to COVID, and the school district is incredibly secretive about whether or not there are any confirmed cases, appearing to take the Disney approach where their positive cases are 0 because sick kids are secretly removed, and their classes are quarantined without notifying any parents or teachers.

This is a big sour in my generally anti-Trump family, and my mom who works for the school system is saying that it’s all lies, the whistleblower is doing it for her “political agenda” and the more the story spreads the more stressed out she gets, saying “they’re making us look like idiots, and it’s all a lie.”

This came to a head when the ex Secretary of Education called out my school system for these things, and my mom says “it’s making me sick”

Now, I am a leftist and I take COVID very seriously, and reading the article, it’s completely legitimate, and I mean it’s the NYT like they probably know more than my mom. And I can’t see how ratting out the local school system is in any way good small town PR, so the “agenda” concept doesn’t make sense to me.

Is my job to just agree with my mom, to deflect the situation, or to try to explain that I think some of the people she works with are shitty and that this is a very serious thing she’s discounting. I’ve tried saying “it’s not you, it’s the school board that’s making these choices, no one is blaming you,” but she doesn’t really accept that.

911,"It’s been a while since this has happened around 5 years. I was in my last year of high school. I had a group of friends that now when I look back on it were toxic people. They would constantly degrade each other and make fun of one another but most of this was done by one guy. He was not really the leader but the one everyone was fascinated with. He would say stupid things and do crazy stuff. He was ridiculous but that’s why people liked him. He would also go after people and insult them for periods of time. 

Well I suppose it was my turn this time. I have never really done well with insults and remarks because of where I grew up. So I would go back and forth with him. This went on for a long time and the insults would get worse and worse. He couldn’t really hold his own against me. I bested him when it came to insults. I didn’t want this I just wanted to be friends. Deep down I really liked my friends. 

One day we were sitting in a group waiting for class. He would not stop and finally I insulted him about what he was wearing. This made him angry. He said some stuff back and finally I hit him with a huge blow I talked crap about his father that left him. This totally enraged him. 

He literally lunged out of his seat and just grabbed me by the collar. I went back in my chair. We wear just them in this position for around 15 seconds of me hanging on the chair him over me grabbing my collar. I told him do whatever you want you are the one that’s gonna get hauled away. So as he lifted back up me with him he gave the sighted little slap on the one side of my face. I did the same. He then responded with a bigger slap to the other side of my face. 

At this point for me time froze and I considered my options. I could fight him or back away. I chose to let go of him and back off. I put my hands up and just said fuck it. 

He started to laugh and try to clown me. I sat down and stared at the guy. He eventually left when he could tell that I was rethinking my choice. I said some unsavory things when he walked away that I do regret. 

I didn’t fight him that day because I knew that if I did we both would have gone to jail. We would have both been in serious trouble. Depending on how it turned out it might have affected my application to college. I might have had a criminal record. I don’t know. I feel like I made the right choice. But I can’t help but still feel hurt and my pride still feels lost.  

I know that he was jealous of me. When I look back at the people he targeted he was jealous of their lives. The only time he went after someone was when they fought back and they had a life he was jealous of.

I always tell him to work hard and to clean up after himself and that if he wants a good future he needs to study and work on himself. He ignores me and says he is sorry but NEVER does anything to change himself or to help. I wanna make sure you don't think I am shit talking him even though he is disabled, because he has a mind of a normal healthy person and he can still move and operate at his own, even if it's slower.   
Anyway, I just had an argument with him about how one day I will move out and if he plans on staying with his parents forever and letting them take care of him. He obviously said no, so I asked what his plan is. He doesn't have one. I tell him he can learn many things he can still do even though he is disabled and that he doesn't have a single hobby beside gaming. I am a gamer myself but I take care of the household and  clean, cook, etc. My mother works 14 hour shift more than 4 times a week. My dad stays at home to take care of my brother, but he fails at doing it. My dad is a whole another story that i don't want to talk about right now. I don't know how to motivate my brother to become independent, find hobbies or do anything at all. I tried so many things and I care about him and don't want him to end up in a bad place. I would like to ask advice about how I could motivate him, what hobbies he could try and pick up, what you would personally tell someone like him.. I am lost and tired of trying my best to help him while he doesn't really care about it. I hate the thought of moving out and leaving him to my old parents to take care of him. It'd make me really happy if you could help or give advice. Have a good day.

919,"Help, I feel like I create more and more problems and I do it all myself! 

Feel like I need to put this down so that I can be free
Last month has been rough for me, to say the least. 

I was very anxious about my birth control. I felt like I could not, well, control it, so I was just absolutely overwhelmed and scared, which resulted in a series of mental breakdowns. 

Later on, when I have finally found peace with it and decided to give hormonal birth control a try, I thought I was over it. Turns out, I had some more health complications to fix, which were rough on me again. I concluded that I have serious health problems anxiety which are the result of suppressed emotions and decided to dig into my brain and fix it. 

Bum, I did it, I realized what was wrong and that I need to let some things go. Later on, I finally start hormonal birth control. Not even 5 days in, I notice acne. I am so frustrated. 

I know that this might not be a result of birth control, since there were sudden changes in my diet and Make-up, but i cannot let this anxiety go. I am so scared I did it to myself. I have a very good skin naturally, so I am extremely worried and sad. 

I am trying my best to keep myself calm, but I notice that I have more and more crying sessions and breakdowns. I don’t want my family and my boyfriend to deal with a sobbing mess of a person and I feel very selfish to cry about simple couple of innocent pimples, but I can’t help it. It feels like I am drowning. This circle of problems is still there even though I know that I have solved nearly all of them. 

I am now disappointed in myself, since of the acne is in fact hormonal, then I did it to myself. I am guilty of it, but I also will have to deal with it since I want to be on birth control. I am devastated. 

On top of that, I really do have an amazing boyfriend that loves me, and I feel like i am such a bad person to him lately, with all the crying and self-centered behavior. I want to change, but every time I try, I am lost and end up having another problem pop up.

Guess I am just becoming an adult atm (I’m 19) and start to deal with real problems, but I find it so difficult to manage my emotions and my behavior. I know that I can do it, but right now I am so helpless it seems. 

I had to put it down here. I am so scared right now and I feel like I do these things to myself, but I have no idea how to stop... I mean, I keep finding new problems??? Why would j be SO anxious about such simple things, what is going on...",24Aug2020,1

930,"So my brother (f2m 26 -no sex change) just had twins 4 weeks ago and has a 5 year old daughter with his husband (m-nonbinary 30). They've always had a rocky relationship. Back in the day it used to be physically violent and emotional/mentally violent on both of their parts. They've been together 11 years. When my neice was born, they got a lot better and dropped the physcial violence part, got marriage counseling and started trying to be better to eachother mentally/emotionally. 

I (24f) been living here the past 2 months with them to help take care of my neice and the babies but I go back home to my husband (26m) Saturday (I live across the country in the Midwest while they live in the south). My brother wanted to come because they're scared their husband won't step up in how they care for their children and they often start fights. My brother also has a really mean and stand-offish tone with him most of the time though. 
My BIL filed for a divorce to keep my brother from leaving with the kids (in this state its legal for either parent to run off with the children if the couple is still married and there is no legal action pending). 
Really, it's such a simple fix. My BIL has the option to work remote, but doesn't want to. 

If they just watch the way they talk to eachother and stop putting eachother down, they could be so great together. They have a lot of good moments but I don't understand why they go out if the way to hurt eachother 

My brother is on maternity leave for 12 weeks and my BIL is being mean about it saying he doesn't need help around the house or with the kids because 'he doesn't work or do anything all day'. They can't really believe that, right?

It seems like such an easy fix. Talk to eachother better, split the bills down the middle when my brother goes back to work, write up a parenting plan and stick to it. 

They're both getting annoyed with me saying stuff such as ""thats abusive"" during their fights and aren't on speaking terms. 


I don't get it. I'm married and have been in my relationship 7 years, and when we are mad, we still talk. We still address what's going on and put our passion to the side. We don't have children though. It hurts me so much to see how afraid my brother is for me to return home Saturday. I don't know what to do.

I plan to precook a week of meals and freeze them before I go. How can I get the two of them to be more mature about this? I don't know how to help them and feel so helpless just going back home when they're in such a bad state and there's 3 kids here. Because of the divorce order, he can't leave with me and my BIL says he won't drop the divorce petition until after I leave because he is scared my brother will run with the kids. 

How can I help? I'm so nervous and sad and it hurts to leave my sibling here knowing how alone, overwhelmed, and sad he is. Both my brother and his husband have anxiety and my brother has clinical depression and it is now coupled with post partum depression too.",24Aug2020,1

935,"This is my first reddit post so if the formatting is off, I apologize. 

I’m 23F. I work at a pizza place as an assistant manager making pretty good money, definitely enough to get my own place. I have an AA &amp; BA in Psychology and was in the process of taking prerequisite classes to get into nursing school. I have the two programs that I want to apply to, I have two classes left (one starting tomorrow), and even started looking at apartments in the city I would go to the school at. I recently finished an intense summer anatomy class and had to quarantine back to back so I’ve been away from work for a little over a month. My sister (20) and I are on the same track to start nursing school but recently we’ve been talking about not going and getting our own place together to pursue what we actually want to do. I love graphic design and writing and she’s still trying to figure it out but we can easily afford an apartment together while we work and figure out what our real interests are. The only reason why it’s a “crisis” is because all our lives we were conditioned by all the adults in our family that unless your job is a lawyer, a doctor/nurse, or an engineer, you’re not successful. Our parents, specifically our mother would likely be depressed if we left school AND moved out at the same time and I know I need to be concerned more about my life and my happiness but it’s just really hard to break away from that mentality that was so ingrained in me. I want to leave, be on my own and pursue a career in freelance graphic design/making logos for companies or content/creative writing and I know the salary might not be the same as a nurses but I’m kind of at the point where I don’t really care about that and I just want to be happy. I kept trying to find reasons why i should be a nurse but I could never come up with anything except “that’s what you’re supposed to do” And i could probably get through nursing school but when I’m done and I have the job, I know for a fact that I would regret not trying this. 

Summary: I’m 23F, i have two more classes before applying to nursing school. Family told me to be in the medical field my whole life and I’m realizing that’s not what I want to do. I already have two degrees in psychology and want to pursue graphic design/content writing (or just something different tbh). Parents would likely be upset.

Another thing might be I do leave her on delivered for long periods of time and I probably shouldn’t have yesterday cause she needed help with some math homework and yeah I left her on delivered that was a bad move but I really had something to do and so I kinda forgot about it.

this morning she ghosted me and then I texted her to see if she was mad and she said no, I replied to her text by saying it was nothing (I totally felt like my gut was trying to tell me something like something wasn’t ok) I forgot what I said after that but I asked her if she wanted to come hang out at the mall this weekend with some friends, I accidentally opened her text and didn’t see it (using Snapchat) I asked her what she said my bad, she then tells me “lol” and then once I ask her again she says “I don’t even remember.” Like huh. Then ghosts me the rest of the day.

Isn’t the first time this has happened, it doesn’t bother me as much anymore but it still does. I was thinking about facetiming her later to see what’s wrong. The thing is if I said I knew she was active and ghosted my message and snap, she would’ve got mad at me and I would then make her uncomfortable which I don’t want to do. i know for sure she saw it and then doesn’t wanna answer it for some reason, I heard from someone she used to complain about me not answering her.

946,"Throw-away/side account since my boyfriend follows my main account.

Hello everyone! Recently I have moved into a house with my boyfriend and his friend. The house belongs to his friend's mother, and the two fellows have known each other for a long while. I actually didn't meet his friend until it was suggested that I move in (to be close to my college). 

I guess I'll call my boyfriend B and his friend F for simplicity's sake.

At first when I moved in, the three of us would have designated times and activities to all hang out. The house was fairly open and I felt comfortable being there. (We would play video games together/watch each other play, drinking games, and watch slasher films), but after both B and F got fired from their jobs, situations have shifted heavily. 

I attend full time college and have my parents shooting money my way so that I can focus on my studies and go back with them once I finish my degree. I have been relying on B and F to buy groceries and other household needs. Since that hasn't been the case I've now essentially become a glorified maid/errand boy. (I've had to dig at least 100 USD into my savings to get groceries)

It suddenly seems like I'm no longer allowed to hang out with the two anymore. I understand ""bros before hoes"" and ""you can't be one of the boys if you're dating one of the boys"", but honest to the gods I don't even feel like I'm dating B anymore. We hardly spend time together and what time we do spend together he's either mad at me (for telling him to search for jobs, to do chores, or buy toilet paper since he uses ¼ a roll to himself every time he takes one of his hour long shits) or is having sex with me. I feel like a glorified flesh light during what little time we spend together. Every time the two do something together, they close the room door and occasionally lock it. I don't feel like a part of the household/group anymore. If I am 100% honest, I feel more emotional connection to F right now than B because he seems to care about me more and support me more than my own partner! (For example, if he sees me struggling with something he'll lend a hand, if I ask him to do a chore he'll comply, if he sees me working on something he'll help and make it go by faster, when he orders food he'll get extra and let me have it, when I'm having a cold flash from being anemic he'll lend me a hoodie)

954,"tw for depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts (not current.)

I have a therapy appointment in 3 weeks, but I don't know how to calm myself until then.

I've struggled with anxiety for most of my life. I also have an unusual fear of abandonment that doesn't hinder my day-to-day life, but it has its ups and downs.

Exactly 8 days ago, my grandfather passed away. It was expected, but it shook me. His funeral was on Wednesday and I haven't felt right since then. Everyone expected my sickly grandmother to die before him, so my family is scrambling to take care of her, which leaves my dad out-of-state most of the time, and we know she's got less than a year to live.

Today, I learned that my music teacher has cancer. I've known her for a little over a year, but she was a ""replacement"" for someone very important in my life (he could not teach me anymore as I'd gone beyond his expertise.) This will cause some big life changes for me, and I'm incredibly worried about her.

My dog is older than I am, and she's hanging on to life by a thread. She's perfectly happy, but she's fully deaf and beginning to go blind. She's the only reason I'm alive- 2 years ago, I told myself I should wait until she died to end my own life, but evidently, I got much better and she's still kicking. I know her time is coming, though.

I've managed to convince myself that my therapist is next, and I'm worried about just about everyone in my life. I have no reason to believe this, although she probably isn't taking coronavirus as seriously as she should. If she died, I wouldn't have any trustworthy adults in my life other than my parents- I've moved on from 2 different ""parental figures"" in the past year. I know, logically, that she won't, but I can't help it.

I also can't  help but worry if it'll be my dad next, or my favorite teacher, or even one of my friends. I just feel hopeless.

I know my therapist will help me get through this, but I can't live with these thoughts. By the time my appointment rolls around, I'll have stopped showering daily and I won't be able to focus in my classes. I can feel myself spiraling already.

955,"I have a genetic mutation that affects all my organs, how my immune system and metabolism functions, and also affects the consistency of all my tissues. The differences in function are great enough that certain medications either do not work on us or work in unexpected ways.

I read about the COVID vaccine. I have a flu shot yearly but I would like to opt out of having a vaccine that tampers with my DNA. First off, in humans the mRNA vaccine causes viral particles to constantly be produced as the vaccine is literally hijacking the cell into producing viral particles through alterations in the body's DNA/RNA. This could easily lead to the immune system attacking healthy cells, or causing too much of an immune response over time. In MCAS, the immune system is constantly or nearly constantly mounting an immune response, leading to whole body inflammation. In short; a constant immune response to antigens is never healthy, especially in the long-term.

Is it possible I could opt out of having the mRNA vaccine on the basis of my genetic mutation? If so, what is the best way I could tell people/authorities that I do not wish to have the vaccine?

I am fine with normal vaccines that introduce a dead virus/bacteria into the body, such as the flu shot, meningitis shot, TB, etc. But I am not okay with a vaccine altering my genetic code that has also never been properly tested for long term health effects.",24Aug2020,1
956,"Ever since covid hit and school started being conducted online my grades have taken a major hit. First year, first semester, my grades were amazing. Second semester, they were still pretty decent. Now? The difference is night and day because I can't even get good grades even if I tried. 

It's pretty much been a combination of me not being independent enough to work on my own at home and the fact that the grading is way more critical since its online. Safe to say that I can't adapt very well to all this. By the time I actually started to care halfway through the semester, even my best work I gave couldn't seem to yield results because I was behind in some courses.

Tomorrow is the last day of the semester and I'm just starting to realize how big of a mistake I made. Initially, I thought there was a slight chance I was gonna fail a certain course. Turns out there's another one which I am most probably going to. Basically, I have a really important assignment for which something had to be submitted at least. Otherwise, I fail the course. I got only 15% of it done because I couldn't even figure out how to start. But then there's a presentation based on that assignment, which I've been contemplating on whether to go for since I basically have nothing to talk about. As a final nail to the coffin, I realized that there was another part to the assignment which I didn't do and submit, meaning that since I technically didn't submit it fully, it might be game over for me.

I don't think I'm gonna go for that presentation and I don't even know what to do right now. Retaking a course is going to cost me and I don't really have much confidence in doing well anymore. Never thought I would've wanted to go back to having classes on campus everyday again.",24Aug2020,1
957,"Hi there,


I graduated from secondary school in 2019, with no clue what I wanted to do. It’s been this way for years now, people telling that I have to figure out what to do after school.

Well, I went to university for a semester and absolutely hated it so I left (no regrets). I’ve been pretty depressed for the last year because I feel like everyone is getting ahead in life and I’m just lying around in bed, day in day out, trying to figure out what to do.

A couple months ago I figured out that I wanted to become a paramedic. I don’t know why I didn’t realise this before, but it’s pretty clear for me now.

Sounds great but the thing is, I literally have no motivation to go university. It’s so much work to get in in the first place, and even more when you are doing it. 

I’m also terrified it won’t work out again, and I’ll have wasted another year of my life.

People always tell me, when you find what you want to do, you will have the motivation to do it, but this just isn’t the case for me. With anything basically I can’t find the motivation to do anything other than sleep, eat, and workout every now and then. 


I really want to do this, I really want to do all the training, but at the same time I know it’s going to be a lot of work. 

So my question - how to find that motivation? How to stop lying in bed all day??",24Aug2020,1

960,"I [25F] go to a local beach a couple times a week in the summer. I always go alone and arrive there around 8am.

The past 3 times I was there a man who is probably in his mid to late 50s has been talking g to me. He goes for a run there every morning and 3 times he has talked to me (and today and one other time before he acutally sat down bear me to talk).

At first I didn't mind. We were just talking about general things and a little bit about work. I didn't particularly want to be talked to, but I didn't wanna be rude so I participated in small talk, and he would usually leave after about 20 minutes.

But today before he left he asked me if I'd like to join him for a coffee sometime. I became a deer in the headlights at that moment and just froze and didn't say anything.

He then said ""I guess that's a no?"", and then I said no that I don't really want to. 

He apologized, to which I replied ""that's ok, no harm in just asking"". He then started commenting on how he's probably too old for me and my parent's wouldn't like that, but no harm in getting a coffee. I asked how old he was to which he replied ""I don't really wanna say""

He then reapeted ""no harm in getting a coffee"" about 2 more times, which I ignored and did not reply to.

He then said ""well I gotta get going to do some work, it was nice talking to you I think you're pretty and attractive. Did you want me to give you my number"". I said ""No thanks"". He then gave up and said ""ok, hope you have a good day"" and left.

Tbh that kind of made me feel a little creeped out and a little mortified. I did not appreciate him asking me out, and never really wanted to talk to this guy in the first place. He's probably my mom's age!!

And although he left after a while, I'm afraid he'll bother me again next time I go there. And I'm afraid that he might keep pressuring me worse next time.

And I do not want to chnage around my preferred routine of going there early just to avoid him. I'm never the first one there anyways and by the time he gets there there's ayleast a couple families at the beach  too.

So my plan for next time (although I pray it don't happen again) is to sit near (as in within earshot of) other people and if he tries to sit down to talk to me I'll say ""last time you made me uncomfortable b when you asked me out for coffee and when you wanted to give me my number. I don't appreciate that and prefer that we don't talk anymore and wish to be left alone"".

Is that a good plan? If not does anyone have suggestions for a better plan? 

And what if my plan doesn't work and he either keeps bothering me or makes a scene? Should I threaten to call the police (or actually call the police)? 

Also important to note that I don't really have anyone that can come with me to the beach. Both my parents and my sister work and I don't really have any friends.",24Aug2020,1

This guy will send him text after text asking to play the Xbox together all the time, and just to have his attention, regardless of what my friend says he is occupied with, and if he doesn't reply in a bit then he continues to text and often manipulates him by saying things like ""Sorry, I'll just leave you alone now. I'm a bad friend"", and my friend always gives in and just gives him what he wants. He tells me he is so tired and doesn't know what else to do

I've told him many times to stop giving him what he wants whenever he asks for it, and I told him that if he can't cut him off without feeling bad, then at least just distance yourself a little, and I also tell him that when he is busy, to not answer his texts or look at his phone. Whenever I say this, he seems to almost not acknowledge what I say, and almost ignore my entire sentence, then just continues to rant. Sometimes I just let him rant, but when he says things like ""I don't know what else to do"" I feel like that's a cue for me to give some advice, since I've been in this situation before too, but everytime I do he seems to brush it off, and it frustrates me because I don't know what else he wants from me.

Yesterday he did it again and continued to tell me that he had school and this guy keeps asking him to play again, and I finally just told him that he's enabling this guy, and that if he ever wants to get a break or have peace he is going to have to grow a backbone eventually, and just stop replying, and stop enabling him, he's doing it to himself.

The thought of planning out my future gives me intense anxiety so I avoid thinking about it.

On top of the anxiety  everyone I talk to gives me a different answer about what I should do.

My dad encourages me to take things slow after high school and go to community college for a while before I decide if I want to go to a university. My mom wants me to take advantage of as many scholarship opportunities as I can and apply to colleges now. I don't know which way is better for me, but neither of them have any real advice about figuring out what I want to study.

My school has us do career option tests on sites like career cruising and xello but my options come out so broad that it really only shows me different careers that exist and not how interested in them I would be. It helps a little but not a lot.

Last year I took AP computer science principles and I found programming to be really fun and interesting and considered possibly going into computer science, but I don't know if I'm really cut out for that or if that's really what I want to do. I don't know anything about computer science other than what I learned in class and there are so many different career options in the field I really don't know to start researching.

I also feel like I have the chance of messing up my future if I invest into a career and find out that I really actually don't want to live with the career I chose.

So my boss told me that the executive director wanted to know if I wanted more hours. “No”, I said. First of all, I’m a full-time online student. You guys may be thinking “Wowww online student.” Yes, I can be flexible with what time I want to log onto my schooling but I can’t be that flexible. It’s an 8 week term rather than a 16 week term which means the same amount of work as a 16 week term but condensed. And even when I wasn’t in school and I worked here, I still didn’t want to go full-time because I don’t like my job so much to be wanting to clean hot ass rooms and poopy toilets all day.

I’ve already refused to work full time every time they offered which was like 2 times. 

I went to clock out and the executive director sees me and just giggles. Idk what’s so funny. Is it stupid that I denied more hours that I sincerely didn’t want? They want me to replace the girl who quit full time hours so they can give the new person they hire my part time. That way they won’t have to hire more than one person. That’s my speculation.

It's a government job dealing with truckers all day, and the amount of knowledge required is incredibly overwhelming. I feel like I suck at the job and am unsure of myself. It's a job where I never feel quite comfortable and have anxiety all day. However, the benefits are great, paid time off, positive environment and management, and like I said, pretty good pay. 

However, it has always been my dream to be a teacher. I started an Elementary Education program when I went to university but never ended up finishing the degree.

976,"I am 17, and feel very confused, guilty and anxious. Any advice/opinion would be much appreciated!

I don’t know if this is something to be worried about, I don’t think it is. Regardless of that, it has seriously been weighing me down and making me feel guilty, so I suppose this is the best thing to do. 

(I don’t know if this is the correct place to ask for this kind of advice, if not could you tell me a better suited subreddit) 

I am a 17 year old male, and I find the way I get aroused to be concerning and anxiety provoking. I seem to get aroused and excited when any male is naked and a female is also present and can clearly see the naked male. The part that worries me though is that it’s generally only males aged between 0 - 20 which does that for me. For example, I have lots of memories of watching males getting changed on beaches, with a female figure helping them or just simply present, and that really excites me. The female figure can’t be too old, anywhere between 5 - 30 is fine. It also depends on the way she looks as well. I would like to clarify, the part that arouses me is the female figure being there, without her I would not become aroused. It’s the excitement of a female seeing a penis, or a naked ass, that’s what really does it. Obviously this is problematic, and self control is the simplistic solution. I can’t go around spying on people getting changed, particularly because of the age. I never deliberately go around doing this anyway, I just sometimes happen to do it if I am in the correct environment, like a beach. 

I also sometimes expose myself to girls, but just the buttocks. I like to make it look natural, I might go down to tie my shoe laces but before that pull my pants down slightly. I remember doing this one day walking home from school, a girl was walking behind me and I bent down to tie my laces, my buttocks being slightly exposed. In school assemblies I remember I sometimes used to make sure my buttocks were exposed slightly if some girls were sitting behind me. All of this has also inevitably manifested itself into fantasies, which can be extremely powerful. I imagine I am going over to a friends house for a sleepover, and the mother has to put me in a diaper secretly before bed. I imagine I get stripped naked by girls, and they make fun of me. The list could go on. I make sure all of these hypothetical scenarios are realistic though, that they could potentially occur in real life. 

Anyway, to summarise. I get turned on when a girl/ girls (idealistically aged 5 - 30) are in the presence of a naked boy/boys (idealistically aged 0 - 20). Any scenario will do. Once again, it is not the naked boy that arouses me (thank god), it is the fact that a female is present. I also sometimes like to expose myself to girls/girl, but only the buttocks. Never all of it, it has to be realistic. Also, never the penis, that can never be played out realistically. 

I am VERY worried, guilty and confused about ALL of this. Why do I feel this way? Is there a name for this? Can I do anything about it? (By the way, I am definitely also straight, although a naked female never arouses me the same way this does)

977,"Alright fellow people of reddit. I find myself in a rather unhappy situation regarding a woman that I have been seeing for a bit of time.(Month and a half) Things started off really awesome between us. We talked and facetimed every day for weeks. We had a really really good connection. Mutual hobbies, mindsets, opinions and just random stuff. Like, I've never had so much in common with anybody, and same for her. She was up front from the get-go that she wanted to be friends for awhile as she was not ready to be in a relationship. She had gotten out of a committed 3 years relationship just 2 months prior to meeting me, and claimed she just wanted to be single for a period of time. So with this in mind, I kept engaging her with interest and spurts of affection. We had grown to be very flirty with one another and one thing led to another. Long story short, we ended up going on a few casual dates. We didn't sleep together, but we were physically affectionate(I won't go into exact detail). There was definitely a spark between us. Awesome chemistry. It was mutually felt too. As time went on, she had told me a few times that I scared her. I asked her to explain and she basically told me I scared her because I seemed perfect for her. I checked almost all of her boxes for what she's looking for in a man. She was scared because she was afraid she would end up pulling away and as a defensive mechanism and push me away from her. I assured her that I would be able to handle it, if that time came and that it wouldn't deter me from pursuing her, even if I had to wait. Well, that topic came up a couple times and she explained more and more each time. She elaborated on how she had left her last boyfriend because she was no longer happy and wanted to be on her own for awhile. She was interested in the prospect of dating me in the future, which I happily accepted. I'm not the world's most patient guy, but I know a good woman when I meet her and this one was worth waiting for. I know it from head to toe that this girl is very strong potential for me. Some more time passed and some things happened that pressured her into basically backing off of me. Her mother was prying into her about me and wanting to know who I was and why she was already talking to another guy so much so soon. This angered her obviously. One day I spilled a little too much of my feelings and she ended up snapping and telling me that she wanted to remain friends for now. That we could no longer go on dates or be affectionate. Nor would we engage in messaging in any sexual way. She basically told me I was friend-zoned temporarily.(She made sure that every time the ""friend zone"" came up, that it was temporary.) She's not the type of person that says things she doesn't mean, I can say that with 100% confidence. Anyways, it was seemingly a light-hearted discussion at that point and we were kinda goofy with it. Later in that discussion, she told me to view this as a test. (Women love to play games...) I asked if she thought I'd be able to handle being her friend, and she said ""I think you'll let your feelings get the better of you."" Following that, we still talked frequently and facetimed. Everything seemed very reserved, but we still conversed a lot and it was nice. We even went and got lunch last week and it was very enjoyable. I can tell there's still something between us when we're in person. But me being an emotional guy, I ended up spilling to her that this is really hard for me, that I miss feeling like we had a deep connection and that I missed feeling as though she was interested in me. This led to her telling me that she thinks we need to stop talking everyday like we have been, that it would help us both. I told her I disagreed, but I would do whatever it took to make it work. She had stressed to me numerous times that she felt like we were moving too fast. Which kinda contradicts her behavior towards me. She flirted very much, and she showed me physical affection on our dates. It was mutual, 100%. Even if I had to wait months on this girl, I will. I understand that waiting is an unhealthy mindset to have, but you must understand. This girl is my match. She's what I've been looking for for over 5 years of being completely single and unattached to another. Her and I both know there's potential in each other. I would be a complete fool to throw away the moments we've had and move on. So here we are about 4 days after that discussion. We've texted extremely little and when we have, she would end up using 1-2 word responses or outright leave me on read, no matter how casual the conversation. She did facetime me randomly a day after that talk and we spoke for an hour and a half and it was great as always. It refilled my tank, metaphorically speaking. Since then, there's been no more than a dozen words between us and it's really bothering me. 2 of the days that went by, I think I may have said ""have a great day"" or ""good morning"" and I was greeted with the bare minimum of ""you too"" etc. I didn't message her at all yesterday because I wanted to see if she'd say anything. Of course she didn't. So comes today where I tried to have a casual conversation about her classes starting and she sent me 1-2 texts of few words and ended up just dropping the conversation. I don't know about you guys, but being ignored is something that doesn't sit well inside of me. It's not a self-esteem thing, nor does it make me question my worth, or anything like that. It's more of a ""you can't spend a few minutes to have a genuine conversation with me out of your entire day? What the hell did I do to you?"" My natural reaction is to blow up and get emotional and ask if she even wants me around any more because she doesn't talk to me, hardly at all. So far I have refrained from hitting her with anything confrontational for a few days.(Be proud of me because that's hard af for me) I THRIVE on communication. This girl is very very direct about what she wants and thinks, but if it's anything feelings-related, she throws up a wall and won't give me much. The few times I've approached her about this sort of thing, she's pushed me back a bit, until now to where we're not even conversing. I should have kept my mouth shut about how it made me feel. It fu***** sucks guys. And to make matters worse, she's still on facebook dating and she's getting to know other men. Not going on dates with them or anything(that I know of) I guess that's part of being a single woman. You just get to pick from a pile of dudes and see who's best. I can't tell her how much it bothers me. I'm extremely competitive when it comes to other men. But being like that is so mentally exhausting, and it puts me in an angry place of jealousy. I prefer to stay out of that domain of thinking. I did ask her to let me know if she finds somebody and engages with them, and she told me she would. I try to rest assured that what was/is between us is stronger than what she could be forming with others. I think to believe that the things she told me about how she felt towards me, was/is true. If those things are true, how can she cast me out so abruptly and suddenly? I've been extremely transparent to her. She knows this is hurting me, despite my best effort to pretend it isn't. If we texted semi-regularly like we were 4-5 days ago, I'd be golden. I am fine with being her friend right now. After all, she did tell me that she wanted to back track back to being friends and develop a romantic relationship with me that way, in the future. My issue here, is what is the mindset that I have to put myself into in order to give this girl her space, while her still knowing that I AM interested in her, that I'm not giving up on her? Let me reiterate, she knows me. She REALLY knows me. How can I real my heart back enough to be patient with this girl? Because I'll be honest with ya'll, I am in love with her, and I know she can't love me back right now. No matter what she does feel for me, she's not ready to love another. How in the world can I push my feelings down for awhile? This whole thing has really hit me hard, as backtracking with somebody that you have deep feelings for is absolutely gut-wrenching, at least to me. Obviously I cannot relay everything we have said to one another regarding the situation, as that would take hours of digging and taking screenshots lol. How do I face this going forward?",24Aug2020,1
978,"TL;DR: Broke up with boyfriend and he's shown me after talking that he finally understands that his toxic behavior is bad. He's willing to actively change. I don't want to fully get back with him unless I see actual progress. What rules should I set and what to do/not do?

Hi everyone, I will admit the title does sound bad and I know if your SO doesn't understand their toxicity after so long, that you shouldn't bother. But hear me out, because I can definitely use your help.

We've been together for almost 3 years. The relationship was great except when it came to disagreements. Thats where his toxic traits come out, the disagreements would evolve into fights where he's solely trying to win, puts his emotions first, undermines my feelings, and whenever we fight it just seems like all his love for me is thrown out the window. I've realized that he's perfectly capable of comforting me when I'm hurt/sad over something that wasn't caused by him. But when it comes to me feeling hurt because of a misinterpretation of his words, me being sensitive (such as during pms/period), or simply because he said something I didn't like, he would automatically become defensive, get angry and frustrated that I even feel that way. And in majority of our fights, he ends up getting mad and caught up over my delivery of my emotions or how I'm not also taking into account his emotions.

I've come to realize that I was so in love with him that even though I saw the red flags, the gaslighting, and the manipulation, I ignored them and threw them out the window. I kept hoping that with my patience I would be able to change him for the better and help him realize that his behavior was wrong. I know that our disagreements should not always turn into fights and that they shouldn't always be so draining for both of us. Every disagreement we have should not take so long and be so hard to resolve. In these 3 years, my mental health has taken a toll, partly because of him and other life problems. I've realized that I'm not strong enough to endure his toxicity, and honestly I deserve better. (Even though in my lowest point, when I was going through a sudden move with my mom after my parents divorce, emotionally abusive dad pushing his anger on me, and school/work overload, he was able to talk me through it all and helped get me up from the dumps.) I cared so much that everytime he was able to twist the fights to be in his favor, allowing him to disregard my feelings, and where I would eventually apologize because...maybe if he so strongly believes that he deserves an apology and is so hurt and keeps saying that I'm not taking his emotions into consideration...maybe it is true? Maybe I'm not as good of a girlfriend as I thought I was?

I broke up with him once back in May with these same realizations and he messaged me a few days later apologizing and owning up to his wrongdoings. We spoke a lot about figuring out a solution and after so long, we came up with things we both needed to remember to do if a disagreement ensued. But looking back (because I took notes of the things we needed to do), the things we agreed upon were still things where I'm still putting his emotions first. Being lenient for him. The solution we came up with wasn't really tackling the problem but instead just finding ways to help manage his emotions. He was on the right track to change, but only 10%.

When I broke up with him 5 days ago, I became fully aware that he was still treating me the same way as before. Yes there has been improvement but he was still undermining my feelings and putting his own first. I couldn't make him understand anymore because I was so drained. I didn't want to keep giving in just for this same cycle to happen all over again. I deserve so much more. I made this realization in the hours after I was again, manipulated to apologize out of pity that I hurt him.

After breaking up with him, I felt a huge sense of relief. I felt at peace that I finally decided to let go. I wouldn't need to continue dealing with his toxicity. Although I was sad, I was happy for me. I was proud that I took this step and I intend to be firm on not getting back with him unless I saw actual change over time. I still loved him a lot, I saw a future together, I welcomed the idea of if he ever did change, that I would be open to trying for us again. Of course I didn't tell him though. In the days following the break up, it felt nice to be alone, I wanted to now prioritize myself and work on healing myself to become better. I told myself I won't look for another relationship until I was in a good place to do so.

He messaged me yesterday acknowledging and owning up to his wrongdoings. When I read the message, I surprisingly wasn't overly excited but was calm to face whatever he had to say. I knew I was already healing, I had accepted the situation, I was proud of myself for how quickly I was able to reason with myself. He wanted to talk so I waited to gather up my thoughts and questions and spoke to my friend about what I should stand firm about. I knew I didn't want to forgive and get back with him just for the cycle to repeat itself.

I made him list out all the things he did wrong and asked him what he would do differently. He really finally understood the pain he caused me and how everything he did was wrong. And he wanted closure and respected my decision to break up with him. He wanted to understand what exactly were his toxic traits and wanted to change. (I was happy he wanted to better himself after all the times he said that he couldn't change.) He even said ""I should've known that winning a fight is not winning, it meant losing someone I loved and cared about. Anger, ego, fear, whatever it was. I let it take over and control me.""

I asked him if he was going to chase after me and after a lot of thinking on his part, he said I don't really know. He wants to get back together but moving forward, if he doesn't fully change yet and the traits still exist even though it will be less, I could just say I want to break up because I can't take it anymore. This is where I told him I didn't want to fully get back together yet unless I saw progress. We could see how he handles the next time we have a disagreement or miscommunication. We wouldn't have the bf/gf title but I guess be exclusive?

So now, after this long backstory, how would I go about this proposition? What should I do and not do? If you were in the same position as me or once was, what would you do?? I don't want to fully go back to the way it was with him..but I don't know where to draw the line. I want to hold something back before he proves to me and earns that privilege again. (We're doing long distance right now because he moved back with his parents due to covid and being able to wfh and is 2 hours away. We've only started seeing each other in person in June and have since spent weekends together once a month. Prior to meeting in June, the last time was in early March).

If you've read to the end, thank you so much! You're the best.",24Aug2020,1
979,"TW: cp, porn, guns, violence, paranoia
TLDR; my brother in law is insane and a public threat but I have no physical evidence, should I report him somewhere? 

Hi. I have a brother in law, we’ll call him Dan. Dan grew up troubled with anxiety and I think he mentioned adhd too. Dan was pretty timid when I first met him, but as I got to know him he seemed pretty cool. He’s into video games, trading cards, Art, all that stuff. We used to bring him back soda or dinner or take him with us to hang out. He’s got a history of marijuana, acid, lsd, meth, etc, and is constantly chugging through kratom. It’s legal, but I can tell it messed with his head. Our whole family enjoys collecting handguns. 
Here’s where things are getting scary. Lately, Dan has started working 3-5 days a week overnight. He pays no bills, has no kids or child support, has a used car that’s paid off, his dad pays everything else, even groceries and fast food is on his dads dime. He’s still asking for money from his dad, even though he should be in a good spot to have a lot of money saved up. He’s got a heavy lock on his door and a locking doorknob that he locks even if he just goes to microwave some food. He keeps an assault rifle, a handgun, mace, and a pocket knife on him at ALL TIMES. Like even going to the bathroom or showering. For work he leaves most of it in his car but he does have a concealed carry license. Dan even goes so far as to wear a Kevlar vest the second he gets home from work. He has several security cameras set up around the house. If we catch a peek in his room you can tell it’s messy but he’s not growing or cooking anything in there, plus we would probably smell it or something. He’s gotten worse and worse over the past few months. We recently fell on hard times so we’re living with my father in law and Dan (the house belongs to my father in law and my mother in law but she passed a few years back) We have a daughter and I never leave her alone with him or give him the opportunity to be around her much. He used to seem cool but now he will literally see a car turn around in our driveway and he’ll hop in his car and chase them down to threaten them. Some nights he walks from his room to the front door and looks outside every ten minutes like someone is after him. One of our friends asked him why he’s so paranoid and his answer was chilling. “Man if you only knew the things I’ve looked at online and the things I’ve seen.” 
Is it child porn, snuff films, bomb manufacturing, how to cook meth, what is it that he’s looking at that he literally thinks the FBI/CIA or someone is after him? I feel sorry for him feeling so unsafe in his own home that he wears a Kevlar vest, but it makes me so scared. He does nothing to help clean or pull his weight in the house, but he rips us a new one for not locking the door ONE time. 
Another strange thing is that Dan will eat randomly in the bathroom. He’ll spend hours in the bathroom and it’s obvious he’s either been eating, jerking off, or just sitting there silently for hours. This behavior is insane.
Is there somewhere I should report him? Is there something I should be doing? A man like this shouldn’t have access to guns. Even small suggestions like “you should get out more” have made him so irate that he threatened us and said to stop sticking my nose in other peoples business and stop telling people what to do. I can’t confront him in any way without fear of being shot or worse. I just don’t know what to do. We don’t have the means to move out, but I’m terrified of him. I fear even more for people who use our driveway to turn around or the neighborhood kids who play pranks and toss firecrackers in the street. What can I do?",24Aug2020,1

We had a miscarriage after only being boyfriend and girlfriend for 3 months. This made us feel a big loss in our lives and we decided to try for a baby. We now have a wonderful little boy together. We married after 1 year and are still together now. 

Recently we have hit a very rocky patch. Normally we sort our issues out in a few days and we stay together the entire time, but issues persist a little while down the line. Instead of trying the same thing again I suggested this time that we should take a break and I should get out of the house for a few days to help us appreciate what we have. She however, was not too happy with the idea and when I suggested it, she said there was no guarantees that we will still be together after this break and she took her half of the money out of our savings. 

I don’t know what to do. I really want this to work as I love her so much, but I am worried she won’t get back with me after this break. I tried to explain to her my reasonings but she didn’t want to hear it as she has her own opinion on the matter (which I understand fully).

Most of our conversations involve him yelling at me, mostly about getting my shit together, so I wasn’t in a hurry to talk to him about this.

Yesterday our parents told me I had to come. It seems like his fiancée, who I don’t know well but seems like a very intelligent and pleasant person who’s so far been very conscientious about the virus, really wants the wedding to happen. Anyway, after another long discussion full of facts &amp; numbers my father said it might be too dangerous but my mother is adamant about me being there. 

They’re taking some precautions, it’s outdoors (though in a tent) &amp; only a few guests, but 1.) our parents are over 75 2.) I’m going to have to go through some of the busiest airports in the US to get there 3.) even with minimal guests &amp; outdoor festivities there are still musicians, caterers, and hotels full of strangers &amp; staff who might be infected (my elderly parents, aunt, &amp; uncle have to stay at one).

Anyway, to finally get to the point, my brother wants to talk tonight. I have no idea what to say to someone who, while having the best of intentions, is putting everyone in danger, especially our elderly parents who barely take any precautions. 


TLDR:
My only sibling is finally getting married but I’m scared it’ll infect or kill our senior citizen parents.

I’m looking for any thoughts or ideas on what I can say to change his mind &amp; not destroy our relationship.",24Aug2020,1
1004,"My (16m) sister (17f) is a very unpleasant person to be around, but she's also extremely dilutional.

To help you get an idea of what kind of person she is, my family is not very wealthy. we're not poor but we have to save to go on holiday. we've been on holiday 4 times, and every single time my sister convinces herself that we are going to move there and she tries to convince my parents. we went on holiday to America for 2 weeks and my sister was looking into houses, not really a big deal, but they were houses that cost close to $1,000,00 and she honestly believed that we could afford that. she had her phone taken away a while ago, and she decided to steal my phone. I only found this out 5 months later. that was 5 months using an old Nokia bc my parents thought I couldn't be trusted with a phone. she has broken 7 phones and every time it is replaced, they're usually insured but that's still £150 per phone, so in total like £2000 on replacing her phone's. I have a scar on my leg from 2 years ago, when my sister kicked the back of my leg so hard it broke the skin, because I was ""walking too slow"". she constantly tries to antagonize me and she laughs and says I have anger issues if I exhibit even a slight reaction, but the second I do something she doesn't like, she punches me and screams at the top of her lungs (like a full banshee screech). her ""life plan"" that she announced a few days ago is to move to Australia and sell mansions (a real estate agent near where we live bought a car she liked, so it's now her life ambition), and if that fails, (she legitimately said this and it wasn't a joke) she would ""marry a rich guy with cancer or marry a normal rich guy and divorce him"". she honestly believes that it is her right to have everything without having to work for it. she also put my mum's bank card on her apple pay without her permission and has spent an excess of £200 on it. I've tried ignoring her, but I have to interact with her at least once a day and it always makes me annoyed for a while after. how am I meant to distance myself from her if we live in the same house? my parents also enable her, and always make excuses when I complain. she also threatens to ruin my social life (she's very popular) and has even said ""I could get you jumped"" to stop me from telling stuff to my parents, like all the times she's had friends round drinking while they're out",24Aug2020,1
1005,"Recently talked to a guy I met online and he seemed cool and my type of guy (Career, stable job, good person) I would date. He suggested we hang out and chill, so I thought everything would be cool to chill at my place.

Him being 28 and been in this world long enough, I thought when he suggested we should drink that he could handle and know his tolerance to drink. Boy was I wrong. 

This guy comes over to my apartment and after about 4 drinks he just starts throwing up on the walls, all over the bathroom sink, and bins. I'm telling you beans, freaking eggs, and toast all over my apartment. I tried to help him get home and honestly I drank more than he did but he didn't wanna move because that's how fucked up he was. 

After about 2 hours at my place with him throwing up and waking my roommates, he finally goes in my car and I drive him home.

Two days later I'm finding myself inside the manager and landlord's office explaining everything because my roommates reported the situation, which inevitably leads to me being kicked out of the complex and moving to a similar but more expensive unit. I moved into the apartment for school and it just started today and I have lab classes on campus, so I need to be close to the school.

Originally I was paying $650 for my shared room and the new rent is a single for $1000 utilities included, which works for me since I prefer being alone.

My dad and current roommates say I should charge him $1000 for every month until the rest of the year,but honestly that is a lot of money and don't really think anyone should be in that fucked of a situation. So I decided he pay half the difference of $400, so $200 a month for 11 months of my lease since I am responsible for bringing him over. 

My advice needed: Is it okay that I charge him this much given the circumstances he has put me in?

I am a 20-year old virgin. My life has been such a clusterfuck of drugs, dropping out, having no friends. Now I have made headway rising above it all. I've quit all drugs, got back in uni, found hobbies. In spite of it all I feel like life is pointless without sex. Nothing matters. I wish I could kill myself but I'm just too much of a damn coward. I cannot find any meaning to life outside of attaining sex. 

I used to have really grand ambitions and dreams. Now I think those dreams are stupid and the only dreams that are meaningful are those of attaining sex. I have vowed to have sex with 100 different girls in my lifetime to make up for what I have lost in my youth. My only goal in life is to become rich enough to build a harem.

I'll openly admit I'm an incel. In spite of all women suffer, I feel an immense jealousy towards them, because they are the gatekeepers of sex. I have started saving up for an escort- but it will take me 2 months to save up enough. And I don't want to spend 2 months being constantly tortured and feeling suicidal.

I went to my girlfriend's family home for a get together with alcohol and I ending up drinking a whole bottle of whiskey plus some tequila,went into blackout and made an absolute fool of myself in front of her family, saying embarrassing things that weren't true and had to be put to bed,I woke up the next day with no recollection. 
Few weeks before I drank so much I got sick all over her father's bathroom and a few weeks before I was out with her family and drank a lot of Jager and got kicked out of the place. 

Do I have a problem? I thought about it and it's been eating away at me recently because my step dad was an abusive alcoholic and I really don't want to emulate his life. 

I saw my stepdad who was an alcoholic and just presumed that's what an alcoholic was (drinking all day everyday and abusive). 
I don't drink every day and don't feel withdrawal symptoms if I don't but anytime I do drink I go way overboard and bad things happen. I don't know what to do. I'm going to try and stop altogether. 

My girlfriend hasn't spoken with me all day and heard me tell someone that I wanted to sleep with her family member (even though I really don't). Everything's a fucking mess. 

A lot of her family were quite annoyed at me and wouldn't talk to me the next day. I also said that I wanted to sleep with one of them even though I really do not. I'm scared I fucked up everything with them.
I don't need it to function and don't crave it really but whenever I do drink I lose control and don't know when to stop and keep going until I vomit or black out. I can sometimes drink in moderation but anything more than a few beers and my brain just makes me drink until I can't anymore.

1016,"Hi there! I am usually just a lurker, but today i need advice myself! I really don't know what to do with this one, so here it goes;

A little background:

So I've been occasionally hanging out with this friend group for aboit 2 years now and it's always fun! Everybody is very sweet and kind and I getalong very well with everyone! Except for this one girl, who we will call B. B is very insecure about her looks and weight, and often reflects that on others in a negative way. I hate this kind of bebaviour because it is very toxic, and just really childish and annoying.

One time she said to me (completely oit of the blue) that two of our friends were very ugly without make up, and that their skin was terrible. I told her to take a look in the mirror before she says shit like that. Now, i know that makes me a hypocrite, because I made a negative comment about her looks, but it just pissed me off that someone would make such an unnecessary, mean comment like that. She didn't really respond to that and I considered telling my friends about B and how sneaky she is. But then I figured I would have these two amazing, but very soft and insecure girls something like ""Hey, guess what! B, one of your best friends, said you guys were very ugly, she sucks!"" Being scared of making them even more insecure, I decided to keep my mouth shut, and hoped that B would expose herself.

That, unfortunately, didn't happen.

There is another friend of mine who has been targeted by her weird comments. This girl, who I'll call A, has a very severe depression, but is one of the most amazing human beings ever. She is very open abour everything, and I'm proud of her for that. This means that whenever things get to much, she's honest about it, but it usually means that everybody has to stop what they're doing to get her home because of reasons.

No one really minds because we care about her, and i don't mind because I don't spend that much time with her, so I don't really experience this a lot.

The thing is, that B has been telling people lies about how A forces everybody to quit what they are doing, and that she is tearing the friend group apart, and how A is an inconvenience to everybody.

This is not true and very unfait to A, who always tries to solve things for us, and whenever I talk shit about B, A is always the first one to tell me shit talking is bad.

If only she knew..

I'm so done with this behaviour, and I can't stand seeing my friends being sucked in her toxic soup any longer.

This has to stop, but I can't say anything without hurting my friemds. In this case hurting them can have severe consequences due to the mental states of all these lovely people.

I tried talking to B, but whenever I attack her with my words, she becomes this horrible ass kisser, and slithers her way through the conversation like the little snake she is.

How can i show my friends how toxic B really is?",24Aug2020,1
1017,"(F17) Honestly I don't know how to handle this. She's already stressed out about her dad's passing, her school work, and family drama in her home. She can rarely message me because of how busy she is. With COVID going around, her mom is strict about us hanging out, which takes out the opportunity for us to get together before I leave. She won't even let us go out together with masks on.

If I tell her now about me moving, I think it'll put more stress on to her in which she'd have to worry about finding as much ways as she can to hang out with me, all the while she's juggling everything else back at home.

If I were to tell her later, she'll be more relaxed while we get to casually talk to each other. The drawback is that I'm afraid she'll regret not going to further lengths on attempting to get together with me, once she finds out I'm moving.

1024,"I've (23F) already been in therapy for years 8+ to be exact. At this point my therapist just is like ""you may always have these issues it's just about minimizing them"" which I don't really find really helpful. 

These are issues that arise from being a victim of sexual abuse by my grandfather at 10. Most of my family cut contact with myself and my mother. I had two- step Dads- both cheaters. The 2nd was a narcissist and completley horrible. My actual Dad cheated on my mom and got mad when she was pregnant with me because it would effect his new business. He ignored me and didn't take much interest and they separated when I was young. 

With my Dad there was an incident where he left me alone, at 5 years of age with a dog in the middle of a cornfield,  while he was out hunting. He was gone for a significant amount of time and I came home crying. I had fallen and gotten hurt also (fell on a corn stalk in the ground and cut my neck) my mother was furious at the situation. This was out in a state where it is known for bears, cougars and other dangerous wildlife. So I also sort of have some abandoment issues. 

I am getting to a point in my life where I would like to find someone romantically and settle down. I also feel like I have seen and heard too much that I don't trust anyone. At all. I don't know how to trust people. I need help or suggestions if anyone has them?

1029,"I live in Michigan. Our governor extended the expiration deadline for driver's licenses and state id's to September 30th due to COVID. Apart of that order I assumed it was also for learner's permits. My learner's permit was originally set to expire April 26th. I looked on the Secretary of State website and under the COVID-19 FAQ one of the questions were,

""My Temporary Instructor Permit or permit for parent assisted experience is about to expire. What should I do?""

And the answer was,

""Under Public Acts 127, 128, and 129, the deadline for renewing driver’s permits (temporary instruction permits, graduated license permits, motorcycle, and commercial permits) that expired on or after March 1, 2020 has been extended to September 30, 2020.""

It clearly states on the website that the deadline for permits was extended to September 30th.

When I was going to driver's training my instructor told me the deadline was extended. Before I took my road test, the examiner told me the same thing.

The lady told me that the expiration for learner's permit was never extended; only licenses and id's.

I told her that I thought apart of that extension was learner's permits. She was like ""no"".

She thought that I was applying for another permit. I told her I was applying for my license.

Then she was like oh, ""Where's your documentation? I don't know what you're doing. You told me you were applying for a test.""

I never told her I was applying for a test; I told her my license. And I would think she would ask for my documentation instead of me just handing it to her. I don't know what this lady's problem was.

I showed her my road test certificate. She was like, ""Oh, well you already passed your test, but I still have to charge you $25.00 because your permit expired. I'm not going to have you take the written test over, but I still need to charge you $25.00. It is what it is I guess.""

I thought that was bullshit. If permits were expired then why does it say on the SOS website that it was extended?

I'll admit I think I could've done a better job communicating, but I was kind of in a rush to get what I needed and head to work.

I actually printed out the FAQ question that mentioned that learner's permit deadlines were extended. I actually originally had it for my road test, but before I showed the examiner he told me that it was extended. Now I'm mad at myself that I didn't show this lady, because maybe she wouldn't have charged me the $25.00.

What do you guys think about this?",24Aug2020,1
1030,"&amp;#x200B;

Before I describe what happened today, I need to describe the complicated relationship I have with my mom the best I can.

Me and my mother have never really had a fully functional relationship. Throughout my childhood, my mom was, and still is, an excessively anxious woman who often handled things very poorly when I (although not limited to just me) did not act in ways that she wanted. Growing up with an autistic twin brother just exacerbated this problem even further, causing her to really spin out on me, while my father took more of a backseat in my family, being both scared of my mother and controlled by her, only ever expressing his frustration in short angry outbursts. My mother often guilt tripped me, changed house rules on whims which both confused and frustrated me, burst out at me at random times, verbally abused me with nasty names, insults and curses, and hit me in inappropriate situations. Additionally, my mom had been a helicopter parent throughout most of my life, being extremely controlling over me, even when it was uncalled for.

One of the worst examples of this could be thanksgiving of fourth grade, when she asked me to play clarinet for my family. However when I did not want to, because I was too shy, so she took me to another room, cursing at me calling me a spoiled brat, then throwing my clarinet at me while I cried. More recent examples would be throughout highschool when she threatened to take me out of AP classes, or threatened to not give me my ADHD medication before school as punishment for being ""rude and disrespectful.""

However, these are extreme examples. By no means am I a victim. My mom still, overall, is a good person has tried to help me and do the best for me, but often has had a hard time handling situations. My mom cares about me deeply. I also have not been the best child myself. Often I got in trouble throughout elementary school (usually didn't follow directions in class or got into skirmishes with other children), and in high school I was rebellious and often broke my mothers rules and gave attitude. To give my self some credit though, I had pretty good grades, did not really get into trouble anymore, and often did nice things for my mother (like having a valetines day concert at my school, where I conducted the jazz band, and announcing that I dedicated a song we played to my mother in front of the audience).

In the past year, I have been the worst son. I got arrested for selling drugs, and I am facing felony charges (PWID). I have also been an addict. I got suspended from college and sent home in January. When I got sent home, I started changing myself. Fights with my mom have been the worst ever. First I got into the habit of cursing and yelling back at my mom, and threatening to leave the house. This was bad, because when I started cursing, although my mom stopped cursing herself, her insults got wayyy nastier. Despite this, my mom has gone to therapy and actually become better and more understanding. She is less controlling than she used to be, and doesn't curse at me as much. However, she still lies to me, insults me, and exaggerates truths about certain things to hurt me, and often succeeds, causing me to curse and yell. She is also aggressive, often physically taunting me with objects, and screaming when I take these objects away, as if I am hurting her. An example would be a week ago, where she took a broom and kept waving it in my face. So I had to struggle to grab the broom from her, in which she started screaming ""help,"" but I managed to take the broom and throw it outside.

Recently though, I have been bad as well. Almost as if I am becoming my mother. When I get into fights with my mother, recently I have started not only cursing, but insulting. Today we were trying group therapy with a counselor from my rehab (over zoom). The important thing is, is that I need to be signed off in order to go back to a 4 year college, which I so desperately need. It is my hope in life. My mother starts shitting on me, and I start shitting back as usual. Things start getting heated, and I tell my counselor my mom always come into my room invading my privacy, and my mom says she ""finds things she's not supposed to."" This shocked me a lot: 1, because I was on anti-depressant withdrawal, a little bit, and a bit unstable(I am trying to stop using them). But 2, because comments like those jeopardize my entire future. I lost my mind in a way I never seen myself. I muted the zoom call, screamed ""fuck you"" and slapped my moms wrist. I think my therapist saw part of it.

Of course, it was not really a hard slap. My mom didn't really flinch or anything, and I definitely did not leave any mark (unlike the slaps she dealt to me in the past). It was more of a ""what the fuck"" kind of slap. I then leave the zoom call, and go to my room to cool off. I hear my mother from my own room, who has called the therapist, milking what happened to my therapist, who now according to my mom thinks I'm ""out of control."" Luckily my mom described that she meant ""cigarettes"" to therapist, although we both knew she meant the muscle relaxants she found while searching my room(unwarranted), that I had wanted to use to help me go to sleep. We both agreed not to bring that up in order to protect me so I could get back into college. In a way, she was using it as a card against me to piss me off.

I just want to get away from my mother at this point. She turns me into a bad person, and I can't believe it, but when I argue with her, more and more, I start to absorb her negative traits, and imitate them. The unfortunate thing is, is that she can get away with it, and continues to, but I can't. I hate that I acted this way, but I can only (consciously) forgive myself for now, and try to pick up the pieces (again). I have to deal with her until I can go back to a four year (Spring semester 2021, but now jeopardized again), and I'm so exhausted with my life situation and mother. If I couldn't go back to college I would honestly cry to death, and I don't really cry a lot, and I feel like my mom is a toxic element in my life holding me back from being a good person.

1031,"So I’ve been a drug and alcohol counselor for the past 6 years. I used to love it in the beginning, but lately.....I’m just not happy. I’ve tried working at different facilities but no matter where I go, I’m still not happy. I guess I’m just not as passionate about it as I thought I was.

So I’ve been thinking about going back to school to be a teacher. Early childhood education, specifically P-3. I’ve been in this debate with myself for a very long time. I started college as an education major but ultimately changed to psychology because “education was too hard” (realistically speaking- I think I was just nervous or something)

I already have a masters degree so I know I can do the “alternate route” but I don’t know much about it.

Any advice for those who changed careers in adulthood (I’m 29F). Pros? Cons? Also, any advice from teachers? Would it be worth it?",24Aug2020,1

I have a crush on someone (will be known as ""p"" for codename) and I am a big wuss, so I didn't talk with her a whole bunch, maybe once a month. She was a semi popular girl so there was even more pressure.

There was this joke (before I had a crush on her) that I liked her friend and she'd try to hook us up. This was very obviously a joke, so no worries there.

One day, like a very very smart person, decided to tell her friend and ask for advice. After this, I'm pretty sure P knew. So weeks and months went by and I haven't has the courage to tell her at all. 

Today, on her Snapchat story P and her friend she tried to hook me up with had a picture of them with the black bar thing reading ""fuck u **(my initials)"". I thought ,like the big brain I am, I'd ask whats all this jazz and she told me to fuck off. 

So er, whats all tbis business then? AITA?

She yelled at and brought me down a lot and it has taken a toll on my own mental health, self esteem, etc. and she acts like that’s my own fault and can’t imagine how she could have anything to do with that.

But the thing is, within the past couple years she has calmed down significantly. She has screamed at me a lot less, and of course she does some nice things for me like take me to the store and pay for my groceries (well, she uses my grandmother’s money because she doesn’t really have any, but still.) I thought about this today and I don’t know.

I want to be mad at her and cut ties with her when I move away for kind of treating me like crap for most of my life.

1038,"Hi all, my (38f) husband (36m) is a HS teacher.  The school he teaches at is handling reopening really badly, to the point where the neighboring district thinks of his district as a joke.  They’ve returned to full time, desks can’t be 6 feet apart, at lunch they are also not properly distanced, and of course can’t wear masks for eating.  The community is very conservative (we are not), and the school board members of course have decided all of these procedures (and more that are questionable but you get the idea).  The board also went so far as to tell the teachers that if they were forced to go fully remote, they would require the teachers to still teach from the school every day to ‘make sure they’re doing their work.’  There’s so much more I could say, but the bottom line is that I want to know how I can say something about this in the right way?

1041,"For a quick background, I (26 F) work from home as a Content Writer. The client that I'm currently working with has just become very irritating as she always expects me to work on her tasks first, gives very vague instructions (and gets annoyed that I didn't understand them despite being bilingual), and keeps asking me about the amount of hours I spend on difficult tasks that she asked my help for since she can't accomplish them herself. I wasn't really interested in taking this client. The only reason I had her was because another long-time client of mine had asked me for a favor to help this client. We had worked together for several months. But as time went on, she had become very irritable, rude, and.passive aggressive when communicating with me. So I stopped working with her. She even told me not to mention her in my CV which was fine. I didn't ask her why I couldn't as I had been working with other clients anyway.

During the pandemic, I had lost my full-time work with another client. I had become a bit desperate. She contacted me out of the blue after not speaking for several months. I was shocked as she was very different from how she was before. She was now gentle with words and polite. 

But all that changed after a few weeks of working.. She kept messaging me on the weekends for me to prioritize her tasks at the start of the week (she's the lowest-paying client I have at the moment) and has now resumed asking me if x hours is really the time I spent on x tasks. She asks as if it's unbelievable, that I'm lying, and that I have to explain the hard work I put on her tasks that don't even pay that much to begin with. I got really annoyed, but kept things professional, explained why it had taken that long, and then wrote her name on a list of people I vow to never work with again.

So I haven't told this client that I don't want to work with her anymore. It won't be long until this person messages me again for tasks. How do I tell her that exactly? 😅",24Aug2020,1
1042,"I work in a very niche industry. After grad school I was lucky enough to land a job that pays well, gives great benefits, and has good work/life balance. The issue is that the environment is aggressively toxic. When I was hired I was the youngest person on the team which was great in the beginning but after five years many people above me still patronize me, treat me as if I can’t do my job, and consistently undermine my abilities.  I’ve also been told by coworkers that I didn’t deserve a raise when I got one. I work hard and consistently take on new projects and work outside of my expertise but the same toxicity is still prevalent. 

The turnover rate at this job is very high but I’ve stuck it out for 5 years now. Despite being undermined weekly I train new employees, handle the most difficult projects, and liaise to other areas within company. I’ve hit my wall, though. I am so sick of being the company’s punching bag and bending over backwards for a group that could give less shits. I’ve slowly started checking out and have chronic anxiety thinking about the job. I absolutely dread opening my email every day and usually end up crying at least once a week.

1046,"Me = Me

Neighbor = Amber

I moved into a wonderful house in the middle of March this year. Her and her parents made a firm point to make sure I was not a party person as my kitchen wall is her bedroom wall. Iv'e lived in a lot of places where there are shared walls and I've never had a complaint or an issue with anyone. I work A LOT and with COVID being a thing I don't have friends over, or go out and stay out late. 

At first we got along swimmingly. She's a little off, because of her disorder. No problem, she can be really sensitive to stimuli and I always want to be compassionate because, living with something like that is real, and it must really suck. At first the issue was me walking. No problem, I got foam filp-flops to cushion the steps. Another issue, closing my cabinets too loudly. No problem, close them lighter, sure. Then the fridge, then, my front door, then the washing machine. And so on, and so on, and so on. A couple months ago there was a total melt down over me making a PB&amp;J at 11 pm. I was hungry and couldn't sleep I think the cutting board woke her up? but idk she wont talk to me. After that I started putting down a kitchen cloth so cutting boards and plates don't clank on the counter 

Then the insults started. Amber started saying things to me in passing. one morning I was outside my front door jumping rope, her comment ""wow, It's nice to see you finally decide to take care of yourself instead on drinking"" 

I'm trying to lose a bit of weight, 10 / 15 lbs. My mother came to visit shes a more voluptuous woman, I got my aunts body. But later that night I came to say hi, her and a friend were having a glass of wine in the back court yard. She comments ""I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but after seeing your mom I don't want you to believe in your own body dissmorphia thinking that you're capable of being a size six. You seem really miserable."" I was floored. I told her shes crossing some major boundaries, and that this isn't the first time shes said off handed things to me. She then walked into her house not saying a word and turned off all of the lights. Shortly after she sent me a text saying ""I was just turning in for the night""

Like wft?

So here's where I need help. Will amber text me if she thinks i'm being too loud? No. Will Amber close the cabinets and fridge while i'm in her bedroom to see what level annoys her? No. Will she call me? No. She wont even talk to me about it. It's like I'm not allowed in my kitchen at all. Shes so passive aggressive and manipulative I'm really starting to lose my mind. We share a shed, but now shes pissed off so without warning threw it all on my font porch. 

Her parents are the same was. Can you tell amber to communicate with me because there is nothing else I can do to please her. Their response ""no texting after hours, 9:00 pm is quite time and you need to respect that. You're going to break the cabinets"" After the call I got her a bottle of wine and had her come out to talk to me. Things got really heated really fast and I called her a lazy princess who uses her mental illness to be a fucking bitch because and without mommy and daddys money she would be she wouldn't even have a house, and I pay a ridiculous about of money and I can use my kitchen whenever the fuck I want, and a couple other things that I'm not proud of.

I'm at the end of my rope and I don't know what to do, how to fix this, or just say fuck it and live in my over priced house like a normal person. My mom says I should write an E-mail, but what do I even say?Yes there was an agreement with her parents that i could use the shed. Now they're saying that never happend

2 - The George Floyd incident.


3 - The story of a 10 year old girl that was raped by her uncle since her 4 years old, and later she was accused to be a murderer just because of the abortion.

I do a majority of the household chores, (pretty much everything except laundry, because she doesn't; trust me to do it) and when I see her doing stuff around the house I ask her if she needs help or if she wants me to do it, she usually says no (but occasionally says yes, only if she's washing the last few dishes in the sink before I get a chance to).

As far as cooking I make my own breakfast and lunch every day, except occasionally on weekends, but during the week she wakes up before me and is usually leaving as I'm waking up so she makes her own stuff. As far as dinner we eat leftovers most days, and as for when we do cook we usually divide up the work so both of us make a part. I often ask to cook the whole thing but she rarely lets me.

When my mom is tired she is irritable, and since I'm the only person she's ever around when she's irritable and angry (sometimes) I get to experience all of it because she only talks to other people about it when she has calmed down. She always talks about how she's so tired and is doing a thousand things at once (usually saying it frustrated and seemingly targeted at me but I could be misinterpreting it). I say anything about anything and I'm a disrespectful little shit who makes her life a living hell (or at least that's how she makes it seem.)

Problem: I continue to have small, irregular relapses. The urge to binge and purge sneaks up on me so subtly, I dont realise what is happening until I'm already at my lowest point. I feel disheartened and it's placing a strain on my relationship. My partner is very understanding but I dont want her to worry about me, or to come to see me as a burden or a patient she must care for. I struggle with depressive episodes as a result of my ED, and these can be heightened by my body issues I hope to improve with (doctor and therapist approved) plastic surgery paid for by my parents (I was left with loose skin following weight loss).

1053,"So, this is not a ""right now situation"".  There are others out there that need/deserve help a lot more then myself.  However this is just a question I've had on my mind a lot the past couple years.   


I'm a 30 y/o Male in the US, with a decent paying job, and a great retirement plan. I'm in the military, and plan on doing my full 20 years plus honestly probably an additional 10 providing nothing breaks in my body (already 12 years in) , I work in a field that has lots of marketable skills in the private sector. I've got additional Investments on the side as well. I'll probably end up covering most expenditures once my wife and I retire in 25-30 years due to her cashing out her retirement before we were married. (So there's my background)  


My parents however, are still working in their 60s (mother) and 70s (Father). When my father hit retirement age they sold their house and moved into a Camper. They're definitely minimalist, which has helped them out a lot with stretching the money they made off there house, however that has a limit. I know they get some money from social security, and have medicare. I do know they have debt from vehicles and the like. It just seems (without actually having eyes on their finances) they're reckless at times. My father is a ""handy man"" and my mother works at (well did) a school as a lunch lady.  My father also does (did) uber/lyft on the side. They've always lived paycheck to paycheck, even when I was younger, and are very ""spend if if ya got it"" types of people. (Fortunately I learned my financial skills from others in my life)  


I don't know how long they can keep this lifestyle up, and with 2020 being what it is and no idea honestly what the future holds. What can I do to somewhat prepare to assume any debts that may come up. My sibling is in no position to assist in this scenario. Honestly it'll be a point of contention with my wife as well, as my parents are not in my life much these days, and really haven't been the entire time I've been with my wife.  


I know a lot of Reddit seems to be ""against"" parents sometimes, but I figured it was worth a shot to see what others have to say as this area of ""taking care of parents"" is 100% new to me and I want to have at least some basis of knowledge beyond ""send them to a retirement home"".",24Aug2020,1

1055,"Now I am a 25 year old women with a successful career and married to love of my life. But this particular memory haunt me for revenge from both the parent and the child (now a women in the same age as me). Now this is the story.

I grew up in a very financial troubled family. My mother passed away when I was 12 and my father lost his job because he fell sick. I was doing some favors to my friends in the class and I did charge money for those so I could survive a another day. I brought them sim cards, reloads to their mobile, got gifts for their boy friends and passed messages for them if needed. For each favor I charged 200LKR. 

Anyway the story starts when this girl who came new to the school wanted me to do her a favor. She was this girl who would do anything to get famous. She was very evil that she had made friends fight. And I didn't like her much. She wanted me to call her mom and say that i brought her a phone and the sim (which I didn't) coz she had being caught with the mobile which her boyfriend had given her so they could speak. And she said she do not want tell it was by the boyfriend coz family was very strict on having any affairs. I don't know why her mother would believe that I could buy her a phone but I agree to take the blame for 200LKR.

As I didn't have a phone I called her home number from a payphone where her mother answered. So as we discussed I say ""sorry aunty I am the one who brought the mobile for your daughter"" Then she start scolding me that I am spoiling her innocent child and I am a good for nothing girl that needs to be expelled by the school. And she said she will make sure that I will regret in my life if I even spoke to her daughter again. And she will make a complain to the school about me and growing up I will end up being begging in the streets. And so many nasty things. I was upset for couple of hours but then I had more problems to worry about. Eg father's medicine, money for food, rent and books for school. 

But now I am all settled and have time to look back in life. I feel bad for the 14 year old my self. Getting scolded and getting cursed. Her mother was an adult. She should have spoke to me. She should have some feeling that I didn't have any money or any motive to buy her daughter a phone coz it made no sense. She Never questioned. I believe she just wanted someone to blame. And I was the perfect person. A girl with No mother and a sick father was a perfect match for both her and her mother as no one gonna questions them about their judgment.

I (19) was driving how from work around 2am the other day when I got in a car accident. I was driving on the freeway where the speed limit is 65 mph. I was wearing my glasses and I was not under the influence of anything. There were 3 lanes and I was in the middle one. The car in front of me suddenly swerved into the left lane. I didn’t know why they were swerving but before I could react I saw a car completely stopped in the middle of the freeway with all their lights off. I slammed on my breaks but it was too late, I crashed into them. I was going the speed limit when I saw the car, but I hit them going around 35 mph. I turned on my hazard lights and got out of my car. I heard a women walk up behind me and apologize profusely. She told me and the cops that she fell asleep at the wheel, hit the wall, and her car ended up in the middle lane. She stopped, turned off her car, and got out and sat on the side of the road because she was shook up.

I feel like I should not be at fault because I did try to swerve but didn’t have time. I braked as much as I could. The freeway doesn’t have lights and it was also underneath an overpass which makes it even darker. My insurance rep said he will do the best to try to get the girl to accept full responsibility. But he also warned me that a lot of the times, insurance companies blame the person the crashed into the other car.

The girls car was still drive able after she first hit the wall, so I feel like she should have pulled off to the side of the freeway or at least turned on her hazard lights. I don’t understand why she would just get out and leave her car with the dark.

Im a recent college grad. on an intense job hunt and with the help of a friend, I was able to land an interview for a job that has me screening people at the entrance of a hospital for any signs of COVID. Nothing big, just something to get some money in my pockets and bills payed. 

I really need this job. The issue? I smoke weed daily and the company who is considering hiring me requires that I pass a drug test.  I know, I know. I am an idiot for not stopping beforehand. Truth is I didn't even consider the possibility that my employer might want to check (even though i've had to take drug tests before). It just didn't cross my mind while I was job hunting and I really regret that i've continued this habit. 

I have no problem abstaining from marijuana use if it means I can get the job. My question is, what do I do in this situation? I don't want to take a drug test because I know I'm going to fail it. Should I just be honest with my potential boss and save us some time? Should I just fake it till I make it? Or should I really test my luck by trying to detox and take the test anyway?

Honestly, everything I read online about detoxing just doesn't sound convincing. It sounds like the best way to detox would be to just let my body naturally purify itself. But that could take a month or more. Thats just time I don't have. 

As of now, I'm continuing my job search because I have zero hope that I will be employed by this company. Ive also decided to kick the habit. It's obviously not doing me any favors. 

Any advice helps, any criticisms are welcomed. 

Thank you!",24Aug2020,1

1067,"So last school year my best friend died, and this caused me to become depressed and stop caring about school. I did pretty badly, including failing one class one semester. It was a honors Algebra ll class, and I talked to my counselor, and she told me I could retake it over the summer. I agreed, and this summer, I busted my ass and got an A+ in the summer class they offered me. I was expecting to be able to take precalc, the next step after honors algebra ll, but my counselor told me I had to take algebra lll instead to recover my credit and then could take precalc next year. 

This didn't make sense to me. Why did I take this class over the summer and bust my ass if it was for nothing? I thought it was to recover my credit, but nope, my counselor told me it was a regular algebra ll class rather than an honors one and so doesn't count. I really don't want to take algebra lll for a few reasons: 1) I want to be able to take AP Calc senior year, because colleges offer a lot of credit for it, meaning I can graduate quicker 2) it'll be embarrassing if I take algebra lll. The only reason anyone would take it after honors algebra ll is if they failed, and everyone knows this, so I don't want people thinking I'm dumb or anything 3) I don't want all the time I put in this summer to go to waste. I literally worked night and day to get an A+ instead of having fun, and it's for nothing? Wtf? Why would she even make me take it if there's no reason to?

1070,"So this is obviously super embarrassing for me to even admit to myself let alone put out there on the internet, but I really need help trying to break this weird infatuation.

So I met this girl at college about 5 years ago and she lived in our dorm. We all got on really well in our dorm and formed a big group of friends that we were both a part of. At the start of college we were quite good friends but over the years the friendship faded but we never fell out, just hung out in different circles. She was also dating a guy I knew (not overly friendly with) for the majority of college and still is to this day.

We graduated 2 summers ago and I’ve only seen her once since at a reunion we did, although I’ll most likely never see her again.

I also will stress I don’t find this girl attractive, she’s not the type I would usually go for at all. Sure she’s a pretty girl, but if you asked a lot of guys who the hottest person was at our college I can almost guarantee she wouldn’t be in the conversation. Not to mention me and my friends did start to find her quite annoying sometimes as well. What I’m trying to say is that literally nobody would ever think I even had a crush on her, let alone what really goes on in my head. She was always quite straight lace, serious and not open about sex AT ALL - I feel like that may have a part to play in all this.

So that being said, over the past few years I always find myself thinking sexually about this one random girl. I have masturbated to her social media many times (I’m really not proud of this), in fairness this has cut down a fair amount but sometimes I still find myself doing it and it makes me really ashamed.

In addition to this, when I’m laying in bed at night and horny, I will think up detailed fantasies about having sex with her. Not just regular sex either, it’s almost always me being super submissive to her. I don’t want to go into too much detail but the core fantasy is usually her finding out about me masturbating to her social media somehow and punishing me sexually as a result. This is more often than not her using a strap on and fucking me, but has gone even kinkier with water sports, cuckold type stuff and even even very very mild scat. I am into pegging I’ll admit, but the other stuff is really not a turn on for me in ANY other context so I don’t know why my brain goes to it here.

Sorry for rambling and probably grossing you out, I just can’t seem to break this no matter how much I try. It honestly feels good to just get it off my chest. 

I know nothing will ever happen with this girl, I don’t ever really want it to either. I just need to let go of these fantasies because they make me feel ashamed.

Has anyone ever had anything like this? Any advice in general would be greatly appreciated.",24Aug2020,1

1074,"The title could be seen as misleading so allow me to explain. My girlfriend grew up with one younger brother and her parents were super strict, mostly the dad of course like I said. We both began college this year and while I'm stuck at home because my college closed she still went and is having a great time with her friends finding out more about herself as a person; it's great.  
A problem with that though is we've both talked and she wants to do things, like purchase certain clothing, that her parents just will not accept. And as her boyfriend I can assure you these aren't clothes that are not purposely seductive in any way or outright trashy for lack of a better word. They are cute clothes that someone like her with a good body should be able to wear and that I would obviously not mind her wearing.  
So my thoughts on it are if her parents, Dad mostly, treat her the same way they did when she was say 14-15 there is an increasingly good chance that she will grow to resent them, no? I have had 2 siblings go to college, one boy and one girl, and my parents both understood that this is a huge point in their lives and gave them more freedom to do what they wanted. I know this is different in many households but I still think my original claim stands where she will shun them if it continues.

My only full sibling (older sister) was pregnant 5mo after me with our first kid. Not a big deal. But I was frustrated as a lot of our family was like ""you really do- do everything together."" I was also a little frustrated because when we were both ready to get married around the same time, I asked my boyfriend to wait, as they had been together longer and deserved their own spotlight. We waited 2 years to get married. all the frustration went away after a while, especially after we had our 2 wonderful kids. 

The issue: we are now pregnant, deciding when to announce as we are a little nervous due to the miscarriage. My sister is again pregnant. This time about 6 weeks behind me. I want to cry. No moment in the light. This is our last kid. I feel like I can't even be happy for myself and enjoy this time because I am supposed to be happy for her. I was so excited to announce soon and now I feel like saying ""yeah we are pregnant, buy so is my sister so... carry-on."" At the same time I feel so childish for not just being like ""well life happens."" They asked if we wanted to do an announcement together and I had all I could to have a civil conversation.

Tldr: I have a stingy friend who ruins getaway/nights out by not paying her share or refusing to do anything that costs money.

I met my 2 beat friends in college and we lived together for 3 years and it was a load of fun. In college, nobody has money so we never did anything  overly expensive but Kay always had more money than me and Tay but never spent any. She always used to assume me and Taylor would pay for things and we were supposed to 'take turns' cooking dinner but it always ended up me and Tay buying and cooking and etc. Kay is so nice otherwise but she just will not spend any money! Her family are very well off but they won't spend any money either so it's obviously a family thing. I know it's not my business what they or she does with their finances l, but when I ended up spending a good amount of money on her, even when I had around 10 bucks in my bank, it does become annoying. 

Few years down the road, we are living different lives  but occasionally meet up and go away for the weekend together, all 3 of us. I love seeing them but because she refuses to spend any money, Taylor and I are missing out on experiences that those cities have to offer.  She refuses to do any activities except sit in the hotel (that she usually doesn't chip in for) and talk. Me and Taylor want to go try amazing food at fancy restaurants, drink cocktails, visit museums, do fun outdoor activities but she always says no and guilts us into not doing what we want to do and also we don't want to leave her behind so sometimes we end up the fools by paying for her (even though she has way more money than us but that's not important) 

We have tried to bring this up with her and she got defensive but said sorry and calcined that she was  just raised that way but has not shown any sign she'll change. 

Me and Taylor want to go on a trip by ourselves but I know for a fact that it'll devastate Kay. I don't want to hurt her by excluding her but she does ruin every trip we go on, unfortunately, with her stinginess. She's lovely company otherwise but Taylor and I just want to wine and dine!

1083,"I’m a 26 year old female and have been in a relationship with my bf for 4 years now. We have an amazing relationship, he’s my one without a doubt. There’s something I’ve never told him, or anyone else for that matter, which is when I was 17 years old I catfished a guy I met online (let’s call him James.) We lived on opposite sides of the country and the  relationship lasted close to a year before I finally came clean about who I really was. I was really young and stupid and in a really bad place mentally/emotionally at the time and it is probably my biggest regret to this day. He took it pretty well considering everything. He was obviously very upset but never blew up on me and was never hateful towards me. We tried to be friends after the fact but there was just too much hurt and awkwardness attached to everything so we agreed to part ways. About a year and a half later I get a text from James basically just saying he was thinking about me and was wondering how I was doing and how life was. We had a couple weeks of friendly conversation before it started to turn very flirtatious/suggestive. At this point I told him I thought we should go back to not speaking because there were just too many complicated feelings involved and I had a constant feeling of shame and guilt that I was carrying. He said he understood and once again we parted ways and haven’t spoken since. Today I got a notification that he added me on Snapchat. I haven’t accepted the request and I’m not sure what to do. I definitely do not have a romantic interest in him anymore and I am 100% committed to my bf. Part of me feels guilty still and feels like I owe it to him to see what he wants I guess? But another part of me wants to ignore it completely because I don’t really think anything constructive could come of it and I’ve worked really hard to move past that part of my life. I still deal with feelings of guilt and shame about the whole situation and I don’t want to open up old wounds for either of us.

1084,"So I’ve been with this guy for about 3 months. I knew him since we were kids. We shared a childhood together but he is a bit older than me so there was a large gap between the time we hung out as kids and then now as adults. We’ve had relationships before each other and have been intimate with other people before  of course that doesn’t bug me because that’s life. He’s slept with 8 people including me, I’ve slept with 3 including him (one of which I was engaged to for a year). I assumed he has done a lot of things sexually with these girls because he has slept with all of them, again that didn’t bother me. I have done a lot of things sexually with the first person I had sex with.

 

The thing that bugs me is that him and I have only done 3 positions during sex and he claims that he has done more with me than he has done with anyone else and he’s never been able to be so intimate and “experimental” with anyone before. These are not claims I’ve made because it isn’t true and i feel like it’s kinda disrespectful to go into intimate details about past sexual experiences. Yesterday, he says out of nowhere that he titty fucked one of his girlfriends... if you were going to say that to me, why bother saying us being together is such a unique experience? Why couldn’t you’ve said that in the beginning, or not at all, instead of acting like I’m “special”?

 

I’m not mad it happened, but I’m mad someone “so honest and open about everything with me” would make me feel like I’m different than their exes.. especially when I never expected to be, or asked to be on a different tier than them. Now I just feel stupid and like everything we do is fabricated, especially when it comes to sex. I felt that we had something different and special that we shared with each other but now that’s all feels different. Why do I feel like this? Why lie about it in the first place? Why ever bring it up if you wouldn’t want to hear about my past sexual experiences?

 

He says he doesn’t even like to hear about someone I had a crush on in high school.. why not think the same for me?

1085," I'm really worried and weirded out by my brother (20) who has a 16y/o girlfriend. He'd been talking on the phone to this girl for a few weeks now well into the early hours due to the time difference (shes from America and we're in Europe).
 I didn't think much about it because everyone has online friends, but then I walked past his room a few days ago and he was saying something about how she was only 16 and then something about when he was 19. She responded laughing with ""I thought you were 18"" and i dont know I panicked and just left it. 
 The next day at dinner he mentioned a girlfriend in America. That night I went into his room and talked to him about it.
 He said she was 16 in a week or so, and that she knew his real age and was only telling her parents he's 18. He said he wasn't telling our family for a long while yet. I kept saying how dangerous that is and he said they knew and were both being very careful. The age of consent here is 17 and where she is it's 18. He assured me there was nothing sexual and all and he wasn't grooming her, and I dont know.
 It just makes me uncomfortable as a 17y/o myself ? Like that is someone nearly a year younger than me. I can barely look at a 16y/o as a potential partner I dont know. It's just ... bad I think. Like the last few days my internet consumption has been mostly about the tiktok dudes grooming minors and now it's in my house? I don't know if it's grooming.

What if I go and don’t bond well enough (it would be over phone or zoom) and don’t feel comfortable sharing details on the first appointment and then they decide I don’t need counseling?


I’ve never seen a therapist or even a guidance counselor and I also don’t normally open up to friends in detail (and if I do I just text it) so I’ve never really vocalized my issues and even if I don’t “need” counseling I just need someone to talk to who is confidential and won’t judge me for anything I say. 


I just hope with a session every other week it will actually help me make progress...



On another note, does anyone have advice for what to prepare for my consultation? Goals, symptoms, concerns?",24Aug2020,1
1091,"This is going to be a long one.

Before I start, let me know if this is a suitable subreddit to post this in, as this could be seen as more of a ‘getting off my chest’ sort of post. I am unfamiliar with the different subreddits on this site, so I am not aware of anywhere else to post something like this. Also I apologise if I go off topic quite a bit. And please note that I’m posting this on a ‘throwaway’ account, and I’ll probably delete it in the morning when I regret posting all of this lmao.

It all started when I was 11-12 years old (can’t remember the exact age as it was something that came gradually. I guess I could stretch it back to 9-10 years old when I was interesting in how games were made in general). I wanted to learn how Minecraft was made, and I wanted to make a ‘Minecraft clone’ of my own. I think it was around age 12-13 when I started learning my first programming language (Game Maker Language) and I created my first 2D Minecraft. Looking back, it wasn’t a great game. However I was proud of it at the time as it featured endless terrain (didn’t look great) and an inventory/crafting system (incredibly flawed and prone to bugs). After that I started getting into Java, and made the same game again (hardly an improvement though, as the lack of optimisation and care for my code caused the game to implode when dealing with large worlds, so you could argue that it was worse than its Game Maker counterpart). I then went on to learn Unity, which I am still using today. My first game was published in Unity, although I ended up taking it down after a day or two as I had lost the project files, and there was a game breaking bug that allowed people to cheat their way to the top of the leaderboard. It was incredibly short sighted of me to take it down, and I regret it every day. It was getting actually getting downloads and being played, but I was 15 years old and I took it down to punish myself for losing the files, and I regretted it the next morning. I am also in the process of learning Python (machine learning) and C++. Throughout my learning I had convinced myself and my peers that I was going to be a millionaire game developer by the age of 18 (didn’t happen). This is not a problem in itself, but I believe this is what sparked mine my family's belief that I'm going to be the best at whatever I do. 

Fast forwarding a few years, when I first started university, I started to get interested in politics (actually, that isn’t entirely true, I started getting interested in politics in 2016 with the American presidential election, and the Brexit referendum that took place in my country. But the age of 18 was when I was getting very interested in politics, domestic and global). Politics and love for my country had (and still has) taken over my life. I even ended a relationship because she wasn’t as interested as I am (sorry not sorry), but we are still friends to this day, although she does want to get back together, but I don’t. When I’m not debating politics with my family or friends, I honestly don’t have anything interesting to say. My hobbies no longer interest me. It got to the point where I simply had enough of my flatmates at University and I would disappear, whether it was a very long walk, or if id get on random buses to see where I get taken (it was pretty entertaining to be fair). But the thing that gets me the most, is the lack of understanding a lot of people have with what’s going on around them. The fact that some people are incredibly uninformed and get their information from their favourite (biased) newspaper. These people can swing elections, and it is these people who have the potential to vote tyrants into office. It wasn’t long before I had the dream of becoming Prime Minister, or at the very least, a member of Parliament. I would be drawing up plans with the friends who were interested of what I would do. We even come up with a plan to turn the country into a dictatorship which was pretty entertaining, although it’ll never happen (or will it?). It wasn’t long before my family was on board (with the Parliament dream, not the dictatorship :D), and a relative wanted to put me in touch with a friend of his, a former leader of the Liberal Democrats, but it never happened as I wasn’t interested in joining that party. I lost interest in my hobbies (except programming), and nothing anybody said interested me if it wasn’t about politics. I was convinced that I’m going to become an MP and take over the world with the New British Empire. And that clouded my thoughts.

Honestly what makes it worse (or better?) is that I’m surrounded by people who also think I’m going ‘make it big’ and become Prime Minister. Pretty much my entire family believes that I’m some genius robot (my mother literally described me as a robot, at least its not as bad as my sister who believes I’m a sociopath (I know I’m not a sociopath otherwise id have been diagnosed years ago. And the fact that id put my country before myself proves that I’m not one) but I’m sure its all in good humour). I believe it can be positive to be surrounded by people who keep you grounded and put everything into perspective, which is something I don’t have. I do love my family though, and I appreciate their belief in me. Although I think this belief went too far when my mother tried to convince me to run for the local elections next year (I haven’t even finished university yet lol, and who in the right mind would vote for a 20 year old (the age ill be by the time of the election) to represent them? I certainly wouldn’t. I believe that most people around that age (myself included) haven’t fully matured their political views. Although I am a member of the Labour Party, I do edge more conservative economically, but I am more progressive on social issues and even that will most likely change as I mature more). I honestly hate both parties equally, but that’s for another discussion. I have also gotten very interested in American politics, a bit too much actually. Although it is quite amusing educating Americans on their own constitution even though I’m a British person who despises America (Suez crisis anyone?) I mean what sort of country threatens financial devastation on an ally? I believe America was party responsible for the collapse of the British Empire, their betrayal damaged our reputation severely. However I found comfort when I started playing Hearts of Iron, because turning America back into a colony under Britain was pretty therapeutic :)

I have a deep passion for this country and I have even put together a plan to restore our reputation on the world stage, and a tax plan that will encourage people to save (I won’t get into detail as this is not a politics subreddit). I am surrounded by people who ‘big’ me up, and use me as a bragging right in family feuds (long story), but deep down I know that I am just another person out of millions in this country who have the same dream, and the same, if not better achievements. I don't want to wake up one day in the year 2050 for another day at a job I hate, deeply unhappy and wondering where it all went wrong. The thought of this makes me sick to my stomach. And living it would be a nightmare. The day where I realise that I am not going to live my dream, instead I will watch the country crumble around me, as it has been and will continue to do so. Knowing that there’s nothing I can do other than grunt at the newspaper when a useless self serving politician sells themselves out yet again. I will be stuck in the routine of getting up for work every day, working myself to death with nothing to show for it. I will go home to my average house in an average neighbourhood, not knowing what the hell to do with my life. Whilst my friends and family who once envied me are living their dreams and are leading happy lives. 

The reason I have written this post is not because of self pity, or a desire for attention. I just want to know if there will be a time where I just ‘snap out of it’, and how to deal with it when that time comes. Because I do not want to lead a life where I am deeply unhappy. But I feel like my dreams in life have made it inevitable. I will actively try my best to achieve my dream, its not that I’ve given up. It’s just that I have been raised by my parents to believe that I’m ‘exceptional’ and that I can do anything. I just want to know if it’s possible to achieve my dream. Or if I'm just being naive, which is fine. I don't want to disappoint myself later on in life after all of the 'bigging up' I have had from my family and friends.",24Aug2020,1

1096,"So about 2 months ago my gf broke up with me due to mental health reasons and she asked me multiple times to give her space, I struggled with this at first but I've left her alone for about 3-4 weeks now and I am not assuming that she'll be better because a month has passed but I'm wondering if I should talk to her about hanging out again.
Every Friday after school my gf (15) and I (16) would hang out after school bc she would have to pick her brother up from his school 2 hours later. This 2 hours a week was the most time we'd get to spend together outside of school because it wasnt a guarantee that I would see her over the weekend as both of my parents work weekends and I live in the country whereas she lives in a town, o I recalling enjoyed those 2 hours, it was practically the foundation of our relationship bc it was one of those days when I had walked her home and I realised that I really liked and it was also one of those days when I confessed to her so they were and still are really important to me.
I know she is still going to be in the town for that time as she'll still have to pick her brother up and I'm wondering is it stupid just to say to her that I ain't going to keep texting her and trying to talk to her, I'll still give her the space that she needs but if she ever needs anyone to hang out with after school on Friday then just tell me. I was planning to say it to her in person give it maybe a week or two but I guess I'll just leave it up to random strangers on the Internet.

Both times that he came in, no customers were around so it was only us two in the store. He asks questions about the job, and then tries to get really personal, telling me stories and trying to make a connection. On one hand, this could just be a sad older man trying to talk to people, but on the other hand, the entire situation feels wrong. My coworkers are really worried and even my boss is concerned. He comes in and sits and talks for an hour or so, then leaves. This last time he said, ""See you later!"" which really made some alarms go off in my head.

1100,"I'm actually real tired. 

i have tried everything and am tired of the bullshit, tired of the repeat advice and than being told that I'm not allowed to date its fucking discouraging, and as soon as I say that I am incel the advice will change to automatically ""women dont owe you sex"" and straight garbage shit advice from women who will talk about their sex life on their pages openly and what is required of their sex partners while they look at me and say I'm not trying hard enough. 

I swear to God I'm a normal looking guy and I weigh a normal amount and also work out and all that horse shit, I have a personality even though automatically since I say I'm incel you will claim it's my personality, I'm working on 2 degrees, have a good job in a field I've been studying for, so on so on. 

What makes me want to go back to being involved in the incel community is that it's all bullshit and I think they are right, women do seem to really want chad man, not cause his personality, not cause his sweetness, but cause of his looks man. 

I've been around women and seen them drool over the hot guy man, and I'm not a pussy I openly talk about my incel beliefs to women cause Idc, and they basically tell me I'm right, they will tell me of course the hot guy gets to take turns with all of them and lonely men no matter how hard working, how dedicated, how fucking loyal, nothing matters man, women dont care. 

I just want to have a family one day and a wife and kids, than I'll get advice like ""hire a hooker, hookers are licensed medical professionals and can help you with this wrong think of wanting romantic relationships!"" Than claiming I'm sexist if I say, ""I am not losing my virginity to a hooker, that literally makes me feel horrible"" 

I mean maybe its just the internet but women online seem so so so fucking rude when it comes to anything, anything!

How are incels wrong? How? They literally do have studies to back up their claims from pretty good damn scources, we all know it man.

Tl;dr: after dropping out of school because of bullys and not getting my gcse's im starting a course tomorrow that will give me some, im very anxious and terrified i will be a failiure and see no point in living in the future if my life is inevitebly mediocre/awful, am i horrible for feeling this way and how can i calm my nerves and anxiety?

So for context I live in uk and i should have left secondary school with my GCSE's earlier this month but in year 10 (dont know how they work in america but thats like a year before we leave at 16) i left to be home schooled because i was bullied out and if you know uk teen culture you would understand how that can be, i put up with it for the most part but the final staw was when i was too scared to leave my own home for (a probably irrational) fear of being jumped (had happend once or twice).

During my 'homeschool' period (1-2 years) i hadn't learned anything educational but deffinetly some life lessons from traveling, seeing different cultures and working for my parents in there bar, (i moved to another town so ive gained some confidence back) but nothing for my gcse's, i started college in my previous town for a course that would give me basic english and maths gcse's but left the next day as it went on strike, we moved before they reopend. And because of corona ive been just sitting in my house and i got deppression i think and my therapist told me 'i thinck to exerstentially' basically saying im too hung up in what could happen and whats going on than to just live a normal life, i agree but dont know how to change this. I start a new college tomorrow for a basic maths and english gcse but im freaking out, for example i left my last college after two days because i couldnt find my class, luckily i didnt have to go back due to teacher strikes, corona and eventually moving. Im sorry for such a long post but how do i cope with all this, alongside this a month ago i found out my dog doesnt have much longer left and a week ago i confessed my love for my crush of 8 years to witch i was immediatly rejected, this is unrelated but is what ive got on my mind 24/7 and does not help.

I know if i dont succeed il work some deadend job and my life will be working paycheck to paycheck (no offense to anyone who lives like this)  but i dont want that for my life and im so scared that if my life turns out this way theres no point in living and im petrified im not gonna be successful. Sorry if i sound odd or selfish but im just shaking wrighting this. So what could i do to change my inevitable failiure and how do i cope with my the pressure and is there something wrong with me for feeling like this?  Sorry for the long post.",24Aug2020,1
1104,"My best friend from high school and I had a falling out early on in college. We didn’t speak for years after. Approximately 6 years after the falling out, the friend reached out to me, out of the blue, to get a meal and sort of “fix” where we left off. We got lunch and talked and caught up on each other’s lives. 

I left the lunch feeling like we had buried the hatchet, but that I didn’t want to pursue the relationship any further. We were such different people now and didn’t click like we used to. I was satisfied that if I ever ran into the friend or saw them at a HS reunion it wouldn’t be awkward and we could catch up again. It seemed like the friend felt the same way because we didn’t talk again after that lunch.

Four years later, I get another text from the friend out of the blue. Apparently the friend moved back into town and they suggested another meet up. That meet up didn’t happen. Another 8 months go by and I get another text to meet up. After a few weeks we finally get dinner. After that dinner it was abundantly clear to me that the friend wants to pursue a friendship again. I have no interest in doing so.

The friend has suggested multiple dinners/ hang outs since and I feel bad constantly turning them down with one excuse or another. I don’t want to be rude, as there is a good chance I will have to see this friend in the future at random occasions.

1106,"Let me start this off with saying that my mom is my best friend and we talk multi times a day as she now lives in another part of the country. 

About 7 years ago, my mom moved away while I was working for a company that paid me less than I was making in fast food. I was able to get into low income housing but money has always been an issue for me (Also, currently the apt complex changed and are no longer low income housing so the rent went from 600.00 to 1,000.00, which is the lowest rent rate in my area). When my mother left, I was given the car as she wouldn't be able to transport it to where she moved. As I stated previously, money has always been an issue as my rent was 690.00 and one paycheck was 600.00. So to save money, over the years I've given up a lot of luxuries like no a/c (I live in fl) and no hot water when taking a shower even in winter.

I was doing ok but over the years the car broke down so many times that it placed me in massive amounts of debt. No matter how much I cut back I could never get out from under it as everytime I did overtime the car would break down again and it always 1k in damage. I eventually was able to get a job that paid 3 dollars more but again was not able to get out from the debt and had to open up more credit car dd's s to max out because I didn't have enough money for food. 

Now, it's almost been 10 years that I've been in a massive amount of debt and I just come to accept that it is what it is and I'll probably carry it, along with my students loans until I'm in my 50s.

I was always really embarrassed about my financial situation so I never really talked about it. Whenever it came to my siblings children's birthdays or if my mom needed something I would just charge it to the credit card. 

I'm making payments towards my debt and my for the most part I was always able to stretch my funds to have everything I needed. This all changed when I received a ""promotion"" and had to move to our corporate office that is 1 hour and 30 mins away from me. When I accepted the higher position, I wasn't given a pay raise and if it weren't for my mental health being destroyed by my racist supervisor then I would have declined the offer. (Before anyone says to just ask my boss for a raise, I have but I would have to ask the vp of the company and she told me that the chances were low due to me making on the higher end of their pay scale). Anyways, the longer drive is really eating into my food budget so I started eating ramen for every meal about 2 months into getting the new job. I've been there for almost 2 years and things have gotten worst. Mostly my plan was just to get a second job in 2020 but covid happened.

Now here is the part I need advice on, my mom found out that I was eating ramen for every meal and offered to help me out financially. I accept it but feel really guilty as I should be taking care of her, not the other way around since she is in her 50s and makes below mim wage. I told her that I was in debt but didn't disclose the extent of it. When covid hit, I was allowed to work from home and I thought I would be ok since the gas budget would be completely removed. But, and this is totally my own fault, on the first month of quarantine I dont know if it was from the extra stress but I ended up buying too much food and over drafted my account. 

Myself and my mother had a conversation about it and I ended up confessing how much debt I was in. My mom, flipped out and couldn't sleep and just cried for 48 hours straight. I try to not think about my debt or situation as I have terrible insomnia and whenever I get stressed out I cant sleep. Well due to covid I hadn't slept well since march. 

My mom came up with the decision that all the money that I make from my job just goes to Bill's and she would buy me everything else that I need. I thought that this would be ok but ever since we've made that deal shes gone from being supportive to yelling at me for getting myself in this situation. It's gotten to the point where my mom has had to go to the hospital three times because of how stressed out she is because of my financial situation and me getting physically sick because of the stress as well. 

This all came to a head on Saturday, when I had a raging headach and she was yelling at me for forgetting to order my replacement drivers license (I'm still under lock down so I didn't need it right away) and I snapped and yelled back. 

I apologize on Sunday for raising my voice but asked her to not yell at me when I'm not feeling well. She didn't back down and at the end of the phone call I didn't tell her that I loved her like I usually do. She started texting me this morning that I hurt her feelings and I told her that I think we should spend some time not speaking because all we're doing is doing damage to each other. 

I dont know how to deal with this and how to speak to my best friend/mother without just stressing us both out again. Can anyone share some advice",24Aug2020,1
1107,"I switched into Software Development a couple of years ago, and I just completed my degree in it. I also just got my first coding job.

Most of the people in the same category as me however are polar opposite in that instead of not being able to choose a passion in life they wish to purse because they are passionate about so many different things they just don't care at all and because this is so many people I am worried that I will settle for less than I know I am capable of. I am not trying to be arrogant but all of my friends that are passionate about 1 thing in life talk to me about it and I always know more than them. I didn't spend very much time playing video games as I just sat around and read and watched documentaries on just about every topic under the sun. Yet with all of this I specialize in nothing at all. Everywhere I look the most successful innovative minds ever were people who spent their live or most of it passionate about the one thing they become rich from. I have so many regrets already like not trying enough in school when I knew for a fact I was much smarter than even the valedictorian of it. It was my lack of desire to learn what school had to offer that I believe this happened. Now I am in a community college where only people in the category I was talking about earlier reside. They don't care about success they just want to get money to survive and do nothing with their potential. I have spread myself so thin on what I know and what I want to do. The thing is, is that I want to do somewhere near 10 completely opposite things and I cannot even near decide on a single one that I wish to devote my absolute attention to. This is mostly just a ramble and I am sure the answer is already in my head and has already been told to me many time but I am writing this just to write essentially.",24Aug2020,1

1112,"I initially wrote this post on r/offmychest to process my fear. Expressing myself helped a lot and also got some support, but I'm getting a new wave of nervousness and I'd like to get some concrete advice here. I'll modify my post a bit so that it's more advice oriented than express-of-anguish oriented.

Here's the story:

For the last 2 years, I've been taking part-time classes as an independent student to get the pre-requisites for a M. Sc. I got accepted in my M. Sc. under the condition that I get a B average in my first session. I will be starting in September 2020.

I am terrified, for so many reasons:

1. I really did sincerely work and try hard and only barely got accepted. I always thought that if I put 100% in what I do, I could accomplish anything. Is there some advice to work better or more efficiently?
2. Now, with the distance learning, I find it harder to get the grades I used to get. Does anyone have advice for this specific context?
3. For some teachers, it feels like they're so over teaching students the same thing from year to year, that they're not even interested in their subject anymore. It's hard to find a subject interesting when the teacher doesn't seem interested. For other teachers, I think they don't realize that they've been studying their subject for years. So, it's not obvious for students to master certain notions in four months, when the teacher has had so much more time to understand the intricacies. Is there any tricks to use when the teacher's teaching methods don't work with me?
4. This summer, I read the book ""The Science of Self-Learning"" by Peter Hollins. I tried out the learning tools for one of my classes. I set a study schedule and wrote Cornell notes for my textbook. I even did it twice: re-wrote the notes, re-did my assignments and re-did the midterm before the final. The final result came in and I failed this class. On one hand, I'm not too preoccupied, because it's not the field I want to study in. On the other hand, if I can't rely on self-learning when the usual methods don't work, what can I do? What are my options? What if I don't have more options after that?
5. I'm from Canada. We're the country with the highest ratio of tertiary education in the world. My siblings have M. Sc's. So many people have an M. Sc. What if I can't? Do you guys have any tricks to deal with that kind of anxiety?
6. What if I'm just stupid? What if I've hit my glass ceiling? I don't want to hit it here. Are there any tricks to go further than what our limits presently dictates?

I'm so scared. I can visualize myself torn apart at the end of the session, because I really, actively, did sincerely try and it still wouldn't be enough. I couldn't reach the goal I've been working on for the last 2 years, which isn't even an unattainable goal by canadian standards. I want it so bad and I don't know what I would do if it didn't work out. I will go through it and I will give it my best, but I'm really hope my best will be enough.",24Aug2020,1

So there’s this girl I’ve been getting mixed signals from and I’ve been told varied things. My first experience with her is when I was just up the park with my mates and she came on a horse with her friends and chased us with the slapping thing. She always comes down my road while riding and talks to my younger sister then my sister makes it a big thing. She messaged me on Snapchat and we talked then I was apparently “not the right person” when my person is ginger and the guy she thought she was talking to was blonde. And my full name is there. It’s just this kinda stuff but different each time. Recently while drunk she messaged me and we talked and she made fun of me and stuff. That conversation lasted almost three hours and she was with loads of friends. We’ve been msging for the past 3 days for atleast 3 hours",24Aug2020,1
1117,I feel like I can talk to stanger all shapes and sizes completely fine. But as someone I'm not too familiar texts me on any social media such as Snapchat I completely panic and try to minimize conversation with them. Any one have any advice or is it just me that acts like this ?,24Aug2020,1
1118,"Things I need advice and help on 

1. How to time manage and complete classes. I have 6 classes that are all online and it's hard to keep up with all of them so I was wondering how other people do it. I was thinking about completing an assignment every day but...
2. How to be more productive/motivated. Continuing the 1st question, I don't have much, or any for that matter, motivation. I feel that school is useless and that there is literally no point in any of this. 
3. How to get over anxiety/fear of calling teachers. Because all my classes are online, I have to do DBAs (Discussion Based Assignments). Basically you call the teacher and they give you some questions that you have to answer.  I'm not sure why I'm so nervous to call them I just am. i think its because I'm a bit afraid of failure but at the same time its mostly me being scared of calling in general
4. How to have more energy. I feel mid to low energy all day every day. Even if i get a good night's sleep, tired, if I drink coffee, tired, nothing helps and I think that's what stops me sometimes from doing assignments because I just don't have the drive and energy to do them. 

As you can see I am a terrible terrible student. I am really not fit for school at all. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated!",24Aug2020,1

1120,"Ok, so here's the situation: I (24M) want to move out of my parents' house. I'm gay, they're not cool with it, I'm tired of arguing about it, so I just want to leave.

Problem is, I'm closeted and my friends who I would ask to live with me probably wouldn't want to be friends anymore if they found out (I know you'll probably say oh but you don't know that! yes i do. they've made their stance on lgbt issues clear through the years i've known them). The limited amount of friends I have who do know I'm gay either don't live near me or already live with an SO.

1123,"Hello everybody, (I apologize for the length)

So there’s a kid sports team that plays in the park behind my house twice a week in the late afternoon. To get an adequate image of what this looks like: parents sitting on portable lawn chairs, eyes and hands locked to their phones, kids running around practicing and two coaches. 

The coaches decided this year it’s best to play right by the swings, within 10 feet of my back yard. 
The park is 15-20 acres of flat, perfect grass, with the exception of a kid play area with swings and all. 
We have a tree that provides shade which is probably why they’re there. 
Fyi - There’s shade on the other edges of the park but  it’s less of a walk to be near our house.

I have two dogs; a beagle and a husky. I let them out multiple times a day because they are dogs, they need to go out. They can also bark (beagle) and bite (husky). 

I was in my office doing some work when I hear the dogs barking abnormally, so I decide to check on them. (I check on them every half hour to see what they’re up to). 

To my surprise, a little kid from the sports team - supposed to be practicing - is kicking the fence repeating “shut up” to my beagle. She’s small and chunky, so if he were to kick her, she’d be pretty hurt. 
My boyfriend &amp; our neighbor went to yell at them telling them to be parents and watch their kids, pointing out the whole 20 acres of park available. No swearing or insults were expressed out loud. 
The second my bf got out the door the kid ran back and the parents’ eyes got off their phones for a second. 

Nothing. Not a peep. No adult interaction. Neither the coaches nor the parents said anything back. 

I think I’m going to get a sign that says “beware dog”, “dogs bark &amp; bite”, or something along these lines.

I just wanted some ideas as to what else could be done to ensure that the future holds no kids “accidentally” kicking my dog in the face because she barks.

I don't usually watch any shows with live action actors in it, nothing has ever particularly interested me  besides Doctor who and Casualty and even then I was bad at watching anything in order.

1126,"Hey everyone first time poster here looking for advice if any. All help is appreciated and welcomed. So I'll try to explain this as best as I can. 

My sister has a lot of dogs, dachshunds to be exact. They listen to a degree but they aren't trained. This is just for context. Anyway. I have watched them in different numbers for various reasons over the last few years. Each time grows more difficult because, well they keep getting more dogs. Of the dogs, they have 3 of them that i get along with well. The 4th i get along with as well, hes blind. The 5th absolutely hates me and has nipped and bitten at me. If its in its crate and i walk past. It will lunge the crate forward to try to get to me. The 6th is skiddish and freaked out by new people.

 The last time i watched the dogs it was because it my brother in law was having surgery. I also spent the 2 day window washing and cleaning every single surface and disinfecting everything since this was major surgery. I was beat after all of this. 5 and 6 were boarded for thus period and the other 4 got alont amazingly. 5 is very aggressive and tries to be alpha and also when it is not around the others dont even bark randomly. When it is there its non stop. 

So my sister asked me not long ago if id help watch them again when he goes in for knee surgery. Less serious, home next day no issue. Plan was same as before.  Board 2 and watch 4. Well covid happened and after reschedules and such and him losing his job they've been overwhelmed. So the plan was still the same but then they got a 7th dog. Another blind pup. Recently one of the really good doggos had a injury and is having back leg difficulty so she has to be monitored closely. 

So my sister can't board any of them. So id be stuck with the dogs. Here are some concerns and details.

I either have to go tonight and be there in a house with tonsss of dog hair and allergens that affect my breathing. Or be up at 5 am and at their house when they go. To which when he goes in for surgery she will be coming back for a little while. Mind you.  I live currently with my elderly father who has health issues to a degree and do not want to be potentially exposed. She then said she would to back once hes out and then come back again. Exposure 2. And then may need help the following morning him coming back. Exposure 3. Theres a lot being pushed at me and I feel like this is expected of me at this point. I have some toxic family background with habits i want to distance myself from. 

I had a problem a while back where my sister left work to make sure I was okay. She threw that in my face. Saying she wont be there the next time, all because i told her how overwhelming 7 animals is for me. My father and sister both throw things in my face or use guilt to pretty much get me to fold my entire life. I have a hard time saying no to people.  I try to express concerns i have with either of them or say things that are on my mind and its immediate deflection and finger pointing at me for some irrelevant point or something i did that they wanna compare it to. Or if they want to ""win"" they dig nails in with horrible comments about topics they know still bother you because they know it will get to me. For example my dad mocking my voice and calling me my mothers new husbands name because i dont associate with them. Or my sister bringing up personal things that bother me or issues i face. 

I tried to ask my dad about it and he agreed and immediately flip flopped with the ""well you should do things for your family no matter what. Even if your anger towards her husband is what it is. Youre helping her "" Im at a loss. I recognize these issues. These habits. These feelings that I'm not allowed to have and want to change those things but am pretty much manipulated with guilt, fear and emotional distress. I need help and I've always gotten really good insight from people i dont know. No bias opinions. 

This may be the wrong spot for this post and i definitely just threw up a bunch of randomness above. Tried my best to get as much info in it for informative purposes. I can answer any questions or clarify any information if need be. If you need more context or info to specifics i can also do my best. Thanks for listening or more so reading.

1127,"Hello, hope all is well with you

I'm confused with myself and most importantly with a decision I've made; for a good chunk of time roughly about a year, I decided to cut off co-workers, friends out of my life. These people are not horrible people, but they lack substance. They don't have any goals, all they know is drugs, partying and working a minimum job. I don't like that. Being around them remind me of my own insecurities and my own failures. I want to surround myself with people who enjoy discussing a wide range of topics such as: poetry, philosophy, science, politics, AI, finance. I want to surround myself with people with real goals, achieving real professions, people who take life seriously. I want to be around friends that are not afraid of expressing their bold opinions, I want to be around friends that aren't afraid of showing their wild fun side either. Most importantly, I want to be around people that inspire me. As I've lost long term friends whom I honestly felt the most connected to, ""friends"" that I make now, make me feel empty, I feel nothing for these people which can explain why it's so easy for me to cut them off. I really wish changing your life around 360 wasn't hard, but that's exactly what it's supposed to be. It's supposed to be painful, you're supposed to cry until your eyes hurt, but it's never impossible. It's only an obstacle that you can overcome no matter how inconceivable it may seem. I don't know if this decision was a form of self-sabotage or not and I welcome any type of advice or perspective other than my own. Thanks for reading :)",24Aug2020,1
1128,"So backstory: about four months ago my partner and I opened a food truck in addition to our existing restaurant in a very rural area. We’ve struggled with finding reliable staff since we moved to this area, so eventually I put out a notice in some far-off FB groups that I thought might turn up results.

I should mention I’m not a permanent member of staff but I often work at either location to help my partner. In fact I have a separate full time job working from home. So helping him find an employee was important for me to be able to do my work too. 

So she’s a city person and has never worked in hospitality and at first she thought it would be kind of fun. At the time she also wanted to earn as much money as possible so she asking for the maximum amount of hours. Fast forward two months and she’s pretty miserable, bored, often feeling overworked (it’s 99% of the time a one person job but it can get busy, and our other non-reliable staff sometimes don’t come to help). She keeps complaining to me about the job (even though she’s only contracted to work two more weeks), and it’s making me feel so uncomfortable because even though I’m not really the person who hired her (she works for my partner), I feel somehow responsible for her happiness, having recruited her up here knowing what the job would be like. At the end of the day it’s not a job that’s for everyone and although she’s a star at it and she’s helped us soooo much bridging the gap before our other manager arrives, I wish she’d just suck it up and have a better attitude. She asked for this many hours and knew what she was getting into! 

My partner seems to think he’s paying her enough (they agreed on a rate per day she’s there and some kind of cut if profits pass a certain threshold), so I don’t think her salary is the issue. 

Does anyone have advice for how I can maybe make her feel better but also kind of give her a reality check that it’s not cool to complain about the job you wanted  and agreed upon to the partner of your boss?? It just sucks because we’re also friends now and I don’t want her to feel like I’m not her friend. Sad part is the more she does this the more I gravitate toward “well if she leaves the job early it will cause a huge problem for me and my partner and I’d never want to talk to her again” which makes me feel like bad person for thinking that. 

Any and all advice welcome, thanks for reading.",24Aug2020,1
1129,"I (15) went out to dinner this evening with my parents, I left the table to go to a nearby TK Maxx (TJ Maxx for the American readers). I saw some nice stuff so went over to the till to buy it. I spoke to the guy who was scanning the items and thought he was pretty cute and he looked around my age. The receipt took ages to print, so I just told him to keep it. We laughed a bit and he gave me my stuff and off I went. 

Just as I left the store, I mentally said ‘Please give me a sign if I should go back in there and get his number’. 

So, I walk all the way back and no sign And just as I’m about to walk into the resturaunt I just think...

Fuck. It. 

I walked all the way back to the store and went to the tills. He was there; great start. I basically just said I lost my card here (I hadn’t) and asked if he had seen it. He laughed and said he didn’t. I asked if I could leave my number with him and if he could call if they would find it. Basically, we just laughed and spoke for a few minutes and it went super well! For my first time ever asking a guy ‘out’ (not really out but you get the point) I was super proud of myself. 

A few hours later...no message or call. That’s when it hit me. On the Uber back, I checked my phone number and realised I had given him my old number. What kind of idiot does that?

I said no it’s okay let’s keep walking. He insisted I said ok figuring We’d go inside, look around, and I’d say there was nothing I liked and we’d leave like I always do. Instead we went in and as we were walking around he handed me a bag and told me to put whatever I wanted in the bag and he’d buy it for me. I never accept any gifts from him so I said no thank you it’s okay but again he insisted and even chose a lingerie set and leggings for me and put them in the bag. Mind you he had a little over 11k cash in his wallet which he took out of town for the sole purpose of spending. Again though I never accept any gifts so I never expected any of that money to be spent on me. Anyways I choose some 5 for $25 underwear and as we’re heading to the register he tells me he can give me 100$ now or later... he did the math and knew the total was 180$ and change. I told him it was okay I’d pay for it (because at this point we were already ringed up.) I was left with 20$. I got upset because I didn’t even want anything in the first place and he was the one that chose the expensive pieces which I had to pay even though he said he would have. I didn’t let him know I was upset but it really bothered me. We have been together 1 year he’s never bought me anything which is okay I don’t want him to but I’m just upset that the only time I ever allow him to he decides to change his mind without letting me know before hand. If he wanted me to pay that’s no problem I would have even though I didn’t really want what he had picked out but he could have told me. Idk I just feel weird about that incident.. am i over reacting? am I in the wrong?

1132,"First of all, thank you in advance for everyone who has the time to read all of this and hear me out, and taking the time to help me in any way. In order to understand where I am now, there's quite a bit of history to cover. 

High school, sophomore year, April 2017. My life was pretty great. I was an intelligent student, had great friends, and was in multiple clubs. Specifically, I was mainly in Accelerated and AP classes, had A's and B's, 4.0+ GPA, and participated in Swim, Chess, and Piano - and I these were things I was really invested in. However, around this time my mother was diagnosed with myelofibrosis, a bone cancer that is very difficult to treat. 

Summer time came, and my mother was hospitalized for the first time. When Junior year began, I was already in 6 AP classes, and was ready to take on the load head on. However, my mother's condition worsened, and since my father works a night job, it was very difficult for him to do everything. I had no choice but to step in. I had to drive my mother back and forth to the hospital multiple times throughout the school year, resulting in me missing roughly 40 days of school. This directly affected my grades. Despite understanding the material I was supposed to do work on, and scoring relatively well on tests, I barely managed to pass my classes both semesters with C's and D's. In addition, I scored 1200 on my SAT, which to me wouldn't do as practice tests I did a year before scored me at 1430. At the end, Junior year was truly a struggle. My GPA dropped, I lost a large portion of my friends, but gladly pulled through, and my mother's condition improved. 

Now we're in the summer of 2018, my mother is feeling better and confident, and takes out her life insurance policy to pay of debts, and help my father as he continues to work on his own for a while. My mother earned $70,000+ yearly, while my father earned $35,000. Keep in mind, they're both Polish immigrants. The house we were living in had roughly 12 years left on the mortgage (important for later), and at the end of paying debts, I believe $70,000 was left over of the approx. $240,000 insurance policy. Since things were looking up, I decided to go all in with school to fix my grades. I took 5 AP classes, and was ready to work hard for my A's. I also didn't choose a college yet, since I planned on retaking my SAT.

The first 3 months of Senior year were great. Then, my mother got hospitalized again... soon things began repeating. I missed around 25 days of school. Despite doing okay the first semester (C's and B's), the second was much worse and led to my GPA tanking to the high 2's low 3's. I barely earned my Diploma, and actually stunned my counselor when I was able to fix some F's to D's in the last few weeks. Now we're in May 2019, and I graduated. My mother was feeling better at the time and was able to go to my graduation. So at this point, I have a Diploma, my mom is doing alright for now, but still needed to be hospitalized on occasions, my GPA is around 3.0, and I have 1200 SAT, and no university or college planned. At this point, I decided to take a GAP year to just take care of my mother. My mother was very hopeful, in fact, we bought a new house 40 miles from where we previously lived. And we have a new mortgage to pay. We began renting out the old house.

In June or August, my mother got hospitalized again, this time it was pretty bad. Despite all of our best efforts, my mother passed away on September 15th, 2019. And this is when I was hit hard. Everything I worked for these past 3 years was just thrown out the window. I felt anger and grief, feeling like none of this was warranted. I literally lost everything, and was now living 40 miles from any friends and family. A month later, after the funeral, I learned about my father's financial state. He and my mother had around $50,000 in credit card debt and $70,000 saved/left over from the insurance policy from earlier.

Nearly a year has passed, and I feel like I let my self go a bit. I worked a few small jobs with my uncle and suspended any thoughts of college/university. My sister, who I'm not a fan of, moved back in with me and my father. Now allow me to explain my current situation. My dad has $40,000 in credit card debt which I pretty much inherited. I only have just over $1,000 saved myself, as I've been helping my father a bit. We currently have $50,000 which includes the left over from the ins. policy, $30k of which we began investing to hopefully grow from it, and $20k which my father is keeping to pay off debts and minimal credit cards fees. We have a monthly expense of $3,000, and $1,400 of that I believe is off of credit cards min. payments alone. The house we are renting out is currently giving us $2,300 a month, $2,100 of which is being used to pay off the mortgage of that house which we still have 10 years on.  

I try to get my family to live a very minimal lifestyle and begin to not use credit cards and just stop spending on things we genuinely do not need. Despite my best efforts, my father and sister don't commit. My father tries, but my sister is a whole different story.

My sister is always out to get me. I'll try to remove all of my bias on describing her, so keep in mind this may be very slightly over exaggerated and not a good reflection on her whole character. But she's always out to get me. Since I was always the academically driven one, and she was more of the party type, she'd resent me for being ""mature"". She thinks I'm a snobby little brat that's self obsessed, meanwhile she claims she's somehow the complete opposite. She has a dog, and when I refuse to take her dog out on a walk, she calls me lazy. She does work real estate, she has a very small income, but she has a serious spending problem because we receive Amazon packages every other day which end up being cosmetic items, dog toys, or accessories to her car. What makes it worse is that she uses my father's cards. In fact my she has taken pictures of my father's cards to save. By the way she's 24.

I think she has an anger management problem, severe self entitlement, and also makes suicidal remarks saying how she hates everything about her current situation and how she deserves better. You'd think this is serious, which it is, but whenever I try to come up to her and talk to her nicely about it, she curses and tells me to get lost because I'm only a ""child"" and ""immature"". My father and I tried everything, but she's an unmovable object, and I have no idea why my father hasn't kicked her out yet. The only reason being is that sometimes she can be helpful, and barely breaks even when taking to account her spending of my father's money and the amount she gives him occasionally. 

All I'm trying to tell her is that we can be a bit further in everything if we work together to stop unnecessary spending.

So I need help. What do I do. I'm unemployed, inherited debt, playing the role of a 19 year old trying to get to school and the role of a housewife. I just want 4 things: Help my family out of debt, lose weight and go back to being in shape (currently at 240lbs 6'0""), get my future set and into a school, and be comfortable. 

Again here's the exact financial situation (got more accurate numbers):

Cash: $47,000, $30,000 in investing, $17,000 in savings account.

Debt: Approx. $40,000

Monthly expenses: Approx. $3,000 - $1,400 of which is off of minimum credit card payments.

Monthly Income: Father - $2,800, Sister - $??? (Could be -$400 - $400, she's not transparent), Myself - $400.

Other upcoming expenses: $10,000 down payment for Tesla Model 3 (My sister's old car broke down, and she can pay this on her own, she promised she would, but she just needed help with the down payment. Since she needs a car for her work we couldn't really discuss it, especially factoring in the long term cost savings an electric car can bring. She will hopefully pay us back slowly for the down payment.)

If you managed to read all of this, thank you so much. I appreciate every bit of help and advice anyone could give me. I'm done grieving, and I'm ready to do what I need to do. Just need to know where to start.",24Aug2020,1

1134,"Im 15F and need advise convincing my family to let me get tested for ADHD. I dont want ADHD or want to be diagnosed so I can be ""special"". I just wanna know of medication is what will make my brain work better. I dont want to live this way my whole life.


When I was young, my mom use to get mad at me for this behavior and asl me if something was wrong with me in an insulting tone. So I've always had these behaviors, they never popped up randomly. Here are my main symptoms:

I have always had trouble focusing, I have a short memory/ attention span, Im disorganized and very forgetful and unable to stick with plans, eventually I always fall out of routine. Instead of actually getting shit down., I start multiple things that I never finish over and over again in a constant cycle

I have consistently tried my whole life to fix these issues but I have never been able to. Im always called lazy, etc and it hurts because I am trying my hardest but, nothing ever seems to work and it has greatly impacted my self confidence, self worth and overall happiness. I feel like a worthless person who's not ever gonna reach their full potential and just taking up too much space.

I get emotional easily. I feel constantly sad and even when I'm happy, I still feel dread in the back of my mind that I'll eventually go back to that sad place. Its like I'm in a box of sadness. Even when I'm in the highest spot in the sad box, Im still trapped.

I tend to talk a lot because I have so many thoughts and ideas and have trouble understanding ""social cues"" on when to stop/someones not interested. I get called annoying and talkative a lot. 

Im very disorganized. I try not to be but, I dont put my shoes in the right spot 1 day and bam, I start becoming more disorganized after 1 little mistake. 

I also have a horrible time rembering things. I can forget what I did last week and I can forget what I did years ago. I can watch TV and forget what I was watching if it goes on break. 

You can tell me something to my face and I will forget it within seconds. Sometimes, I will know you said something but, I just can't process it? I heard words but I don't know which words. I often have to ask people to repeat things 1-3x before I get it. I Before this, I would be scared to ask again, do something wrong and just get in trouble.

I use to think I was just stupid but I have always been in those advanced classes and I've competed in several academic competitions and even won some.

 I just wish my brain would focus more. Even when I have no object (phone) to distract myself, I will daydream. I use to daydream for hours a day before I begin to get it under control. 

Anyways, sorry for the rant but my family doesn't believe in mental illness. I recently asked my brother about this and he said ""don't fall into that logic"" and that doctors will just ""heavily medicate me for something I can control with practice""? 

Its just 15 years of trying to ""control"" and nothings working. . I've knowb plenty of ADHD kids, they tend to be in these advanced classes with me. I know having ADHD is not a synonym for being dumb. My family has a very ""just dont be sad/just focus lol"" view of mental health and I just dont know how to convince them.

Im tired of living in my brain. I've listed some of the things I think make me possibly have ADHD in this post but, maybe I am just a lazy careless, unorganized person like my family tells me and Im just making excuses. 

Please give me some advice if you can. Thank you in advance",24Aug2020,1
1135,"So, to give some context I’m 20, about to be 21 in the new couple weeks. I think I’m experiencing the blues right before a birthday comes ((it’s a phenomenon lol)). I’m seriously considering quitting my job.

I have been at my company for three years, and I have experienced so many ups and downs. At this establishment I have quit three times. First I was tired of working, wanted something better but couldn’t find anything so within two months I was back. The following time ((a year later)) I got a better job ((missed the orientation by mistake)) and lost that. The last time I technically didn’t quit but I did let me boss know I was looking for higher pay and they agreed to it.

I want to leave this time because so many things have gone horribly wrong in 2020. First our AC has been out for MONTHS ((I work at a restaurant)). Secondly, my original boss has transferred stores and taken most of the crew with them ((no one wanted to work with the new boss at my current location)). 

That boss that replaced them quit about three weeks ago. We lost 4 staff members, and had to get minors on our staff. This is a HUGE problem bc now we’re constantly short staffed ((minors cannot work Mondays &amp; they’re in school so only NIGHTS)) . I work the day shift, always have.

Lately also, a coworker who I’ve had conflict with in the past ((they’re the bully type I keep to myself I promise you)) has RETURNED. This coworker nonstop lately has been calling me out personally by throwing SHADE. Things like ((“oh I wish I could schedule myself how I want” she was referring to me discussing how I work 10-4 M thru F and always have. I wasn’t even TALKING TO HER.)) ANOTHER THING this coworker has fought people ON SIGHT at my location. 

My only conflict with quitting is obviously losing that income, ((I have a car note, phone bill and a couple credit cards)) mainly to worry about. But my mom said that I would receive full unemployment if I explain to them the horrible work conditions. 

I’m trying to start my small business also, I have most of the things I need..

1138,"Throw away and I [20M] know I may sound not the brightest cause I always thought it should just be easy. So I recently ended a one year relationship but I now realize that I only got into the relationship was out of me being desperate and the relationship was toxic as we discovered we only just wanted someone to not be alone. Being 2 or 3 months from when we broke up and I am catching myself in that desperate feeling I get when I am single and I hate how I allow it to happen.

To explain I want to learn or grow to be happy on my own, I hate how I get into this when I say I won't. I pop up at the chance to talk to any girl and I will sit on Tinder to try to get anything again and I feel I get so easily attached to people. I also think about just being loved again they way I was in a previous relationship before my last one where I felt so loved and that I kick myself still and blame myself for it ending cause in recent memories it felt like the greatest feeling I had felt before and yes I know it's my young my mind just having infatuation to it but it sucks I still hold onto it.

 I've as well as getting older I understand a lot of my old friends are busy and have new life's but I feel left behind sometimes and alone as I know with some it will soon be the last time I see them perhaps because I know paths in a life break off but I feel everyone is ahead of me and I still have this really child mindset cause I don't know how to grow alone when I was always surrounded by friends at any moment and never made any decision (which has bitten me in the ass) without listening or following what my friends say.

Now, I have stuff that I want to get towards and I am asking for advice as well to get into guitar and playing music. I listen to so much music and fascinate how amazing the song sounds and I wish I could play on a level like that but I don't know where to start learning or to keep a consistent practice but I want to just be good at it and I need to learn that it takes time. I feel passionate that I just want to play my heart out at music too it's just starting and knowing how to.

I feel as though I need to learn and accept how to be alone and strong on my own, not for the rest of my life or all the time but the healthy amount with getting to be more mature. I want to be happy with myself and I no longer want to feel as though I absolutely need someone else in my life to be happy as well as trying to start to learn and focus on this interest of playing music more.",24Aug2020,1
1139,"I dated this guy in college back in 2016 for about 8 months. Nothing ended badly. He went away on a vacation that summer and I studied abroad. We Skyped a couple times while we were both gone, but in the fall when we both came back we just stopped talking. 

He Skype messaged me maybe 2 years ago asking to catch up. I never check skype so I didn’t see the message until months later and I replied some time after that. I don’t know if he responded. 

We really haven’t had any contact for years. About once a year (on no particular day) I think about how he’s doing. I have no feelings at all, just wonder how he is. On Sunday (yesterday), I sent him an email (he didn’t have texting in college so we would email). All my email did was acknowledge the skype message and offer to catch up if he wanted to. I have not gotten a response yet. 

I was still curious about this so I checked my phone and found that I still have his number. So I was wondering if I should text him or call him. It would just be me saying what I said in the email. I would only be reaching out to him via text because who knows if he has the same email address he did 4 years ago. 

I don’t have any social media so can’t reach out that way. And again, to be clear I have no romantic interests in him AT ALL! I am simply curious how this person I used to know is doing. 

So my questions to you guys are: 

1) should I reach out to him this way?

2) if yes to (1), what should I say?",24Aug2020,1
1140,"Something to make clear its that English isn't my first language without furthermore lets me tell you my story

I'm an average teenager boy without really life worries but it all long time ago during my childhood in which I grew up only with my grandma and my older brother and during those times my brother, my grandma and I got involved in many conflicts with my older brother for many things he did (an example, he once forgot to save his computer in a safe place even though my grandma told him to do it then the next day my grandma accidentally dropped the computer which lead to be broken because she rushed but my grandma argued with my brother and after that and though different things it lead to her buying him an xbox 360 take note of this action) and that's just the most clear example i can remember and there were many more horrible things that happened in the house which i can clearly recall the most important ones? I don't know which word to use

Fast forward many years my mom takes my brother to the country she was living and working which left me with my grandma alone which wasn't bad but instead peaceful and enjoyable but she wasn't very happy with the fact that my brother left and through calls my grandma got the perspective that my brother was labeled as ""bad kid"" from my mom which my grandma and I believed because we had more contact with him than my mom even though she called almost everyday and we thought that my mom was a bad person towards my brother (let's just say my mom wasn't the mother with my older brother in his childhood but neither an ""demon"" mom) and because of this there were times in which my grandma and my mom discussed over phone because of something my brother did also one of the reasons because we thought my mom was a bad person was because she showed more affection towards my little brother which one part was due to his age, another because she raised him completely but the most important its because he had leukemia (which he defeated but at the same didn't, take note again)

Fast forward again to the beginning of my puberty in which my mom finally took me to the country in which she was with my brother but my past-self was influenced by my brother's stories and other things about my which lead to think about my mom as the enemy one and this lead to me being more close to my brother and gain his trust and more stuff which all lead to me helping him in a number of absurd things (he thought of my as his servant/slave) around 2 years but through that time i helped my brother to get some coochie and that lead to my first nephew whom i took care of for at least a 4-6 months but during this time a few things changed first was that the perspective i had about my brother changed negatively due to different reasons and another one was that my brother had my second nephew

Now during the time lapse between the born of the first child and the second there different events that lead to my brother leave the house around 2 times and living alone in a room with debts and during this time i still thought of my brother with sympathy for what he was going through and that he had a hard life which like i mentioned was part-true mostly in his childhood 

Now during the months from August-January  my brother and I were in were in many more conflict because of money he owned me (around 7k) and because i was getting tired of being bossed around by him and during this time he was ""studying"" in college and living once again with my mom, my little brother and I with my second nephew while the mom took care of the first (don't ask it's was due conflict between my brother and the mother) without paying almost anything but all that changed when my mother and I found out that he left college after the first and during all this time he was playing along with his lie in which he was out doing god knows what while my mother and i were taking care of the baby and from that point of him changed completely as i learned many more things bad things about him in which he played victim towards my grandma and I

After that event my mom allowed to still living here because of my nephew but under the condition to pay rent (around $600 which was the same amount he payed for a small room in a different house) but through this time he was getting annoyed that I wasn't doing all the things he asked but still thought of me as Alfred and through this time I did an ""oopsie"" in highschool (joke about 9-11/school shootings, which i know was very bad but remember kids to never talk about this very openly in school) which my mom wasn't happy about it but not the same as the ""oopsie"" my brother which involved the police just because of a e-cigarette he had and lied about being threated by gangs but leaving that aside i learned something important was that she was more angry with me rather than my brother for his ""oopsie"" but i didn't pay attention to this 

Lets make this the last fast-forward which takes place around June and the present in which i spend all my summer working as a babysitter for my second nephew while having a price of $40 per 2 weeks (im pretty sure every parent looks for this kind of babysitter) which the first 3 times were paid and after that I wasn't payed anymore which i tried to complained about this but without results and this wasn't a pretty big trouble if i didn't take care of him around 12 hours a day because my brother had most of the time the excuse of my car broke or something which i highly doubted but couldn't really do something about this now during this time the tension between him and me got bigger to the point of screaming me to hitting me which i stayed quiet about but i knew that he would be kicked out and nephew would be in trouble and also i have to be quiet about him bringing ""company"" to the house and while he was ""discussing"" with the person I toon care of my nephew until he was done and this went multiple times with me using me as his 24/7 babysitter and also me and my nephew as punching bags which like I said before i didn't told anyone about this until now

Now all of you may be wondering where was my mom well she was and still is in the hospital with my little brother because he got detected with cancer which lead to my brother having all the power in the house while doing nothing to help which I mean literally because he didn't payed his own debts, didn't payed for rent and didn't help to clean the house or even his own mess which made me angry to clean up all his mess and my mother got angry at this too because she was going through a tough time with my little brother while my brother was very relaxed without any worries

Now all that changed because i got completely tired of him and decided to tell about his actions which lead to me and my mom to have a nice relationship and while all this had happened my grandma isn't happy about the actions taken my mother towards my brother (which i know that deep down in her being she rejects the reality because my grandma raised us all our lives specially my older brother) and also my grandma angry at me being ""against"" my brother even though i have admitted to her all the things he has done and even send her proof but instead i think she got more angry at for doing this while trying to protect him even though all odds are against him and this situation and other things lead to me being labeled as ""traitor"" from my grandma 

Now i don't know how to feel because one part feels good for making my brother pay his actions and my other part feels worried of what my brother might do to me if he finds out that I have went against him and also worried because i don't know which destiny awaits for my nephew, so am i doing wrong to expose all the secrets my brother has to my family?

P.S I forgot to mention a few things
1) My brother has done good things for me but mostly bad and some of these include NSFW which i don't know if I should tell
2) I don't care what would be the final decision of my grandma but i will always loved her
3) My brother didn't have the most beautiful childhood due to personal reasons
4) There were many things that my brother did to my grandma and one of those was to make her cry

TL;DR I learn the true side of my brother after many years and go against him during a family conflict",24Aug2020,1

its consistent too, every single night without fail they will do this, I just tried to ask them to quiet down 10 minutes ago and my mum just laughed, it makes me so frustrated and messes up my sleeping pattern

1144,"I work IT for the University I attend as a student worker. I've been working there coming up on 7 months now, and it's been fun.

I, and a few of the other student workers, put in a lot of time and effort to make sure our building on campus was as ready for the Fall Semester (COVID Edition) as we could. Now that the semester is starting, more people are around us in the building going to classes. Many of the faculty received a 'hazard pay' raise once summer started, but us student workers did not. With more people on campus that we're interacting with all day, risk of contracting COVID is much higher. So, I want to ask for a raise, with the grounds that I'm in more danger than I was before, combined with my length of employment.

The problem is, I'm scared. I've never asked for a raise before, and I don't really know how to do it. I know that the worst they can say is no, but my brain always tells me it could be so much worse:

1.) My reputation as a leech/freeloader would be established if I ask for a raise without having put in more significant effort in my manager's eyes.

2.) He'll say no, and then think about firing me and replacing me with someone who is more content with the position.

3.) He'll just get really mad and blow up at me, which I also don't want.

1152," My ex girlfriend is someone that I hurt. When we were together, I was not in the right headspace to love anyone, nor was I even mature enough to consider how she felt. I never purposefully tried to hurt her, even so, I did. The entire relationship is what most people would call toxic, and from both sides. You’ll have to believe that I don’t have a victim complex, and that we both dished out our fair share of hurt on each other, though I know that I was much worse. 

   To put things simply, we broke up. And then about a year after we’d broken up, we became sort of close again. we started to hangout, talk to each other, nothing too serious, but well, you get the notion. It was around this time that I made the mistake of letting her believe that I wanted something more, which maybe I did, who knows what I was thinking, I was an immature teenager living life high off of a superiority complex. Things played out, and once again she got hurt. She blocked me entirely on everything, and rightfully so. 

   Fast forward to now, where we haven’t talked very much at all for over almost two years, besides the occasional drunk text from one of us. She’s now dating my oldest, and once closest friend, whom I am still relatively close with. I am an entirely different person, or at least i’ve been trying to be for quite a while. But I think that shes never going to get over the fact of the manipulation and pain I caused her. 

   Very recently she unblocked me on snapchat, instagram, and i-message, all within the span of let’s say an hour. I was relieved, to say the most. I thought maybe she’d forgiven me, maybe and I wasn’t such the terrible person I’d thought I had been.  But it was no sooner that she did all this that she blocked me once again. The only difference, is that this time I don’t know why. It hurt, i can’t lie. I’ve been going over and over in my head on why she might’ve done it. Maybe she was punishing me? Torturing me for the crimes that I committed before? I don’t know. 

If you are still reading this, thank you for bearing with me. What I’m asking, is should I ask her why she did what she did? I haven’t yet because I know the best thing I can do for her is to stay out of her life. I don’t think there is anything I can do or say that will change her mind about me. But this small thing has brought up years of pain that I thought i’d forgotten. I don’t know if it was a mistake on her part, or if maybe someone else did it while on her phone. My mind is running wild with possibilities, and I have no one to go to for advice. What do you think?",24Aug2020,1

Also, he hasn’t been able to have things like that delivered to me because I was living at my internship site and it would be more of a hassle for it to get through security so I told him not to try. It was mostly a joke because he still has been sending me stuff but of course I miss flowers because he would always come home from the grocery store with them. Anyways, I was happy for her but she didn’t even know how she felt about the flowers. The balloon said I love you and they weren’t even in a relationship and she hadn’t said she loved him back. I had just moved a week ago (husband is also moving down soon) into an apartment so I mentioned the flowers to my husband and hinted that I missed getting them. A few days later I had a cake delivered to me and I thought he did that because of my hint, but he pointed out how a month ago he asked me questions about flavor, colors, etc. then I felt bad for even hinting/complaining. It was a coincidence he did this right after (keep that in mind because idk if she thought it was a coincidence even though I told her al these details). Two days ago when I was at her house she randomly said she needed to check the mail. Then she opened a package and said omg a million times and wouldn’t tell me what was going on. Finally she held up two shirts that said “if lost return to babe” and “I am babe.” I was like omg that’s cute but you probably don’t think so. She said she liked them but was afraid he would be possessive like her ex husband. We stress ate food together and had a good time. Way before these shirts came I told her how My husband said I had to be home on a certain date because he ordered me a bunch of wine. Yesterday when the wine came I posted it on fb (like I always do when he sends stuff but haven’t much this year since I’ve known her because he’s only gotten me stuff too personal to post, or things embarrassing that I like such as AG dolls lol). A few hours later I almost threw out the receipt and then noticed a note (more like a sentence) that said enjoy your wine I love you baby cakes. I sent her a picture and said omg I almost threw this out, you would vomit right? Lol. She replied saying she calls her son baby cakes (which is the response she always gives for some reason when I tell her stuff he said). Instantly after she says that, I receive a screenshot of OUR conversation of me sending her the note and her message says “she’s sending me their notes now. See. Competition.” How do you all interpret this? Immediately I thought she was talking about me and thinking I’ve been competitive. Another possibility was that she was hyping him to be competitive with us so she would get more stuff or just receive the clingy ness from him in general that she pretends she doesn’t like. I didn’t want to lash out so I just said “that was meant for him wasn’t it lol” and she said “yes I told him that he’s pushing it and making everyone feel like he’s being too much.” I said “huh?” And then she said “him being competitive” I said “how’s he being competitive?” She said “I got that from YOU” I said “I don’t remember saying that.” She said that I said he was trying to compete with my husband and I. I don’t have the best memory but I know I did not say that. I MAY have made a joke about how the 3 of us are mushy and she’s not and we would be trying to one up each other.. but I really don’t think I said anything like that. I just said I couldn’t decide if it’s cute or weird since she’s not reciprocating. But I also tell her to her face I think she may be reciprocating, which would make it less weird. Even IF I said something about “competing” it would clearly have been a joke..and she’s so non confrontational I doubt she told him his gifts are making people uncomfortable. She also kept trying to change the subject, like right away said “he just called me basic lol.” I told her “I hope you don’t think I was being competitive because he’s always sent me stuff” and sent her screenshots from posts (we’ve only been friends for 10 months so she wouldn’t have seen those). She sent me a paragraph saying she’s sorry if she made me feel bad and that I didn’t have to prove myself and it wasn’t about me. And then she said she would explain it again if she had to and I said it’s fine. I told her “I’d rather you tell me if you feel a type of way” and she said “I would” and I told her I was scarred from what Jerrica did (a friend who I caught talking about me and manipulating someone against me). She seemed offended because she said “wait I’m like Jerrica?” I said “no I just don’t want something similar to happen” and she said “well that was a weird situation.” So idk if she got the point or was just offended. But I didn’t want to push it in case I’m wrong.. we’re talking normal now but should I be? Is it even a big deal if she felt this way? The way her text was worded really hurt and doesn’t make sense with her story.. what do you all think 1) her intentions were and 2) what I should do moving forward. We got very close this past year and have so much fun together. We stopped talking before because of a misunderstanding and she told me that can never happen again. So I think she does care about me but I don’t want to worry about this going on behind my back. Or maybe she’s projecting and is jealous/competitive with my relationship.. she doesn’t talk about it much but I just thought that was because of her divorce.",24Aug2020,1
