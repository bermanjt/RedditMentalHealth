0,"As a reward for doing really well this past semester, I got myself an iPad for the purpose of digital notetaking. After having it for four days. My handwriting is shit on it, I dont know if it actually is good for the env. or if I care for the advantages it does offer and now I'm like damn this is the same as if I was hand writing. Idk, the convenience is being able to add charts and such to it. But I'm not sure if it really is a good tool. A part of me wants to return it but another part of me is like "" you got it at sucha good deal, just keep it."" and i'm torn. I'm wasting more time on this indecision than anything else. The fear grows that I'll regret spending this money after the return window passes.

I dont know what to do? I dont know how to reach a conclusion.",09Jun2020,0
2,"Hello, I need advice, please. So my family has this annual week-long vacation trip to NC around mid-July that's been going on for several years now (I want to say 8??) It's usually me (20F), my parents, my brother, my aunt and uncle, and their two children (M &amp; F) who are both older than me and my brother. (F) cousin is married with two children now, and her husband and children have come a few times. Despite the pandemic still going on, my mother and aunt are still making plans to go down like usual. I don't really feel up to going this time due to the virus; I don't feel comfortable going out still, especially since most of that time in NC we would be going to the beaches. Also, I've already been there 8 (I think) times, and we do the same things each time, so this trip wouldn't be any different, nor do I feel like I wouldn't be missing much. Not only that, but last year, we rented a new beach house, and we didn't have a problem with space since my (F) cousin at the time was pregnant with her second child and couldn't come down with her husband and kid. But I've heard that they are coming down this year and spacing now is a little bit of a problem as my other cousin (M) may need to switch rooms and bunk with my brother so (F) cousin and her husband have a room. Their baby would sleep with them in the room but their other child (6F) may be sleeping in my room, and I would have to share. Don't get me wrong, I love her very much, but I feel that it's a little weird since I'm a very introverted person who likes privacy and alone time. That's what I want and look forward too when I go on these trips. Not to mention the age gap between us too. I've thought briefly that if I stay home during this trip, it would free up space and help out a lot better than me coming.

I haven't really discussed exactly how I feel about this in detail with my mom yet, but I also feel like if I do, it might not translate across well and end up looking like I'm being selfish, trying to ruin a family vacation, or trying to start drama which is the last thing I'm trying to do. Am I selfish for thinking these things? Should I just suck it all up and still go? Or should I tell my parents that I don't want to go to NC this time around?",09Jun2020,0
3,"I called him while walking back to my apartment after work. I’m going to school out of state and he’s at his home working. It’s been long distance for awhile. So I look forward to our phone calls a lot. 

Anyways I was talking about my day and yanno the usual. An individual was walking on the sidewalk, I thought it was a girl but it was a boy. So I was like that’s a pretty guy. Yanno just a woah. Then I started thinking about the lunch I had today, and I wanted to transition to the topic so I said “Oof.” My boyfriend then said “Woah Lesbihonest.” I tried explaining my transition but he just went on about it. 

I was confused so I asked why he said that, his reply “You sure you’re not a lesbian? You liked that guy who looked like a girl.” He said it jokingly, but I was still at a loss of words. 

My bf knows I used to get bullied by some people who I thought were my “friends.” Whenever I sat down with them or talked they would greet me by saying “Lesbihonest” then as most convos went on the “are you sure’s” became redundant. During Christmas, they sent me a tool bag with a strap on. I cried. I don’t know why I didn’t stand up for myself. I was mocked, taunted, and joked just bc I had hobbies that didn’t seem fit for a girl. I’m independent, love working with my hands and ranching bc it’s just how I grew up with my brothers and dad. I grew up working hard and honest, I take pride in that. Im not arrogant, I know everyone has their own strengths that makes them, them. It’s just that those words and mean people made me feel ashamed of being me. I know my sexuality, and I’m not a lesbian. I didn’t like the jokes and mean comments.

 I know they were just words but words hurt. I eventually started being in a better mindset that, this is my strength and not a problem. I stopped being friends with them. I became more confident in who I was. Yet I’m still insecure that people will think about me like that. I am sadly really self conscious about it, i thought I was over it but nah the wound soon came open after the person I trust the most made a dumb comment.

So when my boyfriend said that I became upset bc it was one of my insecurities and all those memories came on back. I was also upset bc he didn’t seem to see what the problem was! He tried to continue the conversation  but I demanded an apology. I got a half ass “Sorry for calling you a lesbian.” Then tried explaining it was a joke, but still. I believe apologies should be said when the other person fully understands why they’re apology for, or else they’re gonna do it again. He knows it’s one of my insecurities and I was bullied about it. He carelessly made a joke regarding my big insecurity and that’s what really hurt. I’m also sad bc I thought I made big progress in my self but it just felt like it went away or was it always there?? 

Am I overreacting or how can I be better than this? How could I have handled the situation better? Any advice? Sure need some bc I’m kinda feeling low.",09Jun2020,0
4,"(TL;DR my parents are divorced and i want to move to my moms, but im nervous about how my dad will react)

&amp;#x200B;

the title sounds really childish, but i honestly don't know how else i can describe it.

im a 16 year old girl, and my parents got divorced when i was 2 years old. i only see my mom 1-2 times per year, and i also have a little half brother who lives there and we're really close. needless to say, i dont see them very often because i live with my dad. i come from a military family, and this fall i am going to begin my junior year in high school. i thought i was going to be able to stay in my current town for all 4 years of high school, but my dad got promoted. this promotion is essentially going to lead to one year in one state, and then moving after only 12 months to another state. dont get me wrong, im so proud of my dad. but i honestly dont know if i can mentally handle moving that many times. we are supposed to pack up and leave in about a week.

for background, i have diagnosed depression and anxiety, and im currently struggling with a self-injury addiction. both my dad and my mom are aware of this. my mom has always done her absolute best to do what she can for me, even being all the way across the country from me. my dad does his best too, but sometimes he just doesn't really know what to say, or when to use his filter. i know that he's afraid for me, but some of the stuff that im about to explain is inexcusable of him to say, if im practicing self respect.

i first came to my dad with the idea to move to my moms when i was in a psych ward in 2018. he said absolutely not, and told me that if i wanted to move, he would make us go through the court system, so it was pretty much no-go. i didn't have the drive at the time, and it would have caused too many complications. but when i came to him about it around a month and a half ago, he expressed that he didn't want me to go, but wouldn't stand in my way at ALL and that i could make whatever choice. i kinda let it go, appalled at his response. i also talked to my mom about this, and it has always been an open door policy for her. she would be more than happy to have me.

over the course of this past month, my dad keeps accusing me of making up my mind and not telling me. i havent, and i've sat him down to reassure him that i havent yet. i told him that regardless, i would make the drive across the country with him until we get to where we he's moving, but that i'll probably make my choice before then.

so, everything has been kinda rocky since then. and i completely understand why. but i've been struggling a shit ton. i've relapsed several times and didnt tell them until they figured it out themselves, im going through a breakup with my first boyfriend who cheated on me 5 times and replaced me with one of the people that he cheated on me with in about a week, school has been such a pain in the ass, i got diagnosed with PCOS, resurfacing sexual trauma, and just so much else. instead of going to my parents, i will frequently go to my friends, because im a fucking teenager for christs sake. thats what teenagers do. anyways, i've been ranting to them often so i can get everything out. sometimes when i go to my dad, he'll tell me that my life really isnt that hard, and that he had it worse when he was my age (he was emancipated and quit high school, but eventually went back and got an education and joined the military) and that i need to stop searching for things to be upset about. im also more on the grungier/edgier side, and he isn't a huge fan, so im constantly poked at and prodded and judged for my music, style, and life choices. i am a good kid, i have never done drugs, i dont sneak out, and i've never smuggled alcohol with friends. but i'm constantly fucking judged. my step mom always chimes in and talks about how they wish they had a girly daughter (even though my step sister, who is literally one of my best friends, is girly and basic as one can be - she rocks it though!) so i have gotten to the point where i disregard their opinions on my style and my music taste and the way that i present myself. when i go to my friends, whether irl or over text, i can be myself and they celebrate it. they compliment me and it honestly feels so refreshing sometimes. my mom is the same way. she loves supporting me and she has always done whatever she can, and she couldnt give a damn if i shaved my head and dyed my eyebrows pink.

my dad went through my phone one day when i was upstairs in virtual-therapy (without warning me. this is a common occurrence in this house. i have no privacy online or really in real life - i just got them to start knocking on my bedroom door when it's closed) and he found all the rants. most of them were very small, at least to me, but the two that made him the most upset was when i said 'i cant wait to turn 18 and get out of here', and 'i hate my last name.' for background, i was bullied in middle school for my last name, and it doesn't bug me much anymore, but it was a heat of the moment thing. and for the first one.. dont all teens think about that at some point? like, im not some monster for wanting out of the house to be free.

he went up to my room after i was done, and he fucking screamed at me for an hour and a half. heres some extra-hurtful quotes from that talk.

'you haven't made up your mind yet? well im about to make it for you'

&amp;#x200B;

me: sometimes its hard to talk to you because i feel like you invalidate my emotions

him: yeah? well sometimes you make me feel worthless

&amp;#x200B;

'you aren't even a part of the family anymore. we are all just dragging you along.'

&amp;#x200B;

'you clearly dont care about your fucking dad'

&amp;#x200B;

'i always put in 100%. when have you ever fucking done that.'

&amp;#x200B;

'going to your moms is running away, but i couldnt give a fuck.'

&amp;#x200B;

'when i was on deployment in 2006, i thought about killing myself every single day for 4 months. i stared at a pistol and thought about how much money you and (biological brother) would get if i just fucking offed myself.' - i was put into a psych ward for a suicide attempt and he wasnt telling me this to make me feel less alone. he wanted me to feel bad. it worked. and when i first got admitted, he told me that i just made up all the right things to get put in there and get some attention.

&amp;#x200B;

'do not try to justify any fucking thing to me because i dont want to hear it'

&amp;#x200B;

me: i havent made up my mind yet because i dont know if it will spoil our relationship

him: yeah, ya' do. yes you fucking do. you do know.

&amp;#x200B;

'you always look for negativity to prove that your life is hard.'

&amp;#x200B;

im honestly just fucking scared right now. the pros of going to my moms are severely outweighing the cons, and i think that it's what i want, but i love my dad and i feel like all of this is my fucking fault. it hurts so much. please, please help. i signed out of my main reddit account to post on this one because i dont want him to see this. i've apologized to him so many times but i got ignored for about 2 days. i just dont know what to do from here.",09Jun2020,1
5,"Following my usual routine of getting to bed, tidy up the living room, use the toilet, brush my teeth, make sure the door is locked and then off to bed. But this time, there was something that made my heart stop for a second and made me freeze. After I brushed my teeth, as I was walking out the bathroom, I heard something brush against the shower curtain as I walked past it. I'm sure it wasn't my arm, there was no wind or draft either. I quickly paced to the door and stood in the entrance while staring at the shower curtain thinking ""what was it?"" The curtain continues to move 2 minutes after and I'm still standing there staring. I'm waiting for my wife to jump out, but she doesn't. It just continues to wave slowly. I take a step back, quickly checked the door is locked and sprint to bed hoping whatever it is doesn't follow me.

8,Let me start off by saying I’m a 19 year old male. I go to uni and most of the friends I had are still in high school in my old town. I hung out with them a lot but I never really got close. I have made no friends in my first year of uni. I am a very private person and do not talk to my issues to anyone. I can count on my fingers the amount of times I have opened up to anyone about how I feel. My question is how do I get around not feeling like a burden when I open up to someone? I always feel like I am bothering them when I talk about my personal life. I always listen to others but I never let them hear me. I am afraid that people will see me differently and the thing I hate most is when people pitty me and start treating me different it makes me uncomfortable and completely turns me away from the relationship. My other question is how do I stop myself from feeling awful and embarrassed anytime I become vulnerable around someone? As soon as I start talking about my life I get very nervous and my hands get cold and I lose my train of thought.

14,"I am of Guatemalan descent and my friend recently told me that her parents wanted the theme of their Halloween party this year to be based around Día de Muertos. 

My friend and her family are not of Latin American ancestry, and when I asked them if they were celebrating by making traditonal altars and if they knew the significance of the holiday and when and why it is celebrated, they didn't and said they had ""much more research to do"" on the subject and how they've always wanted to go to Mexico to celebrate, and that they love the ""aesthetic"" of it (mostly the calaveras, etc.). 

They seemed to listen a bit when I told them about some Guatemalan customs on the holiday, and that their were many different customs to it, but I am not sure if they are going to really research on the holiday and the fact that they are using it as a theme for a halloween party really bothers me. I am hesitant to say that it may be cultural appropriation, but it seems like using it as a theme for a halloween party without learning the cultural, sometimes religious significance of Día de Muertos really cheapens the whole point. Día de Muertos isn't celebrated on halloween and it's not ""Mexican Halloween"". 

Perhaps I am being a little peeved for no reason though, because perhaps I should let them in on the fun of celebrating your deceased loved ones and ancestors. I am just a bit concerned that they will completely miss the meaning, and I know nothing I can tell them will stop them. 

What are my responsibilities as a member of the Latin American community? Do I have any? How can I better educate these people and my friend about the meaning of Día de Muertos, the culture, and what it represents? Do I hold anyone accountable? Am I just being irritated for no reason at all?",09Jun2020,1

16,"I am a university student.I am a above average student and have scored pretty decent marks in the last semesters. The thing is , many of my friends ask me to help  in their studies which I do happily. But recently I am feeling jealous of my friends.

REASONS 

When I learn a concept , i would have studied it for  4-5 hours , to search the correct web resource ,understand the examples etc.When I teach it to my friend, it would take me around 30 min to get him understand the problem.So I wasted so many hours while this guy is learning it in a few minutes.

 There is nobody to help me in the studies.

Also when we form a  Lab group , my group mates know that I will study and work on the assignments so, they won't do anything .At the last minute, they ask me to explain what have I done.It is really irritating me.
I can't confront people especially classmates,so I do it .

So recently I am not able to concentrate because there is a part of my brain which says , not to study so that these guys wont ask me questions because I have not studied either.So this has caused me my  productivity and I am  not able to study as I used to before.But I dont want to mess up my grade.I want to my peers to do better but they have to work hard as I do.They are getting it easy.

I have lots of trouble with sensory overload, sometimes when there's too many people talking or too much noise or too many questions I just shut down and get impossibly angry.

My entire forearm is typically covered in funny patterned bruises because of this, and I'm not only asking if this is normal, but also if anyone has advice on how to stop?

After the one good experience, my anxiety with weed went away for the most part. When COVID came around and everything shut down and I was laid off, I started smoking regularly to keep myself from spiraling into a depressive state. It has worked, and I smoke a little everyday.

43,"It’s embarrassing to admit, but I’m a 21 year old female who still asks her parents for permission to hangout with friends or sleepover. I’m literally that one adult friend who’s like “Sorry, but my mom said I can’t”. It’s really embarrassing when I think about it. 

My mom is especially protective. If I were to say I’m going out with friends, she’d start asking for names, age, gender, how I meet them, where I’m going. It’s hard going out to meet with people, because my mom would always pressure me into giving names. I feel like such a child and I want to be more independent.

I am planning on moving out on my own soon, but any tips to help me out?",09Jun2020,15
44,"ETA: We’re both 18F. 

ETA: I don’t know if this helps, but she’s autistic and high functioning, and I’ve long suspected I am too, which is why this is,,,, SO hard 

TL;DR after my trans friend came out in November and started HRT (by buying pills off the internet), it seems like she’s completely changed into someone really nasty and bitchy, when she was never like that before. I’m trying my best to just put this down to this being a difficult time for her, but there’s only so much that can be justified by using that. Has anyone else had this experience, and were you able to resolve it nicely? Did it eventually get better? 

I also apologise in advance if this seems transphobic— I really, really don’t mean it that way, and I’m in no way meaning to devalue how difficult this is for her right now. I’m not lumping all trans women in with her. I’m real sorry,, I honestly don’t know if this is or isn’t going to sound super bad but if it is I’m so sorry— I’m genuinely asking this in earnest. 

Okay so this was originally intended to be much longer (also I’m new to reddit so I apologise if this formatted weirdly or anything) but my sister crossed out my fucking browser window. 

Anyway— me and this girl have been friends for years, since we were about 13/14 (we’re 18 now, and have left high school). She was always a very positive person in my life especially when I was going through a difficult time, and I loved being in her company because she was not only fun, but knowledgeable. She was a really beloved member of our friend group of 6 (now 5– relevant a little later). 

Around November last year she came out as trans, and we were all shocked, but we accepted her and loved her all the same because it really made no difference at the time. Things were fine for a while— her uni life was busy and separate from ours, so she didn’t speak very often in the group chat, but that was fine. She started HRT not that long after, and that was also fine for a while before everything started going downhill. 

This started with her breaking up with her boyfriend (a member of our friend group, and also trans), and making us all feel like the children of some insane divorce— at one point she insulted me for being too scared to have a opinion (a recurring theme), and accused us all of taking his side. She later apologised for acting like this, as well as for spinning every single conversation into a trans conversation (I understand why she did that, and it’s okay with me— we all found it mildly annoying that we couldn’t talk about anything without her making it about being trans, but it wasn’t a big deal.) We forgave her and things were fine again for a little bit, and then it started getting bad again. 

She started revenge seeking against her exbf, including exposing one of his very sensitive kinks to the entire group chat to get us to laugh at him in order to hurt him. She also repeatedly affirmed that the group was less important to her than her best friend (NOT a member gf the group, she actually kinda,, hates us) to him in an attempt to hurt him, but it actually just ended up hurting everyone else. 

She also constantly talks about how sad she is, but not in a way that asks for support— she tries to bait us into coddling her by making jokes, such as an example from this night itself where she said ‘my room is a mess of pills OMG’ and then started listing the kinds of pills, followed up by complaining about her health. It seems we can’t talk to her without her trying to focus the conversation solely on her and her issues. 

She’s also previously invalidated me to the tune of ‘well haha, everyone KNEW you were gay but nobody knew I was trans let’s be real I repressed it HARD (therefore it must have been easier for you)’ when my experience was actually. really really difficult and it took me a lot of years to come to terms with myself. she apologised for that too but it was like ‘well I DiDnT mEAn It!!!!’ to try and,, deflect responsibility? 

This is all in addition to my most recent issue with her which is really upsetting me— the group member that we kicked (I’ll just call her,, Alexa) really hurt me (emotionally) when we got into a fight. Alexa was all round VERY manipulative and the queen of sad-baiting, and had a tendency to guilt trip anyone who tried to accuse her of anything. This friend supported me when this fight happened, taking my side in the argument, and she had an open distaste for Alexa beforehand (because she has some radical, especially sexist views). But now she defends her all the time whenever we get bitchy about her and seems to be so fond of her? It’s like she’s forgotten the damage  the fight caused me altogether??? I don’t want to  seem self centred, and in truth I have no idea if I’m allowed to be hurt by this, but it’s,, just very strange. She’s becoming really manipulative and with the admission of her telling those kinks on purpose, I don’t think any of us can really trust her again. 

Basically, r/advice, what I’m asking you is— is she just a bad egg? Will it get better, or is my faith in her going to just lead us all to get manipulated and hurt again? And most importantly— how would I tell her nicely that she’s becoming a person I don’t want to be friends with anymore, and she’s going to get the boot if she doesn’t work on improving herself and learning how to actually apologise? I want to be kind and acknowledge that her mental health can cause this, but she keeps using it to try and evade responsibility and I dont want to offend her— I’m just. real scared.",09Jun2020,2

47,"Because my ex girlfriend and I (18m) broke up nearly four months ago now. Of course I spent the first two and a half months still talking lots and missing her like hell, and I then spent the next month and a half not talking to her at all to try and give myself some space and get her out of my head. I deleted photos, I unsaved sappy messages and screenshots - just doing my best to try and move on. I thought I no longer felt romantic feelings and I was more than happy to just be her friend, but last week she texted me and started having a friendly conversation. I was happy that I was able to have a friendly talk, but now I'm too worried to text her again now because I'm just afraid that I might start loving her again, and I don't really want that to happen. Now I'm just wondering if I truly am over her yet. How do you truly know when you're ""over"" somebody?",09Jun2020,1
48,"Back when I was 13 I suffered from depression and  anxiety. It was bad and I never want to go back to that state. I'm now 16 (17 in a month) and I've been doing pretty good. But as of recently, my dad has been extremely strict towards me for some reason. He's been enforcing set times for everything (get up/schoolwork at 9 am, shower at 12:30 pm, 25 minute outside time at 4 pm, shower at 7:30 pm, bed at 8 pm). He's also been very specific with rules (no closing blinds when going to the bathroom/showering, don't leave my laptop in sleep mode, no turning on air conditioner when it's below 80 degrees, etc). If I ever violate one of these, he screams at me. 2 nights ago, I stayed up until 8:30 instead of 8:00, and he screamed at me for 20 minutes and took my xbox and my phone, and he said that I'm probably never going to get my Xbox back (that he didn't even pay for). Today, he screamed at me for not going for a walk, taking a shower 30 minutes late, and leaving my computer on sleep mode. I started having a breakdown in the middle of him yelling and he yelled at me for crying and said that I'll get everything taken from me if I don't stop. Is there anything I can do?",09Jun2020,1
49,"So, here I am. 2 years and a half ago, I would be there signing up for my mechatronics engineering course in a private university, with my parents at my side depositing all their expectations (and money) on it, while in my mind I was just like ""well it's not like I'm going to stay here forever, it's just a matter of time 'til I get the results of the state university admission exam and I'm pretty sure I will pass, and move on to somewhere else I won't need anybody paying monthly fees and blaming me for it"".

Well, few months later I had realized said exam, got the results, and... I didn't pass.But I kept trying. And failed once again, so I decided I would stick at that private college anyway and try to finish it first, and maybe later try another degree or something else. Just for context, I have really troublesome parents so simply staying home doing nothing (or even, having a part time job, if that matters) wasn't going to help me at all. Even if I didn't care about my studies, just having somewhere else to go during the day was a bless, so that's how I've spent my life in those last 2.5 years: just running back and forth, trying to hide from home problems at college, and then trying to not feel bad about not giving a shit to homework, studies, exams, projects, and such, keeping those at second plan. And always procastinating, because I can always wait 'til tomorrow to *finally start studying,* to *finally read that 365 pages fluid mechanics book I had borrowed and renewed three times in a row without even touching it,* to *finally get in a good enough mood to study all those subjects and get able to keep up like everyone else in my class does.*

It was yesterday I came to realization that things aren't really going to change because, in fact, every single day it only gets worse, and worse, **and worse.** I've lost countless classes because I was so late I didn't feel like it was worth sticking to the end, I'd rather go to the computer lab and play a game or hang out with another friend. Little by little, I would end up losing entire subjects just by dismissing 25% of the classes or whatever. To get even worse, the debts keep snowballing into something that may get out of control if I'm not going to get a job which pays me sufficiently enough to pay it all. **Why not quit college already, then, you may ask me?** Well, I won't feel like this is a risk I'm willing to take. I cannot stand to wake up every morning having my dad yelling out loud his son is a whiny incompetent who can't take his studies seriously like everyone in our family does. Or my mom feeling betrayed after all this time I got home late because I said I was studying but really I was doing something else, like hanging out with friends since she wouldn't let me otherwise. I just can't, I'm trapped in this tunnel and there's only one way out.

I don't know how to start. So, just to keep this out of the way, **no, I'm not a disciplined person, I'm actually pretty negligible to those regards and I'm fully aware of that.** None of these are anyone else's faults other than mine. The only thing I haven't figured out yet, is how I can learn how to change my behavior, how can I actually get my hands on those goddamn books and start reading, writing, start praticing, and most importantly, start developing a routine, create a habit to keep doing this everyday instead of giving up in the first opportunity. I don't expect anyone else here to relate to my situation, since people tend to categorize those cases as ""immature"" or ""ungrateful to their parents"". That's not like me. I've had rough times during middle and high school, because I had bad grades, I lacked self steem, I had almost no friends, I've suffered bullying. Everything I know regarding school knowledge, I had selftaught myself because I would lose my focus in almost every single class so I had to wait until I got home to try and learn stuff that everyone else already got in the first time. I have traumatic memories of written exams, because whenever I saw my classmates leaving the room, one by one, I would get more and more nervous and forget stuff which otherwise would be incredibly easy to remember. Heck, given all that I might even have ADHD, but I have no access to diagnose that. So, to sum it up: I've lost interest in studies - yet, I want to get that degree, I want to prove to everyone I'm not that black sheep who was too weak to be succesful in academic life.

TL; DR: I suck really hard at college, but I already have a huge debit halfway done on it, so I'm supposed find a way to git gud and get that degree so I can pay for it instead of quiting it.",09Jun2020,1

I get boners while eating food. I sometimes cum while talking or interacting with women, even in a non-sexual context. I have never kissed a girl or had a girlfriend (I'm in the upper half of my 20s).

I almost feel like I'm dying, even though my body is in shape and healthy, and I eat healthy food. These activities tend to help me the most, although not always: 1) socializing 2) being in a new/beautiful/relaxing place in nature 3) exercising 4) playing a certain video game while listening to stuff I downloaded from YouTube

But even if I do the stuff from above, I still often feel like dying at the end of the day.

I already know suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem, etc. I'm not going to commit suicide. In fact, if it has any relation, I am somewhat of a hypochondriac and try to avoid illnesses and unsafe things.

At the same time, I sort of feel like my life has no value. I know my parents love me, and I think my sister too, and probably some relatives, but honestly I think it's a bit pathetic if the only people who love you after almost 3 decades of life are the people who have basically been loving me since I was born (for almost no other reason than I'm related to them).

I can try to be friendly enough, but I feel like I don't even got along with anyone. Even if I ""fake it"" the first one or two times I meet someone, eventually they figure out my true personality and they run away. My ""true personality"" isn't like some evil person or something, but I am just very intense, and I like having intense debates and discussions. I hate bars and I hate alcohol. I totally get that there are times to be ""chill"", but I hate the notion that hanging out is ALWAYS about being ""chill"".  I wish ""hanging out"" meant having honest intellectual creative discussions, or working together to hunt down a woolly mammoth, instead of drinking crap while talking crap (no offensive...but it bothers me when that's ALL people EVER want to do to hang out).

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like there is little purpose in me, personally (not you or other people), being alive if I can't have friends I get along with, which apparently are like 1 in 10,000 because everybody is always about ""being chill"" (or, even worse - they're just way too ""busy"").

&amp;#x200B;

People don't really care what I have to say, in general. They sometimes care. But, basically nobody takes a real interest in any of my own real thoughts. I feel like people like me as long as I'm in a good mood (and it doesn't matter all that much what I say), but I often get in a bad mood because nobody really has anything to say about what I have to say. Just an ""I see...."" or ""You always like to talk about politics"", and then THEY proceed to talk about hockey or something random I have almost zero interest in.

At the risk of sounding like a 14 year old, sometimes I feel like I don't belong here. But, sometimes, at the same time, I feel like I belong everywhere. Recently, I went to a country in Asia to teach English. People might think ""isn't it hard to leave your friends back at home????"" And it's like, what friends? I'm just as home here in this foreign country, besides the language barrier. lol. At least being in a foreign country, while I never fit in anywhere anyway, at least I feel like more of a novelty instead of a straight-up outcast.

52,"I've been working overseas for two years now. I make a pretty decent amount for a living for someone in his mid-twenties.

I met this girl two years ago in the red light district. The service included only kissing and upper body touches.

At first our relationship was very service-like. She barely spoke or reveal much of herself, but that was only natural, I think. It's a dark industry and one does not easily trust.

However, I really liked the girl to the point of obsession with. I started going to the place every two weeks or so, bringing her gifts, flowers, chocolates, and whatnot. Even bought her a watch for her birthday.

The kisses and sessions became more intense in terms of passion. I honestly believe so. We started texting more for some time, but the conversations rarely lasted for more than a day.

She'd text me when I was away, asking when I'd come back. She wants to meet and misses me. I know for a fact that those are true because she doesn't gain any more salary for inviting me over.

This vice started creeping over my life and my finances. I barely had any savings during the first year of my stay overseas. It was like a drug. I looked forward to it every day and night, relieving my stress at work.

I started to notice that my world began revolving around her. I stopped nurturing my friendships bit by bit and became more of a heavy alcoholic whenever I visit her. I hyped myself so much to the point of self-destruction. I know all of this was happening, but I was powerless to stop it.

At some point I dared myself to have a REAL relationship with a coworker who showed a bit of interest. Made it till the first date, only to figure out that I can't sustain courting two girls at the same time. Some thing's gotta give. My conscience had me. During the time I was ignoring the girl from the red-light district, she contacted me frantically asking what is up with me.

I told her an alibi about my smartphone or something and got away with it.

Then I continued the same thing over and over again. Kept visiting her and have more passionate sessions. However, what I wanted was a real relationship outside of this place. Surely we could hang out some time and the money I paid the club would've been more than sufficient for our dates, if she ever agreed to one.

However she simply does not entertain my invitations. She'd just divert the conversation away every time. Couldn't even ask for a picture of her.

I always use the card of me going home to my country. She'd just urge me not to think about something that'll happen a long time from now. She jokingly kids me just to simply not go back home to my country. It's sweet and funny, for me.

I know that this is a very expensive vice to sustain, but she's the absolute number one attractive girl for me. Two years of bonding and friendship are things that are difficult for me to let go. It's like I'm a drug addict.

I don't know what to do. All I want is her, but her inability to reciprocate my sincerity about going official is what hurts me the most. It's like, I can have her - but only to the extent that she lets me in her world.

I'm damned if I quit, it'll hurt like hell. I'm damned if I continue.

Please give me a sincere advice. She's a genuinely kind girl, but please be honest with me.

My head is swirling with confusion every time I think about all this.

Thanks and in advance and have a great day ahead

74,"I am 17F , my boyfriend is 19M . I have been with him for over a year now in fear of him. I don't know how to leave the relationship without him hurting me or himself. It's come to a point where it is way too much to handle. He is gaslighting me.

He always brings up my fears, I have anxiety &amp; I think he uses this to stop me from doing normal things. I've been sexually harassed in my past, he also uses this to stop me from doing things. ""Don't wear that, you'll get raped."" ""If you wear that, everyone will judge you."" ""If you see that friend I know for a fact they'll not wanna spend time with you"" He has isolated me from my friends, me from going out and looking for jobs &amp; to spend time with my family.

He wants to me to be addicted to smoking, I stopped smoking a while ago and he simply told me hes upset about it. While I was trying to quit, he was fuelling it &amp; buying me so many packs - then guilting me 'don't waste my money.' Even though I never asked for it.

He accuses me of things hes done. I've caught him cheating a few times &amp; each time I've caught him he ignores the fact that hes in the wrong &amp; says 'Well, you could be doing the same thing.' 'Let me go through your phone &amp; see if you're being loyal' He gets angry at me &amp; accuses me of doing what he does. 

I've mentioned to him before that I want to end things, I'm so young I shouldn't be in a 'serious' relationship. He bribed my friend with $200 to change her mind, he then started flirting with multiple friends of mine &amp; threatened me that he will kill himself. Which is why I'm so terrified to leave.

He forces me to talk to him, I'm going through a menta breakdown at the moment. I can't even get myself to do daily things such as get out of bed - let alone message him every second of the day. He says 'Tell me you love me.' 'Send me a long paragraph of how much you love me.' He also wants to see me every single day, I have a family to spend time with, I have studying I need to do - but if I say no, he guilts me and says 'You don't love me anymore.' 'Too busy with your hoes.'

I once stumbled across his search history... Lets just say, its very out of the ordinary. It scares me, and it disgusts me. 

He dosn't take 'no' or 'stop' as an answer. I think we all know what this means, but I don't want to talk about this too much. It fuels him whenever I tell him to stop.

CS is not my passion, it's not something I hate mind you, I enjoy it more than any other field, but I don't get excited over it enough to spend my free time on it.

So, with this in mind: are there any places I could be looking? What industries might need someone like me? I was considering tech support, as they seem to have low enough standards. I mainly just don't want to be a cashier again. I want a job that makes *some* use of the 4 years of work that put into this degree.

Also, I need to clarify. I don't not mind doing hard work or learn new things, I just am not the kind of guy who's smart or creative enough to whip out personal projects. I was under the false impression that if I studied hard, focused on school, and got good grades, I could get a decent job as if it was a right rather than a privilege. I know I was wrong. It was childish of me to assume so.",09Jun2020,1

77,"Basically all my life I have been struggling mentally with some personal body issues, but this mostly I have learned to deal and live with everyday, as I really can't do anything about it. But what I haven't really settled about is how lonely I really am, it really sucks. And I really don't know what to do as I want to find love or atleast friends to talk to, yet I struggle with this and have probably for as long as I can remember. I used to be pretty social and I'm generally not a nervous or shy person to meet new people but over the past year or two I would like to admit that has declined. I have gotten more shy, less social and just more ""isolated"" if thats the proper term.

It might feel forced at times aswell, but I tend to ""catch"" feelings quite quickly and end up getting dumped shortly afterwards.

I finally found a apartment payed my deposit and fees. I still live in the same city, because of my job. I can’t afford to move to a new city with my job only being local.

87,"I'm [26/m] suffering from extreme creative burnout, and none of the advice I see about it is working for me. I run a Youtube channel for a living, and the last time I worked on a video was for an hour about three weeks ago. I haven't put out a video in nearly three months because the entire process is just a horrible, grueling mess for me. It would be bad enough if that were all it was, but every creative thing I try to do feels like that now. I don't enjoy painting miniatures or working on wargaming terrain anymore. I haven't wanted to write anything in almost a year. I can't even play Minecraft because there's too much of a creative element to it for me to have any idea of what to do. I really feel like I'm out of creative juice and don't know how to get more, and I'm really suffering for it (personally and financially). If anybody has any advice, I'm kind of desperate for it.

Here's what I've tried so far:

""Take a break"" - I don't think I could be taking more of a break, and if anything it's making the problem worse because I beat myself up for not being productive. I try to remember that burnout is a psychological condition, and that I need to be kind to myself and consider this a recovery period, but it's really stressful when my channel suffers for every day I don't put out content.

""Develop a habit. Do a little every day."" - There was a long stretch of time where I made it a point to open my editing software every day, whether I did anything with it or not. Sometimes I would edit a little, but I always got that same anxious, overwhelmed feeling and just had to stop. I'm trying not to overload myself by forcing myself to do too much too quickly, but I kept that up for months and still never got to the point where I was working on videos for even ten minutes a day. It drains my energy so quickly and it starts to really, physically hurt if I try to fight through it. I'm trying to be nice to myself, but ""it's a struggle to open Sony Vegas every day"" isn't a sustainable business model.

""Consume media. Get inspiration."" - I do this all the time. I read (mostly web serials). I watch anime and other Youtube content. I used to go on the /r/dndiy subreddit, but seeing the things that people make over there has started making me feel really bad (not because I think the stuff I make is bad, but because they seem like they're having a lot of fun making stuff and I'm jealous.) I'll get flashes of inspiration for a second or two, then start writing or working or doing whatever and get frustrated as soon as I get to a point where I don't know how to continue (which usually happens very quickly, and is guaranteed to happen if I put the project down and try to come back to it). That frustration spirals really quickly into hopelessness and that same ""overwhelmed"" feeling I was talking about earlier.

""Take a walk. Exercise."" - I could do this more, but I feel like I do enough walking and exercising that I shouldn't be affected this badly if lack of walking and exercise were the problem.

""Work on other projects. Don't get bogged down on one."" - I can't bring myself to do one project. I definitely can't bring myself to do three or four at the same time. I know the idea is that when I'm stuck / burnt out on one thing, I can switch to a different thing, but I feel burnt out on all the things. I've got two unpainted orc figures on my bookshelf, but I don't feel like it's worth it to drag out my whole paint setup when I know I'm going to lose interest in painting them in less than an hour. (Especially since the only reason I'm starting to paint them is because I lost interest in Minecraft or video editing or whatever I was doing to begin with). If the problem is that trying to be creative totally drains me, I don't see how trying to be creative again helps with that. Especially since a lot of the problem is that I just don't enjoy doing things in the first place. It's not just getting stuck and not knowing how to continue, it's not wanting to start and not wanting to keep going once I've started.

""See a therapist."" - I've seen therapists and am currently taking medication for ADHD. I've also been medicated for major depressive disorder in the past. Neither the medicine nor the counseling has been particularly effective.

""Go back to the things that inspired you in the first place."" - They don't inspire me anymore. I still love them, but it's more of a bittersweet kind of love where I feel like I'm never going to accomplish something like that. It doesn't help that the creators I admire are typically superhumanly prolific, and I can't help but compare my ""I opened Word and typed out some vague story beats"" output to J. C. McCrae's ""I publish a novel's worth of content every month no exceptions"" output, even if I know that's silly.

""Be more sociable!"" - I feel like I'm plenty sociable. I've got a circle of close friends, most of whom I live with, and all of whom I see very regularly. I'm lucky to have a relatively large network of supportive people, even if I don't socialize outside that network very often.

""Get a new job."" - I might have to if this keeps up, but I've had a few different jobs and this is the one that I've enjoyed having the most. There is nothing else I can think of that I would want to do for a living, and even if there were, I'm still in the position where I don't find any of my hobbies enjoyable and don't know what to do with myself even when I'm not thinking about work.

I wouldn't be typing up this post if the usual avenues that people suggest had worked out. Maybe I wasn't trying hard enough, but it feels like I've been trying really hard for a really long time and that things have just gotten worse. So if anybody has anything they think would be helpful, I really want to hear it.",09Jun2020,1

90,"I'm 20.  I was talking to my LDR girlfriend over the phone.  My parents don't know I'm gay, and I especially don't want to tell them I have a long distance relationship.  Usually my dad asks who I'm talking to and he's happy with ""my friend,"" and leaves it at that, but my mom always questions me further with what's their name, where did you meet, what gender, etc etc.  

All my life, I couldn't really tell my mother anything. She was pretty critical of me growing up and she doesn't know about things like my eating disorder and struggles because I always felt like she wouldn't care or she'd care too much and judge me for it/lecture me for hours like she usually did.  I felt it was easier for our relationship to not bring it up.  Now I find it hard to tell my parents literally anything, especially if I have a problem with something.  I also hate when they ask who my friends are, I find it hard to tell them for some reason.  

She got mad when I refused to tell her ANYTHING about my girlfriend and guilt tripped me with a 10 minute lecture on how we're basically strangers, family tells each other hard things sometimes, and how I should just continue to keep quiet if I don't want us to be family.

92,"# in happy longterm relationships, what resulting qualities or skills are more valuable than learning how to solve problems creatively? and why? what evidence supports your response?

**heres a quick example of sovling porbelms creatively:**

* before the laundry machine was invented, a big kind of a problem was girls didnt have much free time to do anything like develop hobbies or run for ceo prime minster president director of aircraft engineering etc
* i dont know the history of the invention of laundry machine but automating this process of cleaning clothes  in total saved time for ppl in general
* this was a way of solving a problem that nobody thought about
* creatively = outside of what is the norm at any given point in time

&amp;#x200B;

in happy longterm relationships, what resulting qualities or skills are more valuable than learning how to solve problems creatively? and why? what evidence supports your response?

for example say the couple had the quality of cooperation, the question is why does that quality matter and what does it lead to? cooperation along with otehr qualities would be a precursor to creative problem solving

* the end result of what things lead \[to\] is what are    **resulting qualities or skills**
* i cant think of a better phrase atm
* see [https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/asmvxc/til\_a\_harvard\_study\_found\_that\_hiring\_one\_highly/](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/asmvxc/til_a_harvard_study_found_that_hiring_one_highly/)

&amp;#x200B;

other possible options i thoguht about for things that are more important than solving problems creatively are:

* **being open**\- being to new thoughts, and new ideas (that are based on good evidence and reason ofc), but thinking about it, this actually is just one of the many prerequisites to being able to solve problems creatively
* **loving the ideals &amp; going towards the ideals**\- even if a couple had this if they didnt know how to solve porbelms creativly i dont see how this would be more important than solving porbelms creativly
* **initiative in starting new things**\- showing leadership stuff like that, umm i dont where i would place this in what is valuable, but its def not  more important than solving porbelms creativly
   * but maybe it actually is more importnt tho gotta tink abojt this one
* **compromise**\- ok this is really bad, and this is a large reason why solving porbelms creaitlvey is so much better
   * compromise = to give up something you care about and/or selfish about
   * compromise is really bad cos its \[not\] creating more value or more wealth in society, for example there's 1 pizza, to compromise theere's still gonna be 1 pizza at the end no matter, well i guess there'll be no pizza which is worst
   * or rent, landowners that rent from residents arent creating any extra value, the value is still the same at the end usually.
      * same goes the residents, they arent imporoving they arent making anything better
* **being thoughtful-** i dunn o what this word means its too vague and i dont know hwo to descibe it using words so there's no way to compare and see it was more important than being able to solve problems creatively cos i dun even know wat this means to be 'thoughtful'
* etc other things somewhere... duno where i put them..  cant think of anything else off top of mind atm

93,"But I need advice (hence me posting on this subreddit).

1) I'm not very good a planning and I suck at committing to a plan, especially because I get distracted by social media (for memes and latest random news) or pornography once something gets slightly difficult

94,"Hi all.

I'm a 32 year old guy. I'm feeling extremely down lately. I feel kind of like I don't want to be around anymore. I'm against suicide though and hate when people ""try it"" as a way to get attention. I think if I ever did it, I wouldn't post about it and I would be sure whatever method was 100% accurate. But I'm not here to threaten that. I'm very good at hanging on, unfortunately LOL

It's getting to the point lately that it is making it to where I physically hurt. I can't concentrate at all. Nothing makes any sense and I don't want to do anything. 

A few weeks back something kind of amazing happened. Some one saved my life. I wasn't trying to take it, nothing like that but I had an incident and could have very well died (was extremely close) and this nice young lady saved me. She was so sweet, helped me out and even gave me a hug before saying goodbye (extreme sport I do, was out in the wilderness alone). It blew my mind. I didn't want to be weird and appreciated her help so much, all I got was her name, I wasn't going to ask for anymore.

The thing is, it touched my heart so deeply. I cannot even describe the feeling. No one has hugged me in about 10 years and meant it. I haven't felt like anyone has given a damn about me in a long time. I have not cried in 10 years and remember the exact time I last did. It's weird because your eyes aren't used to it and sting like crazy. I was crying hard the whole way home. I wish so badly I had that kind of caring in my life.

It's odd. I don't really have any friends. I did, once upon a time and they all either stopped talking to me, back stabbed me or disappeared. For most of my life I haven't had friends. What's weird is I don't totally mind this. There's been times in my life where I've met a few people I would love to have as friends. Super cool, super chill people, but the timing or the place wasn't right or they just didn't want to be. I'm very outgoing but I also don't push things or ask people to be friends. I think it's kind of weird and something that happens naturally. The last good friend or two I had sort of just stopped talking to me. But again, I don't really mind and eventually learned how to live life solo.

The thing is, I hear so many people talk about how you should have friends. Groups of friends. At my age you should go out on Friday nights and hang with ""the buds"". A bunch of 30 something's who park their trucks at the bar and burp while they watch football and talk about their wives. There is nothing further in this world from what I want but apparently that's what you're supposed to do or have. I'm very selective with friends and don't like groups. Part of what makes me so weird, right? And that's how people tend to meet. It seems like nowadays it's taboo and wrong to meet a possible relationship (or even begin as friends) from work or even activities. You just meet through social circles, parties or online dating sites which all feel so unnatural to me?

Now on to the fun stuff! I'm 32 and still live with my one parent. The only family I really have around that wants anything at all to do with me. I've also been in a ""thing"" for about 8 years now. Started as a relationship with a person, not sure what it is now. We haven't had sex in years, she is always upset at me, accuses me of things I don't do, yells at me and has been gaslighting me for years. I've sat down and begged her to stop, asked what I could do to be better and I never get an answer other than not doing things that I'm not doing? This person does not work and I'm not sure if she can. I pay for everything she has, food, clothes, expenses, etc. She rarely takes a shower, never puts on makeup or fixes up at all, never fixes her hair and if I ever make the mistake of asking her to maybe help clean something around the house I get yelled at and cussed out. I do most of the cleaning and organizing.

My life could not be more pathetic or embarrassing. I work at a dead end job in a field I got into 10 years ago and absolutely hate. I might could change careers, go back into college but lately I feel so depressed that I can't even take action. I make very little money, enough to pay my car payment and put food on the table for the two of us. That's it. I have a sport I do out in the wild. Anymore I don't even want to go out and do it (it's nothing very expensive).

What I wish I had more than anything else in life was just love. Something I've wished for so long but I've been told and made to feel like that's wrong. At the most I should be happy with some friends. I feel like true caring love is just something I will never have. It would be so nice to have some normalcy in life, a normal relationship. I see folks my age who have that and I feel happy knowing some people have it, that it exists, never bitter, but it burns down inside. More than anything I just wish I had companionship. Some one to talk to at night, some one to confide in. Sex is so far down my list of things I want. A hug is way up there.

I met some one not long ago, a girl. Only person I've met in 10 years and even before that, never met some one like this. It was so random, by complete chance, one of those once in a lifetime kind of things. We started talking through text, getting to know each other. It was amazing. She was very sweet to me, made me feel like for once some one wanted something to do with me. She wanted to meet up and go do something together, I had planned to go out in nature, etc. Nothing bad, just as friends but who knows, maybe some day? I don't know. It was just nice having some one who was nice and sweet talk to you and want your company. But then, like everything in life I F'd it up. I brought up a sensitive subject with her that I didn't even know was sensitive and said something wrong. I tried to apologize, I was (still am) so incredibly sorry. It hurt me deep to my core.

She didn't talk to me for several days. I finally broke down and sent her a message explaining how sorry I was and how happy I was to have met her and hoped she would talk to me again some day. She messaged me back and said she was glad I had apologized and that she needed to cool off. We started talking again, all day, every day and it was great. She kept hinting for me to ask her out to dinner so I did. She got all excited, we made plans, I was excited... Then that day she told me that her ex husband wanted to try to patch things up with her. Which I guess I understood. She had been going through a divorce. I still think it might have been her way of letting me down easy. She told me she didn't want to but they had a couple of young kids together, so I understood. She said it was time for her to go away. It's odd because I've experienced some bad pains in life but I feel like I've been so beaten and defeated for so long that this one has hurt more than any other. I'm just not good enough, I'm not handsome enough, I'm not enough of a man, I don't have a good enough of a career. If I had been more, been better, looked better, had a better personality or career... It was a once in a lifetime chance and I lost it.

I finally had some one who wanted my company. I was so looking forward to doing something not on my own (everything I do is alone including my work, I'm alone, all the time). I was so excited. 

One eventually realizes that they are just a complete F up. That they are incapable of having anything meaningful and it just hurts. It hurts bad. I'm 32. I'm not getting any younger. My life is going no where and I'm in so much pain on a daily basis I cannot function. I had gotten sort of used to just being alone in life, but all of a sudden I felt wanted again just to have it ripped out from under me (all my fault). Now it just, hurts. Very bad. 

One thing that has kept me going is I'm big into fitness. I'm actually in very good shape and do a lot of running and stuff like that. I'm actually training for a full marathon. But anymore it's becoming harder for me to force myself to go out and do. I am in good shape, I try to be loving, patient, understanding and kind but I guess that doesn't mean much. I'm still very broken, worthless. I work around some really sweet girls, but none of them have ever so much as asked for my Facebook. They want nothing to do with me and I don't blame them.

I wake up and just don't want to be here anymore. I don't want to be me. I don't want this life I'm in. The person I want to be I'm not and I've tried hard to become them but never have been able to. I've tried changing things. Never works. Nothing ever happens. Pretty much my purpose in life is to suffer. I just don't want to suffer anymore? I'm sick of hurting every day. I wish some one would hug me and tell me it's okay for me to be me but at the same time I know I don't deserve that.

So I continue to wake up, go for my runs, shower, work, come home and live completely empty. I tried for years to partake in hobbies, activities, keep my mind busy. It never helped, things only got worse and now I just... I just don't want to play anymore.",09Jun2020,2

I’m usually serious and professional and I don’t really make much progress in long casual conversations, especially that my interests aren’t so common with many people (I enjoy art and gardening and nerdcore comedy).
How do I become more “fun” and relevant and make more social progress?

Extra into: I’m kind of a popular guy in my college because of the art I create and share on social media- however most of my interaction with people is through small instagram comments. I have a good number of friends in college but I usually let my brother talk more and I just add a few comments to their convo. now many of our friends call my brother when they need something and never call me lol.
I know I should interact more with them but I’m not good with that as I mentioned above :/
Any advice? 
Thanks :)",09Jun2020,1

I am taking the necessary steps in order to be a better me. But that has me digging up lots of questions that i am still learning to find the answers to. So here I ask, when in doubt what do you do?

He has posted pictures of me on Snapchat every once in awhile and posts on Instagram about me on my birthday. I’ve told him that I wish he would show me off more, and he’s like yeah I just don’t post much. But a few months ago he got big into skateboarding and made a whole private Snapchat story dedicated to posting about him skateboarding. Now, he made a whole Instagram dedicated to his car, and also posts about his car on Snapchat. But he never posts about me. Ive told him multiple times that it makes me feel like he’s hiding me or ashamed of me. But he says its just that he never posts. But now he posts often, yet he still won’t post me. When I tell him that it makes me upset, he’ll post pics of me for like a few days then just go back to never posting. It really hurts my feelings. He really loves me, I can tell. He is amazing and so sweet. But sometimes I just feel like he cares about his car more than me",09Jun2020,2

I feel like the right thing to do is to leave him but i’ve tried so many times but he just doesn’t wanna let go of me. We aren’t dating at the moment but we are still talking A LOT. a while back i told him about a new friend i made and how i was gonna hangout with him. he got really mad at me and told me i wasn’t allowed to hangout with the guy. i hung up the phone because he was just yelling and saying hurtful things. a couple minutes later he snaps me a pic of wrists. and there were cuts on them. i tried calling him back but he just kept saying how i didn’t care or love him. i finally got him to stay on the phone with me and i told him to clean his cuts because he was talking about how much they hurt. then when we hung up he texted me saying how he hurts me a lot and how i deserve better, he also blocked me on snap. the next day tho he added me back and called me again. i cant really deal with any of this stuff anymore tbh. it hurts a lot and i’m trying to move on, i just don’t know how...

I started exercising more and distracting myself with books &amp; music, and for the most part am doing pretty well considering the friendship heartbreak.

She yells at me and makes me feel like shit about myself then when I get upset and cry she calls me retarded for crying and tells me to stop acting stupid...if that gives you an idea of the type of person she is. She’s narcissistic, thinks everything she does it perfect and her way is the only way. Sometimes my dad would see how she would treat me and stand up for me and then she would turn on him for doing so. She once took my phone that I paid for/ paid the bill on, because I miss placed the ranch dip...she got physical with me and my dad stood up for me and she ended up smashing my phone on his head for that. Our last fight my dad and I talked about privately and he agreed that what she did was wrong, a few days go by and he brings it up again saying I was at fault bc I shouldn’t have been so disrespectful. My thoughts are: why should I show someone respect who doesn’t respect me? It’s okay for her to treat me like shit but I can’t stand up for myself? I thought I had someone to turn to but apparently my mom has gotten in his head. 
Anyway...I’m turning 18 in two weeks. I planned on moving out as soon as I had money for a car. I would’ve already had a car but my mom wouldn’t let me because she didn’t want me to have that freedom. I already had a large sum of money that I loaned to my mom about a year ago, she said the money would be back in my account in a month....two months passed by and it wasn’t, so I brought it up. That turned into a fight bc “I was being disrespectful”. My mom doesn’t want me to leave, she wants me under her thumb always, so I know she’s not going to give me my money back, I can’t take it to the police bc I have no proof I loaned it to her....

ANYWAY BACK TO THE TOPIC. Lol. I’m moving in with a friend who’s dad has a good understanding of what my mom is like. It’s a WAYY better environment. But my mom is already talking about how I don’t need to move out bc that would be stupid. I need a better job before I do, etc...I have siblings here that I really want to maintain a relationship with, I don’t want to leave on bad terms but I know that me leaving in general is going to piss my mom off to no end.

128,"Yesterday, I decided to go on a walk as I was tired of indoor quarantine exercise and wanted some fresh air. I was on my second lap around the block when I saw a woman with her dog ahead of me, and it had stopped, fixated on an object on the road, so they were not moving. I didn’t want to get corona, so I prepared myself to cross the nearly desolate street when I saw a white hyundai creeping along at a snail’s pace behind me. As a young woman, I have always been suspicious, as I have to be, for my own safety. However, at the moment I brushed it off and attributed it to paranoia.


I waited for the car to pass, so I could cross but it was going veryyyy slow, almost waiting for me to stop so I kept walking until I was about 6 feet from the woman in front of me on the sidewalk. The car eventually passed and pulled over about 15 feet in front of me. I crossed the street, and saw that the windows were rolled down and it was a man, probably in his mid thirties, with a stubbly beard and he was adjusting what seemed to be his phone GPS on a dashboard mount. 


Some relief washed over me as I assumed that maybe he was an Ubereats driver, and that’s why he was going to slow, because he was looking for a certain address and had found it. So I continued walking on the other side of the street, but saw that he started to pull out of the spot, and continued on the road toward the intersection. (The road was fairly empty). As he passed by me, he continued at the extremely slow pace that he had been at before, but this time, he stared at me straight in the eyes, not saying anything. 


At that moment, I felt my gut churn, some sort of intuition that flipped a switch immediately. I turned on my heel 180 degrees and began to walk in the opposite direction. I was comforted briefly until I saw that he was ALSO turning around and at that moment I lost my shit. This was particularly concerning because he previously had on his turn signal, and if he wanted to turn around before, he could have done so when he pulled over previously. As he turned around, he was craning his neck, like he was scanning the sidewalk to see where I had went. I knew I had to hide or find help so I darted into a condominium complex immediately and turned into someone’s doorway, immediately ringing the doorbell. I poked my head out onto the street and my stomach dropped. I wanted to throw up. 


The car had pulled up perpendicular to the entrance into the complex and the driver continued to crane his neck, looking for me. I all but threw myself back into the doorway, but no one had come out of the house yet. I decided to duck there, next to the entrance where I was out of the driver’s field of view. I waited for a while, and when I looked out again, he was gone. 


Now, when I told my brother about this, he was skeptical, and told me that I was just paranoid. My parents didn’t think much of it. Am I really being paranoid? Was he just an Ubereats driver? It’s been almost 24 hours but I can’t get this off of my mind.",09Jun2020,1

130,"As the title says, I have a youtube channel with 250,000 subscribers. I created my channel in 2016(I think). I started out with creating and editing videos for popular music. Every video that I post is (rightfully) copyright claimed and I delete videos that do not get copyright claimed.

I used to post a lot of videos, but I started college and just wasn't able to invest time into something that I wasn't learning or making money from, so I stopped posting videos. My last video was posted over a year ago, however I'm still getting a couple thousand subscribers every month and a couple million views per month.

Recently, I discovered a channel called MrSuicideSheep. From what I've gathered, this channel asks to have music sent to them by artists who aren't well known. This youtube channel posts these videos and monetizes them, and in return the artist gets free promotion. I think that something like this channel is a direction I would like to take my own channel in - the only issue is that MrSuicideSheep has 13 million subscribers and I only have 250,000. That youtube channel gets music sent to them in bulk and I don't. I would like to completely overhaul my youtube channel - but I worry that if I overhaul the channel and don't have any submissions from these relatively unknown artists, the entire channel will just fizzle out.

132,"Hi all! This is probably going to be a long post, so please bare with me here. 

I (M22) only had one friend left from my childhood/school, it was my best friend since pre k in fact. Both of us were as close as two friends could be, we always had each others backs, was there for one another, we even went half and half on a house for some time too (I'll come back to this part soon) however something changed and ended that friendship quickly. 

Some time before I lost this friend my life started to finally come together and change alot. I met a girl, got with her, started staying at her place more than my own, and as far as that goes things were great! I had two dogs also, this is where things start going downhill. One day I come home from my girlfriend's place to be informed by my friend I had two days to get out or get rid of my dogs. Now these dogs were the best, no accidents inside, low maintenance, and I came back throughout the day to do everything to take care of them and play with them for a bit each time. Why he wanted them gone is still a mystery to this day. I never got so much as a reason. I genuinely think he was just wanted to start a fight with me, or maybe he was mad because I was moving forward with my life and he'd been in basically the same place for awhile, but I don't know nor can I prove any of that. 

Needless to say but, within two days my things were packed and the dogs and myself were gone. We never talked again after that. Shortly after moving out I found out my girlfriend and I were expecting. We both were beyond excited! However this is when my old buddy comes back into the picture making Facebook posts saying how we will be horrible parents, we aren't fit, etc. I blocked him, made a post defending myself and discrediting everything he said, and moved on. 

Fast forward to the end of my girlfriend's pregnancy, my daughter was born 2 months early due to my child not having enough room to grow inside my girlfriend. Again, while my daughter is in the NICU and we're both terrified, here comes my old friend making more posts about how my girlfriend was probably doing drugs, drinking, and he told everyone we wasn't fit again, etc. Which was all false, and I don't know about all obgyns but, my girlfriend was drug tested every single visit. So that post was quickly discredited once again. 

Finally the last time I heard he'd been talking about me was when someone asked him over snapchat anonymously why we weren't friends and he claimed it was over me leaving him with high house bills (I had receipts to prove this false becasue half the bills were in my name).

It's been about 2 years now without hearing anything, finally. However, I haven't had a single person to talk to besides my girlfriend. Nobody messages me, invites me to anything, etc. Dont get me wrong, my girlfriend is great! But having a friend or some friends to go out with occasionally would be a good change for me I think. I used to believe I didn't need friends, recently I've been thinking differently though. 

My main issue is, after seeing someone I've known my whole life try to ruin me and spread such rumors and be so toxic over jealousy or whatever caused him to act how he did, it's so hard for me to trust anybody or allow anyone that isn't my girlfriend to get close to me again. Even if I am able to trust again, where do I start to look to make new friends? I live in a really small town where everybody knows of everybody and theres nothing to do or nowhere to go to even meet new people. 

Any and all help/advice would be appreciated.  If you actually read this whole train wreck, I'd like to say, thank you.",09Jun2020,1

I moved from my home because it was toxic and abusive, but I feel like I am never content with my life.

I have no car and I can’t afford one so it’s not like I can just go for a drive, but I just feel so discontent with everything. I feel absolutely worthless and like a complete bum and there’s nothing I can do about it. I’m so tired of crying most nights because of these feelings but I don’t know what to do. It’s so hard to make friends because of my social anxiety and of course COVID. I don’t know how to stop feeling this way.",09Jun2020,1
135,"I’ve never suffered from any sort of depression in my past. I’ve always been a naturally happy and positive person. I have struggled with anxiety, but not anything too serious. Just general worries and panics. I wouldn’t consider myself someone who suffers from mental health issues, so I’m not sure what’s happening to me. 

I’ve suddenly hated being around others, especially my family. I have been quite an introvert throughout highschool and college, but since quarantine it’s gone to a whole other level. I could go days, even weeks, without talking to my family if I didn’t live with them. I don’t care to socialize with them at all. I would honestly rather be alone all day long. I hate when I “run into them” in the house when I’m getting food or doing something and have to talk to them. Sometimes I wait for someone to leave the kitchen before I go downstairs and make myself something. I feel super guilty about it and I’m not sure how to lift my spirits or get myself out of this funk. Every time my parents try talking to me I try to hurry and finish what I’m doing to try and leave the room to go back to my bedroom. I only respond with one-worded answers and try to seem uninterested so that they can get the hint I don’t wanna talk. It makes me feel so horrible, but in the moment I’m just so annoyed and moody and literally can’t control it. Afterwards I go to my room and cry because I feel so horrible for being rude to my parents, but I literally can’t help it. I literally get annoyed at my family so easily and I don’t know how to stop it. 

I also can’t stand to talk to friends. I haven’t checked up on any of my friends since quarantine because I honestly couldn’t be bothered. They have reached out to me, so it’s not like i haven’t talked to any of my friends in months, but I never reach out to them and I’m scared they’ll notice eventually and won’t want to be my friend anymore. I don’t know why but I sometimes get annoyed when my friends text me or ask to ft. Like I would rather just not. I literally just don’t ever feel the need to text them, nothing is going on in my life, and again I just couldn’t be bothered. I know it sounds so horrible, but I literally don’t know why I have no interest in any socialization. 

The only person I don’t mind talking to is my boyfriend. He’s the only person I can stand right now. Also we don’t live together just an fyi in case anyone was wondering. I miss him like crazy and I only want to be around him and nobody else. I don’t know if that’s bad or not, but he’s the only person I wanna be with rn. 

Besides not having the desire to talk to anyone, I feel like I’ve lost all motivation for anything. I shower twice a week, I rarely wash my face, I’ve slacked with brushing my teeth, and overall I’m just not taking care of myself at all. It took everything out of me today to work on my summer class and attend the lecture. I could barely get out of bed. I feel like I have no motivation to read the Bible and pray to God anymore and it’s making me feel so miserable cause I want to be motivated and I want to want to do stuff. I literally just lay in bed all day and it’s stressing me out to no end. 

I’m sorry this is so long. I just feel like I’m loosing control of my life and letting it slip out from under me. I’m not sure if this is depression or not cause I don’t feel sad, I just feel distant and annoyed and moody 24/7 except for when I’m with my boyfriend. Ugh.",09Jun2020,2

137,"Tldr at bottom 

I'm 20F and in the US, but my parents are very religious and stuck to their traditions from their home country.

If they find out I had sex before marriage they would disown me. I'm considered one of the lucky ones too, some people where I come from get murdered for this (honor killings). If they know that I'm at a guy's place, they'd 100% immediately assume that I'm not a virgin.

I'm a student and I'm not in a good position to be financially on my own. Even if I was, I'd rather my parents think I saved myself until marriage so that I don't have to ruin my relationship with them. I know it sounds like they're shitty people, they're not, they are just so damn brainwashed and have been conditioned to normalize disowning children for having premarital sex, because they see it as a huge betrayal/disrespect towards them.

I'm just tired of years of putting everything on hold for them (I won't be able to move out until I'm 23). So yeah I know you could say ""just don't date/have sex"" but I'm sick of not being able to do the things I want to do. I have the freedom of a 13 year old and the only reason I'm sane is because going to college gave me the freedom to lie about my class schedule.

Anyways, I've been seeing this guy for a while and he lives about 30 mins away. Before corona I would tell them I'm at college, which is the safest excuse to use because they can't actually verify if I'm there or not. I had to stop seeing him because my work hours were reduced as well and it would've been hard to make up an excuse to leave the house.

Well, now I'm back to working a few days a week and so I decided until college starts again I'll just be telling them I'm at work.

I'm worried though because there have been a few times I didn't answer my phone so my mom would call my workplace and ask for me. I'm going to keep my phone's ringer on while I'm at his place to avoid this happening. But also, what if my mom decides to visit me at work for whatever reason? She's done this twice so far in the year that I've worked there.

If my parents know I'm not at work, what's a valid excuse to give them? 

Also, is there anything else I can do to avoid them catching me? For example, my dad's getting me my own car soon, is there a way for me to know if he had a tracker on it? And if they somehow found out that my car was parked in his neighborhood, what excuse could fly that even if it got me in trouble, it wouldn't make them suspicious that I'm with a guy? 

**Tldr; if my parents ever find out I'm lying about being ar work, or if they find out I'm parked in a random neighborhood 30 mins away when I said I was at work/college, what's a valid excuse I can give them?**",09Jun2020,1
138,"My parents' relationship has been on/off for what it seems like years. They're ""in love"" one week, then have the nastiest fights the next week, then make up, and the cycle continues.

Recently though my father has been drinking a lot, getting drunk almost every night and screaming at my mother and accusing her of cheating on him with a guy that, according to my dad, ""fucks my mom while simultaneously messaging my dad to make him jealous"" or something of the sort. We keep asking him for proof, he keeps saying ""he has the convos on his phone"" but he never showed us. We know he's lying.

And just last night I come back home from my gf's and my brother tells me that our dad was physically harassing our mom to get her phone so he can spy on her ""conversations with all the guys she's cheating on dad with"". Fuck me. My dad's in my brother's room right now trying to put the blame on HIM because my brother broke up their fight last night when I was gone and called my dad ""a mother fucking piece of shit"". My dad is ""crying"". Pretend crying. Trying to manipulate my brother. He just told him he was hugging my mom not trying to assault her. What the fuck? My brother is 21, he's not stupid. 

I'm 23. I workout and I'm physically stronger than my dad so I'm not afraid to kick his fucking ass if he lays a finger on my mom in front of me. And yet that's the last thing I want to do because... well he's my father. I love both my parents, but I wish they'd get divorced. 

I've already have conversations with both of them, I'm trying to be rational and convince them to get divorced but they're both arguing emotionally. It's impossible to make them see reason. I'm a fking grown ass man and yet I have no idea what to do. I just finished university and hopefully soon will be able to get a job and move out of this hell hole.

139,"I'm sure this requires context, it's not about romance or whatsoever, moreso just a curiosity and possibly friendship.

Now we both went to artschool, she was an aspiring actress, and I made theater decorations, album covers etc etc because I did all the designing.

I recall us speaking for a short bit, I mentioned this band I'm into with a friend of mine, which she happened to know aswell so we got acquainted.

She opened up to me rather quickly about her problems though, but I'm cool with that, I've always been very open to hearing people out. She said she failed acting once before and she struggled keeping up, that she considered quiting. I was never the champ of advice giving but I figured that just listening to her seemed the right thing to do. A day or two later I saw her crying in the hallway, but I was already late and didn't want to interrupt her. In hindsight I might've been a bit of an unintentional asshole about it. Hadn't really seen her IRL ever since.

Anyhow, we've befriended eachother on social media, so I could make contact. I can't help but wonder what she's up to, how she's doing. Ya know? See if we could find some more to chat about. Apparantly she got to do the voice for a small youtuber's animation film, which I'm sure is a great feeling. Given the crappy situation of covid-19 and all, it probably doesn't hurt to get in touch with people.

However, I don't want to intrude either. I kinda wonder if it's not a bit out of line for me to try and pick up contact with someone if we didn't really give eachother all that much effort in the past. That might be perhaps a bit strange, no?

I'd like some input before I do anything stupid.

140,"So I'm a 27 year old dude, and I've lived in my city on the west coast of the US for 2 years, and my first roommate I lived with for a year and it was solid, second roommate was 6 months and was amazing. Current roommate is about to be 6 months. Each of the first 2 roommates left to live with their BF's and we are all still friends.

Before the pandemic started I wasn't super happy with current roommate. Even though she was and still is extremely nice, she didn't clean very often, locked herself in her room, and had random dudes over at least once a week. There's nothing wrong with any of those things immediately, but for me none of those are things I want from a roommate.

Since the pandemic she has had her hours cut at work but still doesn't clean, even though I am luckily working 32-40 hours a week. I have talked to her about it, and she'll do a bit extra for a few days before forgetting again. She's also had a few guys over in the past month, which I've told her I'm not comfortable with but she just says ""She understands."" I obviously don't want to control any aspect of her life, but to me it feels like I'm being put in a light amount of danger.

So our lease is up next month and I know we are re-signing because I'm not asking someone to move during a pandemic, but I can't decide on 6 months or a year because I know she wants the year, but I'm leaning towards 6 months, and at the same time asking her to move out once that's up assuming the world will allow it. I'm wondering if the reasons I've listed are reasonable, or if I got lucky with my first 2 roommates and this is just normal behavior.",09Jun2020,1

The degree I took doesn’t have a lot of offers, so now I’m just jobless.

146,"I’m on my third day without smoking. I really didn’t think withdrawal from marijuana was a real thing but apparently it is because I have been so sick the last two days. I first smoked 10 years ago when I was 14. I have smoked pretty much every day since I was 18, except for taking a year off while on probation at 19. I smoke multiple times a day but lately it’s been 1-3 times a day max because I’m back at work and it makes me anxious. 

I realized it makes my anxiety worse more than it’s helpful usually (I use it to cope with chronic stomach issues). I think I have been in denial about the fact that it’s not good for me for a while now, and almost exactly 72 hours ago I decided to quit. The first day I got CBD joints that mimic the smell and taste exactly, so that helps with the habitual aspect of it. 

However, I have been having major stomach issues, nausea, chills, sweats, and depression. I read up on it and this is apparently typical of withdrawal symptoms if you 1. Have smoked for several years 2. Smoke every day 3. Started smoking before the age of 18. I check every one of these boxes. 

I’m having a really hard time coping with the physical symptoms. It has made me want to give in and smoke more than once but I haven’t yet. I have to go back to work tomorrow though and I fear that the symptoms will take over my body. I could hardly lay in bed last night with the lights off and everything without feeling sick so I’m not sure how I can even deal with it if I’m working and talking to people all night.

147,"So here’s the scoop: 

My immediate family (Family #1) consists of my grandfather, older sister (who is homeschooled with me), and twin brother (public school). My mother has recently came into the picture again now sober, and my father is not in the picture.

My “second family” (Family #2) I’m not sure how to describe it without doxxing so bare with me. my grandpas brother (I call him uncle), another male figure, who has a little girl. Also an older male figure with his wife who’s like an aunt to me, a daughter, just a couple years younger than me, and another older guy.

When I go hangout with family #2 we hunt, fish, and other fun outdoor stuff. They teach me things. We have a great time whenever we are together, never a dull nor awkward moment. I’m learning from these people to grow, and be a man. I really love my life when I am with them, I feel motivated and I’m an overall happy guy.

On the other hand when I’m at home with family #1 there is none of that. The only things I can do is spend time by myself, or be bored. My brother is always playing video games, although he does come up with me to meet family #2 sometimes, not recently though because of school. Grandpa used to bring me out there when I was younger, but now he never comes out. My sister is adamant on not coming out with me, she says: “I don’t even know them, or that’s not my version of fun.” She is selfish in every aspect. She’s the princess, and the boss. She’s spoiled. I on the other hand am expected to make dinners for my siblings because god know that they would starve without me. I do all of the chores around, like taking care of the lawn, cooking, and other things. The work isn’t the issue, it’s that there is no return, only allowance, which I don’t even feel happy receiving. And when I go back home to them from up north, I feel a depression, and just an overall negative vibe when I return 

Anyways, back to the point. What should I do? Do I say something? Because I don’t know how longer I can take it anymore. I’m at the point where I don’t even care if I “leave my family.” In the end it’s sad but I’m just not sure the best way to attack the situation.

I know the rules state no revealing personal information, but I tried to be as blunt as I could. I wish I could give more details, and context, I don’t mind if I’m “revealed, or doxxed”, but rules are rules.

Like I don't *actually* have what it takes to be a ""professional"". If you were to ask me about something technical, chances are I wouldn't be able to answer your question. I feel like I just know how to get through school easily and get good grades without *actually* learning the material...

 While we try to help with that, the immediate problem is they've got a weaken immune system due to severe untreated diabetes (fear of doctors) and a skin infection that has begun to spread (dead tissue). Family in the medical field (nurses) have told us that this won't just go away on its own and if something isn't done soon it could very well kill them. 
Response was that people are blowing it out of proportion. 
 Well we did talk them into going to see a doctor finally, who said basically it will have to be debrided (out patient surgery) or they'll be in serious trouble. Now they are flat out refusing, saying ""I guess I'll just die. Nobody cares anyway."" 
We're at a loss. We love this person and obviously want them to live. But as the doctor told them directly, he can't act without their consent. Several family members have yelled at them and called them selfish out of fear and frustration, which is just wrong but nothing helps. Rational conversation is dismissed, as is begging and pleading. The doctor said he had to be real, we should respect their wishes - and told us to go ahead and start planning their funeral.

I have a girlfriend who I love very dearly, and I also have a mother I love very dearly, and there was a lot of drama that went on at one point, and we took her in maybe 2 months before the pandemic happened because she was having a few family issues and so on, all is well how on her part, but now it's gotten to the point where my mother is arguing to me about her

There was alot of miscommunication from both sides one day and everything kinda fell down hill, my little sister didnt like how much time I was devoting to my girlfriend even though I was aware that I have to even out attention towards everybody, and I really tried my best, and long story short, just a couple of hours my girlfriend had come over, she had already left, because she got seriously upset over some of the things that my sister said as she over heard things, which led to even more drama

It's gotten to a point where me and my mam start arguing more and more and I'm just trying to make everyone happy, I'm having to go up into the attic to try make some floorboards, which is easy enough but tends to blame me for mistakes, I'm not saying all of it is her fault, but alot of it is from her end. Whenever I ask her things she tends to ignore me and not reply, for no reason what's so ever sometimes, I understand if its after an arguement, but shes started framing me for making her look like a liar, claiming that I'm living too much of an adult life and that my girlfriend is trying to control me, saying that I've changed as a person and so on.

This whole situation is partly my fault as during my girlfriends birthday, I ended up staying an extra night at hers, i had called my mam asking, she said things that didnt answer my questions and she hung up, and then I got into shit for doing it, I apologised and talked to her about it, and tried keeping up with some her demands, but she expects me to do things that is technically adilt work while also telling me I shouldn't be living an adult life.

Just today, I had another fight with my mam about things, about me. My girlfriend, her mother, and many other things, and thanks to my dad, who 99% does nothing I'll be able to go see her tomorrow again, as she went back home since restrictions are allowing more and more travel to loved ones.

After me and my dad agreed on a time as he leaves early for work as we own a small business, my mother walks In 10 minutes later angrily and upset asking if I've shame and walks off

164,"My 30-year-old sister is living many states away/a plane ride away from the state my family and I are from. She lives with her boyfriend of 7 years and their two cats. She has always struggled with her mental health, and used to be on anti-depressants that had been really helping her but ever since they moved to this state (about two years ago) she struggled to find good, stable employment with benefits and subsequently lost access to healthcare. The thing is, she doesn't have a college degree and therefore can be limited in finding work, or at least work with benefits. And when you add onto that untreated depression (and possibly other undiagnosed issues like anxiety, bipolar disorder), it can be very challenging for her to find and keep a good job. She also does not have access to a car.

Something else worth noting is that she is a pothead, drinks a lot, and has a history of doing coke and probably other drugs. 

At first it seemed understandable that anyone would go through a period of adjustment when they move to new place but now two years in, things are worse than ever. For brevity's sake, these are some things that have happened over the past two years:  


* She's asked me and my parents for money a few times in such a way that seemed very urgent, sketchy, and somewhat nonsensical
* We lost touch with her completely for about 6 months. We had on and off communication with her boyfriend, but it was very worrisome because his phone number kept changing and he would stop responding. We called the police for a wellness check and even that didn't result in us regaining contact
* Searching for answers, we found out via Google that she was arrested in possession of drugs. I also personally called her workplace and found out she didn't work there anymore. The unknowns were very scary
* We eventually regained contact, and increased contact has revealed she is skinnier, they are having relationship issues, and her mental health (and/or drug use?) has worsened substantially. A lot of the time it is very hard to hold a conversation with her because she can't form coherent sentences and cries very often
* Coronavirus has caused her to lose any job prospects—as I mentioned prior she doesn't have a degree so she mostly does waitressing or retail jobs. She mentions not having much to eat and struggling to feed her cats. We still don't have clarity on where she was working or what the timeline of events was
* Her neighborhood is in a city that has become full of unrest due to the protests against police brutality and the Black Lives Matter movement (which I fully support, but that's irrelevant to this post). I don't want to say where but it is making national/international headlines. Even before this, she mentioned hearing gunshots all the time
* Her boyfriend and her are on the brink of a breakup but her self-confidence and mental health is so low that she seems incapable of leaving him. It seems very unhealthy with him accusing her of things and bringing up events that happened many years ago

So here we are in this present moment. My family has helped her with the phone, phone plan, and sent grocery store gift cards to help with food (they are now apprehensive about sending money). They have sent her mental health self-help books, asked their therapist friends for advice, made recommendations about free therapy consultations near her, and recommended she come back home for a bit. She doesn't want to come home because ""it would feel like failure"" and she can be very combative towards my parents at times. There also seems to be some kind of backstory for why she may not feel safe or welcome in our home city anymore. 

As the younger/only other sister here, I am helpless but desperate to help. I keep getting the argument ""but she is 30, she's not a minor."" I get it. But what can we do?? It's been two years of her struggling and struggling. Any advice is welcome. I just want my sister to be happy and healthy and safe.

170,"To give u some more info, he was physically abusive especially when he drank. His mom died in March and it was causing fights because he wasn’t coping well. I can admit I might’ve not been as supportive as I needed to be because I had grown resentful towards him. So he would go out every night without telling me where he was going and doing shrooms and getting blacked out every night. I was afraid every day. 

Anyways I kicked him out last week and I know I made the right choice but of course I’m sad that I had to end a 2 year relationship and break up our family because I thought it was best for my safety and my baby. 

I’m sad about the breakup and got my locks changed at my house and I just keep getting HORRIBLE anxiety. Today it was so bad I almost called 911 because my vision was so blurry I was dizzy I couldn’t breath. My hands feet and face got super tingly and I called my mom to bring me a blood pressure machine. It was 135 over 90. I felt like I was gonna pass out. 

She forced me to go take a walk and it went away after a few minutes and I’m definitely glad I didn’t go to the hospital. 

Between quarantine, drinking more than I should, and dealing with the breakup I know it’s a combination of things causing them so I guess I’m looking for ways other people calm themselves down or helpful websites or videos. Calming music and breathing alone isn’t helping.

He had poor hygenie, was slightly rude during sex, quiet, and rushed like he couldnt wait to leave. He ended up tearing my vagina with lack of foreplay and so I bleed for 3 days. Then I had a miscarriage(never told him or anyone). Then he ghosted me. Turns out he gave me hpv which whatever its everywhere. He got back in contact with me know he couldnt avoid me. I told him about the hpv casually and that was it. During this time I was hardcore suffering from a list of things, like painful urination, horrific periods, discharge and itching. I figured my change of diet was changing my body so like whatever I went to a GP in like August or September and she gave me something for bv without testing me. It didnt go away so I went to a legit gynecologist. They apparently said they think I couldve had trich for months and treated it with the antibiotics I took last August. I also tested positive for ureaplasma. I got back in contact with him after months and I told him about everything and asked if he would be willing to get tested. I never was told what strain I had and apparently that was important and for some reason there was an issue where know one would tell me the strain and my insurance womt pay for me to get retested. I told him this shit months ago and he still doesnt want to get tested and uses excuse. I just dropped it at this point. Are all men this shitty? Also I'm very traumatized by this shit like any advice?",09Jun2020,1
173,"4 years ago I moved my mother and two younger brothers in my house because I felt bad for them. Everything was supposed to be temporary, I told them to stack their money so they could move however they never did. They all worked as well but spent their money as quickly as they made it. Due to covid-19 me and my younger brother were laid off and the other two got fewer hours yet never saved. Well my brother has passed and unfortunately it was near the house so we decided to move but the thing is I don't want to move with anyone, I want to grow by myself as an adult however nobody has money really so they want us to move in together to save money and it would be temporary but its never temporary:( I feel shitty because I love them and don't want them in the streets, especially my mom bc she's at a dead end job but I can't help how I feel. I just need advice, should I go be by myself or bite the bullet and we all move in temporary?",09Jun2020,2

My parents are extremely worried because there's no fresh air coming in and risk of people whom have the sickness coming in. They're so overprotective and is telling me to get myself fired so I can go on CERB and not work. 

Me on the other hand.. I honestly am not worried anymore. I was before because the cases were so high up in the air. Now I am just okay. I learned to live and just keep my distance and I'll be happy. 

My parents and my sister is not okay with it since they're keep on hearing about the numbers going up. Cases are going up  and is just in fear of leaving their own home. They are also scared because my dad is in close contact of his mom which she is in her 90's.

182,"My sister is back home since the pandemic and her bf is also with her. I’m very close with my sister as we are so close in age. Her bf is also a pretty good friend of mine. 

My sister is always too chirpy (when she feels like it)

When I study I close my door but she has a habit of coming in and trying to make me laugh or sing to me. Or mess with my stuff to have fun. Even though I am busy. I have put up signs but it’s to no use. And her bf does the same thing sometimes. But to a lesser extend. 

My sister has been cooking for me, cleaning, and provides me with a ton of support. Her bf as well. They have been there for me a lot. 

However this is when things began going downhill. I am currently in school to become an engineer. I have a lot of coursework. And I like to do it at night since no one is up. My brother is the same. But my sister isn’t. 

So I study till 8 am and wake up at 3 pm. My sister doesn’t like that too much. I told her “maybe I could wake up earlier” she told me she would wake me up earlier. So the next day I slept at 6 am and at 12 pm she barged into my room. 

Put all the lights on and started yelling. It was the worst things and I got super upset and told her to leave. Moments later she texted me how I need to study and that I’m wasting time. That’s something I hate when people say. 

She kept implying I’m lazy but I just ignored. We were okay till night time came. And after dessert we had another small fight. I expressed how upset I was and she said “either get over it or cry about it buddy” and I said that was super rude of her to say. Her bf then began to laugh so I confronted him and he apologized but laughed more. And both were laughing. 

Now I had a big problem. The next day she tried to apologize but then said I was being a bully so nothing happened. I tried talking to my parents to talk to them but nobody said anything. 

So I went and talked to both. Apparently to them I was yelling at them. They both didn’t seem apologetic at all. So I decided I’m leaving the house. As I’m packing my sister comes to me and cussed me out. I told her to “f off” and she began hitting me hard. 

I’m 6 foot 1 and she’s 5 foot 3. I could have easily hit her back but I didn’t. She slapped me. Kicked me below the waste. Punched me. 

I was bleeding. 

Everyone got involved and it was a huge problem. Everyone began blaming me for the fight. 

The next morning when I woke up. My sister began calling me awful names. When I tried to talk back and raised my voice saying “I don’t appreciate that. I did nothing wrong” 

Her bf said “you aren’t being civilized. Like you weren’t last night” 

I left. And am now staying with a friend

185,"From the time I was 14 (I am now a 21F) until a sophomore in university (\~19/20 years old) I dated a man a few years older than me (24M) who abused and exploited me sexually. A common form of this abuse was in forced group sex with only men, disguised as ""kinky threesomes"" etc. where my boyfriend would watch. It was often a dangerous situation with me, a minor, being physically and sexually violated by complete strangers. Presently, I have sought out legal action to the degree of a no-contact order through my university police.

Anyways, I went to university with my abuser. We were in the same program (I saw him constantly in classroom buildings, however, we obviously were not permitted to be within a certain amount of feet from each other). My friends are also in our program and have found out through the grapevine that he is living with his new girlfriend (21F) of roughly a year. It is going around the school that he and his girlfriend have been having ""crazy threesomes with other men.""

This I found very disturbing. I am hoping it is a coincidence, although it sounds too similar to be one. I just graduated, and so did he, meaning that my no-contact order is not applicable since it was through my university's police (but is very helpful for the paper trail). Over the year that I'd known they were dating, I considered how I could tell the girl about who she was dating. I was not able to speak to anyone in his close relations directly without getting into trouble per the no-contact order. After hearing this threesome news though, and having graduated, I feel like it \*may\* be my moral obligation to keep someone safe from this..?

I know that he paints me as a crazy ex-girlfriend as I have heard it from peers, and I'm sure that's extended to his new girlfriend. But he has slipped under the cracks for some time as a pathological liar/narcissist and a sexual predator.

So my question is, should I attempt to share with this girl my experiences with her boyfriend, who sexually abused me? Or is it ""out of my hands?"" My moral compass is all over my place as I wish to preserve my mental health but the thought of someone going through something that I did also is not good for me.",09Jun2020,3

I know this guy (17,M) who I've been friends with for about a year (we've known each other for about four though) and we've gotten very close.

203,"I like to consider myself a pretty happy and positive person, I’m doing very well at the moment. About a month ago I was almost at my peak and it felt amazing! I started finding myself, changing and becoming a better person to my friends and peers, and to myself. I’m still pretty close to that point but there’s just a few things bringing me down. 

I’m 22 and I live at home with my parents and 2 younger brothers. I know I shouldn’t at my age, but I just don’t make enough to be able to move out. My parents are fine with it, if it was up to them they’d make me stay forever haha :) 

My parents do love me and I’ve always been very lucky and fortunate, they’ve always helped me when I need it and I love and appreciate them, they do a lot for me. But they are just so hard to live with. My mum and I clash a lot, she’s very strong headed and I have some of that too but I know how to hold back. She trots around the house speaking badly to everyone, she brings us down, disrespects is, and as soon as someone speaks up and stands their ground, she loses it. Like, if she disrespects me and I try to tell her that I don’t like that, she will basically just say “well move out then” knowing I can’t, she just says it to shut me up and stand over me. She controls my brother (20) and I, but not in a “no, you can’t do that” kind of way, she goes on and says “well I can’t tell you what to do, but I don’t like that” then as soon as you try to disagree, or do a certain thing, she will just hound and hound and hound us over it for a day, then begin sulking and ignore us or treat us bad for the next day or two because we wanted to do something that she didn’t agree with. It could be as simple as hanging out with somebody she doesn’t like, or leaving the house past 9pm on a work night. She also just goes on and on about drama in her and other people’s lives, one happening right now is my brothers girlfriend, they broke up about 3 months ago and my mum is constantly bitching about her and trying to start drama with her over Facebook. 

My dad isn’t like this, he is often walked over too. He’s a great guy, but he also brings me down, but not on purpose. He mopes around the house talking about how sad his life is, and how he just works constantly. By “works constantly”, he also means doing things around the house. Talking about how he hates the area he lives in. I try to get him to help himself and try doing some fun things and going out with me or the family but he just refuses to do anything. Instead he would rather talk about it over and over. It makes me feel bad and I just hate being about negative stuff constantly. 

Another thing that I can’t stand is how messy everyone I live with is. The house is often really filthy and no one seems to want to do anything. There’s a small upstairs area at my place, with a bedroom, small living area and bathroom, that’s all mine. I keep it all very clean because I like a clean space and it makes me feel good. I can’t stand even anything out of place. But because everyone else lives downstairs, and they all live like pigs, it’s honestly filthy. Nothing is put away after it’s been used, the dogs basically live inside, the carpets are never cleaned and floors are rarely swept or mopped. My mum gets home from work and just sits down and watches tv all afternoon until bed. My brothers aren’t made to do anything to clean or do chores, they don’t even do their own washing and they are 16 and 20. I cook every few days and try to do some tidying, but I cannot clean up after 4 very messy people. So I spend a lot of time upstairs where it’s clean and my mum doesn’t try picking fights with me. 

I don’t know what to do, I can’t escape all this negative BS, I’m trying so hard to stay happy as my life is going amazing right now, but I want to find a way to help me through these things. Talking to my family about them isn’t really an option, I’ve tried and none of them want to listen.",09Jun2020,1

206,"Hi everyone! So I have been living at home on and off for y’all the last couple years. It’s been a struggle to be independent. I’ve had trouble keeping work,  managing money, and having enough income to be independent. I live at home with my dad currently since September. Since then I haven’t accomplished much other than paying a bill or two. I find it hard to save. Or have no idea how to save. I drive for Postmates and avg 50-100 a day. I have trouble keeping a job because of anxiety and it feels like a pressure situation. Dad and I are frustrated and it leads to arguments and intense conversation about how nothing changes. He constantly asks the question what would you do if I weren’t around? I feel I am a child and probably deservingly so. For example I smoked cigarettes in his car while doing Postmates and now I cannot do Postmates for a week. We got into a discussion today with my case manager about heading to a group home. I had a horrible experience with living in one. It lead me to be homeless for a day after the group home operator told me to leave because she was frustrated with me forgetting to clean up things or leaving lights on over a 3 week period of living with her. I had to go to the Salvation Army. It was horrific. But at the same time better than sleeping on a park bench. Finally my dad offered me to stay with him. I’ve been with him since September. Also I do not like the group home setting. I have roommates and I have to deal with people constantly. Plus rules like I cannot use a stove etc. I feel like I’m in high school with my dad and even smaller in a group home. I have no money saved unfortunately to get my own place plus I’m afraid it would be chaotic again. So my dad has come to an ultimatum go to the group home or be homeless. Obviously the logical thing is go because shelter, food and water. It sucks to be in a position where I have little control or say in something like this. I wish there was a plan of action to work this out to stay here and improve this situation ultimately to independence and also in comfort. Help? Thoughts?",09Jun2020,1
208,"Hypothetically, I was accepted into an amazing doctoral program at one of the best universities in the States. I moved away from my family and friends and my research became my life. My interest was especially in cognitive behavioral modifications. 

After about a year, I started to notice some issues with the other people in my cohort. Many had changed and became very irritable and unstable. We were encouraged to join studies like alcohol consumption imaging studies and sleep studies. Almost daily, we were asked to fill out questionnaires about our condition. The workload started coming in waves. With the waves, the director of the program and my advisors would praise us and make us feel like we were doing the most important work in the world. Other times, we were yelled at, put down, treated like animals, and called obscene things.

I was uncomfortable all the time. I felt pressure to participate, and I knew that something wasn't right. I went to the Equal Opportunity office at the university to make a complaint. They were so sweet and helpful. They went out of their way to help me make a timeline, gather the evidence, and compile a list of witnesses. 

Almost immediately, all of the university staff started ignoring me. Giving me dirty looks. I was reprimanded formally for falsifying some data that I didn't even write. I made a complaint. Another professor, had a rant about ""n-words"" in front of me. So, I made another formal complaint. Eventually, I couldn't focus on my research. I followed up on the original complaint, that there was something unethical going on, and I was told that I never sent the evidence - I had. I went back to look at the studies on the server, but everything was gone. All of the correspondence on blackboard was gone. All of it was GONE.

I quit the program and filled a complaint with the U.S office of civil rights. They haven't gotten back to me in almost a year. Even if they do, most of the evidence of experiments is gone. I cant sleep. I have a pile of debt. I first told my story to a psychiatrist, and he tried to treat me for schizophrenia. I have not told anyone else.

212,"So for context I've always been one massive sucker for medieval fantasy. My favorite books and movies of all time are The Hobbit and LotR. Some of my favorite videogame series of all time include Elder Scrolls, Legend of Zelda, Dark Souls and The Witcher. Any piece of media, be it book, film, videogame, or anything of the sort that has dragons, swords, magic, castles, shit like that, I instantly love.



 And I always knew that wasn't real, it never will be, and it's just little worlds I can escape to whenever I want to. As a child I always loved playing in my yard with plastic swords, makeshift helmets and pretending to ride legendary horses and dragons, all the while being a famous hero loved by all destined to defeat evil. Of course now that I'm a young adult, I put all my swords and toys aside but still visit some of my beloved worlds in my books, movies or games. 



But I came across a little problem recently. Now with everything that's happening around the world, I've found myself in my fantasy worlds more than ever, and I think it's starting to affect me negatively. Sometimes I'll literally cry and feel depressed lying in my bed, wishing I was a dashing rogue, or a noble knight, or even a simple farmer, living in a fantasy world. And it's getting in the way of my daily activities. And the thing is, I'm fully aware that it's so wrong. Homie I'm a grown ass man with responsibilities to take care of, I'm not some highschool Melissa daydreaming about my crush Chad and imaging the wonderful life and family I'd have with him. 



I think this would be slightly more acceptable if I was 10, 15 even. But definitely not now. And honestly I don't know how to proceed. I don't mean to cut myself off from everything that has to do with that, not planning to. Or maybe I should? I honestly don't know what to do. All I know is I don't like it and am aware that it shouldn't be. And it's a shame that my favorite thing in the world is making me feel like this.",09Jun2020,1
213,"My wife and I arrived at our apartment complex this evening and as we were checking the mail, a very scared looking woman approached us and asked for help. She said she needed a ride, and that her phone was broken. So I tried to call her a cab. The cab was going to take over an hour to arrive, so my wife called her an Uber. The woman took out haphazardly wadded up cash and handed us about $40. The ride only cost $30, so I returned the rest to her. At one point during this exchange, the woman thought we offered to give her a ride in our car, so she tried to open the door and get in, but I stopped her and told her a cab was on its way.  

She thanked us and asked my wife's name. She responded with her first name. Then the woman also asked for her last name, which she also gave. The woman went to wait on the bench outside the apartment building, and we went up to our apartment. My wife was very concerned for the woman's wellbeing, as she seemed shaken up and perhaps even a victim of domestic abuse judging by some marks on her upper arms.  

My wife and I went back down before the Uber arrived to give her some snacks and send her off. She was very happy to have the snacks. Remarkably, the woman asked us if she could have a ride around the block. It seemed like she was trying to escape someone or something. She didn't trust that the Uber would arrive. Thankfully, it arrived during this conversation and the woman left safely.  

So my question is: am I being paranoid about the fact that the woman has my wife's full name and the name/address of the building we live in? She doesn't have an apartment number, an email address, a phone number or any other personal info. I assume if she was up to no good she wouldn't have literally thrown wads of money at us and seemed so urgent to flee the area. I'm probably overthinking because I was startled that someone approached us outside at 11PM, but do you think we have anything to worry about? Seemed odd that she made the extra effort to ask my wife for her last name in the midst of all that.",09Jun2020,1

I've tried just bringing less money but I a lot of the time here people just buy drinks for each other so that doesn't stop much. I was thinking of maybe making a number limit of drinks for myself or something that I shouldn't go over.

I also can't sleep well I've woken up at 5:30 am twice without wanting to. Lastly, I've been experiencing erectile dysfunction. 

Could this be because of the anxiety my exams are causing me? I am terrified that I might have depression and right now I can't afford treatment because I don't have the time or the money.

I was born in a city in the south, but for anon sake let’s say Atlanta, and been claiming that I’m from panama (im not, i was born in Atlanta but I have Panamanian ancestry) and been putting up this facade that I’m from there for like 4 years. I did this because I am very insecure about my ancestry as my dad is a mutt (not knowing who his non black father was) and my mom is American born Caribbean-black and native, again her not knowing about her side, so it just caused me to create a story in my head, to belong to a group and to be cool.
I also ‘had’ a small accent for a while but it just because so overwhelming to lie so I stopped. I thought people would think I was cool doing that. I speak French and English well and I shouldn’t be pulling off an accent for brownie points.
I’ve done a lot of self growth lately and I realized that lying is lame. lying isn’t cool and i wouldn’t want to pull a lie like this again. I want to come clean. Especially after being with my bf for so so long I can’t continue this. I love him too much to lie.
I lied because I thought it was cool to belong as I felt lost. Im okay with claiming my black side but my family doesn’t know anything about their tree so I agreed to take an ancestry test so I can lay this situation to rest.

224,"Recently for some reason, my little brother had an anxiety attack. My parents have started to blame it on because I'm ""too harsh"" with the kid. Apparently telling a kid to turn off the T.V when he's not using it, to stop screaming when he plays Fortnite, to not eat with his hands, etc, is too rough for his mental health...

I've been pretty much unaffected by the quarantine, he has been able to speak with his friends whilst I have only texted some from time to time. I recently bought a ps4 and started playing with my friends and my boredom levels have dropped quite a lot. Is it actually all due to the quarantine or some genetic predisposition? He is really sensitive and at this point, I'm getting really tired of him being mentally weak.

How do I remove these feelings and thoughts of wanting to tell him to man up and stop being such a dick head? Also, When they left for the hospital when it began I was happy that I was going to get extra time to play with my friends since I play in the living room. How fucked up am I that I started thinking about the benefits of him having anxiety attacks? There is also a considerable age gap between us, however, I believe that this is something that he inherited from my mom which gets stressed really easily.

230,"I miss my old mom. Nowadays she's all about ""QAnon"" and ""crisis actors"" and ""debunking"" major social change movements like BLM. She spews hatred toward minorities and when I try to talk to her about it, she infantilizes/invalidates me. She won't listen to logic or reason... talking to her is akin to playing chess with a pigeon.


She wasn't this way before Trump's campaign. I don't know what about it appealed to her, but something did. I've watched her spiral into someone I don't know over the past 4+ years.

She raised me to be empathetic and kind; always buy the homeless man on the sidewalk a sandwich, include everyone on the playground in my game of tag, donate my old books and toys to people who need them, bring my friends with strained family relationships over for dinner/holidays, etc.... even though I grew up poor (she was usually unemployed, and the jobs she had were never held for long periods of time), she always taught me to go out of my way to make sure others around me had everything they needed. Be selfless, even if it means skipping a meal yourself; if someone else gets to eat, that's what matters. She wasn't the best mother overall, as she often didn't pay great attention to me as a kid, but she damn well made sure I knew what kindness was.

I already stopped calling her on a regular basis. I refused to give her my new address (I moved after college, as most do). I told her she is not welcome to visit until she is able to think critically. I thought going low-contact with her would jolt her out of it, yet she still spews this shit all over social media. I gave her an ultimatum; I told her she can either post pictures of me on her facebook or she can keep posting her politial conspiracy theories, not both. She chose to delete all the pictures she had of me on her profile. It feels like she's willingly choosing this shit over her own daughter who she claims to love so much.

232,"I am not excited about my life, my job and myself and I want to find a positive way out. 

I just want to talk. I want to change my life, a lonely and coward life. I should enjoy my life but I feel pressure from my job, I feel pressure from my family and I feel pressure from myself. 

First of all, I am not enjoying my job at all. I don’t feel I am competent for the job. Every time I made a mistake I start blaming myself. I felt bad about making mistakes. My performance is the worst in the team. I start getting depressed because of the job. It is affecting me in various aspects of my life including sleeping and eating. To be honest, I don’t enjoy my job for a moment since I joined. It is getting worse. 

I don’t like my life. Sometimes I feel lonely and I feel I need support, the support I need is someone sitting next to me and talking to me. I don’t have many friends and my phone is always quiet. No one is messaging me or calling me for most of the time. What’s worse is I don’t have confidence to meet new friends. Probably because I am gay and I am afraid, inevitably, I will need to talk about boyfriend, girlfriend or relationship topics, if I want to know some friends - this is the topic I have been avoiding for more than a decade.

I love my family and I know they love me too. But I never tell them that I am gay. I have a very traditional family and my parents would never accept me being gay. I feel the pressure from them. They always want me to marry to a woman. Ironically, they have affected me so much that I even tried to change sexual orientation myself. I have not been living with my family for years. They know nothing about my personal life but I never come out to anyone know me or try to find a partner. I feel like I am free but I don’t enjoy the freedom.

238,"I need advice obviously since I’m here. Well I have been in a relationship with a girl for over a year and a few months ago we hit a rough patch where it kinda started to fall apart. However we got through it, fixed what needed to be fixed and went on. After that however I met this girl over snapchat that I connected with very closely with especially on similarities like religion, hobbies, and our main thoughts about things and life. We even have the same enneagram type if that matters to anyone. Well we both ended up catching feelings for each other without ever meeting in person. 

Eventually my girlfriend found out and we came to a conclusion, I had to block her on everything. I never blocked her on Snapchat however and we continued to talk off and on for a little while and eventually I noticed I still had feelings for her and almost completely stopped talking to her. That went on for about two months and within the past week we finally just decided to say screw it and hangout. We have hung out together twice now in the past week doing things I’ve always wanted to do but never got to do them with my girlfriend. I should also add over never felt this comfortable around someone like I do with this girl. We both opened up about things it took me months to tell my current girlfriend. My bestfriend got to witness us together a few nights ago and he said what we had was something extremely special and something I shouldn’t let go of. 

This is where the problem is is I’m not sure who to pick. I have to pick one of them I can’t keep doing this behind the others back. The girl knows that I am taken I might add. I don’t want to breakup with my girlfriend especially after creating many memories with her over the past year and a bit, but I also don’t want to lose this feeling I have about the other girl. Both are very special people to me. I’ve never made physical contact with the other girl and never cheated on my girlfriend. It was a friendly encounter and innocent when we met. If I could just get some help on what you would do if you were in this situation it would really help me.

241,"I’m currently in my teen years, and I hate everything so much. I have no idea if I have depression or not, but every time I think of searching it up, I feel like an overreacting idiot. To start things off, I cry at least maybe 7-8 times everyday, over stupid things. I’m fairly strong in all other departments, but I cry all the time, over stupid things. I cry when I can’t do or fix something, when someone gets mad at me, when I get mad at someone, when I fail to do something, and every fucking time I look in the mirror. The thing I hate about myself the most is probably my looks. I break down in tears every time I look at myself in the mirror, to the point where I even look down when washing my hands. I’m pretty short for my age, I have hands the size of a gnome child (which has stopped me from doing card magic, something I always wanted to do, which I had to drop because of my stupid baby hands), I have a lot of belly fat (but I don’t appear chubby anywhere else for some reason, my eyes are a shitty grey baggy grocery bag looking mess, and my hair, I can’t even start with my hair, I literally have a bad hair life. Last week I was thinking of going to the park, something I enjoy doing, so I tried to fix my hair up a little bit. It ended with me snapping my comb in half, throwing it behind my mirror, crying, and going back to sleep. And the worst part is every time I cry, I feel like a stupid brat, which for some reason makes me cry more. I’m just sick of looking like a stupid crying idiot all the time and I want to be able to control my emotions. Next up, my life. I love my family to pieces, but other than that, I hate almost everyone I know, especially at school. My school is an institute of the most judgemental, annoying people ever. I don’t know what I do wrong, but everyone thinks I’m just this weak stupid ugly dumb embarrassment, and I can’t stand it. I’m not a complete loner or anything, I have about 10-15 friends, but I kind of hate all of them, and I’m pretty sure they hate me back. I feel like some stupid water Pail on everyone’s back, and I really hate myself. I’ve deleted instagram and Snapchat for almost 4 months now, and haven’t talked to anyone also for around the same amount of time. I decided to log back in and maybe talk to someone, because I was feeling down, and I had 0 messages on both socials. To make it worse, I even got kicked out of some group chats. This year also sucked for me because I got glasses, which make me look 10000000x worse than I already do. I’ve been prescribed glasses since the first grade, and had always just thrown them in the bottom of my drawer for about 8 or 9 years. This year, I decided to actually wear them. The amount of looks of disgust and laughs at me were fucking insane. I actually went in to the bathroom in the middle of the day, and silently cried for about 2 and a half minutes, and I almost snapped them in half, but I knew my parents spent $250 dollars on them and I didn’t want to make them upset. And after like 4 months of wearing them, people still treat me like it’s my first day wearing them. Every. Fucking. Day. Why doesn’t anyone understand that I’m wearing these so I don’t go blind or even risk getting lazy eye (my left eye is significantly worse than my right). I’ve also recently realized that my “friends” who copy my homework, steal my glasses and my phone all the time, randomly crush my hands/arms/fingers, made fun of me everyday for dumb things like my Spotify playlist, embarrassed me, drink from my water bottle like it’s theirs, and always make fun of me and disclude me from everything, and even drove me apart from my only female friend by bullying me endlessly, are not my real friends. And I hate myself for just submitting to all of it. I wish I can just tell everyone they’re dead to me, and I hate them, but no. I’ll always just be Mr. Lame Boring Nice Guy who everyone takes advantage of. I’ve also only had one crush in my lifetime, which I never told anyone about, including the person I liked, because I didn’t want to experience rejection, which I knew was gonna happen, because I’m extremely unattractive, even as a friend. I forgot about eventually and I don’t plan on telling anyone, because embarrassment and I get this weird feeling in my chest I don’t like when talking about my emotions, which I actually feel right now writing this post. For the past few months, I’ve done literally nothing but watch TV and play videos. I used to have so many hobbies. I liked puzzles, Rubik’s cubes to be exact, but gave it up because small hands started to become a bit of an issue. I liked card magic, but I gave that up too because small hands, and people made fun of me when they found out I did it. I recently wanted to play soccer again after I quit playing in elementary school, but again, I was made fun of. I really like playing Basketball, but again, I was made fun of (quite a bit more since I’m short). I liked to write little comedy sketches for fun, but my “friends” found it when they stole my phone once, and I was made fun of immensely. Also for whatever reason, I always have this fear that I’m being watched, like my whole life is streaming live, and anyone can tune in to see, which I can’t get over for some reason. All I know is that when I grow up, I want to work in a big hospital, in a safe place, with a huge, bright lobby, and a bunch of little coffee shops and mini fast food places within the hospital. I have a morning or afternoon shift. Near the entrance, on the 2nd or 3rd floor I work as a Sports Medicine specialist (if Sports Medicine doctors work in hospitals, I hope they do). I live in a nice house in a nice, safe neighbourhood, and I’m happy and everything is okay. I want the world to know my name eventually, and I want to be known for something.

I'll keep this short, I am hoping to buy a large plot of land in the future when I hopefully can afford it, about 100 acres. There are several countries that come in to play but narrow down by benefits such as good health care, good education (not like Americas tuition and health care), and overall good living conditions. From all the research I've done I spotted a few countries that match the description but Portugal caught my eye the most though sadly it's not a large country so owning anything near 100 acres is out of the equation. 

My question is, what country do you think would be best for owning a good chunk of land while all those other factors come into play (if there isn't any then narrow down and bring similar ones into the discussion). Hopefully some place which has both winter and warm summers. Also if you are thinking of going the extra mile then throw in the estimated cost of 100 acres as well!",09Jun2020,1

I love them but they're always hating or teasing me about things I like or do even if they're not that bad (I think) like playing video games (not excessively) or collecting figurines or even how I want to style my hair.

 My mom doesn't like that I want to be a screenwriter. She says I have no clear plan, but I already have a pretty decent roadmap of what to do like wanting to get a job and save up to go to a film school, but my mom is insisting that I go to the junior college near me so I can find what I really want to do. She just keeps trying to tell me that it's a hard industry to break into and so I should probably think of something else and stuff like that. 

Another thing she doesn't like is that I bought a gaming PC with my money without asking her if I could and made me return and was constantly pestering me about returning and if I didn't have a new update/call them again about the return she would ground me until I did. But now that I have everything to return it I need her to drive me to FedEx to do that but she's always putting it off. 

She's always putting things off when it comes to me, like when I wanted to schedule therapy it took several months before we got around to it, but if it's my younger brother (12) she does it immediately. She also babies my younger brother (12) constantly giving him control over me and letting him play Fortnite all day and kicking people off the internet. But if I try to bring it up it's always you were like that when you were younger or I'm just bullying him or it's just me trying to control everything and that I'm entitled or no one policed you when you were little. If I get mad at him and yell or get upset she just tells me I'm almost 19 and I need to act like a 19 year old. 

Also, whenever I try talking to my mom about anything that interests me she tells me that I talk too much and that's why she gave me a brother (16) but when I talk to him she complains that we talk too much together.
 
What should I do? I love being around most of them but I'm tired of living here but I can't move out right now but anytime I talk with them about this stuff they just ignore me.

251,"I recently graduated college with a b.s. in sociology and minor in public relations. I was born with a soft spot for people.

 I love connecting with humans from all walks of life and getting to know the good that's in their hearts. More specifically, I have always wanted to work in disadvantaged communities-gathering resources, advocate for the homeless population, work with students to help them succeed. I want to be apart of something bigger. 

ANYWAYS. 

I got a really good ""first big kid"" job as a marketing assistant (Almost a month ago). I like my office, it's a fairly small company so it's small, my co-workers are chill and easy-going. I am gaining a lot of experience in something that I never thought I'd be doing, which is great, I am extremely grateful. 

And I don't hate it. I just don't enjoy the work I am doing. It isn't rewarding and I've always told myself I'd never live my life sitting behind a desk all day. 

So what do I do?!!   
Do I quit after only a month of working there? Do I stay and gain experience?

 I left my bartending job in February to move to a new city. After that I worked at Home Depot for a month before quitting for this job. So I can't really add in my resume I've had TWO different jobs in the past two months?? But then I risk saying I haven't had a job since February

259,"This is going to be a heavy topic. I really need help with this situation because I have no clue how to handle it and take it anymore.

My grandfather (mother's side) has stage 4 kidney disease. Its been a hard uphill battle for well over a year but he is managing his diet and will soon go on dialysis. 

However the problem lies with my parents. The situation has become worse due to us being in close proximity to each other due to the COVID-19 crisis. Let me list several situations that have caused both my parents to go at each other's throats. 

1) My mom asks my dad and I to take time to make food (without salt) for my grandfather. We have no problem with doing so. However, she insists that every other major meal we make for the week, should be double batched so that we can give some to our grandfather. This is also not a problem, but it is frustrating that when even making pastries or one meal plans she asks if it could be modified in anyway and if the batch being made can be given to him (even if the next schedule visit being over two weeks away). 

* By the way this is worded it seems as if my grandfather is alone. However, my grandmother is still alive and capable of making him modified meals. Yes, making a meal for her that will last several days is a way of helping her out, but my grandparents live over 40+ miles away from my house and takes several hours to get there due to traffic. It is not a journey that can completed in half a day; it is a whole day deal. She does not seem to understand it takes a lot of both of us and acts flippant about it. (more about this in issue three).

That was the main issue. Now here are the issues from both sides of the party: 

2.) My mom snaps about every little thing. Minor things. Like, leaving a dirty dish in the sink for one second and turning away to pick up utensils only to have her snap and accuse you of not cleaning up after yourself. Or screaming that we left a salted meal at my grandfather's house (we did not) the last time we visited them. I understand she is under stress and flipping out (approached her about this and she adamantly denies it), but cannot comprehend why she is not acknowledging it is stressing her out and causing her to lash out. Sometimes I agree on my dad on something, and she completely loses it at me saying I am just like him and a horrible person. 

For example: my grandfather was wondering if his medication would lead to future problems with his kidneys and despite being capable of calling his doctor up himself and asking, asked my mother to do it for him. I asked her why he could not do it himself, and if he had questions could call my mother afterwards (she has experience in the medical field) and if he still had questions, ask my mother to complete a three way call with the doctor. She did not speak to me for two days after I pointed out he was using her. I understand that my grandfather is dealing with a lot but I feel there are certain extents as to what my mother can do. 

3) My dad has a horrible relationship with his family (if you like I can make a post about that as that is whole other story that needs advice). Long story short, his mother is an entitled, selfish \*itch who hates my mom and hates me for being half devil spawn. As a result he drinks...a lot. Sometimes he gets drunk and becomes verbally abusive. His dad (my paternal grandfather) passed away last September due to complications from the Zika virus and my dad did not really have much of a chance to morn him. My dad is not exactly the most...well...expressive or comforting person. However, in his own way he tries to lessen the burden on my mom. He can act like a complete jerk sometimes but his heart is in the right place. He also is dealing with the stress of owning a small business in Post-Covid-19 and is sprouting a much shorter fuse than he usually would. However, I will admit he is a bit cruel in how he mockingly calls my grandfather 'Poor H--"" and is acting a bit like a prick when he snaps at my mom after she snaps at him. 

He is also pissed about driving my mother to and from my grandfather's place. Both my parents have cars and can drive. However, my mother cannot drive at night (she has absolutely horrible night vision) and this is her excuse for having my dad cart her to and fro. Despite my dad pointing out that she could drive to my grandparents, stay the night, and drive back the next day, she still refuses to take his advice and uses up his recovery weekends to go to my grandparents. I understand this is a sacrifice and should be done as an obligation as a loving husband, but I can see he is getting frustrated. 

&amp;#x200B;

Because of these issues, both my parents have been attacking one another and getting into screaming matches. They had a horrid argument tonight and my dad screamed he wants a divorce this is over and that my mom can move out of the shitty state we are in with me (I've been pointing out to them for the past year that retirement taxes in the state will be horrid and that they will not be able to survive or financially sustain themselves because of all the damn handout programs).  He has also mentioned divorce in earlier arguments. 

Any advice would be appreciated. I love my grandfather and want to treasure the time I have left with him. However, it is hard to deal with the stress of his condition on top of my parents fighting as I try to be (and often failing) to be the mediator.

262,"So a group of people I've been communicating with on Facebook has decided they would like to host a Black Lives Matter protest/solidarity walk in my hometown, a tiny thing in middle America with less than 10,000 people and probably a 90 percent white population. I think it's important to stand up in these times, so my gut answer was ""I'll be there"", and I'd like to help get it set up. 

After considering it, though, I realized the people in the group, including me, are pretty representative of that percentage of white people. After that, it occurred to me that I don't know that many talking points, and I'm not sure if this is actually a good idea. 

Here's how I see it, I guess.

Pros: 
We speak out against a long history of racism in this country.
We help show people of color in a tiny, largely Trump supporting town that there are people willing to support them from their city, and who believe their experience is different from ours.
We call out the stagnant beliefs of a lot of people from our hometown as racist, hopefully at least giving them a chance to hear other perspectives.

Cons:
Again, run by a bunch of white folk, so I fear those other perspectives might be lost or misrepresented
To be honest, I'm not sure we would have specific demands. It would be more a show of support than a protest with directing.



I still feel like it's worth doing, but if we do I want to do it right. Any advice is helpful, thanks.",09Jun2020,1
264,"my boyfriend and i have been dating for eight months. it's really complicated to explain our relationship because we built a really strong and healthy bond really quickly and were already so advanced in our relationship nearly two months in. we've talked about everything and we know each other better than anybody else and we've already got plans for getting married. so needless to say i don't doubt the strength of our connection and nothing would pull me away from him. but lately, and ever since it came up when we first started dating, the thought of him drinking and getting high with his friends makes me so sick and an emotional trainwreck. before we were dating he was an avid alcoholic and smoked quite a lot. the circle he hangs out with and his sister's negative habits have influenced him heavily. so when we started dating and i wasn't into any of that stuff, he put a damper on those activities. however, he's fully honest with me anytime he indulges in his vices. i understand where he's coming from, he has no emotional outlet because his father has forced him into such a corner of how he needs to act and hold himself that he never learned how to deal with his emotions in a healthy way. so instead he finds them at the bottom of a bottle or the burnt end of a cigarette. his fathers terrible influence is a whole other story though. anyways my main question is that when he's with me, i have no problem with him drinking, smoking, or getting high. but the thought of him doing those things with his friends (even though he's smart about it) just irks me beyond belief and i wish i could just demand him to stop. but that's not fair and i know it. so i guess i'm just looking for people to either give me some advice on where to place my feelings, if i should talk to him about it, or just to put me in my place.

265,"So on Friday, I (35m) received a text message from my mom (60) that my stepdad (60) told her he was going to kill himself in 30 days. For background, he is a generous and good guy, and has been in my life since I was about 14. But, he’s also may have Asperger’s, has a very thin social filter if any at all, and he is very impulsive. In addition, he has a sciatic nerve problem in his back for many years which causes him debilitating pain, which gets worse at night. He has has surgeries and a pain management implant (kind of like a tens unit inside his body) and nothing has done much to relieve his pain and as a result they haven’t been out in the evening in years because he needs to sit in a recliner or lay down or the pain overwhelms him. My mom has said this sciatica is a large part of his depression. In the past he’s coped better, but he’s slowly lost the ability to cope. The sciatica has cost him his job and he is on disability. Before he lost his job, he had been on meds for depression, and stopped taking them because he felt it dumbed him down and affected his ability to do his job. 

At any rate, she sent me the email he sent her informing her of this, and she told me today that he sent her the email 10-15 minutes after they had a small spat wherein he said something that pissed her off and she went somewhere to clear her head and didn’t want to argue. It’s probably relevant to say that earlier this year, they bought a house near my wife and son and me, whereas they had lived for a few years about 45 minutes away from us and wanted to be closer to us and our son. This process was long and painful. I’m a RE agent, and they asked me to help them find a house. I respectfully declined for many reasons, one being that I knew it would be like this because my stepdad can’t make a decision. They went through multiple contracts for good homes and backed out of all of them, and when they finally had to close on their old house, they had no place to live—so I had to decline their request to stay with us too, knowing it would end up being a longer period than they said it would (I was correct in this). 

That is relevant because I have this feeling that my stepdad is serious about killing himself, and insisted on moving them closer to us so that when he finally does it, she’s fifteen minutes away from us. I feel like it’s more than a cry for help from him—it’s a warning to get her life in order because he’s going to be gone and they have no life insurance. He even mentioned to my mom in his email that “maybe you can live with Jason at his house.” At first I thought maybe the email was a disproportionate reaction to their little spat that day, but the more I think about it, the more it seems like he really will do it if he can’t or won’t get help. He’s incredibly stubborn and has refused to get psychiatric help before. He has verbally mentioned suicide many times but he has a way about him where he will say things completely deadpan and sometimes not mean them, but after almost 22 years I cannot fucking tell sometimes. Anyway, he did agree to get psychiatric help but can’t get in with a doc until like three days until he said he would kill himself. Encouragingly, he’s acknowledged he needs meds. 

Fast forward through the weekend, it’s my wife’s birthday and he and mom were going to come over this week to celebrate with us. This had been planned since last week, but after hearing about his suicide warning, we figured that would be off because...well, how could it be on? Then my mom texts me today asking what day we want them to come over, and we nailed down a day and my wife and I have no fucking clue how to act around my stepdad, knowing what we know (for clarity, he gets injections that temporarily help with his pain, and he gets one tomorrow so plans on coming despite the sciatic nerve pain). He’s acting fine on the surface at least, like nothing is wrong. But there is now an elephant in the room, and we don’t know whether to address it and possibly ruin the evening for every one of us, or ignore the issue completely and don’t bring it up. I am going to speak to my counselor about this to help me process this situation and my own feelings about it, but seriously, how do we have a normal evening with them when my stepdad has, not threatened, but *warned* my mom he is going to take his own life? I’m also angry at him for this, the way he told her, how he would leave her with little money and a ton of debt, and if he is simply asking for help, how he is asking for it. But I can’t really tell him how shitty all that is, nor can I even tell my mom how I feel because I can only imagine how she must be feeling right now. So, how in the world do we act around a person who has warned my mom he will take his own life soon, and is otherwise acting like everything is normal? 

Fake PS: I am not cool with the situation as it is and am short of freaking out here. In 2010 my bunk mate in Iraq put his rifle in his mouth and killed himself while I was sleeping and never showed any signs of feeling as though he desired to do it, so I’ve felt guilt and had nightmares over that in the years since that I don’t even talk about with my wife.

274,"So, almost every night, me and the squad join up to play Final Fantasy Dissidia NT. We always have a lot of fun and use the time to bond and talk about shit.

Generally in fighting games, I pick characters that are defensive (Kamlanaut, Kain, Cloud of Darkness, Kuja, just to name a few), usually characters with few approach options. The only rush down character I play is Garland, which ironically I'm the strongest with. Defense is just my playstyle and how I enjoy the game I'm playing, so sometimes my matches take a while because of the nature of these characters.

I understand that some people just say things that may or may not be hurtful when they are angry, but recently he's been really competitive in matches with me. I hate upsetting people and my biggest fear is hurting someone I care about. 

In some matches he gets really heated and I can tell he gets really upset. I understand, nobody likes to lose, so it makes sense. But some of the things he says sometimes are hurtful and I don't know what to say, if anything. After some of the things he said I felt awful and questioned myself if I was actually being toxic, even though I knew I had done nothing wrong.

I understand that not everyone enjoys playing against defensive characters, as I just enjoy playstyles that revolve heavily on punishing your opponents when they make mistakes, it's just how I like to play. 

I don't turtle in my games, I'm an opportunistic fighter, not an offensive one.

The thing is though, some of the characters I play have little approach options. So when that comes up, I don't know what to say because the character I'm playing doesn't have very many tools in their kit to play offensively. 

When the match is over though, he's polite and says ""gg's"" back to me even if he has to bite his tongue when he says it.

I understand that sometimes you may have to say something to someone that they may not like sometimes, and I'm fully prepared if I need to speak up. 

I also understand that everyone makes mistakes and that sometimes people say things they don't mean, and this just might be the case. I really care about him and I don't like to see him upset, especially when he sounds defeated and fatigued after some of our matches.

Outside of our matches, he's a great guy and he's fun to hang around with. He'll even make an effort to say or do something that will make me smile when he knows I'm upset. However when we play matches on Dissidia, he can get competitive and might end up saying something he doesn't really mean.

275," 

Should I drop one of my friends that I’ve known since middle school? This is gonna be a long one so I suggest taking a seat. I’ve known this person since 8th grade. We were not close but I still considered her a good friend. Over the summer break we became closer and had fun in 8th grade together. However, she developed an eating disorder and discovered she had depression. Of course, me and many other friends were there for her tried to help her as best as we could, even though we were just kids. She kept getting worse, not doing her work, and missing days of school. She was also harming herself. At one point she tried to commit suicide. I still tried to help and support them the best I could. I didn’t want to lose her as friend. After that, she promised to get better and I believed her, while continuing to support. When we entered our freshmen year of high school, she was doing pretty good. She was doing her work and came to school. She was talking about her plans for the future and was looking on the bright side. It made me happy. But before long, she was hopping back into her old habits of not doing her work and having bad thoughts and I was constantly worried about her. She also started to go out with upperclassmen, thinking that it would be fun to mess with them. Me and others tried to talk to her about her behave and when we did, she would turn to self pity (ex. “I’m sorry guys I know I’m a terrible person” or “Do you hate me? I would hate me too. “I don’t why I’m like this, I’m so horrible you guys probably all hate me”). She also did things that would hurt me and our friend’s feeling and act irrationally. Such as her putting us down and laughing it off as a joke when we got upset, she’s the type of person to get upset if you forget her birthday and will test you to see if you truly know but doesn’t feel the need to remember other’s birthday. This was when I began questioning our friendship. I still believed that I could help them though and stayed by her side. This continued on for a bit and for a while again, she cooled down. It felt like a nice little break. In the beginning of 10th grade, she continued this behavior and me and some of our other friends thought we should talk to her about it and it did not go well. She was very upset and questioned how we could plan a thing like this against her, but we honestly did it with the purpose to help her see how the way she acted negatively impacted us. The way she reacted made me realized that it was time for me to reach out for professional help. I would suggest trying to talk to her into going to school counselor or a trusted adult since she was limited on options (for personal reasons). But it was no use, she never wanted to consult in trusted adults that were obviously trying to help, and many times she seemed annoyed by them but she never had a problem asking me if I really liked her and talking about how sad she had been lately. This deeply upset me and I didn’t know how to feel. When school closed because of quarantine, it allowed me to about all of this and reevaluate our friendship. The problem is though, I still care about her deeply and want the best for her. I enjoy her company. I don’t want to end on bad terms and I don’t want her to think I hate her. We also share many of the same friends and I’m worried about how this would change our group dynamic. I’ve been thinking about dropping her as a friend since the end of April and it’s something I think about constantly. But at the same, I don’t want to leave and ruin everything for everyone, including for myself.

I just came out of junior year and it's been the worst year of my life. I thought I was done. I thought ""finally, hell is over. I've made it to the finish line. It's all down hill from here. Time to relax and get my senioritus on."" Nope.

I came outta that school year, and 2019 with high hopes. I don't need to comment anymore on what a load of-



Next, the whole school year, I struggled with grades. My own fault I know, but my dad was unforgiving. He made sure to only say ""fix your grades"" the whole year to me. Nothing else, unless it was the routine ""by, I love you."" We've talked about it. It took time, and will take time for me to heal.

It took me a while to be excited for my fourth and final season of marching Band, because of all of the work, and minimal payoff I had but eventually, I got really hyped up. That is, until I found out that even after the band director told me that I was among the top few he was considering for trumpet section leader, I didn't even get a small leadership position like historian. Despite the fact that I got a smaller leadership role last year, I would have expected at least another role this year.

I still am excited for marching band, but I feel like I've been kicked back down. 

We've had 4 kids commit suicide, 2 of which I knew, one kid die of brain cancer(I didn't know), and 2 girls drowned. One of which I knew, and had to sit by in class. I thought last year's streak of one was excessive. Admittedly, the cancer patient, and one of the suicides from this year were at the middle school literally next door to the HS, but because of how it's set up freshmen go to the middle shool.

In total, that's 7 deaths, and I knew 3. I get I don't have a reason to be sad because even though I knew them, I wasn't friends with any of them, and had barely talked to some of them. Idk why it still hurts tho.

It's been a crappy year altogether. I thought I was finally getting over my depression, but it just comes in waves. I'm not suicidal, but I definitely don't want to go through another year like this. I can't take it. 

Especially after not getting the leadership position I fought so hard for, and sacrificed so much for, I just want to be done. I'm so exhausted in every way, but mentally, and emotionally in particular.

I know this sounds very pathetic, and kinda stupid. But to me- I guess it's just because if where I am in life that this all feels huge. just don't want to go back with this mindset. I want to conquer highschool happily. I know the whole ""look for the little things. They're small, but they exist."" 

I have been doing my best to be so positive, but it gets so hard when every time I look up, something covers the sun, and it gets really hard to see the light around me when there is a missive cloud blocking out most of the sun.

Again, I know this doesn't come close to other stuff here. But I really need a way to be excited, or at least not dread the upcoming year, and the summer with it.",09Jun2020,1
278,"
I (28 F) was in a serious relationship with my ex for seven years. We started dating in college and were together until last year. Though we had our ups and downs and a somewhat toxic phase during college, we eventually really got into a groove, were very happy, and lived together for 2.5 years. I felt very secure in the relationship, even felt sort of superior at times to other relationships with how ""good"" we were. In hindsight, I think we got into too much of a routine with not enough excitement, but TBH I blame him for a lot of that/making no effort to plan anything for us or do anything to foster the relationship and make it grow. 

Anyway, last year he totally blindsided me during an argument, and calmly told me that in our entire relationship, he always felt that i liked him more than he liked me, that something never clicked for him, he’s happy but thinks he would be happier with someone else, and over the next few days gave a long list of things he basically didn’t like about me or had resented for years. This included not liking my parents, my struggles with anxiety, me not wanting to have sex enough, us doing the same thing everyday, and stupid stuff like not liking the same music or me not liking music in general enough. 

He ended up shortly after dating a girl from his work that i had been suspicious of (that’s what started the argument i mentioned earlier.) i also later found out he made out with someone years earlier while we were supposedly on a break, which wouldn’t be a big deal i guess, but he had made it a point at one point to tell me his “lips had never touched another human being since he met me.”  He never shed a tear while dumping me and I just generally felt like thrown out trash. It made it so much worse feeling like I'd been living a lie. I had thought we were happy, when really he'd been lukewarm about me and doubting the relationship for seven years. 

Fast forward to now. I am in a relationship with a wonderful man. I love him so much and genuinely believe he loves me, and I'm experiencing things that I thought ppl in other relationships were lying about.. ie having your bf express his love for you and doing really nice things for you etc. We are in love, moving in together soon, and I feel really lucky. 

The only thing is I have such severe trust issues now that I never had before. I constantly fear that he's bullshitting me, and doesn't really feel that strongly about me. That I could think he's this amazing person, but later find out he was doing shit behind my back, like my ex. I would have bet my life that my ex never lied to me, so to find out he did... Shattered my perception of the world. I no longer trust my ability to judge someones character. I fear that I'm being manipulated, used, or that my bf will eventually realize how bored he is and end things. How do I move on from these feelings? I'm completely over my ex, but the bitterness and fear are very much still here.",09Jun2020,1

I know someone, who doesn't really like me, lets call him Paul. Last night, Paul received texts calling him racial slurs, insulting him, referencing events that only a handful of people would know about, and calling a mutual friend (lets call her Amanda), sloppy seconds, and that I had had sex with her. The person texting him, who I will call Jerry, claimed to be me, although he has a phonenumber from another state (Florida). A handful of people started contacting me saying, ""Shut the f*** up, why would you say these things!"". I received these on my actual number. I was able to make Amanda understand how it could not be me. Amanda, Paul (who believed me, but was still skeptical), and I, started a groupchat to attempt to contact Jerry. Jerry never responded to this groupchat, but instead directly messaged me. He said, ""I'll stop and I stay anonymous"". We messaged back and forth. I attempt to find a reason, so that I could find out whomever I have wronged. He said that I never hurt him, and that, ""I'm just a pawn"". I asked who was telling him to do this, but he never told me. Amanda suspected that someone that we know is juat using a fake number. I sent snapshots of all of the conversation to Paul and Amanda. Paul claimed, ""Since the person wanted to stay anonymous, it must be you [me]!"" I'm not a nice or moral person, but I would never do this. His argument is completely baseless. Paul proceeded to insult me and threaten to call the cops on me. Paul is generally a kind-hearted person, and I doubt he would ever make all of this up to harm me.

He won't listen to me as if he's the older sibling, he even threatened me that i must be scared of him. We are in the same room so obviously we get into a fight everytime for a reason, he won't get his dishes into the sink and when i ask him to take the dishes he will say later so i just took his dishes into the sink by myself and the worse thing is that there are any foods on the bed and it's filthy disgusting especially when he eats sweet foods, i always get bitten by the ants because of the food pieces on the bed, what a dependent person. He hold his poop until our room smells unpleasant, i told him to wipe his ass because the room smells horrible and he said that i need to shut up and mind my own business considering the fact that he didn't smell his own poop, is he really that busy playing roblox? Also, he always get mad at my parents when they discipline him

If he ask something that I didn't know about, he kept telling me noob and stupid and apparently it's very annoying, also if i don't reply to him he will ask the same question over and over again. I raised my voice because it's annoying to hear the same question and he told me that ""why am i mad and he would punch me if i was mad"" TBH i nearly killed him in person because i threw plates at him and his head bleed, that's where i started avoiding punching him or get into the fight but i can't handle it with his bad attitude so eventually i could punch him but not too strong though.

He keeps touching my things even my own cellphone where he posted some embarrassing stuffs about me, i told my parents about it and his behavior towards me but he didn't change at all, he's pathetic behavior is still there. I would just want him to disappear in my life...

I have an anxiety and insomnia so i get annoyed everytime he plays his shitty musics during midnight (he's still playing the computer though) because it prevents me from sleeping. It was very loud so i asked him nicely if he could stop playing so i could sleep early but he refused to, he got mad at me so i end up sleeping at 4am and regularly waking up at 8am.

Basically what the title says. Over quaruntine me and my sister have gotten much closer thanks to smoking weed a lot together and getting into the same shows (thank you Star Wars and aatla).

I also love to paint, and when I have a new project I typically spend a couple of hours on it. Lately my sister has been complaining that I never hang out with her anymore, but honestly I kind of want more space.

She’ll normally come into my room and just lay down on my bed w me and start talking, which is fine, it’s just sometimes I’m doing stuff I’d rather be alone for (like drawing)

This has is especially prominent when we smoke together, mainly bc I’ve recently been either wanting to sleep or smoke alone, and shes been a little hurt by it.

It also is made worse bc I feel like I’m the only person she can confide in. She tends to bottle up her issues and explode in fits of anger at people, and while I’ve told her she needs therapy I also think it’s important that in the meantime she can talk to me so she can get her emotions out.

293,"I'm 18 and I want to be a psychotherapist one day. There are two routes: studying and working in social services, or studying psychology at a uni and working in the mental health. I've always wanted to study psychology, but I kind of lost my interest as I got older, but I still thought I needed to get into the uni because that was the ""only way"" to become a psychotherapist one day. 

A week ago, I realised that it isn't. The social services route could possibly be four years (the entry exam is super hard, only 2% get in, and it takes place once a year + the studies take two years longer) faster but I might not reach the best possible therapist salary, but that's ok. So taking that route makes so much sense, right? 

Well, my friend told me today that she got accepted to studying psychology. I'm the hard working student, she isn't, I got the good grades, she didn't. My heart instantly jumped as if it mattered. It turned out that she got accepted to a paid course and I was so relieved for some reason. 

Why do I care? Haven't I made the best decision I could? Why do I still have the feeling that I'm doing something that I shouldn't?

Edit: a couple of clarifications. 

In here Finland, education is free.

So I got jealous for my friend because deep down, it was still my dream for many years and the possibility of someone just made it happen on an accident really scared me.

And I'm not worried about debt. The job is the same. The average psychotherapist salary is 3800€. So I just think that if I go the uni route, I can get it to 4000 while the social services route might only give me 3600. Both are above average salaries in Finland. I'm just not sure if the extra 400€/month is worth throwing 4+ years extra to waste.

And about uni giving me more possibilities. I don't know. I'm only interested in therapy and helping people and that's only like two of the six years I would be in the uni. Sure, if I get sick of people, I can just change my career like it's nothing because the psychologist degree really opens the doors.",09Jun2020,2

296,"Hi. I’m 13 years old. I’m turning 14 this month. As long as I can remember, I’ve loved one thing, and one thing only: performing. When I stand on that stage, that’s the only time I feel truly happy. I feel full. I feel ecstatic. 

So, after lots of thought, I determined that being a Kpop idol is, in fact, my true dream. 

First off, I’m korean. So it’s not quite impossible, if you ignore the fact that I live in the states. 
And I’m pretty bad at dancing but I’m decent at singing. But one thing I’ve heard over and over is that when I stand on stage, I ooze charisma. 

There hasn’t been a single day in the past 6 years that I haven’t stood in front of the mirror and pretended to be on a stage performing, or started dancing. (Even thought I’m pretty bad, I love dancing and wish to improve). As embarrassing as it is, I’ll constantly stand in my bathroom and pretend to be auditioning for Produce 101 or some other survival show. I’ll pretend that I’m giving a speech to my fans in a large stadium, breaking down in tears and sobbing as I realize my dream has finally been fulfilled. 

I’ve always been told, “chase your passions”, and “don’t let anything stop you from doing what you love” by my parents and adults. But my parents, the very people who told me to chase my dreams, are so incredibly against my dream. Ironic, right? 
It’s not that they’re against it, they’re AGAINST IT. I’ve gotten into multiple screaming matches with my mom that ended with me in tears and us not talking for multiple days. 

Recently, a though popped in my mind. 

“What if I ran away to Korea and became a trainee?”

And yes, I know how stupid that sounds. 

A 14 year old, running away alone? She would get caught before even reaching the airport. 

But if I actually managed to get on that flight, and I landed in Incheon International Airport, then what? 

If it worked, I would need to find a place to stay, how to make money, how to find a place to practice dancing and singing. Then send in an audition, and wait for the results. 

Ideally, I would get into some big name company and receiving the good news I would reach out to my parents who would be proud that I achieved my dreams, then debut in a group that achieves international success. But I know that will NEVER happen... unless?

That’s where I’m reaching out to Reddit. I feel so lost and alone in an unsupportive environment. So if you’re gonna tell me I’m being dumb or unreasonable, please leave now. I just want someone to give me genuine advice on what to do, and maybe someone to tell me how to survive if I make it to Korea and how to get there. I might sound like an immature, stupid, angsty teen who doesn’t know what they want in life yet. 

But I KNOW. I just know that this is what I want to do. It’s what I love and have loved since the day I was born. My mom always tells me, it’s the hormones. I’m too young. But I don’t think so. I know that I want to be an idol.

297,"I moved to a big city about 5 years ago. My mom is a 3hr flight + 4hr drive away so I visit her once a year. I’m turning 30 and my mom is nearing 60.

I loved living in my current city pre-2020. I’ve made some friends, no best friend but I have people I can talk to even with everything locked down. I’ve loved being able to explore this city: the restaurants and food festivals and outdoor events and everything there is to offer. Where I grew up lots of kids in my high school dreamed of moving here, and I was lucky enough to be able to get a job that helped me relocate. But I always knew there was a timeline on this life. I knew that if anything ever happened to my mom or to me that I’d have to move back. I just thought it’d be 10-20 years down the road.

But now this virus has me all fucked up. I miss my mom. I‘m sad that I won’t be able to visit her this year. I’m worried that if anything were to happen to her that I’m so far away I can’t take care of her. I’m worried if anything were to happen to my own health that I don’t have anyone here that would take care of me. I had a small health scare earlier this year that made me think about how I don’t have anyone that could drive me home from the hospital. And I’m asexual or whatever so I’m never going to get married or have a partner that can take care of me.

I’m trying to remind myself about why I left my previous city: I was bored there, the weather was terrible, most of my friends had moved away, I wanted my life to be an adventure. But then I look at their Covid numbers and they’ve had 0 new cases for several days, while cases here are climbing again. I think about the fact I’d be able to visit my mom whenever I want. I’d be able to buy a home if I ever wanted one (I’ll never be able to afford a home in my current city). I wouldn’t be able to live the city life anymore, but maybe I could adapt and start doing more at-home projects. I could have a garden or a garage workshop or something.

I wouldn’t be moving until next year at the earliest but whether or not I plan to leave is going to impact other decisions I have to make right now. I just don’t know how to make this decision when the future is so uncertain and my whole perspective on life was able to be changed so abruptly. I’m just so scared of everything. I’m scared of the second wave hitting and everything going to hell again. I have such an overwhelming feeling of “I want to go home” but I don’t know where home actually is.

I guess the advice I’m hoping for is how I can make this decision, what factors should I be weighing, what things I should be considering to help decide.

I also wouldn’t mind hearing from other people who live far from their parents but still keep in touch and visit them. Do you expect you’ll have to move back some day when your parents get older? What do you do if your parents need help and you can’t be there? Do you ever regret moving far away from them?",09Jun2020,1

acquaintances because I don’t like being on bad terms with people.

317," I've  quit now for two weeks and want to continue for 2 more, so a month in  total, and I do realise that right now the withdrawal symptoms makes me  worse than when I used to smoke. The worst part is that I question myself alot about if quitting will really help me to be way more  clearer, motivated and focused than when smoking. Don't know if this is a  factor but i'm 22 yo.

I take  Vyvanse(40mg) and I used to mix it with weed and the results were  amazing, I could easily clear my head of thoughts and ""meditate"",  motivation came right away and it was easier to focus on a task and blur  out everything around me.

Some  benefits I found that made me stay on weed were that : Boredom was  almost non-existant, thinking rationally about my anxiety/calming myself  was super easy, I could turn off the chain of thoughts in my head which  helped with focusing, sleeping and overthinking and sex lasted longer. I  didn't really see any bad effects for me, maybe because I smoked mainly  at night to help with sleeping and relaxation. In general I felt normal  (or neurotypical).

I know that  weed in general isn't really such a great thing to consume, especially  to try to self-medicate, but I didn't really see any bad side-effects  other than being anxious while smoking in the day (mainly because I  can't smoke where I live). But maybe it's just the ""addiction"" speaking.

I  didn't have any real reason to stop other than because I just decided  randomly I should stop. I know that i'd probably be better off without  it though but is it really that bad ? If I use it responsibly and I can  see benefits from it without any bad side-effects, can it be somehow  good for me ? I also tend to either not smoke alot or get used to a  certain dose so that I can have the effects but not the high because I  hate feeling high to the point where I see myself as a dumbass.

If  some of you have any research on how weed interacts with an ADD brain,  advices with coping with the withdrawal or any suggestions on  pharmaceutical drugs that could help i'd be glad to hear about that.",09Jun2020,4
318,"Greetings fellow humans. I hope all is well for you all so far during these trying times.

&amp;#x200B;

**TL,DR: I cannot \[internally\] stand anime &amp; 'actual american weeabu' notions but I don't mind watching anime only with friends as I'm socializing with them. Group of best friends want to go to Japan \[later on\]. Best friends are aware my stand on said notions and are still best buds with me regardless of what I decide for said trip. I don't know if I should go with them and be \[internally\] incompatible with the Japanese cultures &amp; anime or decline a trip that would let me hang out with them &amp; experience something different.**

&amp;#x200B;

I have an oddball scenario that has occurred recently and I'm finding myself with some doubts.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here's some context in a respectful nutshell:**

I have been friends with a group of best friends for nearly over a decade and all has been well with all of us, through all the thick of thins. There's nothing that's gonna separate us as we see each other as brothers. Anyways, some of them like anime a lot and they are aware that I don't give 2 hoots about anime. Just like I don't care much about sports, I'll socially watch them cartoons but only with them to have more to hang out with them. Occasionally I may laugh with them about how ridiculous anime cartoons can get and what not, but I don't watch anime with my buddies with the same interest(s) in mind.

**The brewing scenario:**

They've decided that they suddenly want to go to Japan in a few years for whatever it'll offer for a small trip. It'll be a for a couple of weeks and it'll cost a pretty penny....for each person.

Deep down, I'm trying to achieve some long term financial goals and the idea for saving up for a un-relatable trip with a group that could potentially be summarized in a youtube video doesn't entice me to go with them. However, the notion of just socializing with them and ignoring everything else is more enticing.

&amp;#x200B;

**The internal problems:**

Most of my reasons of disliking the anime culture &amp; actual 'american weeaboos' can be summarized within this subreddit post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/b9keuv/i\_dont\_like\_anime/](https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/b9keuv/i_dont_like_anime/)

But there's more:

* Over-sexualizing characters and purposely designing characters to look \[and/or act\] like children.
* Anime are generally not standalone, like say movies and stuffs, where you cannot merely pick up, go, and understand on the fly.
* No value of anime knowledge except for conversations.
* Huge negative stigma regarding with anime, otaku, weeaboo, etc notions. Thus I cringe a lot, including the idea of those maid cafes.

**Potential outcomes:**

My buddies are not worried about what decision I'll take:

If I go, the only things I get to experience is the foods, strange &amp; comical things that my buddies will do, and socialization, all at the cost of a pretty penny. But throughout the trip there, I'll be internally cringing and feeling out of place. I may feel like an extra and upset that I could just have a more local experience with my buddies.

If I don't go, I'll miss out on said experiences, but I'll save up more money for my financial goals and don't have to worry about feeling out of place &amp; cringing a lot.

*I'm aware that I have no obligation to go or not to go through them, but my perspectives have given me a conflict of interest and was wondering for your perspectives.*

***What would you suggest for me to do?***

Thanks in advance.",09Jun2020,1
319,"Hey guys, I recently graduated from college with a Film production diploma. Ever since I was in high school I wanted to study film but in the back  of my mind I also wanted to go into the military. When I was in my senior year of high school I realized that the military was my calling, that I needed to do it. Unfortunately I needed my citizenship to apply so that meant a five year wait. I knew then that my parents would literally have a heart attack if I told them I wasn't going to study after high school and instead work part time until I gain my citizenship, not to mention that they wouldn't support a career in the military. 

So I went to college because I wanted to learn film, so i thought, why not do it while I wait for my citizenship?  I went to college and kept my plans to join the armed forces to myself, I didn't want to tell my parents until I had my citizenship and it was decided that I was joining the military. 

During the last year in film I kinda forgot about the military, I was doing well and so I told my parents my plans about a career in it in the future, bad IDEA!  So forward to the present. I graduated with honors, my parents couldn't be happier. A week ago I was reminded of my goal to joint he military and become a pilot. So, finally I decided to tell my parents. 

All my life I thought my mom would support me but I was wrong. My dad didn't argue with me, he wanted to become a pilot in his youth but couldn't so he was excited for me. My mom though, she took it really badly. She asked me why I changed all of a sudden, why I was making such an immature decision? Why am I throwing a perfectly good career down the drain, I studied film mind you, the most unstable job you could have. I knew straight away that this had nothing to do with money or job security and everything to do with my gender and what others will think. She kept going on and on about what the family will think? Seeing me, a girl, join the military as a pilot. She tried to mask it of course by saying stuff like, I'm too old (I'm only 23), I'm not serious about it, I don't know how much serious than joining the military you can get. 

I know a lot of people will say, just ignore your mom and cut her off but the thing is that I love my mom, I have a  good relationship with her, she's practically my best friend. I don't want to disappoint her, I really don't but her not supporting me has made me miserable. I know I will still do it regardless but I also know I'll constantly think about her while I'm there and be even more miserable when she doesn't show up to my graduation from military college. 

So if anyone has gone through a similar situation, what is your advice?",09Jun2020,1

Quick background info: I'm a female teenager who is pretty sure they're straight (this post will explain the 'pretty sure' part. Onto my issue: I've found myself with many tv shows I watch to become obsessed with a character in the tv show to a great extent. Every character I've obsessed over has been female, but the obsession doesn't seem sexually charged. Some of the characters I've been obsessed with include Jade West from Victorious, Izzy Stevens fro Grey's Anatomy, Santana Lopez from Glee, Emily Prentiss from Criminal Minds, and Hanna Marin from Pretty Little Liars. The obsession part is that I get involved in the show solely because of the character, and even read fanfictions once the show is over specifically about the character. The thing is, I'm not attracted to them. I wouldn't kiss them or anything, none of their romantic scenes have turned me on; it seems I want to *be them* more than *be with them.* What I mean by this is that I start to copy the character's attitudes and even catchphrases. I morph them into my personality, but after a few weeks, I forget about them. Do I just have a low self esteem/no concrete personality or do other people struggle with this as well.",09Jun2020,2

326,"I’m just gonna put the tl;dr up here. 

TL;DR: I have a friend who constantly gossips, manipulates, and victimizes herself, and never listens to my problems. How do I break up with her?


I (18F) have been friends with this person (17F) for four, maybe five years now. we’re both nearing our senior year of high school. I’m pretty sure she’s a toxic friend, but I feel really awful for putting that label on her.

Ever since a year or two into our friendship, she constantly has “boy problems” most of which is her creating drama with guys, which then leads to her being “heartbroken.” She also is a huge gossip and loves to gossip to me about how awful some of her other friends are. Even though I haven’t met any of her other friends, I have a gut feeling that she’s talking about me behind my back to them too. All of this drama she constantly creates herself and then victimizes herself when people get upset with her or try to prove her wrong. She comes crying to me explaining how they could do such a thing to her, even when she started it in the first place. 

In addition to drama, she always complains about everything. She thinks the stuff I’m into is “weird” or “too geeky.” She always has something to new to complain about, and expects me to take it and listen and give constant advice. But when I want to vent about my problems, she ignores it or changes the subject back to her.

I’ve had enough of this and I want to drop her but I don’t know how. A part of me says to keep being friends with her, but the rest of me is screaming to let her go. She’s caused 90% of my anxiety problems and I hate to text her. But whenever I ignore her, she tweets on Twitter about how many fake friends she has. She (I think) called me out in one of her posts saying “I thought you were my friend. Friends listen to each other’s problems. You know who you are”.

So there’s this kid at my school who’s like a year younger than me. He hits me up on Instagram like “yo bro what’s good”. This was weird because the last time I talked to this kid, him and his homies were roasting me for not hitting puberty like a truck. 

But anyway I try to put that aside and talk. We have a pretty good conversation. I found out he’s a rapper (and he’s a good one at that). It was all going smoothly but eventually we started running out of topics and it just turned to him sending me videos of his raps asking me to rate them. And after I declined to keep doing that (which I felt terrible about) he just kinda wouldn’t let the conversations end. Idk about him but it was very apparent to me that it wasn’t a “start of a new friendship” type of convo. It should’ve been more of a “one convo stand” conversation. And also it’s hard to forget that I was constantly being called short and fat by his tall skinny fortnite friends. 

He keeps stretching them with some random boring ass topics and shitty jokes that I just reply 😂😂😂 to. The conversation had died like a week ago but he still hits me up as soon as he sees I’m online. Everyday I log onto Instagram I dread seeing that “hi bro”. 

I don’t hate the guy but these forced conversation literally make me want to die. I try to give him hints that I don’t wanna talk anymore.

338,"I live at home with my family basically for free. I pay for half of my college tuition and phone bill. That’s all I pay for. My dad told me to save as much as I can to be able to move out soon and be comfortable, that’s why he only wants me to pay for stuff that have to do anything with me. 

By next summer, I will be an upcoming senior student in my uni. I plan on moving out by then (August) so I can have one year of freedom without parents before I get into the “real world.” Freedom of: partying, making my own decisions, and paying my bills! 

I will be working at a hospital as front desk receptionist and will get paid about $14-$15/hour working 25 hours a week. I plan on getting another job that pays about the same but with around 10-15 hours a week. I calculated everything and if I save all my money, I will have roughly $9-$10K by December this year. Minus my tuition and other miscellaneous which would make it go down to about $7-$8K. 

I currently have a 2005 Ford Focus sedan 143K miles. I’ve had it for over 2 years and works great. I’m also wondering - should I get a new car or get an apartment by next year? Or both? :) (If I do get a car - I’d get my dream car: Jeep grand cherokee. I’d get a used one other 50K miles. I’ve checked CarMax/CarFax and it costs about $300-$400 a month for 72 months to finance. I have 700+ credit score and I’m confident I’d be able to make it!)

I was gonna move out this year but I only have $3k, taking home $1800 a month after taxes, with $1500 expenses per month. It would be really tight on me.

I am currently on AHCCCS but applying for ALTCS (long term care) due to lasting health issues. When I was able to work I was saving up money and now it looks like it'll cause more harm than good because I'm only allowed to have $2,000 in the bank. Can someone please answer these questions ASAP?

1. If I loan money to my family the website says it could be uncompensated (didn't get the full value or ""gifted"" the money) and I could be banned from applying for a while. Is there a way not to do that such as getting a letter notarized?
2. If my dad uses my account as savings since he doesn't believe in banks, can he sign a paper and will they accept it?
3. Can they get any of my bank information on their own or do I have to submit it? What bank account info do I need to submit?

341,"(TLDR: basically the title.)

My husband (31M) and I (26F) have been married for a few years now, and we have a very good relationship in my opinion. We don’t have any children yet, but we’re planning on trying in the future. I was raised in a Christian family, so although I’ve always known I’ve been just as attracted to women as men, I’ve only come to terms with it a year or so ago. We’re both Christian too, and I know how much some Christians tend to look down on homosexuality, although I’ve always tried to be an ally. Honestly, that’s probably part of why it took me so long to accept myself. My husband isn’t homophobic, but he was raised in a homophobic family. Early in our marriage, he carried some of their beliefs with him until I was able to help him grow out of them. 

Anyway, I don’t think he’d get angry at me or divorce me or anything crazy like that for coming out to him. However, I do think it might cause some problems. For example, I have a female friend who spends a lot of time with us. We’ve been friends for decades, so we’re more like sisters. There’s absolutely 0 romantic attraction for me towards her though. But she does spend a lot of time with me without my husband there. I’m worried he won’t allow us to spend any time together anymore, even though she means a lot to me. I’m also worried he’d tell his family, and that they would treat me horribly because of it. 

On the other hand, I want to tell him because I feel like if I tell anyone, he should know first. I haven’t told a soul yet, besides you guys. I feel like I have to keep this big part of me a secret, and it’s really wearing on me. It’s not like I’m going to be exploring it or anything though, so does it even matter? Should I just suck it up and pretend it doesn’t exist since I’m in a happy heterosexual relationship? I’m just confused as to where I should go from here, I guess, if I should go anywhere.

346,"When my girlfriend (22) and I (28, also female for clarity) first started talking, I had a male best friend I was really close to. We shared everything. He understood my dark and lewd sense of humor and vice versa. We had been friends since 2011. He sent me a meme about sexual humor and I thought it was hilarious, but she said it was inappropriate and told me to tell him that. I did not agree with her, but seeing as she was upset about it, I did it. Eventually, she made comments about every message he sent. He worked nights (5pm-2am) and would text me around 2am, which I wouldn't even see until about 10am, but she thought that was unnecessary. He would send memes or pictures if his dog; completely harmless stuff, but still, inappropriate because of the hour. Eventually he stopped taking to me alltogether and I thought it was best, for him, to just let the friendship go. A part of me thought she was being controlling, and when I brought it up, I was made out to be the bad guy for saying that about her and eventually told it was in my head. 

I'm a big fan of online games. League of Legends has been my life for a few years. But anytime I play any sort if online game, she gets randomly mad. She doesn't understand why I have to play games with other people. Same with Grand Theft Auto 5, and even Animal Crossing. She would start an argument and it would eventually end in me closing out of the game. Now I stick to League of Legends and only play Grand Theft Auto 5 Online when we aren't together.
Even when I just play League, she wants to get a play by play of who I played with and how many games we played together. It's gotten to the point where my old friends won't even play with me because they know how she reacts.

So i was in the bath earlier and my boyfriend asked me to send him the photo i took with his long hair the other day, and when i got out i seen he was messaging his female friend (more about her in my other posts) about his long hair and he got mad when she said she didnt like his hair that way, and i got irritated because idk why that matters to him hes 19 and weve been together 4 years and he has had a history of lying and flirting behind my back prior to last year, however it SEEMS to have stopped. They talk about her sex life frequently and she brags about her sportscar and he asks to go for rides in it as well as her begging to see our dog, and hes offered to buy her pizza. These are some examples that have struck me as uncomfortable but mind you he wont even spend $2 on me if he doesnt have to. I made a dig and asked why he cared that she didnt like his hair and he tried to justify it and say he didn’t care but he did because he coukdnt let it go, and i got irritated as i found out two nights ago at 2am it showed that he changed the snapchat settings to delete everything immediately and left it that way til he woke up the next morning and changed it back , and claims he didnt do it although it says he did. 

ANYWAYS point of this is, he got mad and told me to stop being crazy and paranoid etc. and i said i KNOW if i were talking to a male that often on snapchat he would not like it one bit, especially about their sex life and begging them to take me for drives and saying they would buy my lunch, he would absolutely lose it. Its not fair and im exhausted, id never do something he’s uncomfortable with and ive proved that we are 19m and 21f with our own apartment and dog, both going to school. He got mad and called me out and then proceeded to say hes going to go in car with her whether i like it or not, and buy her lunch if i like it or not and ill never stop him (which i never tried to stop him i just tried to tell him how uncomfortable it all made me) and he went to bed and told me not to come, he said sleep on the couch or vice versa. After about a half an hour i went in and tried to apologize for doing nothing as i feel im not in the wrong here, but he would not give it up and let me in bed with him, he said he accepts my apology although i never got one from him, and said if i get in bed hes going on the couch. I tried to lay down so he got up and went to the living room so i followed trying to make up because we always agreed never to go to bed mad, even tho i feel this wasnt my place to fix it it should have been his. He then went back in the room and locked the door and barred it by pushing the dresser across to it so i had no way in, which upset me so i started to cry and ive been on the couch ever since. I should also add i spent the entire last two days writing 2500 words on his technical report for school and formatting the entire 5342 words total, when i coukdve been doing my own work, and he refused to spend 10 mins doing the dishes afterward and i had to do them because he was too busy on fortnite. I feel exhausted but he makes it all my fault and says i play games with him however its the exact opposite. All of this because i tried to address how i felt uncomfortable with one female out of the 5-6 that he regularly talks to/ sees as friends. 

I should mention if i even message one male to have a conversation its an issue, even one of his friends for a simple question regarding my car, etc. he gets suspicious of it, so i find it unfair that he can but i cant sort of deal. Back in March when he was away on a workterm he lost his mind because i asked a male from our hometown where he purchased an item in his story and i forgot to save it, making my boyfriend paranoid for 2 weeks and questioned my every move so much as getting sooky because i facetimed my female friend til 2am who moved away and i missed her so we chatted for a bit. He complains when i say i want to talk to my gay male friend so i avoid him as well just to keep the conflict out of my relationship. Its not fair, then whenever i say that “im not alowed but u are” he says “go ahead i have no problem with u talking to people” until i test it and do it and he has a meltdown and cries begging me to stop saying he will too. 

You may say it sounds childish for two of us but im tired of this and actually want us to work out i just dont know what else to do. He is irrational and thinks he does nothing wrong but yet blames me and screams if i do something so minor as serve him a plate of icecream and hot pie with the ice cream a little melted (true story).    He also made a few comments regarding my weight because i gained 10 this whole winter while he was away and he said its affecting his attraction to me, however hes put on more weight than me, im not fat or chubby by any means i just gained a few stretch marks. Theres more things on the list but i wont explain them all, some are in my old posts. It’s ridiculous but i want it to workout i just dont know what to do. I know neither of us are perfect but i go to extreme lengths to please him and keep him happy all for nothing in return, he cant even be appreciative enough to do the dishes after i work so hard doing something for him and then still cook his supper, as well as him not even being grateful enough that i did 3 loads of laundry last weekend and all the chores and helped with his other assignment that he had to get mad and scream at me over a bit of melted icecream that i chose out of the goodness of my heart to get for him with some warmed pie even though all i wanted to do was go to bed. 

My point is, He sees nothing wrong with what i addressed tonight and proceeded to bring up past things that annoyed him about me to justify and say he can do this and that, etc. Im unsure what else to do.

354,"So basically there’s this girl who I only know from going to the same school as her and having some mutual friends, I thought she was cute a while ago so I followed her on a few different social media’s, one of these is vsco, no one knows I have vsco cause it’s kind of weird for a dude, especially like me, to have vsco. Anyways, I follow her on an account that she doesn’t know is mine, and she recently posted a picture that was just a stunning portrait shot of what I think is her face?? (This is where is gets kind of weird if it hasn’t already gotten weird) I don’t really know if the picture she posted is of her but all of the other pictures she’s posted are of her, this one particularly stands out cause the eyes are a stark brown almost orange in the sunlight, but she almost always has black eyes when I see her around school and in other photos. So, would it be weird to text her in something like snapchat or insta and ask her if the photo is of her?

356,"Hello, all.

I'm in a bit of an uncomfortable situation right now and I need help rationalizing it as well as figuring out if I'm the bad guy here. I am very anxious and uncomfortable.

I'm an artist, and I like to draw fanart which includes NSFW art. I recently got onto the Discord server of another fan artist I really admire and decided to share a piece in the NSFW section. 

Depicted in the drawing were genderbent versions of the characters Leone Abbacchio and Giorno Giovanna from JJBA. The controversy started over the depiction of Giorno, as Giorno is underaged. In the drawing though, I depicted her (her, in this situation) clothed and not actively participating in the situation Abbacchio (an adult character) was in. The image is actually on Reddit if you need proof.

I got told by one of their friends that I was getting kicked off the server for it, even after apologizing and saying I had no idea it wasn't acceptable there. I'm used to being in an environment where this kind of stuff doesn't really register because of mine and other peoples' ability to separate fiction from reality as well as the fact that the underaged character looked like an adult and wasn't even depicted doing anything NSFW. I didn't even consider the age.

I'm feeling anxious and bummed out because I really thought that artist was a cool person and I had to leave in disgrace with the worst possible accusations. I'm worried they think I'm some kind of pedophile. Did I actually do something wrong, or am I overreacting?",09Jun2020,3

My mom is someone who tells you what to do and that’s the end of it. Lately shes been giving me really simple tasks that she could do instead of interrupting what ever it was that I was doing. For example these are some of the things she’s said. “Can you come here and turn off the light?” (She was literally 3 ft away from it while I was all the way over in my room. Another one: “can you plug in my phone?” (Again, charger was 3 ft away.) the last one really bugs me. “Can you get me a glass of water?” WHILE SHES IN THE GODDAMN KITCHEN. What can I tell her to make her stop. I’ve already told her no to the plug in my phone request, and was promptly yelled at by my dad.

367,"Graduated university in 2014 in a bunk degree (English Lit) and have bounced around from office job to office job since. I moved from London to New York for about a year 2 years ago and mostly worked on a screenwriting project with a mate who lives there but moved back after my sister got sick (she's better now).

THis year especially has been awful. I hate looking for work because the job hunt is endless and repetetive applying on job boards and maybe getting 1 or 2 responses per fortnight if i'm lucky (after spamming my shitty CV around ad naseam to every job listing).

My inner circle friendhsip group has fallen apart beyond repair and i've neglected my outer circle who are now spread across the UK and elsewhere. I live with my parents and feel and act like a child stuck in a loop. I have no one to hang out with anymore, no idea what I want to do in my life, no girlfriend and I just turned 30. Even if i meet a girl the fact I live at home is a turn off (I brought a girl home recently but she lost the mood to have sex when she saw my little sister and my mum walking about the house lol I want a relationship more than just casual sex but I want to be able to have at least semi-regular sex too)

I keep thinking of going back to school but it's overwhelming trying to figure out which course to take and whether or not it won't just be another waste of time like my first degree. I'm suspicious of the relevancy of any non-STEM degree in the modern era now anyway.

All I know for sure is I want to start over, probably move out of London and back to the states again (I have dual-citizenship) but not NYC as too expensive.

ANy advice for someone like me? The thing is that my self esteem isn't even bad which makes it worse as I feel like I should be having a way better life with a cool creative job and a girlfriend and yet i'm just this utter wasteman living with my mum sitting in front of a computer all day. It feels like I've completely squandered what could have been a great life because people seem to like me and I have a strong creative talent and lots of interests - in another life I feel like I could have been a screenwriter by now living in LA but i dropped the ball and now im a loser forever",09Jun2020,4

370,"I’m an 18 year old college student that just moved back home for the summer due to coronavirus and my lease ending. It wasn’t exactly my idea of paradise coming back home, but I didn’t think it was going to be too bad. I actually refused to live with my parents again until I had absolutely no other option. But in the end, I had to move back home. 

Recently since I’ve been back home I’ve had my guard up about my privacy. My bedroom is located directly next to my parents room. The walls are extremely thin to the point where I can hear every creak in the floor and conversation from their room. I have noticed that it seems as though they love to eavesdrop when I am talking on the phone with both my friends and my boyfriend. It bothers me to the point where I will turn on my tv and crank my fan all the way up to create some extra noise so they can’t overhear my entire conversation. 

However, I was on the phone with my boyfriend tonight before bed and noticed that my parents had left their bedroom door open to overhear the conversation. Seriously??! I feel like this is another level of nosy. 

They also tend to watch me like a hawk when I make something to eat, or just watch what I’m eating in general as if they are counting my calories for me. 

They ask where I’m headed off to whenever I leave the house. Even some days I will hop in my car and notice that my seat has been rearranged because they drove my car without letting me know for absolutely no reason. They each have their own cars. To make it even better, no, they don’t put gas in my car when they use it. 

They also attempted to create a curfew for me, but I refused to let that shit slide. I have paid my own bills, lived on my own, fed myself, paid for my own education... I think I’m at the point where I am no longer a child and can come home at anytime I please. With respect of course.

Sometimes In the middle of the night I will hear them attempting to open my bedroom door to check and see if I’m sleeping. However, I always keep my doors locked because I personally think that’s creepy as well as an invasion of my privacy. 

I don’t even know what to do at this point. I can’t even talk on the phone with anyone without feeling awkward about it. I can’t do anything without them constantly all up in my shit. If I sat down with them for a conversation I know they’d get defensive. I don’t even know what to do at this point. I hate being around them.",09Jun2020,4

380,"First, a little backstory... I have friends, quite a lot and each unique. Some I consider to even be my best friends and yet, I am staring at my phone right now thinking of someone to text how lonely I feel. I constantly act content with my life as I should due to the ample amount of privilege and opportunities provided for me. I am that girl you see strutting on campus with a classy outfit on paired with pretty hair and makeup all done up... walking like I don't have a care in the world. In fact, I have been complimented on my confidence and attractiveness almost everyday (not to flex, but just something I am used to because of the validation). I am a biology major and very hardworking, very active volunteering and internship wise, in a sorority and charismatic in any setting (i was called coy once and that describes me well in certain situations). Also, I've never had a serious boyfriend, only flings. I can get guys, but they never stay for anything serious once I finally open up... or try to. 

Anyway, I feel like no one gets me, but maybe it's because everyone judges me. I used to think I was projecting my insecurity of being judged on others, but looking back... people DO indeed judge me when I open up. Whether it is shutting my feelings down with a bland response, acting like they don't care, or just being rude and distant when I do express any negative feelings such as loneliness. How do some people make close friends so easily?? I want that friend that I can call at 2 am when I am feeling down and need moral support. When I am feeling so insecure and insignificant, I want someone to make me feel strong and loved. My sister has so many friends, most are close, and I sometimes depend on them to talk about my feelings because I know they won't judge their close  friend's older sister (we are 15 months apart). I guess I am asking what I am doing wrong? Am I perhaps fake, as they say? I try to keep up appearances and act like that b as a mask so much that now it's impossible to take it off and let my guard down? If you read this, thank you for doing the one thing I wish any of my friends could do.... listen without judgment. It truly means a lot to me.",09Jun2020,1

back story:

it was hard but each month for 9 months (we broke up in october) he would come back, and of course i would take him back each time but it was just really toxic and he wasn’t the same. and it would also only last a week before he broke up with me again and left till next time. 

now recent: 
he came back and i let him in again and we dated for a month but he left and it was a really messy break up and now i’m left feeling worse then ever. each break up he leaves me worse and worse and i don’t know how to be alone and stop thinking about him..

Today I was at the beach with my friends, and my friend and I saw this middle-aged man with a bowlcut taking pictures of our other friends in their bikinis. At first we weren't sure if that was what he was doing, but we saw that when our friends moved his camera followed their movements. We told our friends to come up the hill where we were sitting and put their towels on immediately (the guy was STILL taking pictures) and told them what was going on. One of the guys in our group confronted him and he refused to admit he had been taking pictures, refused to show us his camera roll, and would not delete them. My friends were really shaken up because it was just so creepy and it ruined the fun day we had planned. There was a cop at the beach and he said he couldn't do anything because the man taking the pictures was protected by the first ammendment and we were in a public area. So the guy got away with the pictures of my friends and we are all disgusted. We took videos and pictures of him (unfortunately not pictures of him taking photos but after we confronted him) and we also have his liscense plate. We don't know his name or anything but I think his employer and family should know what a creep he is. What do we do??

It’s a long story, but three days ago, she randomly texted me out of nowhere. She said “hey, do you remember me?”. I responded back saying “Yes, wassup?” Was honestly confused, been a month and I thought she was done with me. But someone tell me if I’m overthinking or not

So apparently, there’s this expose page for my school. Basically, women are coming out and telling their stories about men who committed sexual crimes against them, but it’s anonymous. With me and this girl, we talked about sex beforehand, so we knew we were hooking up. When we were together, I made sure everything we did, there was consent. Eventually, it got to the point where we were about to have sex. But honestly, I got to a point where I just wasn’t in the mood. It didn’t feel organic, we didn’t have a connection, so I wasn’t fully erect. You could tell she was disappointed, so I decided to just go down on her. The one mistake I made, was before I did, I didnt ask her if it was okay. But when I did it, she seemed to enjoy it. Said I did good, and even asked if I wanted to keep going. But you could tell that’s not what she really wanted, she just wanted regular intercourse.

But honestly man, past few days I’ve just been really anxious. Like I feel like if she really wanted to, she could out me for that. The day after we hung out, I recall her telling her friends that I was “aggressive and persistent”. I’m confused though, because I asked for consent and never forced her to do anything she didn’t want to do. That is out of my character for real, to take advantage of a women like that. But idk, I dont see any other reason for her to hit me up, because we didn’t even end our “relationship” on good terms. We got into an argument because I feel like she didn’t really care about me, but just saw me as a piece of meat and someone who could dick her down real good.

For some reason, I thought it would be a good idea to tell myself that the people and characters on posters/in movies/in games/etc, were watching me. That they were alive and had thoughts. It wasn't a problem for a few years, but now I really need to stop this.

I always feel the need to be perfect so that the 'people' in my room don't judge me. I don't really allow myself to do and think certain things. I constantly worry about my appearance even when I'm alone in my room. I'm afraid of having certain dreams when going to bed.

I know it's stupid, and it makes no sense to give life to objects. But I've been doing this for almost 6 years, I think, so it's really hard for me to change. I'm still a teenager (16), and I truly hope I can 'get better' before I grow up and move out; I'm scared of living alone with this fear.

I really need advices to finally understand that I'm alone and safe in my room.",09Jun2020,1

413,"My (F27) boyfriend (M24) just got home at 2am from the bar. Not a huge deal I’m a little annoyed because I was in a dead sleep and him and our dog woke me up. I head downstairs to see what’s going on, in just underwear and a shirt, to find a stranger on my couch. Now I’m extremely annoyed because our house is a disaster, him and I have both been working 6-7 days a week and I do the majority of the cleaning and haven’t had time. So I am mortified that someone I don’t know is seeing things like my bra sitting on the couch and dirty clothes in the bathroom and a sink full of dishes. So besides my embarrassment keeping me awake now I am getting anxiety because he barely knows this guy. They work together but not even a year yet and the guy was fired for being an alcoholic and then rehired at a later date. My purse, my keys, everything of value is sitting right down stairs with a guy I barely know. I texted my boyfriend to be like wth is going on and he is saying the guy is now staying the night here. I am not okay with this and have to work tomorrow, given it’s in the afternoon but my boyfriend has no idea due to my fluctuation schedule. I’m just really uncomfortable and wanna leave my house and go somewhere that I’ll be comfortable to sleep.",09Jun2020,3

416,"Ioften post on reddit to make friends and sometimes I’ll offer my discord if they play a game I play even if I don’t know them well I don’t use my personal info on anything. I gave my discord to some person who saw a post on r/relationships I believe and he asked if I was okay and I replied “yeah. I’m good!” I saw he played COD so I gave him my discord and told him I’m not on too much and left the convo to go to bed. 
I didn’t reply to this person simply because I don’t go on discord more than once every 2 weeks if that. I feel like him deleting his accounts after 4 paragraphs about how I’m a horrible fake person is a little much for a person I didn’t have a huge conversation with. 
What set this off is he created a new account 2 months later and told me “I screenshot your username so I could talk to you” and I find that terrifying but is it as creepy as I think ? Is it crossing way too many boundaries for an online conversation?",09Jun2020,1
417,"(15yo female) I have an average Gpa of 3.5. I get decent grades. I’m literally going to be getting my permit earlier than most because of my grades. I listen when I’m told to do something. I try to come out of my room every now and then and socialize. I send my family random uplifting paragraphs about how much I appreciate them. I’m willing to get help for my depression. I haven’t harmed myself since March 7th. I try to take my medicine everyday. I keep up with my hygiene. I play three different instruments. I paint. I sketch. I would go to school and come home with no problems. 

I help people as much as I can and I’ve saved over 4 people from committing suicide. I find new music and share it with my family. I let them know I see them and what they’re going through. I’ll randomly come and hug them. I make plans with my friends and even when I don’t feel motivated. I still deal with the effects of the toxic abuse of my now ex.  I still smile back at people. I don’t go to parties or drink. I like to sit quietly alone and read books. I didn’t mention I had problems with my religion until recently because I just followed my mothers teachings. But I... I start dating a guy and I’m the worst child ever. I stay up on the phone past 2 with my best friend and I get embarrassed and yelled at. I leave my room after 10 and I’m “disrespectful.” And Jesus the sex talk was the most depressing experience. I was told I would end up like my drugged out sister and probably wouldn’t be successful and that I should practically stay a virgin forever. I don’t understand why I’m not enough. 

Is there something I’m doing wrong? I try everyday of my entire life to make everyone around me happy but I do one thing to make me happy and I’m just this bad person. I don’t understand why. Can someone tell me if I’m wrong for feeling like I try my hardest but it will never be enough?",09Jun2020,1

420,"Hi. This is extremely personalized and specific, and I'm not expecting it to gain any traction, but I'm feeling quite lost and helpless. I am in the class of 2021, and will be applying to universities soon. I'm from Pakistan, but don't want to go to uni here , so i may have more freedom and an all around better experience abroad. Degrees I'm interested in are primarily common Law LLB but most countries don't offer this in a way that it would be applicable back in Pakistan if i ever decide to go back or have to go back (ex; the US).

I was previously looking at unis such as Durham, Glasgow, UCL, Bristol and the like but my parents have informed me that the financial situation is quite tough because of corona halting the business, and in general too. So i've dropped my expectations quite a lot, a pessimist and control freak by nature, I spend hours everyday worrying about how I'll get a good job later if I don't go to some flashy uni which we have to spend a lot on. I'm preparing for the worst case-scenario. I'm aware getting a work sponsored visa is tough, but I have no idea how tough it is. Ideally, I'd like to stay back and work in the country I study in, and only go back to Pakistan if i wish. I'm assuming what my parents can pay in uni fees is about 2000 USD per semester for tuition, and living costs separately but ideally low, not in a very expensive city. I've been looking at State unis in the US , and places in Turkey as well. Europe seems quite hard, as I'd love to live there but integration without knowing their language would be tough, and again, one of my primary concerns is getting a job post-uni. 

Could the lovely superheroes of Reddit please help out an overtly anxious bitch and suggest some places I should look into further? I speak fluent English, and would be down for any degrees in the humanities, but what I worry about those is that getting a secure job later would be tough and I'd be made to return back to my home country. I'm also 100% fine with getting a part time job while at uni, and I really want to have a blast and party, whilst not letting my grades go down under. I wouldn't really enjoy a place like Germany for this reason, my counsellor at school told us that they're quite academically strict and slipping grades leads to expulsion. 

In summation, if i've melted your braincells with this mindless chatter enough for your poor soul to have reached this far, I'd like advice on which nations have comparatively simpler work-visa laws, which unis i should be looking into, and how much my job chances are affected by the status of the uni I go to (state unis and turkey seem extremely cheap).

424,"First of all, sorry if I misspell something, I'm self-taught on English so bare with me

I'm 22, male BTW

A little bit of context first

I met an amazing girl through tinder a year ago, we started talking and we found out that we liked the same stuff, videogames, books, series, movies not so much but you get the idea. We decided to start a relationship, I was 21 and she was 19 at the time, everything was awesome with her... I've never been someone that feels attractive or interesting, but this girl made me feel attractive, you know? When you can truly feel the love in the eyes of your partner, I think I'm getting a little bit distracted
We were together for 9 months, to me everything was perfect but one day she just started to try to distance herself from me, she says things like she wanted space from us, and I understood that I mean she said that we took things too fast and I agreed with that but I was sure at the time that she IS the love of my life, I still believe that...

When we broke up she said nothing...

Right now 6 months have passed since we broke up, I know she broke up with me because she was getting ""bored"" that everything was going fine between us, I've seen her getting her heart broken by other dudes that misstreat her and I'm there for her to comfort her, we are still in touch as friends, but she is well aware that I am still in love with her

What in trying to say I understand why she did what she did, she doesn't have the best of the mental health... depression, anxiety, suicide thoughts, etc. And again I understand why she did what she did 

Now here's the reason why am I asking for advice 

I've been fighting for her because I know she's the love of my life, she is the only woman I can see as the most beautiful woman alive and she prefers to be mistreated by other guys and seek out to go back with one of her ex boyfriends that already broke her heart not once but twice 

I want to fight for her, but right now I don't find myself in a very good place in my life, I'm experiencing so much pressure on school, about money, grades, dissapoint my mother... I've never been able to open myself about those thing and here I am asking strangers for advice 

Should I fight for her in this moment in time or should I wait to make something better about my situation and mental health? 

She and I have been talking lately, just as friends, but time to time it slips out of my mouth that I miss her, I asked her not so long ago about the things she didn't liked about me, I was worried about the answer, but I gathered up courage and finally asked, the answer was ""I loved everything about you, it was perfect, but the problem was me, I don't know but I got bored that everything was fine"" somehow I already knew that 

There's so much about the story I couldn't put in words because I couldn't find how to write it, and thank you so much if you read it all, I'm trying to hold the tears because I have never been so desperate or I've never opened to someone 

Thank you stranger, I think I needed to let all this out

435,"hello, talked about this here a little while back but am still conflicted. its also 3:22 am and im hoping to maybe calm my nerves

im 15, f, with a medical history of a looot of things. Idiopathic toe walking since i was maybe 3-5? 4 Dislocated knees (one of them was just from rolling over in bed, it was that easy) , A Patellar Realignment surgery (done on feb 7th this year) extremely tight calves, ankles and thigh muscles/whatever you call it, and awful back and shoulder pain.

My Knee Surgeon forwarded us to a consult with a Neurologist a while ago, and basically tldr, 50% chance i have A tethered spinal cord. They wont know for sure unless they do the surgery to repair it. 

I want to do the surgery, sort of. I have an intense fear of pain, needles, everything painful and medical. My knee surgery was extremely traumatic for me, i still get panic attacks if i think to hard about it. Im crying right now just typing this out. 

So theres th at, then theres the fact that my family thinks i shouldnt. The doctor said if i dont do the surgery nothing will change from how it is now, but i hate how i live life. i hate the constant back and shoulder pain, i hate having to worry 24/7 about my knee dislocating, i hate that when i walk for even just 20, 30 miniutes with no break my legs are in awful pain that night or the next day, i hate that i cant run and im not supposed to swimm much, go on water slides, i cant play laser tag, i cant figure skate anymore (i used to do it competitively) i cant skateboard, i cant ride a bike, hell i can barely get up my stairs at home. I hate living like this. I wanna be able to have a life and do the things my friends can.

My dad see’s it as if i dont do it its sparing me months long surgery recovery, the trauma doing another operation would create and more pain for me. And i get that and surgery terrifies me, it took 40 miniutes for me to get an IV in because i was panicking so much. im terrified at the idea of doing it again.

But i cant live like this. I cant work normal jobs like this, i cant stand for long periods of time so i cant do restaurant stuff or retail, sitting upright for long periods of time is also very painful so i cant really do office jobs, i know theres more stuff then that but just the limitations my life has kills me.

439,"Definition of highschool drama (all of us are 15/16) but... Basically I’ve been best friends with this girl for around 2 years and overtime we got close as fuck. I helped her get with a dude around December 2019 (pretend his name is David) and they’re dating to Thsi day. Some important things to know was that During 2019 summer break, we got hella close. We FaceTimed every day +8 hours, talked about a future etc. I didn’t really “like” her back then, even tho I saw a future w her eventually. 

David was a good ass dude and he’s had a crush on her since October 2019. But ever since January 2020, me and (pretend her name is Emily) have gotten really distant. We stopped calling every day and it was even awkward in class and shit. I sucked it up for the longest time. It fucking sucked seeing her happy with someone else, I felt replaced. 

In late March 2020 she admitted to having a crush on me... for the entire time we were friends. This fucked with my head for multiple reasons. 1: She said she liked both of us, she liked me more but she had to stay loyal to David (I always advised her to stay with him because he truly made her happy) 2: she’s always said things like “yeah but you would give up the world for me too” and this killed me knowing that it was true. 3: through the months of us not talking I realized I did love her, ive said it to her before (and yes I was her ride or die) but i didn’t mean it like THAT. 

Around mid-April Emily and David broke up for a night. It was super complicated: David was skeptical of me (being the boy bsf obviosuly) and asked god (during Ramadan) about a sign for his relationship. David then had a dream about me whispering to him “she (Emily) doesn’t like you (David).” Emily FaceTimed me imediatly, balling her eyes out. Not even 10 mins later she was unphased. Then I remebered a conversation I had with one of her close friends outside of school: a text of Emily saying she wouldn’t be too worried if David broke up with her, because she liked someone else (me) atm. I made it very clear I wasn’t gonna “swoop in” and make a move on her to both David and Emily (even tho David has no clue this shits happening). Regardless, they got back togeht the next day because David made it clear he didn’t care about anyone but her because he does love her. 

After this shit they’ve been close than ever. But here’s the kicker... 
The future they started talking about was exactly like the one I had with Emily. 4 kids (annoying Cus David and I have very similar physical attributes), in a big, comfy house, with a small dog and a big dog. I get to build a treehouse for the girls so they can have “girls nights out” and stupid shit like that. Other things she said include “I dotn like you anymore” “I know u hate me so I hate u” stupid shit like that. It doesn’t sound like much on paper but it was all I wanted with her, but again, I got replaced. 

I chose not to say anything about my feelings, knowing it would just complicate things, but holy fuck it sucks so much more because she doesn’t know the impact she has on me. I blast riot/hard rap music and workout at 2 am Cus I only pump iron when I feel pissed out of my mind. I used to punch walls and shit but I stopped knowing it’s fuckifn stupid. 

Anyways, the only reason I’m writing this is to let it out somewhere, but there are so many additional things that I shouldn’t talk about (her personal business) But it killed me knowing she’s done “naughty” things w him. Sounds fucking corny but whatever. I literally can’t sleep Cus she told me somehtifn that made me want to throw tf up (even tho I persisted on her telling me, Definitly regret it). 

She really is the perfect girl for me. But I can’t do anything about it. I used to wait it out (not actually believing they would last this long) but it kills me inside. I know it killed her too, but I think she’s over me and idk what to do. There are extra ass things I don’t like David (he imposed rules like not posting bikini pics or wearing dresses or leggings) I know this is because he’s insecure of losing her but cmon man let her be her own person. 

I don’t want to move on because I truly believe she’s the one, some Rachel and Ross shit (if they end up togehter again, halfway thru s10). I know we will be togehte at some point.

444,"Hi,

I'm going out with this guy who says he's on the autism spectrum. He says he's been tested to have an IQ over 130. I don't know if that's been done by a professional or just online tests... I'm not sure if it is the case or not. But here's a few peculiar things I have an issue with, otherwise everything else seems normal. I mean everyone is different! I just would like to confirm if these issues are related to Asperger's so I can educate myself, or that this guy's claims are false and not verified by a professional.

\- He doesn't like to not be able to finish something: a show/book/film

\- He tends to talk a lot and go sometimes into details. For example when telling me an anecdote he would tell me the people's names, even if these are people I don't know, so I don't need to have this much detail.

\- He would be very preoccupied with the financial aspects of dates and travels (what it costs him to come see me) and would tell me about it. As if he is equating our time together with the financial cost?

\- He claims not to understand hints and non-verbal communication. But he feels bad when he detects that I'm sad (when I don't express it).

\- He doesn't understand when I want sex. And would refuse my advances (which I don't handle very well). For example, when watching a film, and if I want to cuddle/make out/have sex, he would tell me: ""I'm watching the film""

\- Doesn't cuddle/make out . If he feels bad about rejecting my advances, he would want to get right to sex.

Clearly, intimacy related remarks are a big problem for me, as I have rejection issues myself.

So, i'm wondering, do we have a case of neurological discrepancies, or am I just dealing with a self-centered guy who isn't that into me?

Thank you",09Jun2020,2

447,"When unemployment happened due to CV I eventually got back paid a significant amount of money. At the time the money had finally come through, I was on the phone with my friend. I was excited and told him the exact amount I was getting to which he jokingly replied something like ""shit, you can give me 40 of that!"" I said ""haha yeah, for sure"" I wasn't being entirely serious, though.  A couple days later he has something ""important"" to take care of and asks for $40 and said he would pay me back later, when he transfers his money. I say sure, no prob. I was actually just gonna tell him just keep the 40 it's no big. But, in the mean time he's bought this and that, just bought this nice new camera lens, shoes.  

Not really thinking about all this stuff he's telling me he bought, I tell him he should try sorting out his unemployment to make sure he's getting that 600 everyone is supposed to get plus his UE.. He said he did, and he is getting the correct amount. This rubbed me the wrong way completely.. I sent him a text the other day just to remind him he owes me and he just liked my text and hasn't said anything..

448,"I knew they had some prejudices but they’ve never been openly racist until the protest started. We’re the UK and the reports on the protest have been more riot focused. The destroying of the statue and defacing Winston Churchill’s statue. This has sent them over the edge saying that the BLM is a terrorist group. 

I sat down with them and tried to explain and they both just said ‘don’t all lives matter’ and when I tried to correct them they called me a ‘snow flake’ and ignored me. When I told them about the goal to end police brutality and how police man are turning around body cams and badges my dad said ‘too right. Kill as many of them as possible.’ Me and my younger sister (13) were trying to educate them but were continuously called ‘the snow flake generation’ and my dad finished the conversation with ‘wait until she goes to uni and comes back married fo a n-word.’ I stormed off into my room to ignore them.

451,"There’s this online friend of mine that’s been going through some stuff lately. I’ve been trying to help her with her mental health. 

I used to be in a pretty dark place myself, and I understand a lot of what she’s going through. I’ve had to talk her out of suicide twice, and she has been self harming a lot.

I used to cut too, but I eventually stopped. At first her self harming wasn’t that bad and I was trying to get her to stop, but after her most recent suicide attempt, one of her other friends cut all ties with her. She freaked out and she’s even more scared and sad and angry than ever. Ever since then, her self harming has gotten a lot worse, and she doesn’t even want to stop anymore. She romanticises the act of cutting and thinks her problems aren’t valid because she isn’t doing it enough. 

I tried to talk her out of this dangerous mindset, but she wouldn’t listen. I got her to promise she wouldn’t do more than 11 cuts per day (The worst I ever did) That promise went out the fucking window, as she cut herself almost 30 fucking times because her sister said some mean things about her. Her sisters a bitch, and I know the pain she’s going through, but she lets the wrong people get to her too much. She gets so sad and so angry over nothing. I get it, I used to be like that, but if she keeps going like this, she’ll be worse than I ever was. 

When I was at my worst, the second I realised that there were people who actually cared about me, I tried to get better, not for my sake, but for there’s. She just seems too stubborn to even do that. She is just so stupid, and I know that eventually she’ll look back and hate herself even more. 

Is it wrong that I’m starting to feel angry at her? I have been so patient with her for months on end and she only seems to get worse. I never used to get angry at her, but as I’m typing this I’m literally shaking with rage. She’s a good person deep down, and I know it, but I hate that she can’t see that.

454,"(18F) So a couple years ago I had a really really good friend of 3 years. He was a boy and the entire time he liked me, but I didn’t know that. He had made some jokes about my body before but nothing that was too uncomfortable, plus I thought everything was platonic so I always trusted he didn’t really think that he was just joking and laughed it off. I guess it’s my fault for not setting those boundaries, but I was young and naive. I feel like I need to explain that he’s not a bad person. He’s not a creep. He’s just a nervous guy who made jokes that he didn’t know crossed the line. He’s so socially awkward but I don’t think he meant to hurt me. Anyways, one day he made a joke insinuating we had sex.... in front of ME and a ton of other people. This was in defense of him being made fun of for being a virgin btw. I felt so violated and sexualized. I truly had never felt so embarrassed in my life. I don’t remember if he apologized, if so it wasn’t genuine. 

Anyways, my natural reaction was to ignore him and avoid him because every time he was near me I would tense up and not want to look at him. Things were not the same and I couldn’t get myself to talk to him normally. I have a distrust of men from other past events, so this was a blow in the chest since I trusted him. Also didn’t help that all I could do was remember all the times he sexualized me in the past. I thought that there’s no way he doesn’t know what he did wrong, but after a few months passed I realized he truly didn’t know what he did wrong. He simply thought I hated him for no reason. Couple years pass and we never talk. I’ve seen him look down as I walk by him as if I hate him. We used to be best friends, so I know he’s not a creep, but I genuinely felt that way back then. Should I contact him and explain everything? Or tell him I don’t hate him? It just feels long overdue, but I’m not sure if this would hurt him more. I can’t imagine the kind of pain I put him through just tossing him aside like that, even though he also put me through some pain. 

Having a friendship end like this was really hard and it just made me so sad. Please give me advice.

I’m also going to seek advice from my friends that know him, but I would like to see opinions from older/ wiser people",09Jun2020,1

457,"Hi all hope you’re doing well! 

To keep a long story short my friend refuses to pay what I want for driving him to a from work which is a job I actually got him. I got him doing the same job and same wage which he would never have gotten in a million years and I think is really awesome! However, I pay $300 for car insurance (BC Canada)- $250 for rent at my parents- my own schooling- and gas and other necessary expenses relating to the car. 

I asked him to pay $25 a week to help with gas and lower my insurance because he is in the car with me 85% of the time which is driving to and from work. He agreed a WEEK before that that’s reasonable and today he comes in my car and gives me $30 biweekly. That’s not even a full tank of gas for me- I told him this and that it doesn’t seem fair to me that I take 30mims total out of my day to make sure he gets to a job that pays well that I got him so he doesn’t have to transit 2 hours a day. He became upset and avoided the conflict because he just wanted to get inside his house.(he then slammed my car door which is a peeve of mine)

His response was also that he doesn’t think he should help with insurance and that $100 is double his phone bill a month so it’s ‘a lot of money’ (srsly? This is a car that gets you $200 a day) he claimed that he can also evo (shared car rental) for cheaper which I looked up and it’s false. It would cost him $200 a month not including gas and registration. 

I really don’t think I’m being selfish here and that he is leeching off me and taking me for granted. I’ve never been one to ask for gas money or money in general because I’ve been well off but when someone is free riding daily it’s when I need something in return. 

How would you handle this situation? 

TLDR: I asked $100 from a friend because he car pools with me daily to a job I got him. He refused and gets upset at me",09Jun2020,1

468,"Hi I'm a student living in central London in a house with 1 other student and we have a nice rear garden. The garden is sandwiched between 2 houses to the left and 4 houses to the right so really there's no entrance from the street to the garden but we do have a massive tree in the neighbours house with all sorts of bird nests and squirrel families. Since covid, we've heard foxes mating and found a big hole in the back of our garden, we covered the hole to stop any animal entering but now we see a fox every day roaming our garden. It's usually not there in the afternoons/early evenings but sleeps on our porch every night and we see it in the morning. It casually chills till about noon before jumping over the wall to one of the neighbour's gardens.

I'm not too worried as long as it doesn't attack us when we're out using the garden, my flatmate wants to call some gardeners to chop up the tree as that might be the fox's source of food and reason to be here.

485,"I HAVEN’T WROTE ANYTHING YET BUT IM ASSUMING THIS SHIT IS GONNA BE LONG SO THIS IS YOUR ONLY WARNING! 

Context: Me (16M) Apples (17F) JJ (16M)
 [Age doesn’t matter much in the story but ig I’ll put it in anyway, also apples isn’t the real name of her]

When I was in 10th grade I met a girl and long story short we locked eyes in class. Idk what it was but my intuition insisted that I at least attempt at getting to know her and bc of the whole or deal I figured I would have a good chance at dating her too. It took me a few months but I finally was able to met her and I took my shot. Her name was apples. She told me that she didn’t want to date anyone and stuff like “u wouldn’t want to date me anyway”. I was hurt but of course I still wanted to be friends so I kept talking with her. 

Fast forward to the end of the school year. I was recovering from a depression mainly caused from the lack of attention I got from her and the fact that it turned out she liked my friend JJ. What I didn’t know before I saw her in class was that her and JJ were friends in middle school. They had some type of beef coming into 10th grade but settled it and now they liked each other. The only thing stopping them from dating was that JJ met another girl at his gym and started dating her in the middle of him and apples confessing their feelings for each other. They both became depressed bc they said they loved each other but it was still confusing considering the fact that JJ started dating that girl and seemed happy about it at first. He started drinking a lot to deal with his depression. It hurt apples and her and JJ fought and eventually they said it was best if they didn’t remain friends anymore. 

In the first month of summer I didn’t say anything to apples. I wasn’t even sure if I liked her anymore but something was bothering me. My intuition still told me to never give up on her or else I would regret it for the rest of my life. It took me a while to build up the courage (bc I was afraid of being left on read and ignored again) but I texted her in the middle of summer. I thought of it as a restart and tbh it pretty much was. We got to know each other better bc she gave me a better chance now. Either that or that this time I had a better charm and personality than the first time. 

We keep talking, it started every once and a while and I was fine with that. Mainly all I wanted at this point was to hear her side of the story between what happened with her and JJ, not so much to be friends or date her; again I wasn’t even sure if I liked her still. It didn’t take long before we talked every other day, then everyday. During that time she told me what happened between her and JJ. 

JJ told her he liked her. She couldn’t make up her mind. She would tell him she liked him back but then have second thoughts and then turn around and say that she liked him again. Finally she stuck with liking him and they started to take things slow but not official dating yet. The farthest they got was holding hands. Next thing she knew he was dating the gym girl. They started fighting and then they called off their friendship. It destroyed her at the time and it hurt him too. I promised not to chose sides but I quickly did and i still have some resentment towards JJ even when I know I shouldn’t. 

Eventually one day she asked me if I liked her. I told her straight up that I did. I knew she didn’t feel the same way and tbh I knew it was also bc she still had feelings for JJ even though all of their stuff happened months before at this point. We were now in 11th grade and not much had changed. I was still getting shut down by her bc she liked JJ and JJ was still dating his gym girl. Despite all of this I was very open with my feelings towards her. I wouldn’t shy from telling her I cared about her so much and that I wanted to help her get over JJ. We both agreed that it was for the best. While we did agree on that I also admitted to her that it had to be her that made the change and that no one else could help her. Despite that I tried forcing things on her. I did have a plan to get her to stop liking him. I didn’t know what would come after she stopped liking him but I knew it was better then letting her get hurt still. 

During the school year they made up and were friends again. I gave her the awful idea to tell him how she felt still and he pushed her away again just as she predicted. It sucked bc I thought about her all the time and I wanted her to be happy above everything else. I had dirt on JJ for the whole year and I had been waiting to use it, that was my plan. One night she had started simping over him again and so I told her what I knew. I reminded her that when they were starting things between each other he betrayed her by dating someone else. Then I told her that JJ had been flirting with a girl in one of his classes. That even if they started dating he always finds a way to hurt the people who love him and that she would have been no different. 

The plan worked perfectly at first. I was so happy for her but more for me. I thought I finally could maybe see her happy and maybe even have a good shot with her now. I worried though. She told me that what I told her changed everything but also that she was pissed off at JJ. I checked in on her a lot and eventually enough was enough. She told me to stop prying information out of her. I didn’t know what she meant bc I truly did not want anything out of her. She told me stop worrying about her and that it was getting annoying. I was confused so I told her that I didn’t know what she wanted and that maybe it was best for us to not talk anymore. I said that bc I was becoming depressed every time something was being her down bc I felt like I failed every time she was sad. When I said I wanted to see her happy I wasn’t exaggerating at all.

The next day I saw her and I apologized for everything and she seemed to be fine she just told me to stop prying again and that I was getting annoying with all the worries like she said the night before. She still didn’t believe me when I said I wasn’t trying to get things from her. 

That weekend she ignored my texts. The last thing I sent her was that I was sorry for what I said about stop talking to her and that if we did I would miss her. She left me on read. 

That Monday I asked her why she ignored me over the weekend. She said she needed space and then I asked if we could talk the next day and she said we will see. 

The next day she came over to where I hangout in the morning and we went away from ppl. She told me that she was going to say what she wanted to say and that I was going to say what I wanted to say and then she was going to walk away. I wrote down what I wanted to say and studied it but I still forgot 3/4 of it and then I decided to tell her I felt like a therapist bc my friends said that. That was the worst thing I could of said bc she went off on me right after. I guess she planned what she wanted to say as well bc she didn’t hold anything back and didn’t even try to remember what to say like I did. I don’t remember a whole lot of what she said and tbh I don’t even remember what I said either. I do remember her saying that she only opened up to me because she felt bad for me, bc no one was there for her and that bc she was weak and still was weak. I’m not 100% sure if I remember the next part correctly but she said something about me changing and that it would be a while till she would be ok with me. I think I told her I would change and as she walked away she said something like “humans act on habit.” My phone was taken away that week but soon found out she has blocked me. 

And so I had 3 worth while interactions with her. The first was her sitting with JJ at lunch and then packing up once they saw me. That one hurt me bc JJ being apart of my group knew that I would be headed over there which made me feel like he did it on purpose. The second interaction was me giving her a Christmas gift. I knew she didn’t want to talk but I always did want to give her something so I stupidly still did. She said she was still mad and couldn’t take the gift so I told her that I didn’t care what she did with it just as long as she took it. The 3rd time was somewhat recent. It was the last day of school until we shut down. I wanted to apologize to her. I missed her and it had been months and was worried she would never forgive me and so I waited near by the buildings we locker was at. Unfortunately she walked right in front of me and I looked sus af bc it was like I was camped out where she entered the school waiting for her. The truth is that leading up to this day I had attempted to say something to her but could never get the courage. I was completely terrified but I knew that day that I didn’t have any more time left. She walked pass me and I chickened out again. I had one more shot bc I knew she would walk out the building and I could say something to her. She walked out and i asked if we could talk. She said she didn’t want to talk to me and that she had a test she had to take. I went after her and that’s where I mostly blank. I know I was trying to keep  up bc she was walking fast. I remember I enjoyed hearing her voice again even if she was mad at me and I remember that I was nervous as all hell. I told her sorry but I have no idea what I said after that. I was frustrated that she wouldn’t even have the decency to just stop a second and listen. It was a sorry excuse for an apology. It only lasted seconds and then she said something but I didn’t even hear it. I just turned around and walked away. 

My other friend had a class with her and he told me that she broke down in class. It fucking broke me writing that. All I wanted was to make her happy and now I had the thought that I added to her stress. Also I had that my ego is too big, that I had nothing to do with her breakdown and that it bothered me that I wasn’t a part of it. Either way I felt like absolute shit. 

Still today she had me blocked. Or at least I think. I got rid of all ways of contact with her so even if she did unblock I wouldn’t even know. I miss her. I want to move on but she made me happy and I fell in love with her to be quite honest. This isn’t the first time I’ve asked this question on this site but I want to know how I could move on. I can’t seem to figure it out ever. I spend my days not even thinking of her at all and then at night when I’m alone I think about how all I want is to tell her about my day and learn about hers. There were times when I would have a shitty day and she would ask me how my day was and I would tell her it was fine now that I look back on it. It wasn’t bc it really was a fine day; it was bc now that I was with her things were much better. I think back and I cringe with all the stupid teen love stuff I said and dramatic things I did but I also think of how happy she made me and that’s what I don’t think I’ll experience from a person for a long time. It’s funny bc despite everything I still don’t regret anything. Truly, no matter what I say, I know my intuition was correct when it told me never give up on her. 

I miss her and I always will. 

Please someone tell me how do I get over her.",09Jun2020,1
486,"So because of the covid deal my girlfriend of 6 months moved in with my parents and I after we were both living in dorms because she couldn't get a ride to her mom's house 4 hours away. She said she only wanted to stay a month tops but its already been two months and whenever I ask her on when she's planning on moving home (we told her we would drive her) and she said she doesn't know and then changes the subject.

The biggest problem is that prior to us moving out of dorms I was already having mixed feelings about our relationship and wanted to break up, however there was a flurry of days where we all had to move out of dorms where her and my parents made plans for her to move in with us, i wasn't given much of a say but also I didn't want her to be stuck with no way to get home because I still care about her as a friend so I agreed.

I also don't have great mental health and need my own space and alone time or else I start having depressive episodes, and once she moved in she's been sleeping in my bed, barely leaves my room and never gives me my own space which is beginning to put me into a depressive episode on top of having 3 online classes that are stressing me out. She also uses me as an emotional absorber, and mentally I don't have the room for that right now. On top of that I can't break up with her like I wanted to because she's living in my house and I'm pretty much melting down mentally and never dont feel stressed, she also wants to have sex alot but with all this stress I just can't do it and I don't want to have sex with someone I don't view romantically anymore (I still see her as one of my best friends though).

I'm just very lost and feel trapped, does anyone have any advice on how to handle this? Also its now safe for her to move home because her town has zero cases of covid.",09Jun2020,11

HOWEVER she said “I’ll be here Tuesday so just come in an hour early before your orientation and we’ll do it”. I didn’t catch it at the time and just said okay.

But now im stuck. I dont have time to call and ask but Im not sure whether to go in at 9 am today (Tuesday) or 9am tomorrow (my actual orientation day)

My grandma, 90, has been staying with my aunt in the time of COVID, but she needs more care and on Thursday will be moved into an assisted living facility. It doesn’t allow visitors because of the virus, and that feels indefinite right now. I’ve been video chatting regularly but her memory is going and they’re usually short. I don’t know if we’ll be able to keep those up when she moves.

I haven’t visited literally anyone in months but this afternoon I’m going to my aunts to see her. We’ll be outside but it will be damn hard not to give her a hug. And while we aren’t saying so explicitly, it feels very much like this will be saying goodbye. Maybe she’ll stay healthy through the rest of quarantine, but she’s 90, and even if there’s not an outbreak in the home, she’s been deteriorating the past few months anyway.

I love her so much. We’ve always been close. I’ve been walling myself off from the most emotional parts of COVID as much as I can but I can’t sleep and just keep thinking about how that short visit will go, and the horrible likelihood that it’ll be our last.

493,"So I’ll try to keep it short. I (F, 20) have never ever smoked a cigarette in my life, but often I realize I have the sudden urge/impulse to smoke a cigarette. I am educated enough to understand that they’re horribly addicting and damage your body really terribly on the long run, but I still feel like I need to smoke one sometimes. (I just realized I am under a lotttt of stress rn and had the urge to smoke thus bringing me here lol). 
Background: my dad has been smoking since before I was born and is perfectly healthy now so I feel like I may have developed some desire for nicotine via secondhand-smoke? After he and my mom divorced I came into contact with his cigarette smoke a lot less. Even now, I tell him to quit every time I see him do it, but i secretly enjoy the smell..... (gross, ik). I like walking by someone when they’re smoking bc of it. 
I have been offered cigarettes a few times by some college friends but I always decline out of fear i will get addicted and disappoint my friends and family (bc they know smoking is bad but i know it too!!) AND bc they’re just unhealthy, period. I have never firsthand done anything w nicotine, but have hit a joint with tobacco in it, so I know i’m willing to try new things lol. but i hate cigarettes? but want to smoke them? 

Any advice on why this urge could be so strong sometimes? Should I go to a therapist for this? lol I worry sometimes

497,"Hello, I've seen a lot of online literature aimed at how to talk to you kids about racism, but nothing on how to address racist parents. 

My Mum has said some pretty ghastly things about the BLM movement and the current state of affairs globally when it comes to black people. 

She said how George Floyd was a criminal, how black people should.move on from slavery and that Jews don't go on about the holocaust. 

This seems kinda uncharacteristic for her, as if she has read right wing articles and tarnished herself.

Me and my brother are BLM supporters and advocates of the protests, but talking to our extremely stubborn mum about it is ruining our relationship.

502,"Please read this entire post. We have literally known each other since middle school and gone through high school and college together. However, she’s extremely immature for her age and she has been non stop pissing me off, pushing my buttons, and pushing every single boundary with me. and i honestly can’t take it anymore. She has a past history of abusive relationships but absolutely refuses to seek therapy or help for it. She literally said that she will never get help for her problems. Which I was willing to accept. However, she got involved with another abusive boyfriend. This time, I made it clear that I didn’t want anything to do with him at all. I told her that I didn’t want to see him, speak to him, or get to know him whatsoever. It was a subject that I was not willing to talk about. 

So what does she do? She adds me and him to a group chat on Snapchat without even telling me. this ultimately led up to a massive blowout fight between me and her boyfriend where he accused me of cheating with her and a bunch of other crazy shit. When I get angry and tell her I’m upset that she did that, she tells me to get the fuck over myself and then it’s not a big deal. I never brought it up again. and she still continually sends me photos and videos of her boyfriend and how cute he is when I’ve explain that I don’t wanna hear about it.

my final straw, however, was on June 2. I spent $350 on Jeffree Star make up palettes for her as a birthday gift and a graduation gift. this was really huge for me as I really wanted to do something big for her to show my appreciation of her friendship over the years. It really meant a lot to me. Like a lot. Well, she accidentally gave me the wrong address to her house which is understandable. Everyone makes mistakes. But, what happened next literally makes my blood boil. I told her to please go talk to her neighbors and get her package back as her neighbors had taken it from her. (I have proof of this) She flat out refused. She said her boyfriend would take care of it but he never did. In fact, she promised me that on June 8 she would get it back, but instead fucked her boyfriend and ignored me for the rest of the night. It’s been a week and the package is gone for good now. She never got the package back to this day. She never even called the sheriff or cops to try and get it back either. She never even knocked on their door. She made no effort whatsoever to get my package back. It literally broke my heart. i’m not trying to be selfish because I understand that it was her gifts and she can do what she wants with them, but her complete disrespect and lack of caring towards me is too much at this point. I’m literally so hurt I can’t even put it into words. I just lost $350 for no reason.

I am so angry and upset at her for her complete selfishness and disregard for my feelings that I am thinking about ending the friendship once and for all. I sent her a funny meme to try and lighten things up today and she just left me on open for the rest of the day. I’ve had enough of her shit and I just don’t know what to do. I feel so disrespected and so hurt by the person that I thought was my best friend. Should I end this friendship?",09Jun2020,2

504,"(Don't know if this is the suitable subreddit for this post. Suggestions welcomed for everything, including alternate subreddits)

29F, mar(3yrs), grad, employed.
I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety previously (I'm ok now, though I don't feel I'm cured totally). Although I feel a bit vulnerable, tired &amp; lethargic but I feel at much better place now.

Ive been thinking about getting a higher degree for a few years. I've two options, to get the degree from a well esteemed uni (say M) or an average one (say J). While M is definitely more desired, the schedule will be extremely hectic (for me). J will give me a smooth schedule and won't put too much pressure on me.

While both would be helpful getting further in career, the timings would be a huge issue for M.  I'm scared that the hectic schedule will make me succumb to old depressed and extremely tired myself. My friends have been MODERATELY encouraging me to go for M &amp; I'm glad for their support/boost. However, I get really defensive and irritated if I'm pressurized even a bit. I get scared and my mind fogs. This has affected my previous relationships too. 

I'm now scared to join M as I am pretty sure that it'll affect my mental health. I might again become the old sleep-deprived, irritated, grumpy and depressed me. It'll affect my partner too and I don't want him to suffer at all.

On other hand M MIGHT open new paths for me and I'd feel proud of myself once I've completed the degree. 


So I need advice on two things:

1. Why am I so insecure and become defensive whenever someone pressurizes me? What should I do to become a better me?

2. Whether I should join M or J? M might make me miserable for next 2 years but it'll be a feather in my cap.",09Jun2020,1

I have only lived with girlfriend has her mother for a year and a half as exposition

So to give a good idea what for the  doggies in said incident  are like we have our chihuahua( victim) who we will call OG (our dog), and my girlfriends mother's dog who we will call (MD), mother's dog who is a chihuahua mix 

This happend almost a week ago up until yesterday, my girlfriend's mother is very old and cannot life on her own, she lives on 12 acres of property and lets the 5 dogs we have roam freely, the big dogs and small dogs have no problem with each other, however MG snips and has fought with OG from what I'm told.

When the incident occurred girlfriend who was on a conference call (works from home) told me her mother was playing up her phone, i assumed she had forgot my GF was at work so i went to see what she needed. When i went outside i saw our girl just laying there still not moving at all, my heart dropped i ran to her mother and ask what had happened.

She said that dogs had got to her and she couldn't do anything and she was dead, i looked from a distance and was overcome with grief and she wasn't moving at all which i assumed she was dead, hate myself for not checking, i went to tell my gf from what i assumed was the end of her

We cried for a bit then her mother came in and told us she was alive, i sprinted as fast i could with blankets/towels i held and saw she was covered in blood and breathing. It was a 40+ minute drive to the nearest emergency vet since we were int he middle of nowhere. 

&amp;#x200B;

Good news shes happy and comfy but looks grumpy at us when we don't let her in my girlfriend's mothers room when her attacker hangs out as well. She is eating and drinking water and im thankful for some extra chonk she has that her mother probably gave her giving lots of treats, otherwise the neck wounds could have been fatal.

The damage was at the neck and stomach which only the stomach required staples, which my GF's friend brought up a scary point she was trying to show being submissive and my MD she tore into her anyway.

My girlfriend proposed to me that we should give her mother the ultimatum of which dog to keep but i cant allow OG to be beat to hell and back, and then ship her off to another family after a terrible experience. Her mother keeps asking where OG and we have to remind her that MD almost killed her.

My gut is telling me it to drop MD off at a no kill shelter with a few donations of food and checking on her, periodically making sure shes ins a good home single dog.

It sucks because we where cuddling in bed with MD and she sleeps with us sometimes, but i cant let her in the same home, i dont know what to do.",09Jun2020,1

She stood on top of me basically watching what I was doing like a hawk. When I kissed her, it was just a peck is all she would give me while looking disgusted I even wanted one.

It was on sale and was pretty cheap for 22 euros and arrived fast from germany to Hungary. BUT on the very first day the app that was advertised with the light stopped connecting (bluetooth) completely. I have tried like fifty other apps and none of them worked. I contacted the seller via amazon but got no response. At this point i was really disappointed and cried for a little while but then i got over it. 

So he's been using it for a week now and suddenly the remote control stopped working too (which was already pretty shit because it only had like 6 colors and a few modes that causes a seizure if you look at it directly). Now i was angry. I emailed the brand again now directly to their ""costumer service"" email but again, no response. 

I know this isn't that big of a problem and it wasn't that expensive but I am a 16 year old with no pocket money so i have been saving up for this for a long time.  I really wanted to give him something he really wanted but i was an idiot and went with the slightly cheaper one instead of trying to get more money for it.. :( i am also not familiar with online shopping and i have never ordered anything from amazon so this has never happened before.

517,"Okay, kind of a rough title, but it's how things are now. To give some backstory:

Me (23/F) and my sister (27/F) don't always get along well. We had our sister fights and a lot of struggles when growing up. Once she moved out of the house we got along really well. So we know we can get along when we don't see each other too much.

Now, I still live at home and doing an (unpaid) internship. This is the last step of my study and after this, I can look for jobs and places to live alone. I do my internship from home because of the whole COVID situation. My sister has her own beauty salon. She is now renovating her house, so she moved her business to our parents' house where I live as well.

There are often two people working with two clients, so it brings a lot of noise. I know it's her only option and she can't do anything about it, so I understand this is a tough situation. I'm sensitive to a lot of stimuli and I'm usually alone at home so this is a lot.

But the annoying part is, that when she doesn't have a client, she comes to me to talk to me. First, it was okay and didn't bother me so much. We are a couple of weeks later and it's exhausting. But what annoys me the most is that she can't take any of criticism, she is the most stubborn person I know. When I calmly tell her I'm working so I can't talk, she doesn't care and keeps talking. So I just stop responding and do my work. Then she gets mad at me for not responding. When I tell her again I have to work, she storms of in a rage and yells at me 'OKAY I'LL LEAVE YOU ALONE THEN'.

I don't want her to be mad at me all the time, but I also don't want her to keep talking to me. I have tried to explain it multiple times, but she just doesn't get it. She always does her own thing in her own way and doesn't care about what others want.

Any advice on this situation? (moving out is not an option)",09Jun2020,1
518,"Last year, I brought the girl I was dating to a friend of a friends party. She’s from another country, so she had never met these people. At the party, someone made a racist joke at her. I didn’t know until after the party when she told me. I don’t think I responded the way I should have. I was more worried about how the situation reflected on me, rather than how it affected her. I don’t think I was empathetic enough. She was always so sweet to me and made it seem like it was all good, that she was indeed disturbed that it had happened, but was all chill. Looking back I think I have to admit that my intentions were very selfish and that she was probably exhausted by my white guilt bullshit..she’s such an amazing person and we still talk almost every day. I hope we can be lifelong friends and I want to be better for her. It’s been over a year now and I’m just now clueing in to my crap. I’m wondering if I should reach out and apologize, or if that would be the wrong thing to do? On one hand, I worry that bringing up such a negative experience that she had would just upset her and force her to relive trauma... on another hand... is apologizing and owning up to it the right thing to do? Perhaps apologizing would just be selfish? Should I just quietly commit to doing better and move forward without saying anything? I’m swimming in my thoughts. I just want to do what’s right. Any advice?",09Jun2020,1
520,So I M34 just found out I'm schizophrenic along with having Post traumatic stress disorder.  I just got a 40 mg injection of Fluaxnol which should keep my schizo defective disorder at bay.  I'm retired military and I'm unemployed. I'm still in a psych ward as I write this . I've been here for 3 weeks and got my own room so now they're allowing me to use my phone for limited time.  Money isnt a concern for me because I have my military pension.  I've been living with PTSD for the past 13 years but now having to deal with hallucinations and delusions really sucks.  Any advice you would give to me about living my life now? Also I'm a recovering alcoholic who just cleaned up his life and I have no goals or direction at the moment.,09Jun2020,2
523,"Sometimes I just stop replying to all my Snapchat’s for a week or a month. It’s easy to do as I work a lot, but it’s deeper than that. Even to my friends, I have too much anxiety to even message them back. It gets to be a day or two and I feel bad for not getting back to them, but usually I end up just ghosting people. A lot of people know about my anxiety and depression, so they still reach out sometimes though. I don’t really want to hang out or see anyone sometimes though. How do I get better?",09Jun2020,4
524,"I'm 22 years old, unsure about my future. I have tuition free college due to financial aid/earning a scholarship out of high school (had to take years off for medical reasons) and live at home. We live about 11 miles from the college, and my parents don't want to move closer because they'd have to live in a smaller place and/or a not as nice neighborhood for some years. (I start this fall and the lease is due next month). They're retired thanks to my dad's retirement pension from serving in the Navy. It irks me that my parent's don't seem to care about my future as they're not willing to sacrifice a little bit that would go a long way for me (for example, buying a hooptie car). No college savings whatsoever. Strangely, my sister is starting her first year at the same college and they still weren't convinced we should move closer. For the record, I dropped out at 18 and eventually was accepted for SSI my first try at 19 or 20 because I was very, very ill. Mentally and physically. Luckily for me, I kept trying to recover.. it took years and I'm still not 100%  yet.

Because I think about things realistically, I know that I probably won't be able to keep up with a 1.5 hour bus commute twice a day during weekdays for 4 years. I could potentially schedule my classes on the same day, but that's not a guarantee. And I'm not very confident about driving. I was diagnosed with cognitive impairment about two years ago, and the last time I tried driving (three years ago) I knew there was no way I could possibly safely drive on a freeway or just in general. I've made improvement with brain functioning but still wouldn't fully trust myself behind the wheel quite yet. 

There's also the fact that my college knows my mental health diagnosis and could possibly stigmatize me in unforeseeable ways to undermine my attendance there. Similar to how a boss can't fire someone in a certain situation, but can try to make them quit. All I'm saying is that it is a real possibility.

Unlucky for me, I haven't been able to experience having to work a minimum wage job to realize it's not enough to live off of and to foster that drive to complete a college degree. I did well in high school despite almost dropping out due to mental health issues. The problem is I'm a little bit strapped for opportunity because if I fail college, I have a mental health diagnosis that means I'm essentially banned from all branches of the military unless I get my record expunged. And my family and myself have no social connections to get me into jobs that I have some type of skill in. Namely video editing. I had a mentality before I got sick that I didn't need college as I had the confidence to build my own business or become a self-taught programmer. However, life took some twists and turns leaving me without much self-motivation. Although I'm good at discipline, I've come to learn that sometimes it's simply not enough.

I didn't waste the entirety of the four years, I learned a whole lot. Though, a lot of it was focused on trying to recover my mental problems then subsequently the cognitive impairment that was left afterward (nicer word for brain damage).

I can't think of a real plan B if I fail, as the likelihood of me enduring a lot more suffering seems to be likely. Things might get even tougher than the situation I'm complaining about.

Would you say it's just a matter of soldiering through, or what?",09Jun2020,1
525,"16f, currently dating the person who’s been in my life for roughly 4 years. We’ve dated a few times and mostly broke up due to me moving or my commitment issues (relationships scare me) but this time feels so different. I really really care about him, I feel so free and unjudged and loved when we’re on the phone. And I know “it’s just teenage love” but I really care about him and I don’t know how to correct the mistakes I’ve made. I’ve gone into little space sometimes (a state where I am extremely submissive) and sometimes someone will be like “send daddy pictures” or sometimes I’ll be in a manic phase and someone will say that or something similar. And I haven’t exactly mastered telling people no. Perhaps because of my young childhood abuse I no longer value myself? But either way, I know that sending pictures to people is wrong. And I know that it would absolutely crush my boyfriend. I’ve cried so much over the topic and today I decided to text anyone who’s ever received my pictures and try to have them all deleted. I told my boyfriend of this in case anyone tries to send him my pictures or expose me out of anger for me wanting my pictures deleted. But I don’t know what else to do. I don’t want to be living a lie with him but I also don’t want to loose him. Someone help",09Jun2020,1
527,"I'm a 17-year-old male and my gf is a 16-year-old female. I had trouble problems with ejaculating or feeling any pleasure until we tried to have sex with no condom and I would basically use the pull out method and it's been great, but this time was different. So yesterday me and my gf were in the shower and we ended up having sex them we agreed to wait to get to the bedroom and continue there. And so we did, but this time I started to feel weak and tired as if I orgasmed, but no sperm was leaking out of my penis, not even any a wet spot on my boxers. So I asked my gf if she felt anything shoot inside her and she said no, so we was very scared and I started to get really scared and my anxiety started to kick in real hard like it usually would after sex most of the time. So I start to search up things and never really found anything other than retrograde ejaculation, but idk if it could be that. On my way home my gf did tell me that she felt that my penis felt cold then warm. My girlfriend and especially me are extremely worried and wondering if we should go buy a plan b.

528,"Hello dear redditors. Im kinda new to this place and its my first time posting. Just, this situation happened with my bf and I thought maybe I can get some help from you guys cuz Im kinda going crazy.

Some backstroy:
My bf and I attend the same uni. We were friends first before we confessed our feelings for each other. Now we've been together for like 3 months but there has been a quarantine since the night we confessed and he lives in another city so we havent seen each other since.
Now, in our squad are two girls and three boys 'besides us'. Im fine with all of them, but kinda closer with one of them. Lets call him Jack. Now Jack, Jack isnt my type at all. But he is a good company to have around and I wnjoy the feiendship I have with him. My bf is pretty close with Jack too. In fact he was the first person to know about us. My bf told him first. And he is always saying how he is a good and supportive friend.

Now, our relationship had a kind of rough start, but we've been going smooth for months now. But recently I've been sensing that he is reluctant to text me or like he vanishes mid convo. Yesterday I jokingly confronted him about it and he was like nah what did I do I didnt do that. I didnt mind it, dudes busy. Im not the only priority in his life, he has things to tend to, ok.

But now Jack tells me that, ""after a lot of persuasion"" when the two of them and another one of the gang went out, jack was like ""yeah hows Marie (me)"" and then my bf suddenly lost his cool and shouted like why do you ask me?? You apparently talk to her more than I do.

Im shocked to the core by this. He knows about all the people that used to like me, and he knows how cold and uninterested I act with them. I thought he trusted me. Ffs he was the one that said Jack is a supportive friend and all that. Now he's mad that I sometimes talk with him and what, he thinks sth is between us???? I dont even text him, he texts me whenever he wants to talk and I listen, like maybe once every two or three weeks. And now Im accused of what, talking to him more than my bf?? Or what, CHEATING? Like, wtf??? You were the one that were reluctant in texting and now im accused of talking to others more than you?

Since the start of our relationship was rocky, we learned to be honest with each other and god knows we are. We never had communication problems, i thought if he felt uncomfortable about this he would talk to me about this, not yell at him behind my back. Im not even mad that he thought this, im mad that he didnt talk to me about how he felt. 

What should I do?? Im not lookimg for a fight, I just wanna talk. Should I do the old ""we need to talk"" thing and be straught forward? Should I do the ""is there anything you wanna talk about? You mad or sth? Anything you wanna discuss?"" Or what, start a convo with stg irrelevent and than talk about it???

Sorry for essay length rant guys, I just really need some help. He is a damn good guy and I dont wanna lose what I have with him over things like this.",09Jun2020,1
529,"I'm 18, fresh out of school.

A recent internet scandal, that got famous across my whole country over instagram, trended on twitter involved me(and a couple more people), and it was based on really misguided opinions, fake news and blurred facts. This got famous across my social circle as well and i lost each and every single one of my friends. I tried telling them what really happened, but no one is really willing to listen or give me a chance. 

All the friends i made throughout my school life, every person i considered important to me has removed themselves from my life, abandoned me. Every memory of my school life has been tainted and i feel like a major chunk of my life has been erased from existence. I feel empty, alone, abandoned and i have no one to talk to. My parents deny the fact that my friends left me, because they want to cheer me up(or are in denial themselves, idk) but it only makes me feel worse because i know, that i'm alone. Talking to my parents is out, same goes for my extended family. I have no friends i could talk to, no teacher i was ever close to, basically i'm in this very very alone. 

I feel terrible about myself because I lost everything because of being named in a scandal that I didn't even participate in, i lost everything over nothing.I can't work on myself and I can't do anything productive because i feel very dependent on talking my feelings out instead of repressing them, and keeping them in is not allowing me to focus on anything.

530,"So me (23) and my ex-gf (26) are friends now after she broke up with me a little over a month ago to go on the road of selfdiscovery and learning to love herself for who she is. I still feel there are some feelings between us but that we won’t be together in the near future or ever again. I really do wish her the best and all the love because she deserves it even though she thinks she doesn’t, we’re still friends and meet up and do fun things occasionally. Now I’m not sure to let go or hold on because she broke up with the reason of discovering herself and learning to love herself since she really has a very very very low self-esteem. But now I’m thinking it might be better to met go of that friendship atleast for a while (maybe months maybe +1year) because I think she might hold back on her road to discovering and loving herself as long as I am in the picture and not go all in. I really wish her all the best things in the world and all the love but I really don’t know if she’ll be able to reach that goal since she’ll always look back to me someway even though she won’t admit it. We had the most incredible relationship and I was the only one who’s accepted her on every aspect. All the good and bad. Always been a listening ear. Now I’m questioning if staying friends would be healthy for the long for her road to selflove. I’m still hoping we’ll end up together in the end but know this might be unrealistic. Should I hold on to that friendship or let go to give her the chance to spread her wings like she never did before?",09Jun2020,1
531,"So not too long ago, my girlfriend (we'll call her Makayla) came to me about an issue regarding a friend of ours (we'll call her Weslee). So Weslee is a lifelong friend of Makayla's, and I've known both of them for years as well. But Weslee's a very narcissistic person (glorified self-image, refusal to ever take responsibility for her own actions, etc), and is just generally rude. She does has a soft side, but she doesn't really show it in public. 

So anyway, for years Weslee's been teasing Makayla and others about little things, and calling them names and whatnot. But after a while it got so intense that Makayla became extremely introverted and insecure because of the comments that Weslee always made. So a few days ago we were all at a birthday party and something was clearly bothering Weslee, but she wouldn't say what it was. Makayla asked her a number of times if she was alright, and Weslee always avoided answering. After a while, Weslee just went to a different room and sat alone for a while, not really talking to anyone or letting anyone talk to her.

The following day, Weslee got mad at Makayla for ""not being there"" and ""not asking if she was okay"" (both of which Makayla attempted). Makayla, obviously upset, came to me about it. She mentioned that incident first since it was the subject of the conversation, but then she trailed off into how awful she felt for ""not doing good enough"" to help Weslee, and also how insecure Weslee always made her feel (although it was clearly evident, she had never come forward about it until now). I told her that she wasn't in the wrong and assured her that she tried her best, but Makayla was still feeling like she needed to do better. The next day, Makayla figured out from another friend that was close to Weslee that Weslee apparently said that Makayla ""didn't even try to help"", which then caused Makayla to get really upset again. 

So that night, she told me about what she learned and again told me that she felt awful for not doing a good enough job being there for Weslee. That's when I told Makayla that she should avoid talking to Weslee if she at all can, and that Weslee will open up when she's ready. But among that conversation I told her that her relationship with Weslee really wasn't all that healthy, and that she should probably try and stop interacting with her as much. But the thing is, Weslee has known Makayla even longer than I have, and the two of them have been there for each other almost their entire lives. But even though they frequently tell each other things and vent and help each other, the way Weslee puts Makayla (and others) down all the time is just bad, and it's been shown time and time again to have had a toll on Makayla's health. Makayla told me that she really did love Weslee, but she hated the way Weslee treated her. I told Makayla that she should avoid Weslee for the time being, and that Weslee will come to her about her issue once she's ready and convinced her to just wait for then and to not feel useless for not being able to help (and to try and ignore Weslee's comments, but that's a given).

But I really tried to push the idea that Makayla should try and sever the emotional bond she has with Weslee, and I feel kind of conflicted about that because of how good of friends the two are, despite Weslee's near emotional abuse. So now I just want to know if that was the right thing to do? Like, was it right that I recommended that Makayla stop talking to Weslee for a while? Or was there something I should have done differently?

533,"I’ve encountered an issue with my mom ever since we began self-quarantines and shutting everything down. I returned home during the Uni-semester to live with my mom until my lease for my apartment begins in August. I’m not a very talkative person, I speak very little, because I usually just don’t enjoy talking to people unless it’s something I’m really invested in talking about. My mom, talks a lot about random things that either make no sense to me, or things that I feel like I have no control/helpful advice for. IE; problems with coworkers or my brother not handling certain responsibilities the way she thinks he should... usually I’ll listen to what she has to say for a bit then I’ll end up leaving, or blankly staring off, or I’ll try to respond with the “yes” “wow” “ok.” I’m not doing this to purposefully be rude but because there’s not much  can really think of responding with.

It hasn’t been much of an issue because I’m usually not home, I’m at my university, or when I was in high school, she’d be off at work. During this quarantine though. It’s problematic because I talk to her just about as much as I would if I was in uni, which is admittedly not much. A bit of background before I go on: My mom is a single mother with two sons, one who was raised by our grandmother and not by my mother, and me, whom my mom raised. My dad never married my mom, was admirably remiss in his responsibilities as a dad, but I still loved him and I had a great connection with him, until he died in a car crash a few years ago. I love my mother with all my heart, and honestly I have a paralyzing fear sometimes that overcomes me of losing her.

My mom came to me a couple days ago, in a pretty upset tone, asking why I don’t talk to her or listen to her. She seemed very angry with me. I tried to explain to her this isn’t true, but unsuccessfully. I think it made her more angry. She even tried to say that I “treat my own mother like she isn’t shit.” What can I do about this? I feel like we almost live in two different worlds. My mom has no understanding of the culture I engage in, things like the Internet, video games, social media, the shows I watch or the books I read, my hobbies, or the profession I’m studying. I have little to no interest in what she cares about, old movies, the Bible... I feel like we have no common ground.",09Jun2020,2
535,"Hey guys, I've been in between jobs since i graduated (never held a job for a complete year) for about 4 years now. I've brought up the idea of starting a business (nothing specific) to someone close to me but got told some hard facts. First off, I lack any real experience from any of the jobs I've had. I have terrible people skills, so I don't have a strong network to rely on. I also lack any interest/passion, so I won't be 100% committed to the business.

As much as it hurts to say it, these are all valid points. I'm a lazy bum who spends most of my time on video games and nothing else. I'm here hoping to get advice on where and how do I even begin to improve myself. Also, English isn't my main language so please forgive any errors.",09Jun2020,1
536,"For context, I am white and live in the UK in a suburban, predominantly white area, but close to an area with high concentration of Asian (Indian/Pakistani) heritage. I admit that when I was younger in my teens and early 20's I had some prejudices of my own but have since educated myself to learn about and accept other cultures, whereas my wife seems to have gone in the other direction. I would also say her Dad is also quite racist.
She has had life experiences that have shaped her views to a degree. For instance she used to work at a kids party place where she would regularly have problems with Asian clientele whereby they would try to get out of paying for the parties, she says this didn't happen with her White customers. Also, a couple of miles from us, once you go past the 'border' to the densely Pakistani populated area, there is an immediate difference in driving attitudes, where it feels like the laws of the road don't apply, not stopping for red lights, high incidence of driving without insurance etc (I I someone drive down the pavement 100 yards just to avoid waiting in traffic not long ago). I personally put it down to the fact it's more of a deprived area rather than the ethnicity of the people there.
So her rationale for the views is that blacks/Asians cause more crime, proportionately more likely to be involved in gangs, be absent fathers etc. I say even if true, the vast majority of those people are innocent and do not deserve to be judged because of the minority. I also say on that basis should we judge them as BETTER than us given Asians are also far more likely to be a Doctor for instance?
She would never treat anyone differently based on their colour/ethnicity, or say anything racist to someone, bit the fact she privately holds these prejudiced views upsets me and has caused a lot of tension with us recently, especially since the BLM movement has come to the fore, which I have been a vocal supporter of. I think her view is that Black people are segregating themselves further by talking only about black lives etc, that sort of thing.
So I was hoping people might be able to give some could examples of how to best educate people who hold these views? Have you had similar problems and managed to improve the situation?",09Jun2020,3

540,"I was friends with a girl from when I was 11-15. We were extremely close. I slept over at her house nearly every weekend, we messaged each other all the time, we were always together and we were so close that everyone who knew of our friendship, even her family, thought we were lesbians (we weren’t lol).

We were each other’s only friend up until the last year of our friendship when I befriended two girls in my grade. These girls hated my friend because she was weird, anti social and autistic (undiagnosed but its very obvious). On top of her never answering my messages, constantly leaving me on read and never coming to school anymore without explaining why, we stopped being friends in a big dramatic ‘I don’t want to be friends with you anymore’ kind of way (me saying this, not her). She had never had a friend before me and always said she was glad she had me because everyone else in her life that was family left her. And then, I left her.

I’m 18 now and I think I miss her. Both her and her sister don’t have any social media, at least that I can find but her mum has a facebook account. I was thinking of sending her this:

Now that I am 26, I don't think it is a phase since I am *still* thinking of registering myself as an organ donor.

542,"Hi, so I currently work at McDonalds. I’ve been there for two years, since I was 16. I’ve recently been offered a job at a bank, for £9.50 an hour and I was going to take it until my family all told me I was silly for trying to leave McDonald’s and that it’s the better option, because I know the people, I’m an area leader and in the up coming year I will become a shift manager. 

However, I fail to see how. As an area leader I’m on £8.50 an hour and shift manager wage starts at £9.80. Despite common knowledge McDonalds is easy and for lazy people, I can assure you it’s hard work. Lifting baskets full of nuggets are so so heavy, by the end of an eight hour shift my hands and wrists are shaking and in agony. Lifting fry boxes full of fries and all sorts else, also aches and I usually feel it the next day, it’s like free gym for weaklings like me. Not to mention burns are inevitable in how fast paced our store is, not one kitchen employee is burn free and it sucks, I hate that my arms have multiple scars from either grill or hot oil. My store in particular has been understaffed for nearly a year, which we have all been making up for, working twelve hour shifts most days, six days a week. 

As well, no one enjoys going home smelling of grease and fries. It’s not pleasant. I tried to hand my notice in to McDonalds and they have offered me £9.50 an hour to stay and £100.

548,"Just a background, I am a 22 year old Asian female living with my parents. We are in a foreign country where we need residence visas to be able to keep living here and I am/always have been under my father’s sponsorship. This may be a little long and English is not my first language so please bear with me. 

I am stuck working in our family business which I don’t want to be working in. We run a media business and I am currently working as a videographer/editor. I am not sure this is the career I want to be in forever but it is what I studied in college, which was paid for by my parents. Right now I feel like I am completely dependent on my parents and I absolutely hate the feeling, I really do not want to sound ungrateful at all because I consider myself extremely lucky to have a roof over my head, to not worry about anything financially, but I am sick of feeling non self sufficient. Right now I would really like to be exploring different career paths, I don’t want to regret anything when I am older and right now I feel like I’m running out of time. I have learned a lot of things through our family business of course, skill-wise I wouldn’t be where I am without it, and I owe this to my parents and the business.

The problem lies with my relationships with my folks. It seems like I cannot leave the business without upsetting them and them telling me that the business is the only thing that is keeping us in this country, that they need me and if I leave then we won’t have any money. It didn’t always used to be like this. My parents never expected of me to work in their family business. I graduated college in 2017, I had a tough time finding a job so I ended up spending a year jobless. I finally found one in 2018, I was really good with it, but the company ended up shutting down and I had some problems with my employers and they threatened to sue me in the end. I spent about 6 months working there. After that, my family thought it’d be a good idea for me to help out with the business, since they were really busy that time, and so I did. I told them I would do it for a few months or until I found another job, they kinda just kept shrugging it off, thinking I wouldn’t be able to find one quickly anyway. They also keep instilling into me that working in the fam business makes more money and that you never have to be slaved around by your seniors. Which is true. We do make much more money in our company than say if we all worked under someone else’s company. 

Fast forward to two years later, the present, and I am still working with them. Mainly because we are extremely busy, most days I would be working 70-80 hours a week which is fine, I understand that’s how things go when you run a business, but I am just not happy overall. My skills are definitely better, but I feel like I am not improving as an individual. I still live with parents. I have no real skills dealing with people, etc. I have expressed this with my mom once, I had a conversation with her where I was sobbing telling her how I felt and how I want to be more independent, and she told me that I had the chance to be independent once but I was lazy and couldn’t find a job. And when I finally did I ended up getting almost sued. And who did I run to when I was terrified of getting caught up with the law? My parents. 

Last year I attempted to apply to other companies again. As a waitress, as a video editor for other companies, etc, but I would do it very low key and not let them know I am going out for interviews. I got a few offers, the pay wouldn’t be as good as the pay I am currently getting from my parents and so I never knew whether to accept or not. But more than that it was the fear of getting my parents upset that I would want to work somewhere else when they needed me so much. We have 3 people total in the video department, me along with 2 other guys, and if I left it would be a huge problem for them to continue operating in a normal pace. One time, on a particularly busy day I was not in a good mood, i was working pretty bad, and my father found out that I had gone to an interview after my mom asked me to work on something. He yelled at me saying that “this is the bare minimum you could be doing for the family and you owe it to the business that paid for your college fees, and you chose to go to an interview somewhere else. Don’t you understand that this is the only thing keeping us afloat? And what do you do? You think if you work for another company and you get sued again you won’t come running crying back to us?”

This really discouraged me 100%. I stopped applying to anything and focused on the family business. Things got really busy end of 2019, and then the pandemic happened, and everything slowed down. We aren’t so much struggling financially, but one of our video guys got stuck out of the country and can’t come back, so we only have two people now, me and another guy (he is new and doesn’t completely understand how the business runs. We are very fast paced and he can be a little slow at times). Because the business is slow I thought I would apply to other companies again, but of course it is not completely safe to be working away from home. I haven’t gotten any interviews/offers yet, but I don’t know if I should be. If I do end up getting an interview, I don’t know how I would tell my parents. I know I will get yelled at again, be told that if I left there would only be one guy left, and that they can’t run the business anymore. I know they will NEVER allow me to work outside for another company, especially at this time (they are paranoid about the virus, understandably). It is very difficult to find a job, especially one that pays normal living wages in this climate. I know that if they so much find out that I went for an interview I would get in trouble, and so I am thinking that my last resort would be to maybe live alone with roommates temporarily, until I find a job. Which would not be ideal. It is also illegal since I am under parents sponsorship, and if they decided to report me for running away I could go to jail. 

I would love to hear your thoughts, I really don’t wish to make my parents sound evil, I love them a lot, but my relationship with them right now is extremely strained because of all of this. I used to be so close with my mom before I started working with them but now I can’t even give her a hug because we are so emotionally distant. My dad has always been verbally abusive towards me, and I have had many emotional issues because of it but it still doesn’t mean that I don’t love them. We still have good times together and I just don’t want to disappoint them too much. 

I guess my current goal right now is to find a new job and be able sustain myself. My ultimate goal is to do all that and be able to live alone on my own. 

Thank you so much if you have gotten this far I know this was quite a lengthy read. 

TL;DR: I am working in family business I don’t want to be in, but I can’t leave because I don’t want to make parents unhappy. It is also the only thing that is keeping us in the country, and if I left it would be difficult for them to operate normally. I cannot run away and live alone without their consent as I am under their visa, and if I tried to run away I could get in trouble. I want to be completely self sufficient, get a job, build upon my own career, and live alone.",09Jun2020,3

551,"I have a boyfriend for about one month now. Before we actually started this relationship, we had a very long time of talking and getting to know each other, so it feels like it’s been 4-5 months. 

This week wasn’t my best week. I feel stressed out and useless. I acted stressed and annoyed towards him. I know it’s wrong of me to be like that. I do. But it was an impulse because of different things that’s happened and that he said or made me feel like. I know it’s no his fault, i dont blame him, but this did have an impact on my behavior. 

Yesterday i tried telling him that i’m not always as calm and silent as he claimed that i am. I wanted to tell him that i’m just very chill when i’m with him so the outgoing side of me isn’t always there when we’re just chilling. He thought that i meant that he doesnt know me at all, while i was just trying to tell him that he might not have seen that side of me. He thinks im covering myself up for him and that im not myself when im around him but that’s not what i meant at all. I’ve explained it in a different way again but he doesnt believe it. I thought my first explanation was clear enough for him to understand it the way i meant it, but apparently it wasn’t so thats why i explained again.

I dont know whether i explained this good enough, but this is what comes to mind atm.

I really don’t want to lose him. I have spent all day in bed yesterday with the curtains closed. I felt so lost and fucked up. This morning i woke up and instantly cried because of what’s happened. I know I can’t force him into anything and is he really wants to end things i cant change that, but i really don’t want things to end because of this misunderstanding and because of my behavior due the bad week i had. What do i do?

Normally i’m not like this. I never really react like i did this week. Idk why, but i just feel really off and i know that doesn’t count as an excuse for my behavior, but in a way it did have some influence on it.

He is not really the forgiving type, while i forgive too much and too easily. I always blame myself while he might also have done some things or said things that are not ok. I always sat sorry and i always feel like everything is on me. 

I really want the best for him and i really care a lot. I love him and i hope he knows. I really dont want to lose him.

553,"Hi, I’m (17F) and I live in constant pain, what ifs and regret because I harbor so much self hatred. From forever I remember being and feeling anything but pretty, boys never looked at me, I was the awkward looking black girl. Too dark, too tall, hair too kinky, eyes too dark...melanin too melanin. I definitely have grown out of my ugly phase, I know I’m not ugly ( I’m a good 8/10 8.75 on a REALLY good day) but I have never really felt beautiful.

556,"Here's some context, I [26f] live in a middle eastern country and I have 4 brothers, throughout my life and even during my earliest years I remember my mother whispering to my brothers about how ugly/horrible I am, she used to curse me, neglect me, physically and emotionally abuse ( one session of flogging lasted 10 minutes and them my father took over, and I have a white hair that grew back then when i was a fourth grader) me and even pray for my death ( she used to stand on the praying mat and say oh god as i stand and pray for you please take away my daughter's soul and rid me off her), she was never proud of me, although I did everything imaginable, I was always top of my class amongst other amazing things 
When I was in primary school, I used to wash my school uniform with my own hands and I did until high school, she never packed my lunch but she packed my brothers' lunch, she never offered mother/daughter advice about hygiene and I figured it all out by myself, the only thing close to an advice was how important my virginity is and that if she ever catches me talking to a boy she would have the men in the family kill me, i was 7 when she said that

My mother used to not talk to me for weeks or months, not even ask me to come for lunch or dinner, for stupid mistakes, but she was always the first to apologize to my brothers who were the ones to start a fight with her or yell at her. When I got older, she always pointed out how skinny and dark I am, she told me I'd never be interesting to any man, and she applied me to med school because she thought it'd make more sense for a man to want me if I'm a doctor, but I had a breakdown once and pretended to hang up on her, and I heard my father saying bring her back home and let her rot in this house, to which my mother answered who would want an ugly shitty girl for a wife

My mother physically abused me and allowed me father to abuse me while she watched and laughed. 

When i graduated I had to stay home for 1 month applying for internships, she would wake me up every morning and threaten to throw me away like a ""dog"" ,and during that time my brother was fired because he showed up drunk to the office, she never said anything like that to him, although this has happened 3 times.
Recently, she has been emotionally abusing me by creating imaginary problems and scenarios and telling me that I'm good for nothing, just yesterday she hung up on me because my brother said a hateful prayer to me, and when i said it back she went crazy and said i shouldn’t talk to him like that. bare in mind I'm a resident in a very good hospital while 3 of my 4 brothers are jobless, she was talking about my brother and how he moved out, how she'd love to have him back so that she could love him and cook and clean for him, I almost snapped but I held back 

My mother never loved me, I know in my heart that everything she did for me was to make me more appealing for the future husband, she got me so much gold and said any man who sees this would want you, and pretty much anything she does or buys is only because she wants to marry me off as soon as possible.

558,"I'm about to graduate college and I'm living in the Bay Area with my best friends. Three of us live in the room, and although we all have had different standards of social distancing and concerns about the pandemic, we've found ways to compromise. We rent the house together during the school year and I figured that if I'm paying rent I may as well live here. I'm choosing to stay here also because my mental health is not that great when I'm in my hometown and also my family is very restrictive when it comes to their social distancing. Usually I'm blocked off from the rest of the house and it's very lonely. 
A few days ago, both of them got jobs at this bar/restaurant in a really touristy part of town. We all celebrated and of course I was happy for them but I was uneasy at the thought of them being essential workers on the front lines. They were hired on the spot and started the morning after so I really didn't have any time to discuss it with them. But the snippets that I did hear: that the manager asked one of them to take off her mask so that she could see her face, concerned me about the steps that the bar is taking to protect their employees. After they got back, I asked how their day went and they told me a bunch of stuff that really concerned me. Basically everyone in that store acknowledged that a second wave was bound to happen, with tourists coming in from the epicenters of the virus, and that it was packed that day and only going to get more crowded. Maybe I'm overreacting but it looks like it's not a matter of if they'll be exposed, but when. 
 I'm totally sympathetic to their situations and I understand that, even though that spot pays minimum wage, they get a significant amount of cash tips. However, they aren't really hopeful about the idea of getting a safer job. One of the girls just got hired at a sandwich shop that does takeout or delivery, but she said that she wants to keep the bar job as well. I respect their decision and after giving it some thought I decided that I was going to let them know that I was planning on moving back home based on the situation. I realized that I came across as abrupt since the whole timeframe moved fast. I let them know when they came back from their first shift, but I planned to leave before the incubation period just to be safe. 
It's harder for me to decide what to do because none of us want me to leave but also they don't want to change to a safer job. I spent about an hour today helping them update their resumes and sending them job applications, but I don't think they'll be open to it.
 From my perspective I'm not consenting to the risk of exposure that they're practicing and I'm not getting paid to compensate for that risk either. I'm dipping into my savings so I can afford to stay home and avoid getting sick so I feel that if I get sick from this it would all be for nothing. Also, I recognized that I have privilege in the fact that I have the option to move home and go to a safe place and not have to choose between paying bills or risking exposure. Many of my friends don't have that luxury or option. From their perspective I can see how by letting them know about my choice it seems like an ultimatum. They told me that they understand where I'm coming from but they wish that I could just stay and they would disinfect things. Personally I'm not too concerned about touch surfaces, but I do know that most people are infectious before symptoms show and we share everything, bathroom, kitchen, we all sleep in the same room etc. 
I know that the most logical solution is for me to go home before the incubation period begins and ride out the rest of the lockdown there. However, I'm going to miss my friends and I know that my mental health won't be great. Also, I would hurt their feelings by leaving.

559,"This is my confession which solidifys me as a sad virgin boi

It all starts about a week or so before boomer doomer hits, I'm a 17m who has zero relationship experience. Despite this, I end up at a party, I get drunk, I get horny, I end up making out with some girl ive seen once or twice, fun night right? Well call her Obama

Since I seriously dont have anyone else to crush on, I obviously attatch to Obama insanely quickly, nevertheless fast forward a week and we all in online learning. This is perfect to get close to Obama bc she goes to a different school than me, her and a bunch others make a group chat together to talk while doing school. This is the beginning of confusing times.

What proceeds is the dumbest game of cat and mouse which would make Tom and Jerry jealous, I think Obama is interested in me at one point, then I don't, then I do, then I don't. Keep in mind I have no idea how this relationship thing works, so im going off guesses. Despite restrictions, we find ways of hanging out together, some with me and her and others with a group, going *amazzzzzzing* right?

Now comes to the great let up. Me, Obama and a few others go a park, we hang out, eat KFC and end up at what I now call the dreaded park bench of broken dreams (part bc of another relationship that was also suposedly blossoming until it didnt very recently, not my story to tell thou) Obama grabs my fucking leg and tells me afterwards how much she wanted to make out with me, one can maybe tell that she most likely is into me, I have never expirienced something like this before, and Im very happy about it, I go home happy as can be.

We watch a few movies together though discord 1on1 so I think she likes me right? **FUCKING WRONG YOU DUMB BITCH.** I got bated so fucking hard bc only a few short days mf friendzoned me, how? she wasnt trying to lead me on, I don't think she had bad intentions its mostly mental illness thats making her do these things, in fact this could of gone on longer if her friend didn't step in.

This is not too bad for what im about to tell you, but I get a little upset for a day and I get over it, I bottle it up like everything else and try not think about it.

Funniest lie I ever told myself btw, I actually managed to convince myself that I was over Obama, how helarious right? well my friend it gets worse

Now this is when it gets really bad. I find out three weeks later that Obama is crushing on another guy, we will call him Putin, who is an old friend of mine who I very much respect and still do. We go to another party, I get drunk and Obama gets drunk. Obama has plans to win Putin over, however I believe that this won't happen, does not seem like something that Putin was into.

Now comes the fuck me part, after she drunkenly asks out Putin he becomes intrested, my god. Putin leaves, me and Obama and a bunch others stay to sleep for the night. I get the Plesure of hearing Obama sound off everything she likes about Putin right fucking next to me, she is drunk and thinks he rejected her so shes saying shit like 'why cant I find a guy like him' honestly I dont fucking think she even remembers what happened between me and her mf I have to suck it in and pretend like i'm not fucking hurt by that, which upsets the fuck out of me, but im the master of hiding emotions so no one caught on thankfully.

I kust got a text from her earlier saying how shes gonna go out with Putin a couple times and see where it goes. I'm happy for Obama sure but cmon its like I never existed.

Now comes to this moment, I have never had a girlfriend ever and I don't see me getting one any time soon, I'm not pissed that she moved on, I'm just pissed that she was able to move on to someone else so quickly, I don't have anyone to have any kind of crush on, so I am just kinda here now, this love thing kinda sucks if all ill ever get is lead on and disappointed, I can't talk about this to anyone bc I suck at reaching out and afraid of consequences so im ranting here

Hey guys, I'm new to this subreddit but I've come to ask for help because I'm in desperate need of advice on what to do. I am going through a lot of pressure from my parents to decide on what to do next.

Before I tell you guys what my dilemma is I think it's appropriate to give you guys background information/timeline on my education (very confusing, can skip if you want). Around 2013 I moved to Malaysia from Sri Lanka and started my Grade 5 (I was 9) education in an International school, Around Grade 10 Term 1 (2018) my family had decided to move to Singapore since we all had Singapore Permanent Residence and so I started Secondary 3 Express (Government) in Singapore which was a very hard change for me especially because the environment in Singapore education is very much competitive. After 2 very stressful Terms and on the verge of giving up my parents saw the change in my performance and discussed in putting me back to my old International School in Malaysia and so that's what happened, I returned to my previous school in Grade 11 and I missed 2 Terms worth of education. I definitely found it easier than Singapore but all the time I missed was still hard for me to catch up to but I tried, I took my IGCSE mocks and I did horribly for some subjects and unexpectedly did great for others, but I kept studying for IGCSE, because of COVID my parents felt they wanted me to return to Singapore to stay with them and study in Singapore for a while till this cools down and when i came the borders shut down so I couldn't go back for classes but a few days later we got the news that the exam we have been preparing all our secondary lives for years has been canceled :| and this is the problem. My results would all be predicted which isn't very convenient for me as I haven't done so well recently as I've moved schools so much in the past few years. The school is trying to give us all 5 credits which hopefully would apply for my report card too. I'm getting my results in August and I have so much time on my hands and my parents want me to do something but I REALLY DONT KNOW WHAT I CAN DO.

I am interested in Business and it looks like if my choices are in Singapore (maybe Overseas) but I don't know anything about Higher Education, I don't know what a diploma is, a degree is, or anything like that, I've come to the conclusion that I've really not improved in education as I used to get A's and A\*'s but now I get F's and UG's. I'm sorry if what I'm asking is stupid but I really am desperate for help. Thanks to everyone who can help me in advance.",09Jun2020,2
562,"Long story short I’ve had a really really seriously fucked up rough life. Almost every form of trauma you can name I’ve been through. Recently though things have gotten way worse because of corona and my mom and I keep fighting and the girl I was talking to for months broke things off with me and my current friends barely talk to me and never see me. Everything just kept building up and up and up.

Tonight it truly felt like no one cared at all. I was sitting alone in my room with my thoughts and realized that I needed to get out. For the past few weeks now I’ve been contemplating Suicide a lot. I’ve almost ubered to freeways or lookout points just to sit there and think about jumping. I’ve thought about running away. Everything ok.

Then I posted on my private story on snapchat (has 7 ppl on it) 3 videos of me talking and crying and walking by myself in the middle of the night on the street saying that I didn’t know where I was going or what I was going to do because of how hopeless I was.

The girl who used to talk to me constantly swiped up and told me to stop being a bitch and actually try in life. This was after earlier that day too when she said we weren’t friends but that she’d still be here for me to talk if I needed it (which doesn’t make any sense either and just made me more confused). And that conversation went back and forth of me saying no one cares about me and why bother trying and then her trying to encourage me in a blunt way. At one point she said “ok don’t listen to me then” “keep doing what you’re doing and it won’t change” or something like that. And I said “so kill myself?” And she asked if that’s what I’ve been doing sarcastically. I told her I’ve been hurting myself which is true. And she said that she did care about me when I tried in life but stopped when I did. And I asked if she’d care if I try. And she said she does care but doesn’t want to talk about it anymore. So I said okay and said sorry because it felt like me talking about any of this (even tho she asked me about it) felt wrong. And I told her I was going to bed. She said yup and left it at that.

My question now is that am I a horrible human being? I didn’t threaten her that I’d kill myself if she left. I never have, never will, because that’s disgusting. I just posted about not being able to take everything that’s going on anymore and when she swiped up and talked to me about it I was honest about how I felt. It feels like I’m the bad person for asking if she cared or will care. It feels like I indirectly did something or threatened even though I know I didn’t. I’m scared and feel guilty now. What if she feels like I did? Did I do something wrong? Everything feels like it’s breaking. I don’t know what to do.",09Jun2020,0

565,"I'm in a relationship with someone that my family doesn't know about.  While entering into this relationship, I voluntarily gave my wife's and daughter's contact information (phone and email) to him.    The idea was that this would ensure my loyalty and adherence to the terms of the arrangement, the idea being that if I didn't, he has lots of embarrassing and incriminating material on me that could be revealed.  At the time I thought it was just something to add a little excitement and edgy mood.

Fast forward a bit and I know he's chatting online with my daughter.  He didn't tell me directly, but he told me something about her that he couldn't have known otherwise (and continues to occasionally).  He clearly has no intention of stopping.  So this has gone from a play situation to actual blackmail.

I thought of blocking his email and phone number on their devices, but he could just create new ones so there's no point to that.

Medication: Not on any medication or drugs

General health: Haven't maybe been living the healthiest lifestyle since corona doesn't really allow me to go to the gym but I'll still kept a good diet and sleep pattern.

So I didn't really have a that bad of a porn addiction before this happend even though I did it about 3 times a day I could stop without any major troubles and it felt amazing every time I did it. But about three times a day I went through some very rough stuff in life and it all went over today(it wasn't something like deep depression it was more of a physical thing that could be solved instantly like that) but those days I genuinely didn't feel like masturbating because I was so down I barely thought about it, but now when it's all good again I decided to masturbate again like I usually do, but this time it close to an hour(it usually takes about 5-15 minutes) to cum which doesn't sound like a problem but shouldn't 3 days of waiting should reduce time? And even worse when I came I felt next to nothing. And a few hours I came I tried to get an erection going again to see if it's really working, and I could get it somewhat aroused but not near full form, and before this I could get a full erection just minutes after masturbation.

571,"I'm interested in applying to the JET program. JET brings native english speakers to Japan to help teach English. I would love to do this and have a high chance of acceptance with my crientials.

However what's holding me back from applying is my cat. I love my cat and she is very attached to me. Even when I left her for a month she was stressed. I felt so awful when I was away from her and worried about her every night. 

The Jet program is 10 months. I'd be away from her for 10 months and I don't know if I could do it. But this is the only time I'd be able to do the program. Technically I can bring her with me, but the program highly discourages it due to the cost of bringing a pet, and the very few apartments that allow pets.

I'm not sure what to do.",09Jun2020,1
572,"Hello there!
So here’s my situation: I work as a lawyer and I’d consider myself as average good paid for this kind of job. In average I earn 4000,- Euro net.
During m studies in my twenties I already worked in different jobs like McDonald’s or at gas stations and I started an insurance for the case I’d be not able to work anymore.
Lately I had an accident from which I cured quite well so far and I absolutely don’t have any limitations anymore. But, because of some phrases in my insurance contract and I would be able to go into retirement already now. I calculated I‘d get exactly 3.267,16 Euro net for the rest of my life. This amount is under inflation and I’d get every year 5% more.
I wouldn’t be allowed to work anymore if I take the money. 
I have a wife and a daughter. I could spend the time raising my child. I also thought about going to another country where things are cheaper.

Mostly I consider to go into retirement because I started to hate my job. It’s not because of the company I’m working for, it’s because of the work I do. I wasn’t happy in my job anymore for more than 1 year now.

my parents have been through a lot. they’re tired. if i could make a wish itd be to liberate them from capitalism. but we dont live in that america.

i’m 26 and send money home every month. i’ve been doing so since i’ve started making any kind of money but now i’ve taken over the entirety of their rent and living. i’m a designer i dont make much, i’m cutting into my savings. i don’t want my dad to return to uber driving out of concern for being a target of racial slurs/attacks/aggression. obviously he’s been through that having moved to Virginia like 50 years ago. enough is enough.

what should he do? i’m at a loss. they have a lot of debt to pay off from taking out business loans to support a struggling dry cleaning business. before they they ran a bar and made a decent living until things got dangerous (racial aggression from customers, bar fights, etc).

574,"So when I was 17 I started working for the first time. I'm conscience of money so I'm not someone who spends frivolously on clothes/food/gigs/festivals so I saved a decent amount for myself within 6 months. My mum had been working for 9 years at the same job, working like a dog to pay the rent and look after the family and drinking to deal with it, my dad meanwhile hasn't worked full time in 15 years but had started getting more hours. So I encouraged her to leave her job, improve her health and find something new that inspires her and values her effort. She did and we started working out together, she stopper drinking, everything was great. But of course the money starts running out and the weekly rental payments don't stop coming in so they asked me to help out. I payed our entire rent of $650 a week for months, monthly internet bill of $75 and groceries here and there until all the savings I had any any new money coming in was gone. Totalling about $6000. I didn't have a choice, you have to support your family but of course I did sacrifice a lot, especially considering it was my first year of Uni and most opportunities to make friends cost money (travel, going out ect.). Things got better, mum got part time jobs and I could start saving again but now Covid is happening, and she lost everything and I lost some work too. Now our landlord expects us to continue to afford rent and I'm going to have to lose the money I've worked hard for to afford to move out/finally travel. I probably sound selfish but it feels like I constantly have to put my life on hold for the sake of the financial inadequacies of my parents. I love them so much but usually the parents are supposed to support their children when they're young, not the other way around.

575,"\*a little trigger warning as i mention suicide\*

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, I (17F) have got an interview next Monday for my dream job and while I'm putting my heart and soul into a presentation for the interview. I understand that it's basically a 50/50 whether I get the job or not.

If I get the job then great! I drop out of my 6th form (A-Levels, kinda like a college in the UK) and start working in the September (probably) until my 4 years of learning are up and then I will be given a full-time employment at the company. That is my hope and will make my life if it happens.

My question arises with what I will do if I don't get the job? Now I've already completed my first year of 6th form....  But I hate it, it stresses me out, makes me feel sick and I can barely cope with the school work, one of my teachers went on about clocks for half the term and has never taught us a thing, the other has a go at you for seeing him after class, even though he ""encourages"" us asking his questions after class.

At the start of the year I had attempted to swap 6th for for a college course in motor vehicle engineering,which was my first choice anyway, but I changed my mind later on and went to 6th form as you could take up to 3 subjects providing you had the grades. But I missed the deadline to swap courses by 2 days, I've regretted not swapping courses earlier ever since.

I've told my nanna and my aunt (who I live with) about my decision, that if I don't get the job I will swap my courses , But I will apply for the course now, so it is in my back pocket if I don't get the job.. They didn't like it, they don't understand how much stress 6th form causes me. They kept saying that I should just carry on with what I'm already doing and that ""*since I've already spent a year there, then it cant be that bad*"" or "" *I should see it as if I've already got the job*"" or "" *Why don't you apply for the course after I find out if I get the job*"". To which I have expressed my concerns that I would miss the application deadline for the course, and that even if I didn't then I would have a high chance of not getting in, due to how late I would have left the application.  The other argument they keep saying is ""*How do you know that you wont end up saying that you hate engineering this time next year?*""

But all I want to do is something that makes me happy, and being around engines and oil has always been my happy place. I'd rather be physically exhausted by working with cars than hating myself over choosing Physics and Computer Science for my A-Levels and wanting to off my self because of it (it's come across my mind more then once).

My next course of action is talking to my dad about it. He is most likely the only person to understand but he's a bit of a hard person to predict when it comes to these things. I can already hear him having a go at me over not doing it in the first place or going of about how I'll end up like my cousin ( who has no education further the high school GCSE's)

I'm just not too sure how to go about telling him or really if what I'm doing is right.... any help is gratefully welcomed.",09Jun2020,1

Now I would like to share two incidents with u 

Incident 1:- i met a girl and she liked me from the first time she met me .. I planned everything just as i was about to book a place .. i get a call from her says she cant do it and hangs up.. two days later she tells me she met her ex and things got out of control and the condom burst .. Thats why she couldnt tell me but she needed money for pills .. i had money but i gave her an excuse .. Fast forward things now she has a kid 

Incident 2:- I found this lady who is a freak ,we somehow connected .. On the day of meeting she called me at her place at 12 pm .. She told me to bring money too .. Earlier on chats she would joke that i have to pay her which i took lightly.. So when she told me bring money i said u joking right .. shes like u can move on with ur life and never contact me again ..

She won’t meow when she’s like this, she’s very cuddly, and she barely walks. We don’t know what causes this, and we’re worried about her. when she’s not drooling, her mouth is hanging open and now this morning, her purr is very very loud and she’s jumping everywhere trying to find somewhere to sleep. she hasn’t stopped moving. I don’t know if she’s okay anymore. I’ve read different things on why she tends to drool a lot such as cancer in her mouth or throat, but either way, i’m worried she has something wrong with her brain that leaves her balance off and her mouth dangled open. is there anything i should do? do you need more information??",09Jun2020,3
583,"How to stop being so fearful and scared?


Today I go to a driving school and I have very less clothes so I wear an oversized collar-shirt and pants. They are very oversized because I am only 151cm tall and very skinny.

In class and outside, I get very scared and even move half-doubting my movement. I can't move smoothly and whenever others answer Q&amp;A, I did not even have the guts to speak out. My voice is also quite weird, being quite ""childish"" squeaky for a 19 yrs old to have.

Even at times when I can't see properly the screen because I am at the back, I am scared to move forward so I just listen to whatever they say. 

I can't even see level eye contact with anyone because besides all the problems above, my face is also quite ugly. I try many skincare but still ugly.

And I go to a shopping mall just now still in my oversized clothes. When I see girls walking near me, I quickly go far away and also I can't get my friendly voice out when talking with girls. Because of my fear, I automatically speak in an angry voice for no reason.

587,"TRIGGER WARNINGS: self harm, negative thoughts, mental illnesses

I don't know what's wrong with me

The doctors, they say I have depression and anxiety, unsure about other stuff as I only know of those two

But I do know I'm very negatively affected by something that even I don't know

Most of the times I'm okay minding my own business, then suddenly sadness or panic hits me, what about? I don't know

I do know how I handle my mental health isn't the healthiest option

What I do is hurt myself and yell at myself, most of the time it's a punch to the head and face, I made myself have a nose bleed the last time I had a breakdown, but I never cut myself because I don't want anyone to see marks on me

Another thing that happens is I can't talk. Like, I physically can't move my mouth, all I do is whine and I'm sure it irritates him, I don't do it on purpose, I want to tell him what's wrong but it doesn't come out til some time later when I finish crying

I also push him away when I need/want him the most, I don't feel like myself when I tell him to go do something else then put up with me

He hasn't shown any signs of leaving, I know he loves me with all his heart, I'm just scared I'm making him lose interest because of how I'm acting

I really want/need to better myself, I don't know where to start, I don't want to lose my only reason I wake up, I've never been so in love with anyone, I just wanna be better for him, I'd never wanna drag him down :(

591,"Okay so my mum works full time, and is at work a lot, and so I’m left at home with her two dogs. 

Lily is the sweetest dog I’ve ever met. She unconditionally loves everybody she meets and I never have any problems with her.

Smudge is a different story. I believe that he thinks that he’s the man of the house, and because it’s just me and my mum he tries to protect the house. 

So he barks almost constantly. If a car so much as drives past the house he starts growling and barking and biting at the door. And our front door doesn’t lock, we were meant to get it fixed but then lockdown happened and so the door can literally just open, and Smudge has opened the door before by jumping at it so I’m constantly scared that he’s going to open the door and run onto the road, or attack a dog that’s being walked, or attack somebody who’s walking, or any other sort of bad event.

I worry that Smudge is going to turn on me some day, because he’s generally an aggressive dog. He barks and snaps at strangers, he growls and snaps at me if I do something like grabbing his collar to stop him biting the fingers off of the mailman. And I feel like he’s a danger to people, when I invited my friend over he barked and snarled at her and if my mum wasn’t holding him back I don’t know what he would’ve done.

The neighbours foster young children, and when he’s let outside he barks and snarls at them through the fence and I’m scared that one of them is going to try to pet him and get hurt.

I can’t invite people over because I’m worried he’ll attack them, I can’t record YouTube videos without him barking and snarling constantly at pedestrians and cars. I constantly worry that he’s going to open the door and hurt himself or others.

And my mum doesn’t seem to care. I’ve suggested things that could effectively solve all of these problems, I’ve shown her cages that you can put over the letterbox to stop him biting at people who put letters through, I’ve suggested she move some stuff in the garden around so he can no longer look through the fence, I’d be willing to put up with the barking if I didn’t have to worry that he was going to bite somebody.

And it’s breaking my heart to see Lily so stressed all the time. She hates it when Smudge barks etc and she whines and whimpers and panics because she doesn’t understand what he’s barking at.

So, how can I get my mum to see sense and address her dog’s behaviour? I’ve tried telling her that if Smudge bit somebody he’d be put down but she just dismisses me or acts condescendingly towards my valid concerns.",09Jun2020,3

Flash forward 3 weeks I text him again asking him to lunch and he agrees. The day we’re supposed to get lunch he injured himself running (it happens), cafeteria where we’d meet is pretty far from his office. So I suggest we wait a week. The week passed and I text him again and it sounded like he forgot but he still wanted to meet up that day.

So to this moment, I just scanned my phone and it detected a malware in the app PicsArt. It had like a list of words and one was trojan so I deteled it immediatly. It was an app that my partner suggested I instal because its good for playing with pictures so now I'm wondering if it could have been a spyware or just a regular virus. 

I tried to google PicsArt and virus and malware and nothing came. Not even sure if Malwarebytes is a legitimate app or not. 

So how can I know for sure? Last time they broke my privacy years ago I decided to leave if it ever happened again and I would. But I'm not about to cause some drama and accuse them without any evidence.

I was watching this YouTuber (before I even realised who she was) called Acacia Brinley, she's apparently known for being the 'it' girl of Tumblr back in the days. But she's also known for the controversy around her, and people claim that she has always changed her style and theme, and could never settle on an aesthetic. I've never really known of her, so when they were bashing on her for this, I couldn't help but think of how much I can relate to it.

604,"I’m a teenage girl at a mixed high school and I’m terrified of the boys at my school. I go to a private school and I live in Australia for some context.

I don’t know why but ever since I was started middle school I’ve had this fear of the boys at my school. Whenever I walked through the boys school (we were spilt for middle school and mixed for VCE) I’d always find it difficult to breathe and try and go through as quickly as possible. It wasn’t that much of a problem though because we had separate classes and didn’t interact.

Now that I’m in high school my classes are mixed and I’m scared when I walk around, especially when I’m alone. I started carrying pepper spray because I don’t feel safe but it doesn’t really help me. I’ve been having nightmares about being attacked and raped by my classmates and I hate it.

I’m friends with some of the boys in my classes but I’m always worried that they’ll turn on me and attack me and I know it’s stupid but I’m anxious when I’m alone with them even though they’ve never done anything that would suggest they’d hurt me.

I think it’s because most of the boys are loud and violent with each other so I’m scared of them. I was waiting to see my teacher for help once and a group of boys walked past yelling and messing around and I was really scared. The worst part was a male friend I mentioned previously said hello and I jumped and grabbed my pepper spray.

I know that some of the boys in year 12 (the class above me) have attempted to rape girls at parties and the school did nothing (they still get to keep their ‘colours’ which are awarded to exceptional students in specific fields. Usually those ones have colours for being good at sport). I’m an introvert and I don’t drink so I know I won’t ever be put into the position of being attacked at a party when I’m drunk but it scares me thinking of what someone might do if I’m alone with them.

I’m not scared of my male teachers as I trust them but I seem to slightly prefer female ones because I feel slightly safer. One of my female teachers resigned this year and I was dreading the new teacher because I had heard rumours it was a man and I felt uncomfortable and I don’t know why. That being said, one of my male teachers I trust and respect a lot and I feel like he cares about me and is a role model and a father figure I look up to.

I’m also a little bit scared of my dad as he used to hit me when I was younger as a punishment and yell at me a lot. I always feel like I have to be careful with what I say or do otherwise I’ll set him off. My mum and dad used to always tell me that if I went out alone I’d be kidnapped and murdered or raped and now I find it difficult to go places alone. My dad also has an issue with other men as my mum was married before she married him and he seems really angry about it so he’s always lecturing me about not dating anyone or getting married or whatever.

I know this makes me sexist but I don’t know how to fix it. I’m so sorry if I offended anyone I just really need help. Therapy isn’t an option for me because I live in a home where it’s frowned upon and my parents would kill me if I saw a therapist. I’m so scared and stressed when I’m at school and I don’t want to feel like this anymore.

609,"I (23F) recently befriended her 30F. We were having so much fun together before this COVID outbreak for months. Both of us would bond outside and talk nonstop, not until our phones were drained of their battery charges. I showed her a world which is completely different from hers. She's a very conservative person and is kind of old school. There were a lot of things she'd missed doing but I made her do them, almost all of them, and we had fun.

But something happened which made us break our bond. She revealed her true self to me. The one underneath the facade. It isn't really what I've expected but I fumbled and withdrawn myself for days to think. Then, in those days, she also did the same thing. And now, no matter what I do, I can't bring back the old us. She found friends, too, though. Old ones. And she's happier with them. If only I can delete everything she told me before about those ""friends"" of her then maybe i could accept it all. 

I don't know what to do. She used me. And I feel like dying because I've given too much only to receive bullsh*t in return. It isn't fair. I want to delete her from my life. I don't know how, though. Everywhere I go, memories of us pop up. Whatever I do, etc. It sounds dramatic. But it is the truth. And it is painful, all of it. 

How do I formally close this all to her? Should I even?",09Jun2020,2

614,"My boyfriend and I had broken up for a while then got back together and during that time he started talking to this girl. They got quite close as they she played the same online game (league of legends) as him that he would complain about me being bad at it so he never wanted to play it with me. He lied to me about them talking on other social medias and told me he just spoke to her on league of legends. I'm pretty sure he had/has feelings for her but she lost interest in him as they don't talk as much (every second of the day) and instead now talk every few days, from what I know. I don't know whether to give him an ultimatum that he stops talking to her or I'll break up with him. I'm not going to lie I am insecure/jealous about her as he told me when we were broken up that he would have sex with her so I know their relationship isn't platonic. We did remain close friends whilst we were broken up and he would tell me things like he randomly shaved his pubic area but I'm guessing it was so he could send nudes to her or something since he never shaves but I asked him when we were back together if he did anything sexual with anyone (physical or online) since we broke up which he denied. The only problem is that he has quite a big history of lying to me about things like this as he told me he hides it because he knows how I'll react (I get quite upset) but I told him that it upsets me more if he hides things from me then I eventually find out. Their main form of communication is Snapchat which we did have a history of only sending nudes on which was what made me suspicious of their friendship/relationship. I don't know if I should just tell him how I feel about him talking to her because I think he will get mad that I'm not letting him have friends. I honestly don't mind if he has female friend but it just makes me uncomfortable that he has previously told me that he'd have sex with her and stuff like that...

615,"I highly doubt I will find answer here, but it never hurts to try.

Please do not advice with ""work hard and become better version of yourself"". No. I have been doing this for years to the point I felt like a new person twice, but my true nature would always show up and screw everything. 

It takes a couple of drinks for my brain activity to let guard down, my mental will is holding my frame. When I am not in the best shape or tired, my true self is revieled. It takes couple of hours for person, to see through my frame. They see my true loser self, that has been with me my whole life. The list goes on, but  the point is there is no matter how good of a skyscraper you build on a bad foundation.

I tried going along with myself most of my life, taking lots of hits. My ego could take them, until there was too much to handle.

I passed two cycles of self-development, body improvement, gaining expirience, all to become better. Now I am here after this years of work, smarter, better than ever before, but problems are pretty same.

I am still me, clearly, and going on like this will make me the best version of myself. It won't solve my problems, help my ambitions. 

How do I change? Is there a way to rewire my brain? Can I gain another personality, another mindset?

Also if I hit her boob by accident she will hit my boob too saying that we are even now. 
That makes me so uncomfortable and whenever I say anything she says ""that sounded dirty"". I tell her to stop telling me if something sounded dirty and stop telling me whatever she does but she tells me that she will stop or that I am the only person she can say those to.

I write with my left hand. I use cutlery with my left hand. I draw and paint with my left hand. And I just realised I pick up my cup with my left hand. That should mean I'm left-handed right? No

I use scissors with my right hand. I use chopsticks with my right hand. I use TV controllers with my right hand. But my right hand is my dominant hand (even though they're about the same bc I have noodle arms).

Sometimes I use both. I lift things with both my hands, just whichever one feels more natural to pick it up I guess. I use my phone with both my hands, either one or the other or both together. But that doesn't mean I'm ambidextrous either. I **definitely can't** write with my right hand. Or use scissors well with my left hand.

624,"F(22) So this happened yesterday before I left work. They called me to the other building in the office to tell me that the man at my building tried to write me up because i used “their” bathroom. This company has at least 3 buildings people work in. I am in one where we have a front office. So i am considered an assembler. There is no more than 50 ppl in this building. I am the ONLY female that works in the back with the rest of assemblers. This building already doesn’t have 1. break room 2. vending machine 3. waters for the assemblers 4. MORE THAN ONE clean restroom. So I sometimes use the “clean” restroom when the other one is to dirty to use. There are like up to 5 females in the front office and 2 guys  so they are considered to be the only ones to use that restroom as well as customers. You would think that maybe the females would at least understand and allow me to use the bathroom right? Well no. No one in the front likes the fact that I attempt to use a clean bathroom. They claim that if they do it for me then everyone else is going to want to. They claim that there have people saying things about me using it? So instead of trying to work with me and just allow me to use it under our circumstances, they’ll rather take up for people watching me go all the way to bathroom to see where i go? I think you could consider those creeps. Mind you I am among nothing but males in the back, which they claim they are the ones saying something about me using a bathroom? I need advice of what to do next. Should I just leave? It is almost about to be a year that I have been here and I have gotten NOT ONE raise after they transferred me to this building which was only like a month or two after i started this job. 
They lock the bathroom but I have a extra key, that’s how I sometimes get in. But they don’t know that. They sometimes leave it open to so that’s what i tell them. These people pay me to sit on my ass because we don’t have a lot to do. I’m just not sure where to go next",09Jun2020,2

634,"I live in a 3-story apartment complex where everyone shares an outdoor space. Earlier this spring, some landscapers planted daylilies in the ground outside my neighbor's window. Daylilies are EXTREMELY dangerous to cats. The pollen can cause organ failure just from being on a cat's fur and the cat licking it off.

My cat does not go outside unsupervised; I follow her around wherever she goes, and it's uncommon for her to venture to where the daylilies are. I definitely will prevent her from going there. The vet says that she is prone to anxiousness and needs exercise, so I can't keep her inside altogether. However, even if I did keep my cat inside, I'm still worried that I could be taking a walk on my own, come in contact with the pollen, and bring it inside. 

My neighbor is an elderly lady and avid gardener who tends to be protective of the plants growing near her place. However, she does not garden on this side of her apartment and it seems like she doesn't tend to these plants at all. I don't know if she'll agree to moving them to the actual garden she maintains on the other side of her apartment, but regardless, our other neighbor has a cat who likes to spend time there, so that might not be a great idea. Ideally, she'd agree to getting rid of them altogether. I would even be willing to pay to replace them with a safe flower, like roses. 

Like I said, these flowers weren't even planted by my neighbor; they're just outside her window. The management in our complex doesn't seem to mind us moving the plants that the landscapers plant; in fact, they encourage us to garden on the property. 

I've been really stressed out about this. What I'm wondering is how to approach this conversation and what I can say if my neighbor says no. Any advice? Thank you!",09Jun2020,1

I didn’t want to meet him, I just wanted to see what he looked like since my mom said I looked exactly like him (and I don’t look like my brother/dad and people sometimes ask). When I asked, she said it was a fling when she was in high school, where they gave fake names. It happens, I wasn’t upset. It just feels like I am missing a piece of my identity.

I am curious about his name, and possible children he may have because I will never have any “full” siblings, I am curious on if I have any other half siblings. (Have 1 younger brother that my mom and father had) I merely want to see what he looks like, not too interested in talking to the man.

My mom has always been an easy going, mostly happy person. But here lately (within the last two years), a change has happened. My mom has started a bullying behavior. 

In my family, there are six grandkids. The older of the group are between 10-13. The younger are 3-6. My sister lives with my mom, so tension is high (my sister has four kids, but rarely all at once). 

That still doesn't account for what I'm seeing though. There's now a look in my mom's eye. A hateful look. She openly mocks the little ones when they cry. Two weeks ago, she took a squirt gun out of my son's hands and emptied the gun right in his face to ""get back at him"" for squirting his cousin. Obviously he wasn't hurt, but wtf? He's four. 

My other sister and I live in other towns, so we'll visit maybe twice a month. But with the way my mom is acting, I'm not sure I'm comfortable visiting much at all.

A bit of a long shot reaching out on reddit, but I'm really struggling with my feelings on this so I just would really appreciate any helpful advice. 

20-something yo woman from the UK here, for some context. 

Im really struggling with my own feminist views at the minute. I am definitely feminist, but I feel like my views have become so aggressive, to the point that I find them generally very hard to rationalise. I just inherintly feel so angry at men all the time, and I know its not right.
I think because Im so fed up of dealing with so much misogyny constantly? 
Getting cat called, seeing women constantly objectified and being objectified constantly, seeing how few women can be successful (media especially) without being sexualised/objectified, thinking about how little value men seem to have for women who arent 'attractive', seeing gross and creepy comments from men online, being constantly afraid of what men are thinking about you, nevermind wht they could actually do to you, being afraid to voice any thoughts or concerns because you wont be taken seriously... 

And men can be like 'yes but not ALL men are like this', and i wanna believe it so bad, but, in my experience, most men I have interacted with are like this/have acted like this, even to some subconcious degree. 

Idk
I could list more and more, and Im aware my views could be wrong and over the top, and a lot of people will be angry if they read this. But I really am just trying to ask for some advice. 

Im a very sensitive person naturally anyway, but I genuinely do not know how to rationalise my feelings at this point.
Every time I think about any of this I get incredibly depressed, I hate existing as a woman in the society we live in, and I have no idea what I am supposed to do. 
Every time I think about any of this, or any of these scenarios happen, I just think about how much easier it would be to not exist anymore. I dont want to live in a world where I just have to accept the fact that women are treated like crap and are generally just viewed as objects, and there's nothing I can do to change that. 
I wish we could all just be viewed as people, instead of seen for our physicality? 


I dont think I want to not exist, but I cant keep feeling like this and I do not know how else to feel. 
I just want some advice on how to deal with any of this, and the feelings that I have because of these scenarios? 
Should I just try to stop noticing all of it?? 

Thanks in advance to any advice, I know this has been a messy post and probably a frustrating read. 
I hope you're all keeping safe and well during everything currently anyway!",09Jun2020,0

671,"I’m a 19f with my 22m boyfriend and we moved in together jan 2020. Best decision of my life. I’ve always been very anxious, but after loosing my job due to covid19 I’ve been at home for the past few months and my anxiety has manifested, making it a lot harder for me to do the things that I’d learned to manage over many years. A big part of this that has developed is separation anxiety, I really struggle not having my boyfriend around now to help me with things that I struggle with, like going to the shop or managing panic attacks, helping me talk through what I’m thinking, helping me in baby steps, and am jittery if one of us has to go somewhere, which I managed before but now it’s back to being a struggle.

He’s visiting his family an hours drive away for a few days and it will be my first time actually alone in the house for more than an hour (when I was working he was unemployed so was always at home). It’s looking to be about 3 days, 2 nights sleeping alone. I’m just wondering if anyone had been through anything similar and has any suggestions for managing the separation anxiety that has developed from me being so used to being around him and becoming reliant on it, as well as any advice on managing social and general anxiety because it’s worsening and I feel a bit stuck. 

To describe what these sort of things feel like a bit - it’s like a restlessness, where it hurts in the pit of your stomach and makes your hands clammy. I get a lot of physical symptoms, like headaches, nausea, chest pain, breathlessness. Intrusive thoughts are a big one, things that I know are completely unreasonable will pop into my head and refuse to get out, like him getting hurt, something going wrong, or something similar. When my anxiety is bad I also really struggle to sleep, and feel permanently unsettled. (I’m sorry if these descriptions aren’t doing any justice, I’m just trying to pinpoint what affects me in case anyone has had similar and found things that help them.)

It’s embarrassing for me to say how much I’m struggling now, especially because I spent so long training myself out of it (all through high school and afterwards), or at least managing it so that I didn’t struggle as much. I’ve been to therapy in the past, and group sessions, and tried various medications, although I haven’t been on any or needed any since moving out. Any help is welcome, from things I can do while he’s away to coping mechanisms

Thank you :)

I had constant harassment from my higher ups due to not being able to use my arm. I stood up for myself when they tried to tell me to just go home &amp; wait it out. They were obligated to find work for me to do. I finally had enough and quit in March. I can use my dominant right arm, but not for long or heavy objects. I lose my grip and drop items.

so said guy is actually best friends with one of my very good friends. and i knew this before i started talking to him. and my good friend has known me for 2 years so he knows a lot about my past and specifically with my last toxic ex who i dated for about a year. 

this ex hasn't been a secret or anything between the new guy and i as we discussed past relationships and such but last night i found out that the new guy did his research and asked my good friend about this ex to which my friend told him a lot as i assume and even showed him a picture. i also know that this new guy asked more than just that and my friend told him stuff that i don't fully know the extent of. 

i understand that the new guy would of course ask his bestfriend shit about the new girl he's talking to and make sure i'm safe to let in because he's been hurt in the past but i can't help but be uncomfortable by the fact that my friend disclosed information about me. what should i do? is my friend wrong in doing what he did? i know the ""bro-code"" is a thing but still.

I’m having suicidal thoughts again for the first time in years, they aren’t related to her but I do think she’s why.

I had no problems making friends, i even had a couple of girlfriends. I guess you could say my mental health was really good. I was almost never sad. My country went in quarantine in mid march and my mental health started deteriorating after about one month. I was seeing a girl since before this quarantine and one day when i was at her house i had my first panic attack. I didn‘t know what it was then, so i thought i was just feeling nausea, excused myself and went home. Thats when things started going downhill. I had a severe panic attack when i was on my way to visit this girl. I had another panic attack when i was visiting my grandparents. I couldn‘t breath and my grandma found me crying in the bathroom. I could not explain why i was crying. I didn‘t know. Naturally, i started talking less to that girl because even thinking about her made me physically ill so we eventually stopped talking. Then i started feeling really sad. There were days where i would wake up and i would feel so empty. I would just lie in bed and cry. For a couple of weeks i barely ate anything and lost quite a lot of weight. The last couple of weeks have been better. I started feeling better i started eating better. Today i had to go to school to have a mock exam for my final exam. As soon as i opened the door and went outside, i started having another mild panic attack. I decided i would walk to school, thinking it would go away by the time i get there. Well ,it didn‘t. I stopped and sat on a bench and started crying. I could barerly breath and felt like i was going to throw up, so i went back home. My final exam is in 2 weeks and i am so scared that the same thing will happen again.

oh boy. what should i do??  
ok so like i've had this group of friends from some facebook meme/music groups and for the last few months they have been kinda making fun of me, like always constantly making memes and jokes at my expense non stop. it's not that i can't take a joke as at first the memes were actually funny, a lot of them were actually gold at the time. the thing is they very rarely made others the butt of the joke and it's almost non stop at my expense. the last few days they've went too far and after not just months worth of constant making fun of me but since like friday they've really been upping the ante and it now feels like genuine bullying and not just jokes. i tried asking some of them in a group chat to stop it and one of the worst offenders for this said ""well we want to"" followed by ""fuck you"" then called me an asshole and banned me from the chat. he later tried claiming he meant they want to fuck me as in have sex and said i'm ""an incel who takes everything too serious"". as well as this i tried explaining how i felt and got told ""we make fun of everyone"", sure but no one gets it as much as i have the last few days. they're now at the point just posting pics of me in a fb group is considered humor and the group is literally just nothing but mocking me rn. i feel really upset about it, more bc these people re my friends and said they were and then would turn round and do this. i'm currently getting screenshots of everything that i can find. i considered going to the police but there are two problems, 1) i responded while i was really angry and told someone to kill themselves and called people names so they could use this against me 2) they live in different countries so idk if there's like an international thing or if i'd have to contact every individual police or something",09Jun2020,0

When I was younger, (I am 19 currently), myself and my other siblings would say something like this, ""if you do x ill tell mom you did z."" As well as, ""but she did x and i cant do z?""

These small threats towards one another. Are these meaningless tattles as kids? Knowing I've grown from it... Do I not be concerned? Was this just immaturity, and not something inherently manipulative or abusive?

705,"hi everyone

first off I want to say that it has took me alot of energy and courage to type this out because I've been heavily depressed and in bad anxiety for months. especially so since the covid period has put my country in quarantine and we practically still can't go out to meet anyone. I have been jobless for 5 months slightly before the start of the covid and have been having problems finding a job since. that has been a huge contributing factor to my anxiety and depression. also, my mum is fighting last stage cancer and my dad got a heart attack surgery 3 months ago. I am the only child and you can only imagine how hard things have been for me.
because of my mums condition and chemotherapy, she has become very sensitive to things and my dad feels very responsible and affected by her words and emotions each time she blows up. he will take everything she says personally, but in the midst of blaming himself for it, he will also occasionally blow up in annoyance and anger. for instance, my mum has been saying that it's indirectly my father's fault that her cancer advanced to stage 4 because he was not doing well in his business in the early years and had to sell the house and move houses and because of that, she feels that it aggravated her cancer when she had to overexert herself and stay up late hours on months to pack the house and move houses,etc. my dad being my dad, deep down he will start blaming himself for it even if he feels otherwise. they have been arguing about this very very badly. I go to take a nap because I'm depressed and I wake up to them shouting and screaming over this, where my dad starts saying how can my mum accuse him of causing her cancer to aggravate just because of something she assumed, etc. my dad has been taking very good care of her and making sure she takes her supplements, gets enough rest, be there for her, do everything for her at this stage. so I can understand why he will go crazy over such accusations. my mum gets angry with my dad over the slightest things these days and she's very stubborn and that pisses my dad off alot. like for instance my dad went to research on curry leaves and it's efficacies for cancer patients so he brewed a tea for her out of that and she refused to drink it, so they start arguing. it's just sickening because everytime they argue, my anxiety gets worse and they don't seem to realise that it affects me. they just shout at the top of their voices like as if I am invisible and I don't have a mental health. I have stopped them a few times but they don't seem to care. also, my dad has been under a lot of stress and he has this sighing spell where he'd sigh every minute, a few times. it's very sickening because it affects me and drives my anxiety up the wall everytime I hear him sigh. I really feel very suicidal and I have been trying my best to stay positive what should I do? :(

709,"I am F25 and I have just been hired by an asset management company in the UK. It's supposedly a really great place to work, incredibly welcoming and with a reputation of treating its employees very well. I will start work in September.

I have a history of MH issues which I have disclosed to HR in very little detail in the onboarding documents. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety years ago, but I am actually being treated with mood stabilisers at the moment, which are working quite well, I think. 

In the last three years I have had about 4-5 bad depressive episodes that have resulted in SH scars on most of my right forearm. Some are white and flat, but a few more recent ones are red and puffy. While I anticipate that (1) I will probably not self-harm again in the future as my MH has been better recently, and (2) the more visible scars will have gone down a bit by the time I start work, I am a bit worried about how to deal with them being so visible. 

I don't mind other people seeing them and asking me about it, but I am unsure about: 

a. what if they make people uncomfortable? is the etiquette that I should cover them? 

b. can my manager/HR asks me to cover them, for example if we meet clients? 

c. will showing my scars make me less likely to be considered for promotions and difficult projects, as people might think I can't deal with the pressure of a stressful job, or that they are unprofessional? 

d. most importantly, who do I ask these questions within the company? Can I just mention it to HR or do I expect them to bring it up? It is obviously quite a personal and difficult conversation (I am comfortable with it, but I am not sure whether the HR person will think themselves qualified/appropriate to answer my concerns?) 

I don't want to make a fuss about something like this before I even start my job, but I really want to ace it and do well and I genuinely do not now how to go about addressing this problem.

I thought he must of done the hedge so I asked him and he said he hasn't been over here and briefly said my younger brother may of done it and we moved on and kept talking. Afterwards I went looking for the hedge trimmings and found them at the top of the garden where there is a small gap between the fence and I could see the hedge clippings in a pile a few meters away on the property next door.

It's been 10-12 years, and i've thought about it now, like an intrusive thought (i think?). I want to file this in ""embarassing things i did as a child"" but idk, it feels wrong, but i don't want to stirr up trouble or anything. 

&amp;#x200B;

On a side, it feels right to bring it up and face the consequences (especially now that i'm an adult) but also, it's been so long, i was so little, it was so ""child thing children do"" thing. I'm not really close to her, so it's not like i can casually talk about it. It was the only occurence of something like this ever.

716,"Hello, I need advice. I (38F) am supposed to be a bridesmaid in my best friend's wedding. She recently got engaged and is planning a quick wedding for November 7th. My husband (40M) is still wanting to social distance. We have still only gone to the store for essential items and our kids can only play with the kids next door as they haven't left either.

Best friend wants to go dress shopping this weekend and when I brought it up to my husband he said that we are exposing ourselves to Covid because best friend's family hasn't been social distancing since April. Our state has had about 1k cases per day and has made national news because of it. Husband and I got into a huge argument where he said it is selfish for best friend to plan her wedding like this so quickly and during a pandemic.

I don't want to miss her wedding, we have been through so much together and she has finally found someone to spend her life with. I tried explaining to her my husband's concern and she stated he is being selfish and controlling. I'm also going to share that in March and April she was on lock down. She would not even go out for groceries and would get really upset about her fiance going to work. Now she is telling me to come to a dress fitting this Saturday despite my husband wanting me to skip it. My husband said he won't force me to stay home but thinks that if I go, I have wasted months of isolation and reducing out exposure. We go to the grocery store and get take out so I don't understand why I cannot safely go to a dress fitting with a mask. He says best friend's sister is there from out of town, so that is opening up our exposure even more.

I feel in between. I'm getting pressure from both sides here and don't know how to handle this situation at all. Best friend is getting upset while my husband is also getting upset. Meanwhile, I am missing out on everything and feeling like I'm being forced to social distance. Advice?

721,"I 24(f) feel like I have a problem with social drinking and but I also don’t feel like an alcoholic

Okay so basically. It’s in the title. Since quarantine started I’ve really really started to have a lot of self reflection on my relationship with social drinking. 

I feel like I either have one drink or I drink until I’m totally drunk. Thinking back, most of the time there has been no in-between. And the last few times I’ve been drunk I did some things and said some things I really regret. Totally black out at a bachelorette party and became “that drunk girl” and then the next time got into a huge blow out fight with my parents. 

Most of the time however, When I’m drunk, im the life of the party and don’t really have any negative repercussions except a hangover the next day. Usually people text me the next day saying how much fun they had with me or things like that. 

The issue here is that I don’t go out to drink often. So my husband for example feels like it’s just a rare occurrence since I usually dont “act out” when I’m drunk. I also have no problem having a glass of wine or two at home and not getting out of control. So to him he sees me drinking all the time and feels like I’m over analyzing my social drinking based on two bad days. 

Last night my cousin came over and he and my husband were drinking. My cousin asked why I wasn’t drinking with them and I told him why. I basically said “I feel like when I drink socially I’m either sober or drunk. Like I can’t control how much I drink once I start” my cousin didn’t make a big deal of it and never asked me to have a beer or anything the rest of the night. When we were going to bed though, my husband said he felt like I was making myself look really bad and sound like I had a serious drinking problem that I don’t have. 

But I feel like it IS a serious problem that since I started drinking at 15 that Ive never learned how to regulate. I always show up ready to party and get fucked up. And I feel like that’s a problem even if I’m only going out once a month. 

Where do I go from here? How do I address the severity of the situation without making myself “sound like an alcoholic”?????

TLDR- I feel like I might have a problem with social drinking and getting too drunk. Where do I go from here?",09Jun2020,1
722,"I'm (39f) a total mess right now,  I think.  I am just now out of an on-and-off-again ""relationship"" that was never a healthy one,  but was very intense emotionally and sexually. I've never ever felt these feelings before, and letting go has been especially hard.  It's not my first or even second or third rodeo,  but this one kept coming back and it's killing me.  I think it might really be over this time,  and I feel like I'm dying inside. 

I think,  no I KNOW,  I will never feel like this about another human again,  and I know it was never a good idea so I should be relieved,  and part of me is.  But other parts of me just want to die right now.  I know I am so weak for this person that if they come back again,  I will be right in this same boat again.  

I guess my question is,  would therapy help me?  Will it be worth the $80 an hour to pay someone to hear about my bullshit? Will they be able to help me get past this or am I being too dramatic because my heart is breaking again? Do I just need a drink and some time alone?",09Jun2020,1

724,"For reference, I'm 36.

My girlfriend is jealous, or I think she is, and I don't know if it's too much.

When we started dating, I was out of a relationship with Mandy (fake name) and me and Mandy shared a cat. We continued sharing the cat because we split up in good terms.

I was vacationing with my current GF, let's call her Amanda, when Mandy texted me asking when I'd be back to take care of the cat so she could go visit her parents. Amanda was aware of the arrangement and cat sharing. When I was replying to Mandy, Amanda run to see my phone and asked me who was Mandy (she was aware of the arrangement, but didn't know the name of my ex). I, dumbly, told her that she was a friend. Amanda insisted and I made up a story of a girl I know from the gym. The thing is that I didn't want my ex to be involved in our trip. It was a stupid thing to do. This happened a year ago (last June), when Amanda and I had been together for four months.

She didn't believe my story and confronted me about (a couple of weeks ago, she confessed to have looked through my phone and my conversation with Mandy to see if there was something) and we had a huge fight that lasted a week. I ended things with Mandy afterwards, by leaving her house's keys in her mailbox, an action I was not comfortable with.

Anyway, the next months were hellish, because she was constantly believing I was contacting with my ex and hiding things from her. I had to give my phone to her for her to ""believe"" that I was not hiding amything. This was not normal, IMO, and it turned out that she had been cuckolded in a previous relationship.

As I felt bad for the way I ended things with Mandy, I went to her house and apologized and we resumed the cat sharing, but without telling Amanda.

Eventually she found out (last September) and she broke up with me, but would not leave it alone. We talked and decided to start over: I would be clear with her and tell her everything and she would believe me. I ended things with Mandy again, but now on my terms. Amanda was convinved that Mandy was a bad person (she's not, by any means) and that she was out to wreak havoc in our relationship, etc.

Manwhile, she fired up a couple of times because I was looking at a blonde in the street (she is really insecure about blonde hair (she's brunette) and goes on and on about how it's ridiculous that men prefer blonde women).

Since then, I have honored my end of the deal (we're talking about 9 months), but she has not. Constantly she is bringing up the fact that I lied, or that she is feeling insecure because she's not sure if I'm telling her everything, or she says that I'm looking at girls in the street (I'm not).

In the past three months we have been living together in the pandemic, barely going out, and I decided that I better use my mobile phone only in front of her in an attempt to show her that I'm not hiding anything.

She confessed to have looked through my phone a couple times more.

Anyway, last week we were going at her house and she accused me of looking at a woman (I didn't) and told me to stop the car and go chase her and ask for her phone if she's really what I'm looking for. I gor really angry and we had a very big fight.

Afterwards, she told me that she is ruining everything, that I'm going to stop loving her and the like. I felt bad and told her that nothing happened and prepared to try again.

Last Sunday someone knocked at my door without notice. As my ex Mandy lives in the same complex that I do, we supposed it was her, and I was freaking out because I didn't want to see her and afterwards Amanda believed that I didn't want to open the door because I was hiding something (I don't).

Yesterday this came up again, because she was feeling bad and she remembered that in September I went to a trip in the mountains and met people and I girl I exchanged phones with to go climbing messaged me. I ignored the girl and told Amanda everything, but she was remembering that the girl sent me a voice message and that I didn't reply, which is apparently what I did when Mandy messaged me when we sharing the cat without Amanda knowing.

I was really tired of having to explain myself over and over and she started packing (she has threatened to do so or started to do so four times in three months). I told her to stop and told her that she needed to start believing in me, that I was telling her everything, and that I was going to use my phone normally, because it's not her right to my intimacy, telling her everything because I want, that I was to stop sending her pictures of the things I'm doing when we're not together (I do that also) because she has to believe me and that I'm doing despite it may made me look bad.

And I told her we could have a look at my phone's bills (she told me that she wanted to look at them to see if I called Mandy these months). She told me that no, that she didn't want to look at my bills, that she was just saying it to get information, that if I was scared it meant there was something.

Anyway, I'm really scared of breaking up. When she was packing, I was trying to be calm, but then she told me that ""I'm leaving my drawing stuff behind, I don't want them"", things that are gifts from me, from these months, and I was really sad.

Today we have to had another conversation, and I'm wondering if she is too jealous. She told me that she is afraid she's not going to be capable of doing things right.

What do you think? Is this too much jealousy? Is this beyond repair?

Thanks a lot.",09Jun2020,2
725,"So I know a lot of people are probably having this dilemma right now, but I'm a little conflicted; I know what I want, but that might not be the best course of action. 

Things I want if I did go back:

1. 3 sick days every year; 2 roll over, the rest pays out; with a cap of 5 sick days. 
2. 5 vacation days every year, 2 roll over, the rest pays out
3. No more weekends
4. A guaranteed lunch break of no less than 25 minutes

Reasons not to go back:

1. I was really unhappy and stressed and it was having negative effects on me overall
2. I was living paycheck to paycheck
3. No guaranteed breaks/ lunch break
4. No sick day/ vacation day
5. Stressful environment

Reasons to go back:

1. Bills(?)
2. It is a job
3. Life is uncertain and I'm very anxious about staying alive, fed, and with a roof.  

&amp;#x200B;

I mean just looking at this suggests to me that I should just go find another job, but I'll be damned if the uncertainty being projected around is giving me severe anxiety. 

They also only gave me 2 days to figure it out and I didn't see the message yesterday, so I get a whopping 12 hours to decide. 

Bottom line: I don't feel that going back is what I want, I feel that getting another job would make me happy (I'm pretty sure I have a guaranteed in at Costco due to familial connections). I think going to work for Costco would make me happier. I want to stay unemployed and amass all the savings that I couldn't ever get while I was working and then go back to work. I'm feeling like I'm being pressured by my old employer to make a hasty decision and it feels like a bad idea. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 26, worked almost every day since I was 16; worked way hard all my life and lost my childhood home because I couldn't afford it. I'm scared to lose my home because I don't have anywhere to go that doesn't require me moving to another state. Being laid off was the closest thing I've had to a vacation since I started working and being unemployed was the only opportunity I've ever had to generate a savings. My savings can support me for about 4 months and I should be able to support myself off my savings for about 8 months if I continue to remain unemployed.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been thinking about what I really want to do with my life and I really just want to go back to school, work for a company while I develop my professional project, then start my own business. I want to improve the design of modern infrastructure while allowing for easier and quicker maintenance projects, safer driving conditions, and safer and more convenient emergency response. It would also allow for a new need of steady manufacturing jobs. Hopefully that will pave the foundation for newer city structures where everyone has equal access to education and healthcare services. I'm afraid if I go back to the kitchen life I'm going to get sidetracked.

728,"Not sure what to do about this and am at a dead end for ideas. My sister is a mature (thirties) student at university in the UK, having been a dropout for many years before then. I was so happy for her when she got on to her uni course and seemed to have a path in life but in the last few weeks her mental stability seems to be going badly downhill.

Yesterday when I spoke to her she ranted for over an hour about that her internet is ‘playing up’ so that her usual YouTube videos (TED talks mainly) start off normal but then the people just start screaming non-stop out of the screen. She says her laptop also sometimes flashes pictures of people she recognises, but with different eyes in them. She also told me that everyone at university hates her and thinks she’s a loner weirdo (this part might be accurate) and that she isn’t really bothered about being alive. She is not a drama queen or making stuff up for attention. She genuinely believes what she is telling me is true. I get that this is extremely serious and alarming but have no clue what to actually do practically.

I can’t see her in person because I am in another country right now where there is a flight restriction. My mum speaks to her often by phone but is also far away and at a loss about what to do as well. She is also scared of her threatening violence.

Even if someone in our family would or could see her, part of the problem is that my she refuses to believe she has a problem and becomes very defensive and attacks (verbally) anyone who suggests she might need help. This means that she won’t go to a doctor or counsellor or anyone (plus I don’t know if she even can due to everything being closed due to Covid). 

I thought about if there is a way could force some sort of intervention by doctors, but I am worried that any authorities getting involved (doctor or police or whoever) and just taking her off to a mental institution would work out very badly since it hasn’t even entered her mind that something might be wrong with her. She would probably need to be physically and forcefully taken and that feels very extreme plus she would never trust us again. 

There is also a good chance that the police/doctors might also say that because she is a small female she is not a danger to anyone and just leave her along until she seeks help on her own. They probably have enough real problems with Covid and protests right now for her to be a low priority.
 
Short term I am scared she is just descending into madness. Long term is a whole other issue she is essentially incapable of looking after herself and is a huge emotional and financial burden on my parents (they are not rich and spending all their retirement money on her university fees). We all feel hopeless trying to think how she can just be self sufficient in the future.

734,"TRIGGER WARNING: domestic violence.

FYI: the names and identifying factors in this scenario have been altered in order to protect the anonymity and safety of all involved. 

I live next door to a woman, her boyfriend, and their 5-6ish year old boy who moved in not too long ago. I grew up in the same town as the female but we had not seen each other in 6 years until she moved in. It was not long before I realized there were instances of domestic violence happening in the home (there are multiple instances confirming this, but I will not go into detail here). I am a case manager, and have access to many DV resources. I decided to find a time when the woman was alone and it was safe to gently express my concern and offer her resources should she be interested for her and her child. 

However, before that could happen, the cops were called to their home after another physical altercation. The man kept claiming it was the first time, which is not true. The policeman saw me and approached and asked if I knew anything. I expressed that this is not the first time I heard or saw concerning things, and that is all.

The woman found out I talked to the cops. She found me on Facebook and proceeded to call me every profanity under the sun on every post and that was public, messaged me and said “You ________! You better stay in your ________ house you _________”. with a lot of other words in between that I will spare you all of. 

Seeing this, I decided to knock on her door to see if she wanted to discuss the situation in person. I fully expected it to be a heated conversation, but was hoping that after a while, she would settle and we would be able to reach a calm point. She verbally assaulted me for a solid 10 minutes (I got no words in) attempted to fight me, then went into her backyard and dumped a trash can full of trash in my yard, and sprayed entire cans of hair product all over my car.

What should I do? I was fine with being yelled at for a minute (thick skin curtsey of my work) since I am aware of the physiological complications that DV victims endure, and in that moment, I was an added factor that she cannot control, which lead to explosive anger. 

I feel for her and her family, and strongly wish she would seek help (thought I know how difficult it is for DV victims to leave). While that is her choice all the way, I cannot allow her to deface my property (which is rented and not owned by me) and verbally assault me every time I simply walk outside to sit on my porch, go to my car, or work in my back yard.  

Is there anything I can do here that will actually help all involved? 

I filed a police report simply to create a paper trail of evidence for these incidents. It’s difficult to navigate because I want them to be able to get the help they need, and more often than not, the police in this area are apathetic and negligent.

Also I am feeling real bad that maybe I want to choose dad because he has money and can get me everything I need? Like I am feeling that it wouldn't be fair to him if that's the reason I wanna choose him. Because back when our family was together, he would be at his work for the whole day, but he always took out time to go with me somewhere and cared lot. I was daddy's princess. But when I live with mom, I don't call/respond much to his messages/calls, and when I used to live with him, I never called/responded to mom. But I also think that the reason I don't concisely, miss him/cry for him is because he has a tough 'man' kinda image, the 'sweetest dad; thing, but very masculine and I almost never saw him cry. But I did miss him as hell a few times and have cried. He messages me everyday, sends me pictures of my room and our house. But, my feelings are mixed up. I am so scared, of everything. 

I am so freaking afraid of telling her that I want to go back to him. Idk why, I am afraid of even small things, like when the bell rings, if my mom is standing behind me and stuff like that. Everyone thinks that I am very brave and tough and am scared of nothing. But it's the total opposite. I want to end this fear, also how do I break the thing to my mom? I always avoid talking about anything with her, especially, things related go court and stuff. My heart beats 3x while doing something like that. The whole time I was writing this, my fingers were kinda shaking, my back was stiff, and I was making many typos, whereas my english/spelling is pretty good. Sorry for typos, I am feel scared rn, and I don't even know why. Also when do I tell her this? Because my online school has started, her reaction would disturb me, and idk if the courts are open again.

If you actually read till here, thank you so damn much,I really appreciate it. Please give me some helpful advice. Please help.",09Jun2020,1
742,"I don't really feel comfortable talking about race issues with anyone (especially white people) to be honest. I try and be as colorblind as I can with most other things though. 

As of recently I can't count how many times the subject of a conversation, that had nothing to do with the protests, turned into a conversation about the protests, people of color and/or BLM. My friend got into a discussion yesterday about the defunding the police stuff going on. It was a good conversation into it drifted into BLM and how he wishes he could do something more and stuff like that. I stopped him midway while he was talking to tell him that I didn't want to talk about it with him and it kinda got awkward after that.

I don't really know if I'm being an ass for not wanting to talk about the subject, especially in light about what is going on in America and stuff. What do you think?",09Jun2020,1
743,"TW mention of attempted suicide

Okay so I (f19) broke up with my boyfriend (m18) about three months ago. He treated his friends like shit, emotionally manipulated them constantly and attacked one of them at one point while unprovoked.
When I broke up with him I spent 2 to 3 days continuously telling him to not contact me, but he kept begging to be friends. I told him no so many times during these few days but he wouldn't listen. He sent me paragraphs upon paragraphs almost every day for about three weeks, I ignored all these messages until after three weeks I snapped and responded telling him to leave me alone. He then did for a short while but messaged me again when my birthday rolled around to ask if he could drop off a gift, I said no.

At this point I had started getting involved with someone new, I don't know how this person feels about me exactly but he made me very happy and excited. I hit a huge milestone with him, seeing as I've been able to feel a way about him that I haven't felt before. I have a mental disorder which makes it difficult for me to properly feel for others. I still feel things for them but I have a hard time sensing said feelings, and where I should feel care I usually feel numb. I don't feel numb around this person. But part of me felt guilty, this is somebody who used to be friends with my ex until my exs friends finally had enough of his toxic behaviour and left him. 

About a week or two ago my ex messaged me again, this time to tell me he was going to attempt suicide. We talked for about 30 to 40 minutes and he made it very clear that it was because I broke up with him. He never said it in an accusatory manner or pointed fingers. But I'm really angry at him for having said any of it at all. Even outside of the fact that this is a lot of pressure to put on somebody for having left them, he also knows that one of my biggest traumas is that a few years ago I had multiple friends who would make me talk them out of suicide, sometimes multiple times a week. Whenever this trauma gets triggered I tend to start wording things in a more sensitive way, to try to be more gentle. He and I have talked about this in detail before, he knows this is a reaction to my trauma. During our conversation of him telling me he wanted to die because of me, he put the conversation on hold just to point out how much it pissed him off how I was wording things differently.

Not only did I tell him so many times to leave me alone, he put his life in my hands, he did this knowing I have severe trauma, he then gave out to me because I was showing what he knows to be a reaction to said trauma, he then also ended the conversation asking to be friends for the millionth time.
I understand he's going through a tough time and I believe that everybody deserves a shoulder to cry on, but I feel so angry that he picked me.
He ended up attempting suicide during our conversation, but got through it and as far as I know hasn't done anything since then. 
The reason I haven't blocked him is because I'm scared that he'll message me asking to come over, and that unless I directly say no he'll pop by. 

But now I'm worried that if he finds out I'm involved with somebody new that he might do this again. I feel like it's not my responsibility, and this new person I started seeing means a lot to me, but I feel like it's the responsible thing to do to end it. I think it's unfair that I'm putting this new person in a position where they might be the 'reason' somebody hurts themselves, and I would be putting them in this position without their consent or knowledge. Just because I know its not my responsibility to take care of my ex doesn't mean this guy would feel the same. But I don't feel its my place to tell him about what happened with my ex. I would be dropping a huge bombshell on him just for my own convenience. I don't even know if this guy feels the same about me or just has a small crush. I feel selfish for wanting to tell him everything.
I ended things with this new guy but now I feel like I've made mistake. I have a strong romantic attraction to him and I haven't been able to stop thinking about him. I feel like I'm letting my ex control me and my love life.

(edit: after my ex attempted suicide his mother called me to thank me for trying to help and to let me know he was safe and in a hospital. So I know for a fact he wasn't bluffing.) 

I guess my question for advice is: did I do the right thing? Would it be selfish to tell the guy I like all that happened?",09Jun2020,0

The good news is that I have goals and I heard that makes scheduling easier.


So the 3 key elements in my life I want to schedule my daily and weekly routines around are 
1. Exercise
2. Education
3. Income

I'd like to dedicate 2 hours if possible daily but at least 1 hour preferably in the morning. 6 days a week

For education I usually listen to podcasts and informational videos while working, but I have books I'd like to read.

Income, I currently am working 2 jobs but only for.the next 3 months.
My work schedule is 6:30am-4pm 5pm-9pm monday-friday &amp; Saturday 9am-6pm


Will someone tell me how to do what when so that I can have structure and routines in my life, please?
I have tried several times but I have failed and failed to the point that as of now I have absolutely no structure apart from my work schedule. It's chaos

This year I had another abnormal pap which came back Atypical Squamous Cell of unidentifiable significant but couldn’t rule out high grade. So I had a colposcopy done and both biopsies were good. She still wants to do a leep. To be honest I don’t want to be cut if it’s not a have to. She even said “is it necessary?

after 2 and a half years of friendship he got sick of my bullshit and walked away. now i just don’t know what to do. i feel so broken. 

i struggle a lot with my mental health and have this friend, we’re calling him jack, who has always been there for me. lately everything in my life seems to be falling apart and i’ve been more reckless. i’m a freshman in highschool (F15) just trying to find happiness again. lately, that’s been through a little bit of dr*nming and v*ping. i’m not even really into that stuff. i just wanted to see what the hype was about, see if it could numb me for a little bit. it didn’t. i’m not addicted don’t even really support either at my age. jack knows that dr*nking and v*ping are not really me &amp; has expressed his disapproval. 

yesterday, i was hanging out with a more reckless friend who ended up giving me a brand new disposable (she didn’t like the flavor). now as i said i don’t v*pe, i’ve only ever taken a few hits just to say “fuck it!” and try to fill the void. it’s not really who i am/who i’m trying to be. because i was upset with myself, i texted jack, hoping he could give me some guidance or advice. instead jack just flipped out, which is not like him. in recent months he’s had a shorter fuse when talking to me, but the way he acted yesterday was completely out of character. essentially telling me to “get over it and solve my own problems for once” saying that i do this to myself &amp; maybe i just want to be miserable and unhappy . 

he even said things similar to the following: 
-“god doesn’t love you” i’m a christian &amp; i have been trying to stay with my faith so this stung. 
- “maybe stop separating yourself from everyone and just reach out instead!” i isolate myself a lot when i feel like i burden others with my problems. 
-“you don’t have any friends? go make some.” i never feel good enough for people because i have so many problems and find it hard to trust because most of the people i let it leave. 
- “you feel lonely and trapped? get out of the house.” i stay at home in my room often because it one of the few places i feel safe. 
-“it’s your life not mine. figure it out yourself” another reason why i don’t get close to people. i feel like a burden for even reaching out for advice when i’m told things like this. 

he said all of this as if it is all something i can control and just “get over”. i’m trying my absolute hardest but i swear it isn’t that easy when every day is a battle to even get out of bed. i wish it was that simple and i could be fixed so easily. 

two texts later he told me to only contact him in emergencies or “whenever i get my shit together.” i’m so lost. he was the only close friend i have left. now i have no one. how do i fix this? i feel extremely hurt over what he’s said to me, but i don’t want to let a 2 and a half year friendship. slip through my fingers. i’ve already pushed so many people away.

786,"Hi all, I’m going to dive right in. I (23F) just found out over the weekend that I’m pregnant, confirmed by 2 pregnancy tests. I’m not sure how many weeks I am currently, but I would guess 8 or 9. I have only told 2 people - my boyfriend (29M) and my best friend. I don’t want to tell anyone else because I am scheduled for an abortion this Saturday. But I am second guessing it and going over all the possibilities in my head. 

I was taking birth control, but last month was rough as I have depression and anxiety, and I was spotty with taking it and my antidepressants. I know it’s completely my fault. But this is one of the cons to keeping the baby - I feel like I’m not emotionally ready and I still have a lot of things to work through. My boyfriend and I also had a 2 year plan, in which he would finish college and get his degree and a job. Currently his only income is from his Indian tribe at the start of each semester and he is going to be a lay coach this fall. I have a job with stable income. ~$1400/mo.

I have always wanted children, and I never thought this would be a choice I make. I have cried every night or any time I don’t have an active distraction. I feel confused and cornered. It’s obvious my boyfriend would prefer abortion. My best friend is biased and thinks that since she wouldn’t want kids that abortion is the only way to go.

I agree that abortion is the best route when thinking of our two year plan. But my biggest worry is our relationship dynamic. I love it being just the two of us. With my anxiety, prior to my boyfriend, I was just constantly at home avoiding people and new situations. He has brought me out of my shell and we had plans to go to fun places like Dallas and New Orleans. We wouldn’t be able to experience this the same way with a child. When I told him about this, he said he was leaning toward abortion mostly because of college and our plan, but now thinking of losing our dynamic has also made him sad. He couldn’t sleep last night after I mentioned it and didn’t go to summer workouts this morning.

I’m scared of abortion though. I’m scared of the pill and inducing a miscarriage. I’m scared of what I’ll see or what me or the baby will feel. I made the mistake of looking up what size it might be and the baby is the size of a strawberry. I am so scared of this experience.

I’m also afraid of giving birth and being seen differently by my boyfriend. He would never make me feel weird or unattractive, but I have always had body image issues and struggled with self esteem. I worry my body will look totally different and he wont find me attractive anymore.

On the other hand, I would love to have a baby. I love kids. I think it would give me the purpose that I currently feel I’m lacking. But I want it to be wanted.

My boyfriend said he would accept my choice either way, and adjust accordingly. He would make any changes he needs to in regards to school to make it work. He said if I chose to keep it then he would be excited for it. But it’s clear to me that it isn’t what he wants. He’s leaving the decision entirely up to me, but I don’t want to put him in any situation he doesn’t want to be in either. I don’t want to have to make such a hugely impactful decision on my own when it involves the both of us. 

Please help. I am so lost. I am so scared of the abortion but I am scared either way.

791,"Hi All,
Looking for some advice on what our rights are and if we have a case to fight. 

In the middle of March I had a very low grade fever and was sent home from work and kept home for 2 weeks without pay. I was never sick, my fever stayed below 99.5 and I never exhibited any other symptoms. I kept in contact with my boss expressing wanting to return to work and was told I was not able to return until I got a Covid test. That was difficult to accomplish since testing was so limited at the time and I ended up having to pay a steep cash price so I could return to work. 
I have since heard conflicting reports that since my employer kept me home, they should have to pay me for that time without it coming from my PTO. Is this true?

Also, we recently found out she received a small business loan. Most of us have had our hours reduced more than 50% and we are ineligible for partial unemployment since our wages just barely exceed $450 a week. Do we have a case to fight for financial compensation? 

Any advice or help is greatly appreciated. We are trying to educate ourselves on what our rights as employees are.",09Jun2020,1

800,"Last summer I interned as an engineer at an objectively good company. I don't really like the topic, but it's a resume builder and I really liked my boss and coworkers. At the end of my internship, they gave me an offer for full-time after graduation. The offer was with the same team, but a different position for a different manager (that my first manager from the summer said was really good).

They only gave a month for me to decide, so I ended up accepting instead of applying for other jobs. I didn't have to choose this job, I have a good resume: 4 internships, 3.9 GPA, one year of undergrad experience. But I chose it because of the people, and because I did like some aspects.

I started in February, so I've been there for about four months now...and I hate it. A lot. My new manager isn't necessarily bad, but isn't good either. This new position is like my other one if you replaced everything I like with things I dislike. I also have to work like 50 hours/week and I hate the city I live in.

My manager from last semester said I could tell him if I am not happy, and he would help me, but I'm realizing I really want to just quit...but I can't. I signed a contract for two years, and if I quit before then then I'll have to give back my starting bonus + any profit sharing - which could add up to as much as $20k.

I genuinely want to go back to school for my Masters/PhD and go work in a completely different industry (still engineering though). I can't figure out if I'm wasting my time or not, but I'm genuinely miserable and I don't know how to get through with this time in my life. During school I did everything: I was super involved in student orgs, I did internships, I got A's, I networked with professors, I did research...I though that in the end I would end up happy but I'm so miserable it's difficult to do anything.

I'm just at a loss of what to do. Does anyone have any experience with something like this, or advice on what to do or how to get through the next two years?

He yelled at me for a while about how if black people say cracker and that's racist he should be able to say the N word.

811,"Hi there! A little info, I am a 21 year old female and have been working for about 8 months now.

So, I work as an Audio/Visual techie on the weekends at my church, with two other guys (27 and 30) and our boss (50+). When the world shut down, I was allowed to work from home. Before that though, we had just purchased a new camera and we are all really itching to try it out. At first, my boss told me it would just be him learning how to operate it while live streaming and recording Masses. Then I find out a few week later, that all three guys are there working on the camera. I also found out that the boss had invited the guys to get stuff they wanted to work on at home, but left me out of that group chat. Now, I know for some reason, he thinks that because I have a Samsung and not an Iphone like the other I won't get his messages, but still, he could have messaged me privately. I do make the PowerPoints for the weekend Masses and would liked to have played around with the stuff they have. I would have just gotten a USB and copied everything over. So, I'm not sure if the boss didn't think of that, but I still think he should have asked me.

I did get called in once to go read because one of the guys got sick and couldn't do it. When he was better the boss had told me that they would like to keep me since apparently I read better, but he couldn't because of the other guys contract. I didn't believe that.

Now that the churches are reopening, I've been waiting for him to call me and tell me when to go in. But no. They've had a plan in place for weeks and nobody has told me anything and we start this Saturday.

I guess I'm just hurt that they don't treat me like one of the team. There are only a couple of things I can think of that are reasons for them not calling me to go back to work:

\- I am much younger then the guys, I am still in school and they don't want to put me in danger of catching the virus  
\- I am a girl and they just need their guy time  
\- I haven't been there as long (the 27 year old has been there 4 years and the 30 year old has been there for 12 years)

No matter their reason, I still feel like I should be told what's going on.

I feel like quitting if they aren't even going to keep me updated on what's going on. I don't know. I am the first female they've ever had, so I might be reading all this wrong and it's just a guy thing not to tell people anything that doesn't really involve them.",09Jun2020,1

821,"I've always been notoriously bad at comforting other people, and I mean downright awful. 9 out of 10 times I end up making it even worse for them than it was to begin with. It's gotten to the point where I avoid all places, events or conversations that could lead to someone else getting sad or upset, simply because I don't want to go through the sheer awkwardness of talking to them about it.
To give an example of how horrible I am at comforting others, I've said plenty of things like 'Maybe it's better off this way"", and 'Well, we'll all die at one point or another. It's just how it is, there's nothing you can do about it"" at funerals. Like what the fuck, who says that in front of a crying person?! 
I eventually learned that it's better to keep my mouth shut and just listen rather than say some extremely stupid shit, but even so it's still incredibly awkward for all parties involved, especially when they're actively talking to me, seeking support and expecting me to respond with some comforting words.
And the thing is, I want to offer my support somehow, I really do. But every time I've tried to it ended up being so extremely awkward, cringeworthy and all-over uncomfortable for both me and them. 
I'm going to be attending a funeral in a few days, so what am I supposed to say or do when someone's crying or talking to me about their grief? Should I just, hug them, or something?

They were borderline *mean* to each other, and I talked to my friend about it, saying I'm willing to help however I can, I can maybe help watch their baby for a few nights along with a babysitter, but that they *need* to take some time for themselves, because they're in a bad place.

Well, he has basically been coming into the office once or twice a week ever since the baby was born, the company basically letting him work from home. We've *all* been working remotely the past two months, but now that they're transitioning to having us back in the office, he's planning to come in two days a week.

Yesterday, it's just me and him in our department, and he's talking about ""how he's going to start running things"". He's apparently frustrated with the rest of us, claiming ""we don't do the stuff he asks us to do"" (I honestly kind of struggle to think any examples of what he means), and is talking about just doing some weird, *very* passive-aggressive stuff (ie. moving peoples' desks around, without even asking how they feel about it).

I'm genuinely starting to get concerned. He is clearly *very* stressed out in his personal life. I think he's also probably stressed about work, because I don't think he's actually doing all the work he's supposed to be doing. He used to rely on adderall to do his job, but now I'm concerned he's using it as a crutch, because the dude barely even sleeps and is constantly either working on his computer (our job), or taking on *major* projects around his house (ie. they just recently ripped out a closet and are installing a new bathroom, all the work they're doing themselves).

I've talked to him in the past about being careful about using adderall too much, but he'd always dismiss me and say it's all fine. I once spoke to his wife, who was also concerned initially, but she just doesn't seem to care. They seem like they're constantly arguing now, though (at least much of the time I see them; it seems like it's usually *him* getting snappy with *her*).

The problem that I'm worried those issues are about to start bleeding over into the workplace. Our lead programmer already can't stand my friend (he and I get along pretty well at work, he's opened up to me about this stuff), and is already on the verge of quitting over my friend's behavior. (and if the programmer left, we would be SCREWED)

I don't know what to do. My friend has always been kind of a dominate personality, but lately it feels like he's almost impossible to talk to, if it involves *any* form of criticism. He's constantly suggesting more work for the rest of us, and just seems to be causing friction where it doesn't need to be.

It's reaching a point I'm finding it more and more difficult to bare working with him. I can't say anything to him because he'll get angry, and I can't say anything to management, because I'm pretty sure they're also frustrated with him and I'm afraid it could lead to costing his job.

Do I just suck it up, and if it *does* continue to get worse, I just quit and find someplace else to work?",09Jun2020,1
848,"I recently came back to the town I went to high school in as I’ve been living 2 hours away since graduating. Whenever my FWB sees I’m in town, he’ll message me to meet up and I’ve been back in town over a week and we’ve already seen each other twice. 

During our last meet up, he had to leave earlier than expected and he still hadn’t made me orgasm which I wasn’t mad about because he did truly try but it just wasn’t happening for me. Because he had to leave early he suggested for us to meet up again the next day, to which I agreed. 

So after he left, we messaged a bit more that same night about meeting the next day. The next day comes and usually he’d text me at some point to confirm that we are still meeting up. He never ended up texting me but I figured maybe he was busy at work and would text me once he finished. The time he finishes work comes and still no message from him so I figured maybe he had to do something before coming over. 3 hours go by and still no word from him. 

Now, some of you may be thinking, “well why didn’t you just text him to check up?” For our past 2 meet ups I was the one to text first and ask if he wanted to come over so I didn’t want to seem like I was needy or w.e and was dying for him to come over. In all honesty, I didn’t care if he came over but at least let me know if there are a change of plans. 

It’s now been almost a day since we were supposed to meet up and there’s still no word from him. Again I truly don’t care if he couldn’t come over for whatever reason but the right thing to do is to at least let the other person know if you aren’t planning on showing up, ESPECIALLY if you were the one to make the plan. 

He’s not the forgetful type either so I just don’t understand why he would flake out without any warning? 

I just don’t know if being annoyed by this and peeved is reasonable since our relationship is casual but there should still be some respect and common courtesy.

EDIT: I guess for a little more context regarding our relationship, we went to high school together and we were normal friends. After I moved away for college we somehow became FWBs and it’s been on and off for three years now.",09Jun2020,3
849,"Howdy :^)
I just graduated in May and was at home for coronatime. This lead to me kinda losing it, and I think that pushed a lot of my existing friends away. I wanted to talk to them like i would In college, but obviously that doesn’t work through digital work and it lead to me being very lonely. I can tell sometimes that people are annoyed or dislike me and I can’t tell if it’s me reading into things too much. 

A week ish ago, I moved again to a big(er) city than what I’ve lived in previously (suburbs then rural), and I’ve been struggling with feeling like it’s not just me vs the world. I’m trying to meet people, working a 9-5, but it’s all remote so I don’t leave my bedroom/office much and I feel kind of down, bored, or scared most of the time. 

Does anybody have any advice? I know I’m young but that makes me feel like I should be out there meeting people / having the time of my life while I have the time and energy for it. 

Thank you for reading, I know it’s kind of dumb and I’m using my account I made in like 2012 with the embarrassing username but such is life

850,"Hey everyone, so I'm a student (16 M) in high school at the moment, I've always been a perfectionist (ever since I was in 4th grade), and I've slowly been having my marks from an honours student drop (recently) to a guy who may fail tests/does really badly on them (I think this is because I began to procrastinate more and more). I used to have the discipline of just doing the work (until my junior year) where I've basically lost all of my motivation + discipline. I still feel immense guilt and hate that I don't do anything, which honestly has resulted in me feeling depressed a lot and losing a lot of self-confidence, especially since I know I can do way better. Of course, the quarantine has made my problem a bit worse, but overall I already knew this was going to happen eventually way before the news of COVID came out. I apologize if this is like too many issues/problems to deal with here, I really just needed to vent out and have at least one person understand how I truly feel. I would really appreciate any advice given and I'll answer the questions people have for me.",09Jun2020,1
851,"Howdy  y'all. This post is gonna be a long one but I'd really appreciate you  sticking through and reading it. I'm not sure what to do and I don't  want to make the wrong decision.

I'm  19 years old and I live in the US. Almost a year ago now I moved out of  my mother's house whom I'd lived with for my whole life and moved in  with my father across the country after I graduated high school. My  parents are divorced. My mother was verbally and emotionally abusive,  and very neglectful of me. I have been suffering from depression and  anxiety since I was 12 years old because of the way she treated me, and  while I love her very much I knew that I needed to leave and get some  independence. My dad offered for me to move in with him so I could take a  gap year and go to college after and I very gladly accepted. Within the  month I had moved. Everything was going well for the most part and I  got along well with him and my stepmother up until a few months ago.  When COVID came, my dad became a control freak and forbid anyone from  leaving the house except for him. I can't even go in the backyard or a  walk around the neighborhood without getting yelled at, and God forbid I  try to go for a drive. He became angrier and more aggressive towards  myself and towards my stepmom, and he's being EXTREMELY pushy about what  he wants and doesn't care unless it's important to him. He's always  been a brash/pushy dude, but it was almost as if I was speaking to a  different person now when I was around him. He's drinking more, his  temper is much shorter, and he snaps at anyone who slightly disagrees  with him. If I try to talk to him about how I'm feeling, he just talks  over me and treats me like I'm lesser. I finally had enough the other  day and started talking over him in anger and he just cussed at me and  left. When I went to apologize later, he brushed me off and acted like  he didn't care. Lately I've been having a really tough time with my  mental health again, and I'm losing weight. I can't sleep, I'm barely  eating, and I'm holing up in my room most days just to avoid him because  I don't like being around him anymore. I feel so numb and have lost  interest in the things that used to make me happy again. My dad has all  these grand ""plans"" for me and says I'm gonna be super successful, but  I'm not sure this is what I want anymore. He's always pushed for me to  go to college and wants me to get all these extra degrees so I  ""understand people"" but I have no interest in psychology. He also wants  me to get a business degree and then go be a lawyer or something. When I  told him I wanted to be a marine biologist, he got mad because they  don't ""make enough money."" He's obsessed with money. He couldn't care  less if I hated my job and went through 10+ years of school as long as  my paycheck's fat. The strange thing is, he never even went to college  and only has his GED, so now that I think about it I'm not sure he's the  best concerning college anyways. I like working with my hands and would  love to maybe pursue welding or marine biology, but if I even bring  that up he just gets mad. All I want in life is to be happy and make  enough money to live and a little extra to have fun with. He has done a  lot for me financially and helped me get my health back on track after  my mom neglected me, but even still I don't feel safe around him  anymore, and this place just feels off now. It no longer feels like  home.

Some good friends of mine in  the state I left a year ago have offered for me to move back and in  with them, and I'm honestly considering it. I miss my old state, and I'm  pretty lonely here. Besides my dad and stepmom I haven't met anybody or  been able to go out because of my dad (even before COVID he was kind of  controlling, it's just much much worse now.) If I moved back home, I'd  be able to see all my friends again and would have a stable place to  live. I don't have much money and neither do they but I think I'd be  happier. They already told me they have a room for me and that they  would help me move if I decided to move in with them.

I  apologize for rambling, and here's where I need your advice. Should I  either A. Move out and in with my friends, or B. Stay with my dad. If I  stayed with my dad, I would be living in a nice house and he said he  would be willing to pay for my college, but I'm extremely unhappy and  don't know if the whole paying for college thing comes with the caveat of doing what he wants instead of letting me choose. If I moved in with  my friends, I'd have to pay for my own college and struggle financially  but I'd be happier because I'd be in a calmer home. They also could help  me with my mental health because instead of pushing me aside because  I'm ""overdramatic"", they would be able to help because they've had  similar struggles themselves. I'm willing to put the work in, I just  want to make sure that is the right choice.

854,"Hello everyone, thanks for reading this, and sorry if my English is not good. 
So to explain the title, here's some backstory : I'm actually 14, my mom has always been a baby sitter (I dunno how do you call it in English, but to be simple, she has the kids of other parents who work everyday except week end, and that's her job) and therefore is always at home when we need her for x reason. Here's the problem (that might seem dumb for some people) :
She wants to change job. And become a dentist. So instead of being at home 24/7, she will not be here everyday from 9am to 7pm. That seems normal to some people but, for me that's a big big shock.

I feel abandoned, even if I know that i shouldn't and I cried about it. A lot. I told my father what I felt and he told me to not influence my mother's choice. So I don't know what to do. In one hand, I want to tell her that I don't want her to leave me and that I feel abandoned but on the other hand I feel like it's her choice and so I shouldn't be worried.

Please that's serious and I really need help.

I feel lonely and I am lost. And another thing that adds on top of everything is that my sister will leave the house this year.

855,"My best friend and me keep getting into arguments about, basically, him ""being angry and negative"" (as I see it) and me being ""hypocritical and unsupportive"" (as he sees it).

Both of us struggle with depression/anxiety. But he gets into these intense moods and rants where (as I see it) he just complains, and he genuinely sees himself as a victim of the world, to the point where he will say those words aloud. He has said that he always draws the short straw, that people have fucked him over his entire life, and that if he told me everything bad that has happened to him, I ""wouldn't be able to handle it"". He also says that he knows people talk shit about him all the time, that he has been told about parties people have had where they ""talked shit about him for hours"". And that this is what his whole life has been like (he's 30).

Often it will start out with him complaining about his day, or not having enough money or something his boss did, and when I challenge him on being positive it blows up into these massive rants, so I feel kind of responsible. But I also feel like I can just feel the negative energy there all the time and so it's hard to not say anything.

I find it really draining and I do try and listen but sometimes I can't and try to address it, telling him he could be more positive and maybe he could try more hobbies, smoke less weed etc. Maybe this attitude is kinda making some of the bad stuff happen...He then gets upset that I'm victim blaming, and that he's just opening up and men are never allowed to be vulnerable. 

I just don't know how to deal with it. Am I being an asshole when I address it as something he could take more responsibility for?

861,"This is a long post but I need to get it off my chest. For a little background, in November 2018 I reconnected with this girl I knew in high school. We were only acquaintances then but I was excited to hear from her. I just had my daughter in April and turns out she had a son about a year older. She seemed really eager to be friends as we are both young moms (I’m 22; she turned 21 recently) and I didn’t have any one I could relate to anyway so I was excited too. After a few times of hanging out, I realized we didn’t have much in common, but it was so nice to relate to another mom.

We started hanging out as often as we could because we lived close to each other. I felt like I really found a best friend as all my other friendships had ended and my sister had just moved 2000 miles away (also a mom). 

She started becoming distant when she moved about 30 minutes from me so that her fiancé could be closer to his work. I have a shitty car and never really wanted to go out to her place because I didn’t feel comfortable being so far from home. She was willing to come to my place when we did hangout (once a month at most at this point and we hardly ever texted anymore) as she came to this part of town a lot anyway. 

ANYWAY, to get to the point (thanks for reading this far), she and her fiancé have just separated and she moved back in with her mom (which is where she lived before). She actually seemed more relieved than upset as he was developing a drinking habit and had gotten physical with her. She insisted she felt happier and that her son’s behavior was improving (her son is a little on the bratty side) and that she was just so relieved to be close by again to hangout more.

For the last month or so, I’ve been constantly reaching out to talk/hangout, but she doesn’t reply or when I see her at her work occasionally (local grocery store), she insists she’ll text me after work and that she misses me, but weeks have gone by where I don’t hear from her. Last time I saw her was her 21st bday celebration in May (it was a small get together with her family). I told my husband that I’m starting to take it personal and he keeps telling me that she’s just going through a lot and to give her some time. That would be easy to digest if she wasn’t constantly viewing my Instagram stories and posting pictures with other friends (which according to her she said I was her only friend, so I got a little curious and jealous when I saw her post). The more time that goes by, I miss her, but also am realizing opinions I have formed of her which are: I love her son but really don’t enjoy being around him much anymore as he still seems like a brat to me (he’s hit my daughter multiple times) again we don’t have much in common and when we do hangout, we’re always talking about her. 

TL;DR: Am I a bad friend for taking a friends absence personal/realizing how I really feel about her while she’s going through a separation? Wanting to know what more can I do besides reach out?",09Jun2020,2

I live in a small town in the Wisconsin. Covid has not been a huge issue here yet, but we know things are getting worse in a lot of areas. I just today saw confirmed cases in town from asymptomatic carriers who are now quarantined.

In addition to that, im a big guy with asthma. Yesterday was my first day back and all staff are required to wear masks but customers are not. All day I felt like I was going to have an asthma attack. I don't think I can do 40 hours a week in mask in retail with constant fear in my mind.

863,"Im 17 M and a year ago I ended a 2 year relationship everything was nice until the last few months where it became very toxic.

864,"Hi all. I'm currently at home, drawing from my state's unemployment, and am afraid to go anywhere. I have pre-existing conditions (asthma, chronic bronchitis) that make me afraid to go into public.

868,"Tldr: how do you get energy and motivation when you don't have the energy and motivation to do the things that will help you get the them?


I am so exhausted and recently my performance in everything is slipping. I have a list of chronic physical and mental health conditions, things that I have been, and will be, dealing with my whole life.

Recently (even before covid) my executive function has been in decline. It takes every spoon I have and then some just to make it through the day, let alone be productive.

I know some type of schedule or structure would be a huge help, and I use to be great at making them for myself when needed, but I just don't seem to be able to anymore. I'm so fatigued that it's been a fight with myself just to make myself type right now.

My performance at work has been slipping and not only am I ruining my chances for a very promising promotion, but if it continues my career may be at risk. I would almost definitely qualify for some form of disability but I wouldn't be able to live on what I would make from it, and it would seriously limit the possibilities for my future. I don't want to spend my life in a cheap apartment scrounging for the necessities of life (and no one should ever have to).

This is literally the best and longest job I have ever had (I have been working for a corporate home office for the last year and a half). For the first time ever I have non-state health insurance, have actually received a promised raise, and make a living wage. I can't lose this job.

But I can't function. I'm always so tired and I can't focus. Trying to get medical help has only resulted in more diagnoses but her few solutions. I just need a dedicated doctor to do a full work up to figure out everything that is wrong and help me work with it so I can have a ""normal"" life.

I found out I was pregnant a week and 2 days ago (last sunday). I immediately requested an appointment with the doctor/obgyn who has been treating my pcos(poly-cystic ovarian syndrome)  and is likely the reason my boyfriend and I were able to conceive. I finally got a response yesterday for an appointment to *confirm* my pregnancy for *next week*. I'm very frustrated because I lost my last pregnancy(4 years ago) after I was unable to obtain medical care/confirmation because I was told to my face there was no way I was pregnant and literally handed a pamphlet for a local in-patient mental facility. I miscarried at the local hospital about a month later.

I have great confidence in the health of this pregnancy, but there is so much I need to do that I don't seem to be able to do. I need to improve my work performance so I can continue having a paycheck, and maybe even get that nice promotion to the less stressful (more in-tune with my natural strengths) salary position that my manager thinks I would be a good fit for.

I also need to get shit together in my home life to prepare for all that is upcoming. My house is a mess and my boyfriend works a lot so he doesn't have a lot of time to help around the house, whereas I have recently been lucky enough to work from home.

Between fatigue, difficulty focusing, and lack of motivation (I have all the reasons to be motivated but the energy/desire just isn't there) I've just been terrible at everything lately.

I kinda wish that I just had an assistant that could help me fight through some of the hurdles like getting a doctors appointment or keeping me on schedule, or just basically a second brain that I wouldn't have to program myself(i don't have the energy to set anything like this up in an app or program for self-help). I just don't know what to do, or rather what I can do with all the barriers of mental and physical exhaustion. 

Also, in case I didn't mention it earlier(too exhausted to comb through everything) when I began suspecting I may be pregnant, I started going off my meds since the vast majority of them are not good for a fetus, so until proper pre-natal care starts, and my care team can help me find pregnancy safe alternatives, I have the added detriment of not having the normal chemical assistance that I'm used too.

Because I know at least one person will ask, and I am a lazy ho, my diagnosed medical conditions are:

* Fibromyalgia
* polycystic ovarian syndrome
* sleep apnea
* Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder
* chronic depression
* bipolar disorder
* non-combat ptsd

Ever since my dad passed away in October my ability to function has been declining, and I've reached the point where I can't afford to slip anymore and I just don't know what to do.

871,"Never played a season of football in high school. But I went to my college's football tryout last fall and I made it as a walk on all be it only Juco, however when the conditioning test came I failed I didnt train before at all, and I never came back assuming that it meant I was cut. Turned out I wasn't cut lmao. But during the tryouts I made very good impressions on everyone. I took a break the spring semester not sure I wanted to get my degree and decided to come back to get my degree, get my bachelor's and transfer. I got back in contact with the head coach and position coach and we arranged to have a quick meeting. Said they were proud I reached out and that it's time to get to work.

I went in, had a great meeting where he said I was going to be a good class, probably just graduating class. When I came back out to my car, on the jeep next to me a rifle bullet was standing up that wasn't there before.

873,So a little background on me is I am 34 years old and  have a beautiful fiance and we just bought a townhouse together. I have been in the restaurant industry for 17 years and have done everything there is to do in it. Over the years I have become miserable in the industry and want to find a new career but can't because 1: I feel like I have wasted my time and have no skills other than restaurant management experience and nobody will hire me without any experience and 2: I suffer from an extreme form of anxiety that I fear taking the leap to something new. I don't know what to do and have no self confidence. I know if I fail that we will lose everything we have worked for and that makes my anxiety worse. If I stay in this industry its quite literally going to kill me because of the constant state of depression I am in. I would like something where I can work remotely and be able to find a good work life balance but I am at a loss. Please Help.,09Jun2020,1

Hey,

so my mom is a semi traditional woman who really values what other people think of us. It has gotten to a point where anything she says is usually yelling. Most of it is just telling either me or my sister to do something or to stop. It has gotten to a point where my sister escapes through watching tv shows- she is 7. I have a dad but he is quite a hard worker and is actually very active during the weekends but as during the weekdays he spends a lot of his time working for a respectable IT company. He was boring in a poor village and has worked his ass off to be where he is at. I would say I am upper middle class. My dad doesnt bother me and he plays with my sister occasionally, works for average over 9 hour days, does housework, etc. Insane he is able to do this. My mom also does equally hard work expect instead of the spending the free time with whatever she wants to do my mom just works. Like deep cleans daily. Over cleans like insanely. She says that she does not like doing this but it must be done. But some of the work is quite useless and unneeded as sweeping the garage, cleaning cupboard, waxing and mopping the floor, like I understand this is important but she does this on a weekly basis. The whole house is deep cleaned and torn apart and put back together. But she doesnt clean and make things orderly she just makes it like clean in terms of no dust and such. Its frustrating but i try to help by every day cleaning the house and putting things in order. THis is not enough for her and she is always just mad. My dad escapes her through work, my sister through going to her friends house or trying to watch the phone any time she can, and me through sleeping through the day and staying up at night... I have tried to tell her she does not need to do this much work as she has cried several times and any household or domestic fight we ever have had is due to her believing we either are not being a good family and spending family time or we are not helping her with her work. I hate this and I want to help her. She cried today again.. whenever I try to explain she just doesnt care at all and uses anger to firm her beliefs from change. I want to help but I cannot seem any way to help her. I tried everything but the frustration she gets from her cleaning and household work is so bad. She projects it onto us which I can take but for my 8 year old sister i cant tolerate it. She used to be a bit better when i was the only child and we lived in an apartment but still always cleaned and maybe its age? idk she has a very good friend support system and her friends like her very much and they think of her as a loving and kind hearted person which she is but not to us like she definitely loves us a alot but her cleaning is destroying our relationships. today i said i would not eat until she decides not to hold the party this weekend for my dads birthday. Why? Bc she makes her own food for the party, deep cleans the house which means moving beds, couches, tvs and cleanign the whole floor regardless of bed or cabinets. She gets so mad that we always have a fight before any party she throws idk please help on how I can make her realize the detriment this is to her and to her family",09Jun2020,2

879,"Hello! For a little background, I (F21) am living at home in the northern US due to the pandemic and being a financially-strapped college student. My stepfather has been with my mother for around 6 years, and the problems started immediately after I met him at 15. I'll give some examples of his extremely inappropriate behavior below, and need advice on how to deal with him. I realize some of this may be run of the mill stepparent stuff, and for that reason I've ignored it for years, but it's reached a point where it's difficult to do so.

Food Issues:
•When I get seconds at dinner, he'll comment ""someone's hungry!"", when I don't get seconds he'll ask ""is there a budding eating disorder we should know about?"", and if I get one plate a bit too full for his liking, he'll say ""My, that's a large portion."" I'll note that I'm at a very healthy weight and don't have any eating issues now or in the past.

Appearance:
•When I wear makeup, he never fails to comment on it and ask if I ""got dolled up"" for him/mocks me for wearing it, but when I don't wear makeup he says ""You've really let yourself go, you look like shit today.""

Sexual Advances: (This is what I take most issue with)
•Since I was 15 he's been texting me pictures of ""sexy"" Halloween costumes saying I should wear them and pictures of women in sexual poses asking me (jokingly, he claims) to do those things for him; I've told him and my mother repeatedly that it's highly inappropriate but nothing has stopped it.
•When I'm standing somewhere cooking or otherwise occupied, he will come up behind me and slap my butt or caress my thigh
•When I was 16 and he thought I was asleep, he sat on the bed beside me and fondled my breasts for an hour. I realize this wasn't a great decision, but I didn't ""wake up"" or say anything until later because I'm of a very investigative disposition and wanted to know the extent of his issues.
•Once, around 4 am, he blasted what I can only assume was porn based on the *cough* sounds for several hours on the family TV
•No matter what I wear, he'll text me occasionally and say ""man, that makes your ass look good."" Remind me never to wear those things again.

Alcohol:
•He gets drunk almost nightly and plays sexual music videos on blast while everyone else tries to get work done

Emotional:
•I'm on a pre-law track in college, and he regularly implies that I'm only there to find a husband and that I should be honing my skills as a housewife to make myself valuable and worthy of a man's love, despite the fact that my professional aspirations take immense precedence over my romantic life, which I've told him repeatedly.
•He only communicates his true feelings over text message, as he is too cowardly to say those things to my (or anyone else's) face, and texts me throughout the day trying to make me feel guilty for ""not giving a shit about him."" I've never let this fly and recognize and shut down all attempts at emotional manipulation, but it's exhausting to have to do so with such regularity. I've given him the benefit of the doubt for several years, believing it all to be caused by his not feeling welcome family-wise, but there comes a point where the excuses run out.

I don't normally post things like this and usually prefer to deal with things via open and honest face-to-face communication, but he's established that that's impossible so I'm not sure what to do. I'm very independent and sure of myself in most respects (and very willing to speak up for myself if you guys think it'll help), but I've never had a healthy relationship with a stable father figure so I really don't know what ""normal"" is. Advice appreciated!

Edit--I'm not trying to dunk on my mom for the situation, because she definitely sees that my stepdad has issues, but she's very much the nurturing type and seems to think that support will solve things. I will take it up with her, but in the past she's said outright that she won't favor me over him, ie. she's willing to have conversations with him but would never pull the plug on the relationship.",09Jun2020,3

882,"This one's pretttttyyyy long so there's a TL;DR down below but if you have the time to, I'll advice reading the whole thing.
Okay soooo it might seem as if I'm being nosy from the title, but it's not really the case. I'm a female in my teens and have a guy bestfriend about the same age just some months difference. Let's call him Sam, he has a girlfriend and we'll call her Amanda. Sam and Amanda have been in a relationship for the last 6 months. I was really happy for him because his family life isn't the best and I thought she could give him enough love. Sam is the most optimistic and the kindest person I've ever met, so when he told me that him and Amanda are dating I really thought he chose the right one because he had previously expressed how if he ever got a girlfriend he'll want her to be as optimistic as he is and other stuff like that. Amanda and I have some mutual friends and some of them didn't have the best views on her. Sam is a really popular guy, by that I mean he's the most popular guy in the school. So I brushed it off as people just being jealous or something.

So flash forward 1 or 2 months into their relationship, I never really met or talked to Amanda cuz I never thought it was necessary. Sam told me they had a horrible fight, I won't be mentioning the reason. He cried in front of her, ik it doesn't seem like a big deal but he's the kinda guy who never cries, like everrrr. But she didn't forgive him, he chased her around begging her to just talk to him, the reason wasn't that big and it was definitely not big enough for her to make such a big deal out of it. After what felt like years but was some weeks she forgave him. Amanda always brought up my name into any argument they had and keep in mind that SAM NEVER INITIATED AND FIGHTS WHATSOEVER. She always brought up their first fight and told him that she couldn't forgive him and she just forgave him then because she felt bad for him. SAM DID ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO COMPENSATE FOR THE TINY MISTAKE HE MADE. 

Amanda told him a super fake sob story of how her ex died on the same day as her birthday, while he was cycling he got hit by a bus. Also this is not possible as where we live in a very safe area and the town is small and has its own news channel. There are literally no crimes in this area and the channel just reports some minor thefts or something. IF what she said was true I asure you, I am a 10000000 percent sure it would be in the news and literally everyone in the town would know cuz it's a small town. Most people know each other and I have never heard of the family she said he was from and neither have any of my family members or friends. So the story is pretty much very very fake. Sam thought I was just overthinking and she would've never lied to her. I left it at that, I didn't want to sabotage their relationship. 

She has done many things of such sort and one time when they almost broke up she reached out to me with some basic-tryna-be-a-sweet-bitch stuff and I just said yeah whatever. They didn't break up. She did a lot of stuff after that and after one point I just stopped giving him advice because the amount of times I had given him an advice he always did the opposite and I reached my limit. He kept telling me about all the things happening with her and I just said nothing. After sometime he stopped telling me about her and I was kinda relieved but then I realised that that's not how bestfriends work. I started asking about her but he never told me anything.

I found out from a mutual friend that they were having a fight I asked about it he said it was nothing major. He has stopped sharing a lot with me and I have done the same, I'm really upset that our friendship has turned into whatever this is. Because of her he has distanced himself from all of his other friends, I feel like I'm his only support system and I'm letting him down. But I feel insulted, one day he literally told me that half of the fights they had were because of me. I can't look at him the same anymore. What can I do? I need advice. I feel like I'm the jerk ruining his life and his relationship.

TL;DR my bestfriend has a manipulative girlfriend and I was tired of giving him advice and him not following it, our friendship is going into ruins now. What can I do?",09Jun2020,1
883,"Hey everyone. This is my first time posting to reddit so please be kind. I'm in a hard situation right now. I have two best friends: one guy (let's call him Federico) and a girl (let's call her Charles). I've known them both for the same amount of time; we all worked at the same program. Very early on, I realized they both have had massive crushes on me. 

Federico was incredibly outright with his feelings while Charles was more timid. I got to know them a bit better as time went on and we hung out a lot. But sometimes there's this silent tension when we all hang out where I can feel how much they really like me. And the thing is, I'm not sure who to choose. They're both great.

Federico is very stubborn but also super loyal. A fantastic baker and a man of many talents and arts. He's got great insights and a great conversationalist (even though he goes on forever at times.)

Charles is passionate and kind. She's got this carefree and spontaneous vibe going on that's infectious. She likes all the same music I do and we enjoy the time we spend together to explore more of what we have in common, though she can be a bit indecisive at times.

Hoping to get some advice...

**Background:** I live in 5 person household; I live on the upper floor with a couple who rents two bedrooms (they're bad at communicating and confrontation) and I rent the master bedroom across from them. She hates weed; I had hotbox once and she acted like she was dying.

**Situation:** So the female decides to adopt two rabbits, and they stink up the room, and so do they since they all pile into one room...so it's a mix smells of body and animal. I would like to smoke a joint or two everyone once in a while in my room (I live in a 'Karen'-like neighborhood). Sometimes I get stressed, I work a 9-5, I pay rent/bills, I contribute to cleaning the house, I try to stay away from alcohol, so weed helps me relax. Neither animals or weed is allowed in the house, but since I'm ok with letting them have two rabbits, I can smoke a couple of times a week? I lit one up an hour ago, and she said nothing. I'm gonna continue smoking at least once every week or other week until they speak up.

891,"Hi everyone! 

I (28F) originally posted this in r/nailbiting  but I thought it might be a good idea to get some perspective and advice from here. I would love to hear your thoughts on a toenail situation I am in, as I'm a bit lost in what I should do. 

Just a heads up, I'm going to talk about some toenail picking problems so if that's not your jam, that's cool, basically the tl;Dr is: should I get my toenails permanently removed? 

History: I've had problems with picking/biting/tearing my toenails since early childhood, and they tend to lead to ingrown toenails, which then get infected and very painful. In the last six years, I've had to visit a podiatrist three times to correct the damage I've bestowed on my toes. Its humiliating, expensive and painful and I wish I could stop, but I can't. 

About two weeks ago, I had a bad day and attacked my toes with sewing scissors. I damaged the nail enough that I pretty much immediately realized I would have to go to a podiatrist to fix this. A few days later, I made an appointment and went in. 

The podiatrist I met with was very chill and nice and listened to me lament about my problems, like how I can't stop, how my partner has to hide nail clippers from me, how embarassing and painful this is, how ugly my toes look, and how I wish there was a solution. 

And then he's like ""You know, I can just remove your toenails for you"" 

And I'm shocked, because I've never heard of this. But apparently there is a chemical that once he rubs it on my nailbed (after he cuts the nail out), the nail won't grow back, leaving me with no toenail to rip/chew/tear into. 

I gotta be honest, this is a lifelong dream of mine to not have toenails on my big toes. They are the worst for damage and the ones that constantly get ingrown and need a professional to fix them. Not having toenails would be amazing. 

But this seems like a pretty big step, and my therapist is really against it, saying that it's just a bandaid solution that won't correct the mental behaviors that go into me hurting my toenails. The reviews I got from my friends are mixed, with some saying to go for it, others are more cautious. 

So here are my thoughts: 

1) has anyone had this procedure done before? What is it like? 

2) what are your thoughts about permanently removing two toenails (on my big toes) as a way to no longer have to deal with a lifetime of painful ingrown toenails? 

Like I said earlier, any advice or perspective would be really great and much appreciated. Thanks so much!",09Jun2020,20

893,"  *-throwaway, because some of my family know my reddit account-*

For reference: I am 25, my sister is 31, and my little brother is 23. We are all half-siblings. My brother and I have the same father, my sister and I have the same mother mother. My older sister is also mentally handicapped. She can't learn beyond an elementary school level and has the emotional maturity of a 16-year-old. She's good with old people and kids and has a 7-year-old daughter. But she lives with my mother and stepfather as she could never support herself on her own.

When my sister was 14/15 and I was 8/9, my father molested her. My parents were divorced by this point (amicably), and my sister and I used to visit my father for a few weeks every summer. I have very few memories of this time, or even of my father at all, because I repressed them, so I couldn't give details if I wanted to. I have no idea what all happened, but my father plead guilty to sodomizing a minor and went to jail for 6 months, got out in 3 on good behavior. This incident has been a huge scar across my family, and especially my sister and I recognize that. We never talk about it and haven't since I was a kid (which I don't remember anyway). If there is any mention of my father at all, my sister will say something like ""Why do you have to mention that asshole? Thanks,"" and storm off (one distinct memory was when I was a teenager and my mom was showing me pictures of my dad in a scrapbook.) So, we don't talk about him. Ever. 

That said, I'm not really close to my sister anyway. I see my mom, older sister, and niece at least once or twice a month since we live close, but my sister and I are always at each other's throats when we're together. My entire family is also extremely manipulative and broken. My parents are recovered addicts, my mom doesn't work, my step dad does contracting work for cash. They're honestly a lot better now than they were when I was a teenager, but it's still not a great environment. Without going into detail, when I was a teenager, my parents (mom and stepdad) got addicted to drugs. At 18, I went off to college. Soon after, our home was foreclosed on and I lost everything I owned (they never told me until it was too late for me to go get anything). I was effectively homeless, and couch surfed my way through college. I recognize that I didn't have it as hard as my sisters and niece, but it still fucked me up.

One reason I was able to make it through this time sane and alive was my paternal grandmother, who took me in and fed, clothed, and supported me after a suicide attempt. She got me put on my father's insurance and made him pay for my therapy and some other expenses. I never saw nor poke to him during this time. That entire side of my family rallied around me and I became very close to all the people I never got to know during childhood. I am now much closer to that side of my family than I am to my mom’s or my step-dad’s.

I recently went to a funeral for my grandma's brother, and of course my father was in attendance. I had seen him once before at a family function, but this was my first time really speaking to him. I was terrified, but my brother and boyfriend were there supporting me, and I actually managed to have a pleasant conversation with him. I haven’t spoken to him since, but he messaged me on Facebook today to wish me a happy birthday, and I have been contemplating responding and maybe trying to foster a relationship with him. I told my mother, and she accepted it gracefully and said she understands if I want to speak to him. 

My sister found out somehow, and she called me up crying and screaming about how I've betrayed her and now I don't know what to do. I feel like the scum of the earth. I didn't think it was asshole-ish at the time, but now I'm not so sure. I would never expect her to accept him or see him, and I don’t plan to invite him to my wedding or any family gatherings or anything or let him post (or post myself) anything on social media. I just wanted to be able to speak to him on days like today, or Father’s day, or at family functions with that side of my family. What do I do?",09Jun2020,38

So this morning I decided to google myself as people sometimes do to see what comes up and it was pretty much what I expected, old Myspace photos and such. A couple of those photos are of me in my back yard when I was in high school standing next to my two older siblings. 

When I clicked one of those pictures some related photos came up that made me wanna vomit. Dozens of pictures of my brother doing some absolutely foul fetish stuff immediately popped up. 

Now I don't judge people for their sexual tastes and fetishes, to each their own as long as they keep it to themselves. But this is my blood relative and it is on the front page of google when you google his name, and worse, even when you google my name these pictures are just one click away. People say we look very similar and I'm terrified that any potential employers, friends, or girlfriends  who google my name and find these pictures might confuse them for me or even judge me through association.

I don't know what to do, I am absolutely nauseous and disgusted right now.

He throws MANY tantrums and won’t stop until he gets what he wants. The only way I can get him to calm down is by playing deathstep or dubstep. Whenever I tell my parents, they just tell him to stop. Doesn’t work most of the time. 

I’ve also found out that he’s been searching inappropriate things online. I understand, but as the oldest sibling of the house, that’s a really young age. 

Another problem I have is mocking. He mocks me a lot. He follows what I say 
Eg. I’ll say “stop” and he’ll say the same thing. He calls himself better than me. He calls himself smarter, and me, “dumb”, “stupid”. 

I try my best to be like my dad, who is calm, understanding, and totally awesome. But I can never get it right without him having to kick me in the shoulders a few hundred times. I’ve explained so many times that it’s wrong and stupid. He never listens. He can be loud and obnoxious when I’m trying to finish essays, assignments, and writing prompts. 

I will admit, I took part in this by saying “fuck” around him for a few times.. When he’s not acting rowdy, he’s usually nice and shares, but yeah. That pretty much is all. He’s a fun little guy to around with too. I’m just sad.

905,"this may seem like a strange question but recently i have been manifesting dating with a girl that i met online, (don't worry, as of now we're just friends and we have both seen each others faces and in video, im not being catfished and we're both OF AGE) i really like her and she likes me only as a friend but i've been manifesting recently and just now i was blessing a cup of water. i followed all the instructions of every manifesting technique including the instructions to blessing this water. i read that if you're manifesting something BIG, (i consider manifesting love to be something big) you should wait for a full moon, and to drink it first thing in the morning after a full moon. the next full moon is on july 5th but i already blessed the water and i don't know if blessing it again would create bad energy so i was wondering if there was any way to keep water clean for a month.",09Jun2020,0
908,"Im sorry, but i just need to get this out or im going to have a damn mental breakdown. I feel like shit.

School just ended and im one year away from going to uni and I already feel like a damn failure, holy fuck I dont even know what to do anymore. My grades have gone to shit, C average. I know that many dont consider that so bad but from where im from its basically an F average. Same shit. I cant even talk to my parents anymore because every damn fucking discussion leads back to my damn grade and what im going to do with my damn life. And trust me, ive tried talking about it to them but they just dont stop fucking bringing it up. My anxiety has gone to shit, ive never feelt worse. I feel like everyone is disappointed in me.

My parents always compare me to my cousins or my friends or just damn strangers. Look at X, he just got the highest grades in his school and is going to be doctor! Look at your cousin, she has a bright future! What about you? I dont even know what I want to do with my damn life, it just feels like everyone knows exactly what they want and I stil dont know what i want to be.

Im always sad, I always feel like crying but I just cant. I have failed my family. Im gaming more and more just to get away from everything because honestly, the only thing that makes me happy is being with my friends. My family hasnt brought me happiness in so long. Every dinner, every breakfast, every time im in talking distance. They always say "" that they are sad"" or ""they arent angry"". Dont they even thing about what im feeling? Thats not even all, my health has gone to shit, corona isnt helping at all. So if I tell them to drop talking about my studies, guess what they bring up? Ding ding ding, my damn weight. ""Oh ----, your have gone up in weight, what if you get sick, blablabla."" Like for example school just ended and I get home after being with friends for a while, and guess what they bring up? Yeah, the cousin thats the same age as me but jumped a year and just graduated with all A;s, hes going to be a doctor. And why dont you just have a goal in life? What do you even want to be. Thats another thing, I have to follow the thing that brings in money, not what I enjoy. My god its like theres only two choices, doctor or engineer. They even shot down becoming a lawyer because god knows why. I said that I enjoyed social studies and guess the response. They said that there is no money in areas like that and why dont i just become something like my cousin. I can still hear them talking about me, they know that I can hear. They are sayng stuff like ""why doesnt he just say yes"". The yes is to listen to them and just let them rule my life.

Not going to lie, ive reached a point where i have thought about death, what is the point anymore. Dont worry, im too much of a pussy to kill myself and I can't die knowing that everyone is going to be sad because of me. Its just that i cant deal with this anymore. I havent even talked about my little brother that is given everything and when he does something i get the screaming and that its my fault. An example is that he broke my headset yesterday out of anger and I got angry. Didnt even touch him, just screamed at him. And guess what? They told my that i didnt need to scream at him, and bla bla bla, ofc it turned into a talk about my studies. They didnt even tell my brother off, nothing happened to him.

913,"*Sorry if format is off, I am new to Reddit.* 

My father has been cheating on my stepmother with various women for at least 10 years. I noticed when I was in a young teenager, but it could have started before that. My parents divorced when I was very young, so I'm not sure if this was a contributing factor. My father doesn't really hide it from me or my little brother and my brother and I have discussed it amongst ourselves a few times. He even brought her around us several times ""as a friend"". She has bought me a few gifts that I did not ask for, which I think are gifts of silence. My brother and I are both now in our early 20s. I still live with my father and stepmother. My brother and I are very loyal to our father and want to protect him so we've never said anything to our stepmum also because she is very loud and threatening (though she has never hit us or anything, but she has hurt my father once.) Part of me thinks she's aware of the cheating because I've overheard their arguments, but I'm not 100% sure she knows. We also believe that our father knows that we understand what is going on and is confident that we won't say anything because of our loyalty.

 I studied abroad for a few months right before social distancing hit and I didn't see the woman at all between returning home and social distancing, so I figured he might have broken things off with her. However I just went on Twitter and my father posted a picture of himself in a lambo (not his car) and I know that woman drives fancy cars. He also posted an unrelated tweet replying to her. She has a private account so I can't tell what they're talking about. My father also has my stepmother saved as a different name in his phone for whatever reason.

My father has been REALLY strict about social distancing to the point where my stepmother and I have been banned from seeing my grandparents or even going to the grocery store (even if we have masks) and I feel that he's being hypocritical by banning everyone else from going out but still seeing this woman. I have a very important exam in July that I cannot miss and I will be disqualified if I have any signs of COVID. I'm also angry because I think he is jeopardising my exam chances by going out to see this woman when the rest of us are strictly distancing because of my exam and for health reasons. I'm aware this is selfish.

I also feel torn because my stepmother is annoying but mostly nice to me. I know she loves and cares about me, and she has been in my life since I was very small. I don't want to tell her because I'm worried for my father but I hate thinking that she might not know. I also don't know how to bring up with my father that I'm worried about my exam without directly telling him that I'm aware of his cheating. Again, my brother and I have never confronted him about this but we're sure that he either thinks we're complete morons or that we know.

I'm not really sure what kind of advice I need. Should I talk to my father about this? Should I just trust that he's aware of the importance of my exam and won't expose us? Should I ignore everything, focus on my exam, and just save up money to move out ASAP so I don't have to deal with it?",09Jun2020,2

Hi everyone, I'm currently having an issue deciding what degree I want to get through university. For background, I've been attending community college for 3 years, and for the last 2 years have been pursuing Aerospace Engineering. As of recent, I have graduated from my community college with three different associate degrees  (AS Arts, AS Science &amp; AAS Engineering Technology)  and started at a university for classes over the summer. These summer classes will technically be the end of my 2nd year of this degree.

However, I've now really come to the realization that I hate the degree I've picked. Initially, I had thought I would primarily be doing things like aircraft testing and designing such that the math I'm doing would be less relevant. Though as I have continued with this degree I have learned just how much more prevalent the math is and have been told how much it's used in the actual career field. To preface this, I absolutely hate the math in this degree, I've hated it since day 1 and have continued to dislike it. I had assumed at one point that it would get better and I would find interest in the problem solving, but I just haven't. My main reasoning for picking this degree was honestly for the high-income prospects with the median salary being well over 6 figures. Though, I really don't want to pursue something I won't really enjoy doing.

As far as careers go I was really looking at working either a government job or defense contractor job. If I did get my BA I thought Northrup Gruman or Lockheed &amp; Martin would be cool, but I've always had more of an interest in things like the FBI or CIA. My original thought out of high school was a criminology degree because I always really been more interested in law and less in how things work/design.

The main concern now is if I should continue pursuing a STEM degree which I really have little interest in or pursue a non-STEM degree. The issue I keep seeing is that a lot of non-STEM degrees are useless and make a lot less than STEM degrees. A lot of the classes I've taken, being math-heavy, won't as easily transfer to these non-STEM majors. I've taken multiple career and degree assessments online to help determine what to take, but I honestly have no idea. The general suggestions are Political Science, Criminology, Justice Studies, or Business. As careers go I've been getting Intelligence Officer, FBI Agent, CEO, or Management. Additionally, I took some personality trait tests and they have said I'm an ENTJ.

At this point, I don't know if it's worth it to switch or what exactly to switch to which allows me to get a job I want, but still have other opportunities available for me. Another main thing is I don't want to be going to school for another 3-4 years just to get a single BA. I'm still looking for something that can at least get me a decent paying job which doesn't need to pay 6 figures. Anyways if anyone has any advice on what to do or what they've done I would greatly appreciate it.

P.S. I also happen to be failing the summer classes atm which if I fail will push my Aerospace degree back a whole year (since certain classes are only available in the fall and require these as prereqs).",09Jun2020,1

Tells me he thinks they’re pretty. Now okay. I’m a lesbian. I got the first time, some dudes like to talk about who they’re attracted to. But the same two women? Same two images? Saved to his computer (he usually opens them on Microsoft paint; you can’t make this shit up lmfao). Constantly says they’re pretty.

923,"So I have a dilemma. I’m a teacher and I have a second job at a tutoring center close by my school and home. It’s a really great gig, and they’re super flexible working with my teacher’s schedule. 

I have a long distance girlfriend and I planned on visiting her this upcoming week in her home state. I asked for a week off, they gave it to me. The school is out for summer. So all worked fine. 

But now my mother wants us to go on a family vacay to Florida where we will share in the rental of a beach house and stay a week for July 4th. Also, my grandma lives five minutes from that rental, and she recently just got out of the hospital. It was a health scare, but she’s doing much better, thank God. But this made me realize how much I love my grandma and want to spend as much time as I can with her. 

But if I were to take off another week off from my second job, it would be two weeks off from work, with only one week sandwiched in between. 

On top of that they are trying to start a new Spanish Tutoring program for which I am certified and I’m the only one on staff that could teach Spanish. 

Sooo....should I take off the second week and go to Florida? Or should I not? (Btw, my second job doesn’t work on Fridays so I could maybe drive down on Thursday night, while the rest of the family would go on the Saturday before then?)

What would you do in my situation? I just don’t want to look bad at my job that I’ve only had a few months (5 or so).

925,"Sexual abuse trigger. 


I (21F) have my own experiences with my dad. My dad is a truck driver. When I was a kid I liked to go with him at work in my Hollidays. That changed when I was 12. A day my dad approached me and learned me about sex. I didn't think much about it. We had intercourse in the truck. I will yo this day decripe it as concentual. If it just ended there. We did it a few times before I didn't want to anymore. It wasn't normal. Then he tried every time I went with him, so I stopped doing it. Said I was too old for it even when I loved the trips we had. then he started to come almost every time we was home alone. Then when he woke me up in the weekends. Later when I was 16 he started to tell me to pay off favors with sex. I avoided it. He could grab me and try to take my closes off when I tried to dress. 

That was the story only the internet knows. I am now in a healthy relationship. I have no problem in bed at all or with waking around undressed or showing off. There is the but. When I get my closes on from time to time, my bf tries to take it off me, or he will touch me while I'm dressing. This just makes me think of my dad. 

My dad still hopes to have sex with me and asks for it when we are alone. I am a person of promise no matter what. I would rather go to prison for murder then tell ego the real murder is if I promised to. I promised my dad never to tell it to anyone so he would go to prison/get divorced.

My question is, should I tell him? If yes, how. He is autistic and don't really understand the concept of feeling and people not getting over their past. And also, 

I have a friend who told me her Story about years of sexual abuse. Should I show her I trust her and tell her?

928,"I don't know how to start this. I posted in the r/polyamory group a few months ago with a story that I will break down briefly before I discuss my concerns about why I think my boyfriend is not the father of my baby.

My boyfriend (24, M) and I (20, F) have been together about nine months. Back in April, we mutually decided we would enter an open relationship. He pushed me to be with his friend (who he knew I found attractive and he felt the same). It was someone we both trusted. We're going to call bim BFF (22, M). My SO (boyfriend) cheated on me a few months before that and I wholeheartedly feel he pushed me to be with BFF so he could feel as though we ""got even"". I still stayed with my boyfriend. 

I did start to develop feelings for BFF but that has changed since I found out I was pregnant a few days ago. SO knows about these feelings.

SO and I were obviously sexually active. We didn't use protection. However, in our eight month relationship, we never came close to a pregnancy scare. I have PCOS and he had tried for years with his ex fiance and a few other exes without much happening despite them being able to conceive with other men before and after their relationship.

BFF and I had sex once (we used a condom, I'm not on birth control). I was ovulating at the time we had sex (back tracked that in Clue as I keep track of my periods). Two weeks later, I took a pregnancy test. It came back positive. From what I've read online and understand about conception and fertility, you aren't actually pregnant for the first two weeks of pregnancy... maybe someone can explain more.

I know I'm probably overreacting. But realistically, I cannot positively say that the baby is my SOs. It just doesn't add up to me. Condoms are mostly effective (98% if used correctly). But I have the worst luck out of anyone I've ever met. I must have broken 1000 mirrors in a past life and it just followed me. 

Thoughts? Advice? BFF already has a child and doesn't seem thrilled. SO seems on edge and unhappy about the situation. And I'm feeling guilty even though I didn't do anything wrong...

EDIT: I felt pregnant. Just a feeling I had. I've been pregnant before (miscarriage, unfortunately). I took a pregnancy the same day my period was supposed to start. This was almost a week ago. BFF and I slept together three-ish weeks ago. Just for context.

EDIT 2: I will be keeping the baby :) I appreciate all of the ""you have options"" and stand by pro choice but I would love to be a parent.",09Jun2020,1

934,"So, I love my hometown. Sure it’s got its problems, but my job puts me in a position that I can be active in making it better, and I find working towards that ideal to be a worthy endeavor. Before this whole pandemic, during 2019, I was planning to make this place my permanent residence. I had been saving up and planning for my dream home on the ideal plot of land close by my family in the beautiful countryside that’s a 15-minute pleasant drive from my work. 

Even though I can find worth in my job, I kind of fell into it. Originally, I went to college for linguistics and was a credit shy of minoring in German. The plan when I graduated was to work until I had enough money to pursue education overseas and either get into teaching English as a second language or go into translation. Out of college, I got an unpaid internship that turned into a paid position that got me head-hunted by a business that has done a lot to raise up the community and that I'm proud to work for. It’s not what I pictured myself doing, however, and at times I hate it. But I get to write sometimes and that has always been important for me. 

2020 has brought with it wild changes, and I’m sure everyone has been reevaluating their priorities. Personally, I find myself brushing up on my German, looking into translation degrees and universities in cities I might like, and just planning out what I still need to do to be in Germany by 2021. Recently, my father who used to build houses for a living started looking into doing so again. He asked me if I still was serious about my house. If so, he could start working on foundations. Now, I’m at a loss. I can very clearly picture myself pursuing both paths.

TLDR; In 2019 I was saving up my money for my dream home in my hometown, but 2020 has made me wonder if I should use my savings for a work visa, plane ticket, and tuition for a German university to pursue my original plans.

Any advice you could give would be appreciated. I'm not sure if this changes things, but I'll be turning 26 this year.

939,"Im going into highschool in September and i’m very worried about my reputation.

Two years ago I went to a fairly mainstream public school in my town, I was going through what most would call an emo phase at the time and was also figuring out my sexuality. At the time I decided that I was nonbinary (this didn’t last very long, I now identify as female which Is also how I was born), and also bisexual, (i’m still trying to figure out my sexuality now so I don’t know if bisexual is the best term for me right now but I do still like women).

At first school was fine, but I also preached to every person in my grade that I was nonbinary and also attracted to women. It only took two months before someone started bullying me and such and that sent me into a downward spiral as he continued to humiliate me in front of my class every chance he got.

I tried to get him to stop by finally relinquishing the nonbinary thing and said I only said it so he would stop making fun of Transgender people. And at some point I told my mother and she had the school deal with him, and ever since those two months he’d never attempted to do anything bad to me again. (At least when I was around).

But I couldn’t handle all the pressure and constant anxiety, this kid was in all my main core classes and it was constantly a case of ‘life or death’ to be around him. So at the end of the year I decided to switch schools and go to a brand new one that was being built.

That year turned out great and I finally started to feel better about myself again, but now i’m going into highschool. My town only really has three highschools, two of which are mainstream and the other one being Catholic which I will not go to under any circumstances because of it’s reputation for bad kids hanging around. (Not that Catholicism is bad per say it’s just that the school is really bad for some reason).

I’ll call the other two high schools A and B since I don’t want to reveal my location

A lot of kids from the old school I used to go to are going to high school A, and only some are going to high school B. But all my friends, including the ones from my new school are going to high school A.

I decided to go to high school A in the end because it has much better programs and options than high school B. High school A also has the better reputation. I thought everything would be fine because I rationed no one would remember the embarrassing stuff I did in my second year, and that I would be fine.

But now I’ve come to realize some people still think of me as nonbinary. On a discord server my friend’s friend referred to me as a furry (I have no idea if that’s just a thing where i’m from but people would call nonbinary people furries for some reason). His friend apologized when I was shocked but still, I rationed it could be a one time instance.

But then, another friends friend asked if I was nonbinary to her (none of my friends actually knew that I used to identify that way), and now I'm starting to get worried.

I’m frankly terrified that everyone aside from my friends are going to assume I still identify that way, and even more terrified if the person who bullied me will be at my high school. (I tried to find out where he was going so I didn’t have to be around him but none of my friends knew and I saw him at both high school A and B’s open house so I have no idea).

And I have been fairly open I am attracted to women to some friends, so now I’m also worried they’re going to tell people on accident or something.

I could go to high school B, but what if the bully ends up going there? Then I’m alone without any friends and I won’t get to take the options I want, and my tormentor will be around. I can’t go to the Catholic school because of how bad it sounds, and the only other high schools are out of my town about an hour and some away.

Should I stick with my decision to go to high school A and just see how it goes? Or should I forfeit before I get hurt and attempt to take the bus into the city to go to school there? OR, should I go to high school B away from all the kids at my previous school? Any advice at all would be really appreciated.",09Jun2020,0

942,"Hey folks. So obviously this isnt the time to be choosey when looking for work. That being said I intend to take a crappy job tomorrow because money. While i toil away doing fairly meaningless factory assembly Ill be reforming my completely upended plans of relocating. I need to find my next step. I was a melter for a local foundry not long ago and found I absolutely adored it. The heat and flame and molten iron are freaking awesome. Ive toured other foundries but they are all much smaller and the work is underwhelming comparitively. 

The place i worked is a dying industry and i left due to some interpersonal issues ( idk if it was my supervisor driving my unsupervised 14yo sister to her bfs to lose her virginity or if it was the day he refused to give me a break and let me get my period on the floor then told all the other supes i cried because he yelled at me. Sorry still bitter). At anyrate i am looking for new avenues to explore a love of getting up close and personal with molten metal and would love ideas.",09Jun2020,1
944,"So I bought a graphic tablet and started learning the fundamentals. I'm also constantly practicing and tbh I can copy the references quite well so far. But I always feel kinda wrong for trying to make my sketches and studies the exact copies of the references. Feels like I am cheating and not learning anything new. Besides, there are sooo many tutorials on how to draw people, landscapes, objects etc. With such different methods of drawing I struggle to find the ones which will be the best for me.

950,"Background: Friends for 10 years, almost like sisters. I moved several states away (with my now husband). After I moved she had a baby and became more distant, less invested in our relationship. I chalked it up to her being a new mom. I got diagnosed with a chronic illness and my mom died in a year span. She never came to visit or regularly checked in. I made annual trips home and visited her and other friends while there. I planned a wedding and she was supposed to be the MOH - the only person standing up with me as it was a small wedding. No bridal shower or bachelorette party, just a small ceremony so little investment for her. She backed out the day before the wedding. Called after her plane should have left so I couldn't change her mind. Said she had to do what was best for her family (not a financial issue). I was devastated. It put a pall over the first few weeks of my marriage (what should have been a happy time). My wedding was 6 months after my mom passed. I didn't get to have my mom, or my best friend there. A year after losing my mom, my grandmother passed (we were close) and six months after my grandma, I lost my aunt. Friend never reached out when I posted the news. The only times she reached out after backing out of my wedding were to share happy news for herself (new job! another baby!) Meanwhile, I was in mourning several times over, devastated, and upset about not being in a good place in my life to have kids (so much mourning and chronic illness). Fast forward, she recently reached out again and wants to know where we stand. I'm torn. I don't want to throw away a friendship of 10 years (she gets me like no one else does) but she hasn't been there for me for a while and hasn't made a huge effort to fix the mess she made.

What should I do? I'm really torn between trying to fix it and just cutting ties. She was the last person I ever expected to not be there for me. We had a great, strong relationship up until she had a baby. I miss having someone who really understands me, but I only want to invest time in people who invest in me. I want to talk to her face to face to see her reaction to what I have to say, but can't (pandemic).

TLDR: Best friend messed up friendship, hasn't done much to fix it. I'm not necessarily ready to give up. How should I move forward?",09Jun2020,1

Pretty much the title. It's kind of stupid but still please hear me out. I (25M), for some reason cry a lot. I've cried on the last day of school/work where nobody even cared about me. I cry during the stupidest of the stupid movies. God my eyes get teared up even when I see a baby or even a baby animal. On average I've been crying for at least three times a week for the past couple of years and I'm not even exaggerating. 

I didn't care about any of these but now my girlfriend (25F) is starting to get frustrated over this. Now she gets irritated and avoids watching movies or shows with me. We've even had a couple of arguments over this when I tried to tell her that I really can't help it. And whenever we argue or especially when she raises her voice at me, my eyes literally turn into Niagara falls. So talking about it is just making it worse between us.

I don't talk to my parents and I don't really have a lot of friends other than people I know through her. So I was hoping I could get some helpful advice here.",09Jun2020,2

960,"I (20F) have been living with my partner (22M) just over a year now, but three months without our cleanaholic roommate.  We've had a few talks about splitting responsibilities and chores, but I always seem to end up doing most of it.  He gets frustrated when I ask every other day for the same thing to be done, ask him to clean up the empty cat food bags, or complain it's been three weeks since he said he'd sweep and it hasn't happened (according to him he did sweep - the area of the kitchen he walks in).  I grew up in a house where we cleaned the whole house every week, behind couches, vacuum and wash.  This is maddening because I work 5 days a week 8-4, he works 3 days, 6pm-6am.  I end up with so much work and just feel frustrated and resentful (which is why we've had our talks).  I felt really good after the one three weeks ago when he said he'd help with laundry, keep the floors and counters clean, he'd do dishes on his days off, I'd do them on his days on.  But I've been doing it when it hasn't been done.
He said ""I don't see it needing being done yet, and having you tell me to do it because you think it needs doing is really annoying"".  
Am I nagging or being unreasonable?  I already stopped cooking as often, and have been trying to give myself more me time, but seeing the things that need doing are frustrating me so much.

962,"I am a licensed security officer. I lost my job due to COVID at my most recent site. Luckily, the company I work for has security contracts with different businesses all around the city. So they can just place me at a different site if I lose work at one site. I got a call from them today and they offered me $14 an hour, Saturday through Wednesday, 4:30pm-12:30am. They say I will be driving around in a patrol car the whole time. On the upside this is the highest rate that this company offers, it will be very independent with little supervision, and I won’t technically have to do grave shifts. However, school classes are becoming more intense, I’m transferring to university from community college in the fall and need to put time into scholarship essays as well. Furthermore, I recently started talking to a counselor at school for depression and I can’t imagine being in a car by myself 40 hours a week would be good for my mental health and/or social life. Also, I occasionally have back pain and think that being in a car that long would exacerbate it. Lastly, I imagine there would be a lot of down time and so I think it would add fuel to the fire of any smartphone addiction I may have. There will probably be a lot of down time and I think the only thing you could really do while pulled over on the side of the road is browse Reddit. I have the option to say no and they will look for something else for me but its very likely that anything else they find will not be paying nearly that much, and on one hand I will need every dollar I can get for university.

my sister has no friends and no one to talk to.
My sister and I have a complicated relationship and while from her side she would let me into her life, I can not do that because it would seriously impact my mental well being.
We have a broken family dynamic that I chose to distance myself from by moving out by the end of this year.

Growing up gaming was a way out for me and led me to the most amazing people that I have met irl and that I am still in contact with.

My first go to in order to meet new people and to not be lonely would always be through games.
My sister has never played computer games.

I have an old pc where the Mainboard is fried, I want to buy a new mainboard and set the pc up in her room and introduce her to games.

Now the thing is, learning a game on your own sucks especially when you have no connection to gaming.

How and through which games can I show her the world of the internet where you can find your best friend on the other site of the world.

A short summary of my sister, she is very kind and can be lovely, she is very shy though and she has trust issues. 
I think therapy would help her a lot but she doesn't want to.
She's great with animals and works with old people, the old folks like her a lot.

Mind you, this happened all the time, but only when I did something to it. It got to a point where I repeatedly asked my mom to call the doctor but she never did.

970,"I'm a middle aged man, with a family. I own a modest rural/ vacation home, a 1000 sq ft cabin and a barn on some acreage. For the past 7 years, I've allowed my friend and his wife (both are my co-workers) use the place when I've been busy working. 
They love the place and gradually have made it the centerpiece of their lives. They spend every weekend and summer vacation there, about 100 days a year. When they are at work, all they think and dream about is going back there. They've cultivated a huge vegetable garden and use the barn workshop for vintage car restoration hobby. They also store 5 older cars and trucks there, and boxes of car parts. 

They do not pay any bills, but they keep the place clean and gladly help with repairs, although I don't like asking. They have a set of keys and mostly come and go as they please. 
This bothers me as they use the place more than I do. Even though they are my friends, I feel they are intruding in my private space and my possessions, using my kitchen, my workshop, my tractor, firewood, electricity, water etc to live there and work on their own projects. 

They love the place and I don't want to deny them happiness but I feel I'm not in the  business of providing charity vacation space. I don't want to make any money off them but I just want the place for myself, as I paid for it and I own it. I never envisioned or planned to share the place. There's no financial need to share. 

FWIW, many people in my  city have rural  vacation homes and I've never heard of anyone extending vacation home use like this. It's not for lack of interest, I'm sure there's millions of people who'd like free use of a vacation home. 

Deep down, I'm tired of them using the place. I don't want them there. But I've put up with it to make them happy, as they cannot afford their own place and are deeply grateful for my generosity. They are introverts and have  few other friends or social connections. 

Am I excessively generous or foolish with this  open invitation? 

Is it reasonable to keep personal space and home private like everyone else does? 

Is it reasonable to ask them to use the place less, just so I can feel more secure? If yes, what do I tell them?  

Or should I put up with my discomfort and enjoy the friendship and gratitude? 

Thank you",09Jun2020,3

972,"I live in a corrupt Eastern European country with an unemployment rate of over 50%. Back in 2007 I made a decision to study English, literature and education, unaware of the hardship I'd go through in the future.

Four years later I got my degree with a very high GPA and, as you might expect based on the intro, I barely worked in the next 4 years. I decided to get my MA thinking it would help. A year later I got my degree, with an even higher GPA and got a job.

A teaching job in my country is very hard to get and the contract always lasts for only 10 months. Every year I have to apply to a dozen of schools and within a few days go to a dozen of interviews (if I make it to all of them) and still mostly get rejected because of no political background.

Last year was horrible. The county government passed a bill that does away with ranking applicants based on certain criteria and replaced it with a written exam. Even worse, placing first (as I did) on any of those exams means nothing since the principal gets to pick whoever he/she wants out of all the applicants that passed the exam. I barely got a part time job earning only $200 a month.

I fear (know) it will only get worse since most people are emigrating (fleeing) to different countries in droves and less and less students enroll on every level of education.

A friend of mine is offering me a really good job in the Middle East, while a cousin is offering me to go back to the country I was born in (Netherlands).

Here's the thing: I don't want to.

I'm a highly emotional person, extremely introverted (though I hide it really well) and have to deal with anxiety on top of it all.

The thought of moving anywhere puts me into a really depressed state.

What's even worse is I'm really close to my mother and feel like I have a huge obligation to take care of her, especially since my father died two years ago. It would break my heart to see her cry over me leaving.

On the other hand I'm married, have been for a decade now. My wife, despite going to college herself, insists I take the job opportunity being offered to provide her (and myself) a better life. She feels it's my obligation to work and provide and if that means moving half way around the world then so be it.

There are other possible solutions of course, but none that would satisfy my wife. I really only need $500 a month to live, would even be satisfied with $400, and am willing to work any job. I'm even considering taking a loan to get my PhD yet she seees that as even more expenses without any income.

I'm at a loss. I've been crying my eyeballs out thinking about the possibility of leaving my house, the willow tree nearby that I love, the valley I walked through a thousand times, my old mother and her smile whenever she sees me.

On the other hand I love my wife and want to make her happy. We've been unable to have kids and it's my fault. I need $5000 for IVF and this job would give us that opportunity.

I have no one to turn to and ask for compassion or motivating advice. I've tried speaking to my wife but she simply berates me ad nauseam. It's that time of the month now but still...calling me a cry baby and telling me I'm useless isn't something anyone wants to hear, especially from their spouse.

Any advice would be appreciated. If nothing else, a few kind words would go a long way.

980,"I met this person 8 tears ago and she was the only person I could be open with, I’m generally self conscious and try not to talk to people too much, because I think I’m bothering them. But with her I’ve never felt that, we both draw so we connected well, I consider her to be my best friend even tho I know I wasn’t hers. 
In our last year of school we spent every day together because we were preparing for college exams together. We both passed and she went abroad to study. We didn’t text much when she was there, which I understand, she was busy and time zone was a problem. But we would still check up on each other. 
She would come back during brakes and we would meet up a few times but things changed after I invited her to my house, yahh for the first time after 8 years of being friends, I don’t know how that happened. Nothing unusual happened, I cooked a meal for us and we watched a movie. she went back to college soon after. she stopped texting me after that. she didn’t text me for a month, I reached out to her but nothing seemed off.I invited her to my place a year ago and ever since then I’m always the one to text her and ask how she’s doing. I never thought much of it because she was  busy in college, tho I also go to college I gave her the benefit of doubt. 
She came back because of covid and has been here for almost 3 months. I didn’t even know that she came back until I checked up on her. I stopped texting her because now I thought I was bothering her. We’ve only had 3 very short, 4 sentence conversations. I always started the conversation of course. 
she’s not exactly the most normal person, she’s a painter so she has her bizarre, weird moments.   I study architecture so I come across painters in my college often, most of them are quite introverted. She did dive in to her artistic side a lot more in the past years, so I don’t know if she became more reserved. But I’ve known her for 8 years, that’s not an excuse. 
One thing I can consider a problem in our relationship is that I’m not the most comfortable with feelings, I rarely display it and never driven by them while she’s very much driven by it and paints with feelings, she shows her feelings with paintings. 
Also we used to connect with art, but now I went with architecture and she studies art. We completely lost that connection. But that still doesn’t change who we are. 
I seriously don’t know what the problem is. The feelings thing can’t be the only thing. I seriously think that she just doesn’t like me for no good reason, though she never showed any other signs other than never reaching out to me. 
 I have asked her if she doesn’t like me or if I’m bothering her, but she always looks at me weirded out and denies it. It just feels like she’s ghosting me and I don’t know if I should just give up or still give her the benefit of doubt and keep the relationship like this. I do really want to go back to being the type of friends we used to be. I’m trying to find the problem in me but I can’t pin point it. 


Sorry, this is a little long. Also I don’t know if the answer is obvious but I don’t see it. Any suggestions will be very much appreciated. Also sorry if I don’t make sense in some parts, I’m not the best in storytelling.",09Jun2020,0

984,"This is a long one, sorry, I need to feel like what I am about to do is not the wrong thing to do! I need advice on my best friend living with me. Sorry this is going to be all over the place too. 

So, I made friends about 6 months ago with this woman and she became my best friend pretty easily. I am 26 and she is in her 40s. She has a lot of physical health issues. She was staying with her family who is a bunch of drug addicts and abuse her physically and mentally. 

She found her way into staying at my house. She pays no rent or  pays for anything. She does go out of her way to try to find services to help pay for stuff ( i.e food donations, electric help etc)  and she helps take care of my son and helps me clean. Which is all fine and dandy, except my mental health is SEVERELY taking a hit! I NEED MY SPACE BACK. She is ALWAYS THERE. ALWAYS. She has taken over my house. I recently got a new boyfriend and it got serious enough to where it was time to have him over and meet my toddler. I had to PAY $100 to get her a motel room JUST SO I COULD HAVE MY HOUSE FOR ONE NIGHT. Then on top of that I had to pay for her to eat out while she was out my house. Come to find out, she had a guy over, she had me pay for both their food, had him over night at her motel room ( against the rules) WITH A DOG (also against the rules) and then had the audacity to invite him over to my house the next day without my permission. I was asleep taking a nap and then there he was. I had to bring my son home to him being there come to find out he was a drug addict. IN MY HOME. I havent felt that disrespected in a long time. 

I told her, I could get an eviction notice at any time because she was not on my lease. On top of that, I am on Section 8 aka 30% of my income no matter what for the rest of my life and I could loose that for her being there.

I told her she had until the end of quarantine to figure out a place to go. She tells me all the shelters are not accepting people due to covid and being over booked. But I struggle to find that to be true because I hear nothing about it. In fact, we hardly speak now because just the sound of her voice is so annoying now. I am starting to HATE her. 

She also wants me to spend money on weed for her to help her with her physical pain.  She gets kidney stones a lot, she goes to the ER a lot for pelvic pain. Like A LOT, so I get shes in a lot of pain. But how is this my problem?!?!?!! Why should my family suffer for her body? 

I feel like she is starting to use emotional tactics to have me feel bad for her and keep her there. 

Like, for example, the day after I picked her up from the motel room she told me she was looking out the bedroom window cause she felt like I was going to abandon her there.

She keeps on crying to me about how bad she feels about herself and how bad her emotional pain is and her physical pain how her family inflicted the emotional pain on her.

But, I see no instance in which she is trying to better it for herself!

She just mopes on my couch all day and smokes weed for her pain.

Oh, and by the way, I quit smoking weed 3 months ago. But she still wants me to go buy it for her and then I have to smell it and see it still in my house.  When she doesnt have it, she doesn't even clean or do anything. 

for the past 4 months this is all shes been doing while I've been putting myself on the emotional back burner and financial back burner. I am about to have a mental break down.

She costs me 150 dollars extra a month by staying with me.

Next month my utility help is going to run out and I will start having to pay child care services ( the gov. suspended all payments for a couple months) I WILL BE BROKE. Every. single. penny. to bills. Like I'm going to have to rely on my kids dad for not even the $100 child support just to make sure he has diapers and things he needs.

I feel like I have done everything I can to help her, and I feel like I have done more than any other person would of in this situation. 

So, this is the ONLY solution I can think of,  start calling the shelters myself and getting her name on lists and when one calls me back with an opening, give her an ultimatum of either you go here or you go to the streets cause you are obviously not trying to figure your life out and if you decline then you are just so obivously taking advantage of me. 

If I loose my housing, all of us are on the streets. Well, I'd be moving in with my grandparents and with how hard it is right now, we would not be finding our own apartment anytime soon.

I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO

Am I being to harsh?

It's been 4 months! WHEN IS SHE GOING TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND OWN UP TO HER OWN CRAP!

I CANT HELP SOMEONE WHO WONT HELP THEMSELVES

I feel like I have \*\*\*\*ed myself off long enough for this woman and it's time she figures it out. I need my life back, my home back, my money back, my home weed- free. My emotional wellbeing back. 

I have a 2nd dependent that I can't claim and I can't afford. 

But, I am a seriously gentle and kind person.

I'm having a hard time treading this. 

I feel like if I have a conversation with her she will indirectly use if I give her a 30 day warning she will stop cleaning, stop helping me watch my kid all together.

986," On marketplace I stumbled upon a Guns N Roses flag, this man’s Father got it thrown at him at a Roses concert, 30 YEARS AGO, This guy wanted $100 for it, I said pass, then said let’s do $70, I still don’t think it’s worth, but it would be nice to have. 


What I’m really asking here is; How much would you pay for a flag of a band that you like that was from a concert 30 years ago?",09Jun2020,1
987,"Hi. I’ve been helping a person who is struggling with mental illness (OCD, depression) and addiction (alcohol, apparently heroin at one point—could still be going on afaik) for a few months now, and it’s been feeling like a losing battle. I’ve been very patient with this person (you sort of have to be when they don’t even answer 75% of your texts and calls); I know to not reprimand them, try to be as understanding as possible, be a listening ear, console them, let them know I’m not angry or upset with them, suggest they go to rehab, get therapy, etc., but it’s just not getting through. I know ultimately this person has to make the decisions to admit they have a problem and help themself, but it seems they’re doing everything in their power not to. Today particularly made me feel despondent, as they told me they would drive down to where I live so I can help them get proper treatment (likely have them go to AA and get set up with a therapist) and possibly live with me if need be, but a friend of theirs contacted me and informed me that they’ve run away with some random person again and are doing god knows what. But to the point of this post’s title, when I had gotten off the phone with that person, a thought jumped into my head: “Things would be so much easier if they were just dead.” I felt disgusted with myself for even thinking that, and I’m still unsure if I really meant it or not. I desperately want this person to get better, I do—they’re a close relative of mine, and it hurts me deeply to see not just them suffering, but their mother as well (she’s old and feels incredibly anxious about this whole thing). It’s been causing strain in our family as well. I don’t know what to do. I’ve been able to help people get treatment and turn their life around in the past, but nothing is working here.  It’s like a torturous game of cat and mouse, days on days of caginess and false promises. I know I shouldn’t be so self-absorbed, but I just feel so drained. I guess what I’m asking for here is what left is there for me to do with this person, and how can I deal with my frustrations?",09Jun2020,3

I don't really know if this is the good sub but here is my problem :

I'm a 20 year old student  in computer science and due to covid all the internships of my university have been canceled. Furthermore, borders might be open in Europe but I don't feel like it's a good idea to travel in these times.

I really don't wanna spend this summer on video games / netflix.

999,"Hi, i dont expect anyone to read this but if someone does i tried my best to shorten it and make it readable.

So im 16 and i have to begin college (uk) in a couple of months and i still need to apply for a subject. I was originally planning to do an apprenticeship in a random job but since covid and the fact that I live in the countryside theres not that many places hiring or looking for an apprentice.
This means that i have to apply for a course instead and actually go to college but the problem with that is that im incapable of making decisions,  to the point that it makes me panic and break down.  Another big problem is that  absolutely nothing at all interests me. I dont find anything fun or likable and when i do find something i like i always lose interest in a couple of weeks. 
So its really hard for me to choose or think about college and it doesnt help that my dad is constantly nagging me about it and saying that ill just waste my life and he wouldnt be surprised since im so lazy and comparing me to everyone else whos has applied and has plans for the future. 
Its getting close to the deadline for applications and every time i think about it i just want to break down and   i have absolutely no one to talk to about how i feel since my  'friends' stopped talking to me months ago and my dad just says im being over dramatic, attention seeking and lazy. 
I guess im just here to get it off my chest and to tell someone else over than myself and the wall (i talk to myself a lot and sometimes to random objects because i have no one else ro talk to)
If anyone who reads this has any advice or has been in a similar situation I'd really love to hear it .
Thank you.",09Jun2020,1
1000,"Okay this is my first reddit post and I’m just gonna let it all out cause what the heck? Why not? 

Okay first I’m a 19 year old female and I wanna start from where everything started going downhill and I want to provide some background cultural information so you kinda understand where I’m coming from. 

My parents are from the Middle East and they moved to the USA in 1999 and have been living here ever since. I am the second of 6 kids. Although we are living in a western country my parents still teach and enforce their culture and traditions on us. A very sexist culture if you ask me. 

For example, females are taught that their role and purpose in life is to be a good wife and mother. That’s it. Females don’t have dreams. They don’t get to follow their dreams. Education isn’t necessary for girls. Young girls are taken out of school, usually in middle or high school. My mother and her sisters never made it past 6th grade. I even know girls here in America that were taken out of school. They always say that if a girl knows what 2+2 is then what else does she need to know. Then they take her out and put her in her place(the house). They teach her more valuable lessons like cooking, cleaning and others duties of a housewife. She is then married off when she is “ready”. Usually from 15-20 years old. More “modern” families keep their daughters until she in her mid 20s but never older than 25. She is then considered too old. 

A female is always under the control of the male figures in her life. Her father, brother( even if he is younger than her) and maybe grandpa and uncles. My mother for example is 100% reliant on my father. He provides everything. Like many Arab women, she is not allowed to drive, so anytime she wants to go somewhere she must ask my father to take her, which 8/10 he says no. And she has to accept that. It’s not right nor is it fair. In my Arab community I have only met ONE female that is actually going to a university and isn’t tied to these cultural shackles. But she got married on her third year and she was promised by her husband that he would allow her to continue her education but it’s been three years and she has a kid and she never got to continue. 

Two of my first cousins were married last year. They are now both forced to wear the niqab. I know they hate but what can they do. They must obey their husbands’ order. One is now pregnant. I feel so bad for her. But she pretends that everything is fine. I don’t want to end up like her. I hate seeing girls just give in. I want to see a girl refuse I want her to fight back. I’ll be that girl. Or at least I’ll try. 

Okay. I hope that’s enough background info now about me and why I’m here. When I started sixth grade my mother made me start wearing the hijab and start covering my arms and legs. I am to wear loose fitting clothing that conceal my body shape. I did not like it. I was eleven. I’ve been covering for 8 years now. I still do not like it. I do not agree with the reasoning behind it. I hate it actually. I should and want to be able to wear what I want. But I can’t. And a lot of the times I say that I do want to wear what I want. I’m accused of wanting to wear booty shorts, tank tops and other revealing clothing. No I don’t. I just wanna wear I want. Tshirt and jeans. That’s it. Thats all I want. 

I’m not even allowed to cut my hair. My own hair. Simply because men don’t like short hair. And I’ll never get married if I have short hair. I don’t care about what men like and don’t like. It’s my hair. I recently cut it anyways. I love it. I got into a shit load of trouble. But I don’t care anymore. I’m sick of this shit. 

I’m not allowed to have a phone number. I have a phone though. I’m not allowed to stay in touch with friends. I am not to befriend an American unless absolutely necessary. I want to be friends with whoever I want to be friends with, I don’t care about race or nationality. So basically I have no friends. Zero. I have no one to talk to. Only my cousins and that’s only when I see them. Which is rarely. 

I’m not allowed to leave the house. Only times I leave the house is for doctor appointments and if my older brother goes grocery shopping I beg him to take me with him. I just want to get out of the house. See other human beings. 

So now I’m here on the internet ranting to whoever chooses to listen. Next I want to talk about school. That’s kinda of the central topic. I went to public from k-10th grade. 10th grade that’s not bad! No one has made it that far. I was convinced that I was gonna make it. I was gonna graduate! I was gonna be different. But nope. I was taken out of school to start my “training” to be a housewife. I knew that marriage was soon to be next. I had to figure something out. I was googling what to do for days and I decided to call CPS. Bad idea. A day after my birthday an agent came to our house and spoke to everyone in the family. No one knew i was the one who called. 
When she finally spoke to me i told her everything. I told her that my parents aren’t letting me continue school and that they were definitely going to marry me off just like all the other girls. I was scared. I was 16. I didn’t want to be married to a strange older man. I wanted someone to help me. After I said all this she just raised her eyebrows at me as if I’m making this shit up. She said “ so what you’re telling is that your parents aren’t letting you go to school?” I said yes that exactly what I’m saying. She just stared at me. Like I was lying to her. She nodded her head and asked me to call in the next person to interview. And that was it. I risked it by calling cps and I wasn’t even given an ounce of reassurance. The moment she left, the house was dead quiet. I fucked up. And let’s just say I knew what was coming. I’ll just add that my parents still do not know that it was me that called. They think I told a friend what was going on and they snitched. If they knew it was me, i don’t know what they would’ve done to me. 
However the following week my dad called me into his office and told me he was enrolling me into an online high school program. Maybe the cps agent did help me. I WAS GOING TO GRADUATE! And I did! I graduated in 2018. I am the first female in my family and extended family to graduate high school. I’d probably say this is my biggest accomplishment. But this also brought a lot of judgement and a lot of relatives and friends of my parents saying that it was taboo and sinful. That my parents have sinned. They don’t know how to raise a girl. And my dreams of continuing my education were crushed. 

So I was put in the kitchen and now i am responsible for cooking breakfast, dinner and supper for the entire family. I have to make sure my siblings get up and get ready for school. I do the family laundry. I sweep and mop the house. I do the dishes. I change the sheets. I clean my siblings’ room. I have to change diapers and put my little siblings to sleep and feed them. So on and so on. The chores and duties don’t stop. I’m tired of it. I’m tired of it all. I’m tired of doing things that are not MY responsibility. 

And for two years I did not dare bring up the topic of college. But this year I did. And somehow my father agreed. But only if it was online. I am not allowed to leave the house. So I did thorough research and found wgu. I enrolled in their academy and I start wgu in July. I plan on getting my bachelors in elementary edu and I can get it done in 2 and 1/2 years. That’s amazing and it plays a part in my plan that I want to discuss later on. I’m really proud of myself. I feel like I’m getting stuff done. 

But I still haven’t gotten my drivers license. I feel that I can get it this year or if not the next. I have been practicing driving with my order brother, who isn’t a sexist piece of poop. He agreed to taking me to the dmv. I was supposed to go recently but the pandemic ruined my plans. But I hope I get it soon. I know it’ll grant me the little freedom that I need. So my plan isn’t fully developed but I’ll talk about it anyways. I want to leave. And in my state I’m still a minor. I cannot legally leave until I’m 21. I’ll turn 21 in June 2022. That’s two years later. 
I want to spend those years slowly getting more freedom and not being constantly watched by my parents. They track down everything I do. Especially my mom. She knows if my period is late and wants to know why I was in my room for 13 minutes and constantly goes through my phone. As if there’s anything to go through. I have absolutely no alone time and no privacy. 
And I know my time is running out. I have a feeling my mom isn’t gonna let me finish college. She hates it. She’s constantly talking about so and so who recently got married and how I’m 19 and I’m not. She tells that no matter what degree I get. I will never work. No man will let me work. I’m wasting my time. That she’ll get me married as soon as I graduate. 
Before coronavirus she started taking me along with her to “friends” house. I didn’t know that I was being observed and that there were potential suitors. All these old women I was meeting where there to see me because they’re lookin) for a wife for their sons. 

Anyways I never fit the desired description. They always want a fair skinned girl with long luscious hair and big boobs. I’m none of that. As an Arab I’m tan. My mother constantly tells me to use whitening creams. I lie and tell her that I am using what she give me. Im okay with my pigmented skin. I don’t care who doesn’t. I’m a proud member of the itty bitty titty committee. It’s a shame that the first person to bully me about my chest size is my own mother. No I’m not gonna wear a padded bra. It is what it is. So I feel like the only reason I have yet to be married off is bc I’m not “pretty” enough. It does kinda of destroy my self esteem but honestly it’s buying me more time. 

Plus my mom has enrolled me in Islamic classes and another class to learn Arabic. I hate it. She wants me to do well. I don’t do well. It’s hard. Arabic is one the hardest languages to learn. And it’s so hard to do good on something you don’t want to be doing in the first place. She’s constantly telling me that if I don’t do better she’ll take me out of college. She’ll break my laptop and rip my schoolwork. This is just the beginning. Who knows how she’s gonna treat me throughout my college experience. I just know it won’t be good. She won’t show me an ounce of support. It’s upsetting. Plus the classes are taking so much time from me. Time I could be using to study and do classwork since wgu is self paced. 

So like I was saying I want to leave. When I turn 21 I plan on leaving. I need to figure out how to save up money. I feel that maybe if I get my license soon then maybe just maybe I can work up the courage to ask my dad if I can get a job. That’ll have to be next year or so. I’ll have to get them used to me leaving the house, driving around and stuff. Slowly becoming independent. I’ll probably say that I want a job to help my dad pay for my college or something like that. I don’t know yet. 
Getting a job is very very very very important. I definitely need some type of financial independence. I need money to be able to have somewhere to live on my own. Plus I’ll be leaving the house. Me leaving the house. Sounds unbelievable but Im crossing my fingers and toes that’ll I’ll be able to accomplish that. I hope that maybe I’ll be able to befriend someone. Maybe I’ll meet someone that can help me in some way. 

I feel so guilty thinking about it but I’m sure this is what I want. I tired of living like this. This isn’t me. I wanna be me for the first time in my life. I’m not a bad person for wanting change. I’m not a bad person for wanting to be free. Am I? I feel heartless. But I want freedom. I want it so bad. I want to wear whatever clothing I want. Whatever makeup I want. Do whatever I want with my hair. Believe what I want to believe. I respect every religion and other’s beliefs. But I don’t want to be religious. Why don’t I have that option? I want to set my own values and morals. I want to leave the house when I want. Go to an ice cream shop. I want to go to the movies or the park or the fair or the mall or anywhere! Hang out with a friend. Talk to a friend. Heck I want a friend. I want to have a job. I want to be independent. I want to fall in love. Not marry someone my parents picked out for me. There’s so many little things that I want. Why don’t I get to have those things? 

I know that if things do get bad and my parents do try to force a marriage on me before I have the chance to leave. I found Unchained At Last. It helps those trying to escape a forced marriage and even child marriages. I would totally seek help from there. 

Sooooo that was a lot. Like a lot. I’m just letting it all out. I feel like I need to. So if you read this far. thank you so much! &lt;3
I’ll take any advice about whatever you’d like to talk to me about. If you have any ideas or tips or anything please tell me. 
Any advice on how to get more independence at home. And how to keep avoiding marriage. And to prevent ever having to be in a forced marriage situation. Or if my parents ever do try to take me out of college. Mostly worried about my mom. I know she’s capable of convincing my dad. 

Sorry if this is all over the place I’m trying to type this as fast as I can.

The job I had before I moved here let me do slightly better financially but not enough to have been able to afford living there, which is why I’m here now.

1008,"Hi everyone. 

When I was 14 years old I had met this older guy and we started hanging out. I was on a rampage of poor behavior and bad decisions, and I did not have proper parental figures to steer me in the right direction. I was looking to escape from my current life situation, and this 19 year old guy invited me to hangout. I said yes. He brought me back to his place for some drinks, and then we had sex.

For the next 5 months I remained in his basement. His behavior was bad, often using me for sex, poor temperment, calling me names and spreading rumors about me whenever I would talk to other people or try to leave. He fed me Pizza Pizza, bowls of ramen, packs of bacon, and whenever his disability check would come in, a lot of alcohol.

I stayed there willingly, not wanting to go home. He offered me the attention I lacked in my own home, and given my age, I strongly believe that I did not know any better.

His brother came over a few times who was closer in age to me, being 16 when I was 14. Him and I became close, quick friends. I remember messaging him after a rough night with 19 year old, fearing that I may have been raped, but he had convinced me otherwise. Telling me that it had been consensual and nobody would listen or believe me, given that I willingly stayed in this guy's basement. 

Fast forward, I eventually felt like I did not want to be there anymore. I decided this after he left me in his basement to go hangout with another girl. That was it. I left and went home. I recieved a flow of angry messages from him afterwords, and I felt guilt, but I did not go back to him.

Fast forward to now, I am now 21, and realizing the damages of these events. Sexual acts with my partner are a challenge, I often shut down in fear or I get so wildly uncomfortable that I really can not enjoy sexual acts to their extent. I have a very hard time expressing my sexual needs as I feel sick whenever I touch on the subject. It is not all bad, though. Given my past, we have a pretty okay sexual life, although unpredictable at times. 

I am posting on here, wondering if it would be wrong for outing my friends brother on social media? I want to do this for a few reasons, one being that I want to spread awareness for other girls who have been or may currently be in my situation, two, to hopefully come to some conclusions about my past, and three, to open up about the experience I have faced, in hopes to try and move past them. 

I let his brother know, now 23, that I planned on doing this, and I wanted to let him know prior and to hear his thoughts. Immediately, he retorted by telling me he has already heard this whole story 8 years ago, and he believes that I gave my consent, therefore I have no standing whatsoever, and should just move on. He also told me that I was, ""pointing the gun in the wrong direction"" and told me to place the blame on my mother, who has since passed away. 

I am now feeling guilty and unsure of what I should do from here, and I feel like if I out this guy, it may not be recieved the way I expect it to, and I would be hurting his family in the crossfire. I am also unsure I am mistaken with what happened in that basement, and if I need to take responsibility for it. Knowing other people's opinion would help me take the next steps in this situation.

**edit**I do not want to file with the police. Social media is currently the best place to go for this, in my opinion. Social media is where change has been happening, as well as helping to gain exposure on these types of situations. The police WOULD NOT do anything for me.

I would like to also add that I have a string of photos I had posted on my Instagram in 2014 that clearly show I am at this man's house for 4 months.",09Jun2020,0

1012,"Hello All,
I have recently been feeling frustrated with my career opportunities. I am recent college grad (Summer 2018) with a degree in Public Relations living in Houston Texas. Since graduating getting interviews for PR jobs have been tough, and I have not even come to close to getting a job in the field. During this time however I have noticed that it has been pretty easy getting interviews and job offers for sales positions. These are often the ones where you solicit (using that word for lack of a better one in this case) people in stores to buy the product your company has a contact with. Until recently I have looked down upon these jobs due to advice from a professor in college to not get duped into doing sales because companies use PR job postings to real get people to come in and do sales. Due to my changing circumstances in life right now (i.e. about to become a father and leasing an apartment for the first time) these opportunities have become more attractive to me. Since graduating I have worked as a office clerk for an air cargo company, a order filler in a warehouse, and currently as a delivery driver for an amazon contracted delivery service provider. This is what  has led to my recent frustration in these jobs I feel like I’m not going to end up where I want to be and I feel like I’m not using any of the skills I have acquired from college. Which leads me to look at sales i look at this as an opportunity to use my brain to make money instead of my body which is a change of pace I want and also the potential to at least leverage any potential success into other higher up positions in the sales industry. Which leads me here! I am here asking for advice from people who have transitioned from other careers into sales and for a mentor that could help tailor my resume and groom me with some tips to help me be successful in going into this new role. Some questions I would like answered are:
1.) If you transitioned into sales what are some the challenges?
2.) What are the best sales careers to be looking into?
3.) Which skills should I be highlighting on my resume and In interviews to better my chances at getting a sales job?
4.) If you are a college grad not in their field or just frustrated with where you are job wise what do you do to deal with that so it doesn’t make you and angry and depressed mess?
Thank you for your time and help it’s greatly appreciated!
TL:DR version
Recent College Grad and Expectant Father wants career change and is tired of working jobs that undermines his potential. Wants change of pace and to work with his Brain and not body like he has for past two jobs and needs tips on entering into sales field, which sales jobs to look at, dealing with frustration not being in a job he feels offers advancement or uses his skills, what to put on his resume to stick out to people looking for employees to enter their sales force, and general advice about transitioning from one career to another!

1014,"A little backstory to clearify things.

I was a little 3 year old boy with 1 year old sister, mother got deported cuz her visa expired and dad didnt want to renew it for some reason and she almost kidnapped us to her country but my dad stopped her at the airport and now shes gone and banned fr visiting the country i live in.


Fast forward 17 years later.

 im now 20 years old, my dad always told me that he will arrange a meeting between us but never did and we ""the kids"" was never able to contact her. 
I spent some time in the past few years looking for her around social media, only knowing her first and last name, didnt help much except for one incident.
I came across a facebook profile with her name and country, tried contacting her thru an anonymous account, she didnt reply, 
A few days ago i tried with my official account, and to my surprise she did reply, she said something along the lines of 

""is this really you OP""
""i never thought you would find me""
"" i tried contacting you thru several connections but nobody wanted me to contact you"" 

So according to her she tried contacting us but my dad wouldn't allow and she contacted our relatives in hope of getting a clue of where we were, but didnt have any luck. 

What do i do now, should i keep talking to her? Should i tell my father? Ignore everything move on with my life? Im really confused and dont know what to do...",09Jun2020,3

I know I should not just beat around the bush but I also don't think just walking up  to him going ""you drink to much slow down"" and walk away would be the right option either.

1029,"So this is probably an addition to my awkward life scenarios.

I (F21) just caught my eleven year old little brother watching porn and he knew he got caught. I know that this is reality, one day he'll be curious and venture into this side of the web. But I just didn't expect it to be this early I guess? We also came from a rather conservative family and he's the youngest. 

Being an older sibling, I just don't want to let this slide because I believe that what just happened will have an impact in his life. I somehow want to tell him that watching explicit stuff is biologically normal to cater to our needs as humans, scientifically speaking; but at the same time I don't want to tolerate this at an early age. I care about his mental health.

My ex and I broke up around may this year. She wanted to just be friends but I felt like I couldn’t pretend to be friends with someone I was in love with, so we decided to stop talking. Fast forward to a few days ago, I’m in a bad mental state, I miss her, think about her all the time, write endless letters about her, etc. I decide to try acid (yes I know you’re supposed to be in a positive state of mind when doing acid) but I didn’t really care. Had the worst trip possible, felt like I was dying, and the only thing that could calm me down was to call my ex and talk to her otp. After that we started talking again every few days, to every day. She then told me she wanted to try again with me, to date me. I learned that while we were broken up, she had kissed a guy, and had sex with another guy. After learning that, it’s like I couldn’t do it anymore. Knowing I hadn’t did anything with anyone else, because I felt like I was so in love with her that I couldn’t. I couldn’t stop thinking about her being intimate with another man, doing the things she did with me for him. I felt really possessive and jealous. I completely understand that we were broken up and that she’s allowed to do whatever she wants considering she’s single, I’m not saying it’s her fault. I just felt hurt. I then told her that I didn’t want to have any communication with her, not to text or call me. In saying all of that, now, I have this weird feeling. Like something’s telling me to change my mind, like my heart is telling me that I made a mistake. I miss her and think about her every day, she’s my first love. I know she misses me too.

Our son is happy overall and has a great attitude about it. My ex explained that the kids will never be around the dog again and she will be working on his k9 etiquette. 

Am I an a jerk for thinking that the bite should be reported to the state? How do I diplomatically make this request of her without opening a can of emotional worms?

When I try to have a good conversation about how they shouldn't do this and it's not right my mother says to me that they bought it so it's not even mine, although some of my stuff I have paid from working on black because in my country you can't work legally if you're under 18. Recently she gave my bike to a friend of hers and she was hoping I won't get back on time, and I did and I was really nice to the woman. I called my mother and a bit calmly I told her that she pissed me off big time with this and she tried lying her way again and when that wasn't working she hung up. Today when we were eating she started fake laughing a lot and spit on me. I'm always calm but this just stepped on my nerves. I started yelling at her because I have told her many times (calmly) to be careful when she eats. She started saying ""If you don't like me why are you here?"". I realized that she never has cared for the family, she really doesn't understand what a son is. I ask everywhere for a job to save up money and run away and I don't have any friends that can help me emotionally, I always end up alone in vulnerable times. Do you know any books, articles, videos or whatever to spend my time on while I have to live with them? Something non-fiction, something that I can relate to. Or maybe even something about earning money.

I said I’d respect that and let her be but I was stupid and genuinely forgot and texted her like things were normal and was gearing up to finally tell her how I feel. She left me on read and I don’t know what to do. Obviously I’m going to respect that she wants some time to herself but I feel bad for texting anyway like an idiot. I didn’t confess my feelings to her like I hoped to I just said “Good morning! How’d you sleep?”. Should I apologize for not respecting her boundaries and explain it or will that overwhelm her more?

1044,"So, I’m a white american who recently saw a black acquaintance post that they would be unfriending any white person who isn’t actively dismantling their own anti-blackness. I was rather surprised to find the next day that I made the list of people they unfriended. 

I’d like to give a general description of my development of understanding race. I definitely grew up immensely privileged. I went to private school, most of my classmates were wealthy white people. This is in a liberal city, and I was raised with the belief that I was not racist, because I believed racism to be bad. 

Ten years ago in college is when I started learning about the complexities and pervasiveness of white supremacy. I was finally being exposed to different backgrounds, and I listened and learned so much. Or I thought I did. I became very against the prison industrial complex, police brutality, job discrimination, housing discrimination, etc, and very supportive of funding education, paying reparations, minority representation in pop culture, increased diversity, intersectionality theory, investing in social services, etc. I became more aware of my own microagressions towards POC and worked to unlearn these behaviors. Originally, I would frequently share posts about social justice, on a variety of issues (I’m a gay woman, just for a little more context). But as I got older and my social media use slowed down somewhat, I was less of a daily social-justice-sharer and more of the type to engage during times of heightened conversation on such topics (ie the 2016 election, me too movement, BLM, etc). As I got older and became more financially stable, I started donating money regularly to POC individuals in my digital sphere pretty much any time I saw an ask for funds, and would donate to organizations from time to time as well. 

Ever since the police murdered George Floyd, I’ve been pretty vocal about my beliefs that police should be abolished and we should reform our society to handle social issues without unnecessary violence. I’ve mostly been sharing posts, rather than making any original posts. I sort of felt like for me to make a personal post about racism would be like seeking attention for being woke. I want to make a genuine difference, not just try to get clout, so I share the voices that need to be heard right now. 

I know that there is always more to learn about dismantling white supremacy, and I’m so very open to challenging myself to do better. But I have no idea how I could ever have conveyed that to the person who unfriended me. I don’t think it would have been great to ask them to put in labor explaining to me, and I felt that any announcement of my personal goals in dismantling racism would come across as “I’m not like other white people” which surely is annoying as well? 

I understand this person unfriending me on the basis of being a random white person they met years ago, like I completely empathize with wanting to distance oneself from the privileged right now. This just surprised me. 

So if anyone has any advice for TRULY coming through for POC, please comment!",09Jun2020,2

So i don’t know if anyone is gonna read this but if you do thank you,

Also for references this is being posted again because i want more people to see it.

I’m only 17 and i met this girl like 10 months ago.  I was so beyond happy with her and she dumped me over text because she lost feelings for me. And i get that life has people come and go.  I know this might take you back because of my age but i really thought she was the one, she was my first love and i thought she was perfect.  

I haven’t told many people this but my moms is terminally ill with stage 4 metastatic breast and bone cancer, and they’re doing everything they can but i don’t know how much longer she has left, I don’t if she’ll see me graduate or have kids or get my first big job.  I thought at the very least i could show her who i thought it was gonna be and i feel like that’s just been thrown back in my face.  

Other than that i live a very privileged life, i have my problems but it’s always small things that you can make up in day.  I spent my whole quarantine with her and face-timed her everyday, and played Minecraft with her, i spent time with her, and the only reason we weren’t officially dating sooner was because i wanted to do ask her in person.  And now that’s all gone, I can’t stop thinking about her, every song i listen to game i play people i try to talk to remind me of her in some way.  

I can’t stop looking at her instagram, vsco, snapchat, tik tok, so i had to delete the apps off my phone.  I honestly don’t know what to do to get over her.  For the record i’m not a drink and never have been even at parties, and i haven’t been sober in 5 days.  I haven’t been able to sleep or eat in 5 days.  I know this is gonna take time for me to get over her, I know there’s no hotfix for this.  Everytime i try to sleep i dream about her but it’s not a dream, it’s nightmare, where she is still with me.  I don’t get how adults to this stuff like 10 times in there life before they find the right one.  I don’t know how to get over her.  she broke up with me over text and i was super upset about how impersonal that felt and i wanted to call her and hear her one last time.  

She said she broke up with me because she lost feelings and i think i know her well enough to know that’s true, and she’s not lying.  I want her back so badly and everybody tells me i need to move on and forget about her and someone better will come my way, but i wanted that one.  She said she needs space and i understand that but i feel if i let go I can’t even be friends with her.  I feel like she hates me now.  I thought i found the one, and now she’s gone.

1051,"My and my family are super white. I'm 21 and privileged.

My father has always been really racist. He (almost every time) turns off the TV if he sees someone with different skin color. He makes stupid comments if he sees someone with different skin color. He brings up the topic out of nowhere. I believe he does so because he knows I will get annoyed. He laughs at me when I try to explain to him why he's wrong. He says ""You should defend your race. Only we - christian white people - are worthy of living in our country."" or ""We should do a purge. There's too many immigrants."". He believes only white people are smart and hardworking, everyone else is stupid and lazy. He often says that school brainwashed my into thinking we're all equal. My mom and brother often share the same beliefs. Today they were talking about George Floyd (Rest In Peace) on the news. What did my father say? He said ""Those fucking niggers.""

I just can't explain how deeply sad I feel about this. I feel sad for my father. I feel sad for all the people that are victims of racism. I feel sad that after all this time people judge others over something so irrelavent like skin color. 

So my question is : How would you react in this situation? Honestly, I recently just stopped talking when He starts this kind of conversations, because it always ends up in a big fight and tears. I think he actually does this on purpose to argue with me.

I understand what she's saying but at the same time, I really want to go to college and have a great freshman experience, be independent, and meet new friends. I also think that I need to learn how to manage my own affairs because I've been incredibly sheltered for my entire life.

I've tried to reason and argue with her, but she isn't budging. I can't take a gap year or I might lose my scholarship. What should I do?",09Jun2020,1
1061,"I’ve been trying to make improvements in my mental and physical health this year despite everything going on. My main objectives right now is finding an orthodontist so I can get braces so that way I’d be eligible for double jaw surgery as well as finding a therapist/counselor because my sessions with my current counselor are about to end. 

I’ve been looking for dental coverage to ease the amount I have to pay for the braces but it’s just been so overwhelming and I don’t want to schedule any appointments with orthodontist yet because I don’t want to have to keep paying orthodontist I don’t plan on working with. 

Looking for a therapist/counselor has been frustrating since my insurance doesn’t cover that. So finances have been really stressing me out. I really wanna get them done because I want to be able to smile better and I just need someone to talk to to keep my mental state in check.

My fiancée absolutely loves learning about murder mystery stories, always reading about serial killers, documentaries etc.

I want to somehow combine a ""mystery"" game into the date. I just have zero ideas on how. Whether it's finding clues in order to get the next meal, what would be the clues? Or is there another way to incorporate it?

Maybe hide clues around the area where we live and she has to get to each of them but make it murder theme related?

1074,"I work at a pharmacy at a major chain. Ever since the protests late last month, politics is all that comes up at work. Usually I try to stay out of it because I'm more liberal minded when it comes to social issues, while everyone else is conservative. Recently, the way others talk really expose their ignorance and sometimes downright racism. I feel strongly for the BLM movement and solidarity with whats going on but arguing and trying to open these peoples eyes is getting tiresome and depressing. I've already lost one work mate as a friend because of her upbringing and background, feels the protests are inconveniencing her because she lives in the city and the demonstrations are around where she lives and doesn't care that police brutality is a problem. But feels she isn't racist because the protesters just need to get jobs or a hobby and she constantly sends me videos of neo-conservatives rattling off stats about blacks and the like. Others who work with me are older so their racism is not as subtle, but I usually am able to just walk away when they go on a tirade.

My parents found out about a month into our relationship and just expected that I would break up with her and start dating guys. They pulled me out of school and put me in a homeschool program to get me away from her. They threw my phone and computer away and took my car too.

1094,"My father said something to me (22F) this morning that left me feeling very distraught. Not so much what he said, but multiple things he has said over a course of the past 2 years that just caused me to reach a breaking point. I want to stand up for myself and I want to do it right.

I apologise if this does not come across clearly. I didn't want to drone on and on.

This morning's conversation marked with #.

Some background information:

I grew up in a very conservative household in South Africa. Quiet, goody-two-shoes kid, parents' word was law, all that jazz. After I finished high school, I went to the US to work as an au pair for 2 years. During that time, a lot of my opinions changed as I learned more about the world around me and what I consider to be important to me. I also realised a certain level of emotional abuse I suffered at the hands of my parents which I thought was normal until I saw firsthand that it wasn't.

When I came back home to go to university, there was tension between me and my parents, because I have different and much stronger opinions now than I've ever had before and I try to voice them instead of just bottling it all up. Of course, my parents didn't take kindly to this. They do not respect my opinion on any subject and belittle me, telling me I'm too young and what do I know, etc. They make comments on my appearance then get mad when I'm upset about it. Honestly, it happened all throughout my teenage years but I thought it was the truth since I was wearing two sizes bigger than other girls my age. (But come on, I was a size 10! It still hurts to think that my low self-esteem was caused by this.)

(\*)As an example of a subject that we disagreed on (which will come into play later), last year I told them about a story I heard on the news about a female reporter being smacked on the ass by one of the runners at the marathon she was covering. My parents' opinion basically amounted to it not being that serious, the runner didn't mean anything by that, defending his action. I sat there shocked, telling them I was not expecting them to be defending him. They started getting really aggressive, telling me how I need to stop being so sensitive over such stupid things, that I'm an idiot for believing he had ill intent, etc. I didn't want to sit and listen to them attack me so I got up and left the room. They told me I was childish for leaving because they disagreed with me.

\# This morning, as my parents were getting ready to go to work, my father brought up a conversation about the BLM movement and the bail amount posted for the cop, and how he thought the whole thing was bullshit and that he doesn't believe it was murder. I was shocked at his statement and asked him why he believes that. My dad said that it wasn't the cop's intention to kill George Floyd, to which I replied, ""What did he think was going to happen when he put his knee there?""

My father proceeds to go off on me, telling me that he can never have a conversation with me because  I always storm out of the room (referencing to the story above\*) when people don't agree with me, that I get stupid ideas in my stupid little head that cause me to become a completely closeminded asshole.

I stayed and listened to his rant about why the cop had every right to put his knee on George's neck (which, I mean, really?), not engaging, trying to keep myself from talking back just so he wouldn't start telling me I'm an idiot all over again. He left the conversation smiling as if he got through to me.

When they left for work I started crying hysterically, which happens. I've cried a lot over my dad's comments about my weight, my looks, my clothes, my beliefs, my boyfriend, because he feels entitled to his opinion and never sees anything wrong with what he's saying. But this morning, I threw up because I was crying so hard. This has never happened before. It triggered something in me.

I am a very passionate person and I do enjoy hearing other's opinions on a subject so I can get a broader point of view. I don't pull my own opinions out of my ass - I want to make an informed decision, so I do my damn research; I talk to people. But the people I talk to don't talk back to me as if I'm a child who has no idea what they're talking about.

Some sort of conversation needs to be had about my father's behaviour so he hopefully understands how much his words affect me. I want to make sure I approach it the right way so I don't place myself on the backfoot. I want to stand up for myself. Any advice on how to properly initiate, and then subsequently handle the conversation will be so greatly appreciated.

1096,"Was gonna post in r/AITA but it was removed. So there was basically a bunch of BLM themed chalk drawings at the property I work at in one of the build’s parking lots. It was right after the George Floyd incident. There was a lot of different quotes and phrases. Some were more graphic than others. I had no problem with this, I understand people are upset and want to voice that frustration. So I just left it out....but I ended up getting a couple complaints from residents about it so I washed it away. Felt conflicted about it, on one hand I support this movement 100% and I want to let them be. On the other I’m not sure if I should treat this same way I normally treat graffiti e.i remove it no matter what. Now where I live, it’s a pretty progressive city, but there’s hardly and black people. There is however one black family that lives on the property, and it was their parking lot that had the drawings. After I washed it away I felt like an asshole because I know if I were in their shoes, I would definitely feel unwelcomed if someone erased all that. 

 Flash forward to today and I noticed right outside the front door of their building there was a single phrase written “you can’t silence black” and I just felt even worse. It’s still there, I don’t plan on erasing it but I’m sure someone will complain about it.

1097,"I don't know how to begin, so I'm just gonna cut to the chase; I hate when people get mad at me.

Whenever anyone, even strangers online, yell at me or insult me by calling me stupid, fat, a bitch, etc., I get so unreasonably upset. I might start shaking or crying. I usually manage to give a calm response, but I fume inside. 
And it's not like it's a quick fuse, the fire will burn all day a lot of the time. It won't stop bothering me until at least a day passes.

I know others' opinions should not matter to me, and I try to think this way and be more confident, but I constantly swing back to thinking they're right and hating myself, even when I know they're wrong.
I think such negative things, and imagine myself yelling back at them about how they're wrong or just feeling like I am stupid/whatever they called me.

This usually effects me for an entire day, maybe even more, and the feeling eventually fades, but it hurts so much when it happens. I know this isn't healthy, but I feel like I can't stop the emotions and I hate it.

This is also awful for me, because my job requires mentally strong people. I should be better than this, but I'm such a baby. 
Nothing seems to help. I can distract myself for a bit, try deep breathing, then my mind immediately gets flooded with the memories again. What's wrong with me?

How do I stop feeling so negative when this happens and move on? How do I become mentally strong so this petty stuff stops bothering me?

1100,"OK, so - I work for a global staffing agency in a small four-person field office. During the recent protests a co-worker of mine has been posting videos on Facebook that can be viewed as racist propaganda (for example, one titled ""Black Lives Matter is a Leftist Lie"") and some condemning the protests/riots, etc. Her views are her own and her that's not what this is about - but she lists our employer on her Facebook page and frequently shares job postings, etc. I was concerned that her political views would bleed over onto our employer and as a staffing agency we cannot be seen as racist. (Full disclosure, I am extremely political on my own page, but I do not list our employer anywhere.)

We have an HR team dedicated to giving advice on sticky situations so I reached out to them for help on how to approach her. They ran with it in a way I did not expect and turned it into an investigation. My co-worker absolutely knows it was me who spoke with HR (small office, aside from her and me it's our boss who never talks about politics and another recruiter who doesn't use social media) and has since deleted me from Facebook. While she's not being unprofessional she has been distant and ""off."" My boss is also acting strange and keeping me at arm's length so I'm pretty sure she's been looped in.

My concern is that they both think I made some sort of formal complaint when all I wanted was advice. I confronted the HR team and they gave me a boilerplate response about due diligence and my concerns being in good faith, but that doesn't take the tension out of the office.

My friend is going to have a cook out at her apartment next Friday with her family. I know they normally do this in the front yard instead of the back yard. They play music semi-loud but, outside of that they are pretty quiet. They just talk and play outdoor games. Pretty stander stuff.

However, with everything going on I want to ask her were they will be having the cook out. I've never said anything to her before about this and wouldn't now if it weren't for everything going on. I am worried that if she uses the front yard they could be harassed by police or, just people passing by. With everything going on tensions are high and bad people seem to be acting out even more than normal. I'm just worried about her safety and think the backyard will be better because it's fenced in and not facing the main road.

***So.....should I expressed my concerns to my friend and suggested she used the backyard instead of the front yard? Or, should I just not say anything at all?***",09Jun2020,1

So I have had a rough past semester (as I am sure many of us have). I was studying abroad in Madrid trying to learn Spanish; however, halfway through I got booted back to the States because of coronavirus. I ended up getting coronavirus as soon as I got back and was pretty sick for several weeks causing me to fall far behind on my online coursework. During this period my (at the time) untreated anxiety skyrocketed and I was unable to finish my work. I managed to mostly fix it and got a P in 3 classes, withdrew from 1, but failed one. At my university, this doesn’t affect my GPA so that’s not an issue, and I didn’t need the credits to graduate, but it is on my transcript. This was very out of character for me. I go to a very prestigious “hidden Ivy” school and have a 4.0 and have received several awards for both of my majors and will be completing honors projects in both of them in the fall. I also will be managing my college’s newspaper, acting as a research assistant, working as a writing tutor, and volunteering with a local arts organization downtown. Will this F ruin my chances of getting into grad school or getting some kind of award like a Fulbright for example? I am really stressed that I have ruined everything I have worked so hard for and feel pretty awful about it. Thanks so much in advance, I really appreciate you taking the time to help me out.",09Jun2020,1
1105,"as we are all are inside alot more because of the situation with the virus i have found myself over analyzing everything in my life to an unhealthy point, weather that be something i said years ago or how i responded to a question that my parents asked me. with this being said i keep going back to the thought of growing up. im 17 and i just got my first car, for most people this is an amazing moment and a step towards adult hood and a symbol of freedom. but for me it was quite the opposite, im slowly realizing that im growing up and there is nothing i can do about it. as stupid as this may sound i hate the thought of growing up. i don't necessarily want to be a little kid for life but im scared of adult hood. my questions is this. is it normal for someone my age to hate the thought of growing up, all of my friends seem to love it i have older friends who couldn't wait to move out and go to university but i hate the thought of it. so if anyone can relate to this or give me some advice on what to do with these feelings it would be greatly appreciated.",09Jun2020,1
1107," I was out in town with my sister when a visibly homeless woman (poss drug user judging by appearance- this will be important later) approached us asking for help. She claimed to be 4 months pregnant and there did appear to be a slight swell under her hoodie. She asked for £10 to gain access to a shelter. I replied that I had no cash (true) but she pointed to an ATM so I literally had no reason to say no, so I went to get out £10 and give it to her.

Now here's the issue: I'm a 21 yr old student and partly responsible for my family so giving her £10 is quite a sizable dent in my finances. I really empathised with her because at the end of the day, I have a warm home to go to and she was vulnerable on the streets. Also, my family has been through some *really* tough times (going to bed hungry kind of tough) so I wrote down my number and told her to give me a ring if she ever needed help. I did try to make it clear by saying ""I'll try my best to help if I can"". I was thinking along the lines of providing sanitary products, food etc.

Fast forward 24hrs, and she's messaging me asking me to call her ASAP as it is an emergency and she has nobody else to rely on. I have a feeling it will be for more money, and I really can't afford to continue handing out cash. Also, I can't help but think she may be using me to finance a habit; I've had people take advantage of me before because I tend to be quite empathetic and want to always see the best in people. What do you think? Did I make a mistake? What should I do now?

1108,"Okay, so the problem is that people start to bug me after 2 years of knowing them and being friends with them. I start to get a bit mean to them and I get very annoyed and start to pick out all of their faults. I never say the flaws out loud, of course, but maybe it does push them away. This has lead me to not have a very good idea of friendship, being awkward and standoffish at first. 
In university, I had a few friends with whom I thought I had a really good friendship with. But after 2 years of friendship, I did start to notice their flaws a lot. But I tried to be nice to them because they were still my friends. However, they soon started avoiding me and left me out of stuff, which I thought was my fault and which got me very depressed. Later, I found out that it was someone else who had made them turn against me. However, I still wonder if it was because of my getting annoyed with them. Maybe I wasn't so good at hiding it or something. What do I do to form meaningful relationships with people and not get annoyed by them or drive them away? 
I do have a boyfriend who is the sweetest and has been with me for the past 3 years. He does not annoy me at all, so I'm curious why this only happens with friends to me. Please help, I'm very confused and I don't know whom to ask for advice on this.",09Jun2020,3

I’m a 16 yr old male. For the last two weeks or so I’ve noticed that I can only get like 3/4 hard. It’s enough for me to masturbate and finish.

1112,"So basically, next year due to corona I will likely be taking a gap year. My options are either to stay where I live or to move to San Diego for a year (across the country)

pros of where I am:
-closer to home/family
-most of my friends are close by
-more comfortable with this area
-my boyfriend lives here and I could spend the next year with him
-could probably have my own apartment

pros of san diego
-one of my best friends will be close by
-new experience
-may have an apartment
-could possibly establish residency and save ~30k a year on tuition per year

cons of where I am: 
-not saving tuition money

cons of san diego
-hard to establish residency, would involve proving my parents wont be paying for college as well as being fully self sufficient
-away from almost everything i know
-would be my first experience living alone
-a lot of independence i have not had at all
- living there hella expensive

also its not guaranteed I would live alone in either situation i may live with my mom or with a relative if possible. will be my first time having a full time job, I also havent learned how to drive yet but plan to (i have a lot of driving related anxiety). i tend to be kind of an anxious person and i am also worried about having paranoia about living alone in a new place.

1113,"A close friend of mine's father past away a few years ago. Due to issues within the family she didn't know much about his past or get to see him often as he lived out of state. Regardless of the past father's day always hit her hard and I want to do something special for her.

I was able to dig up interesting facts and information about her Dad from other family members that she doesn't know about him and I'm trying to orchestrate something small but meaningful that would take her mind off of the negative.

He was into space, science, rockets so I've actually already built a rocket for her to shoot off and I was going to write some of the interesting facts about her dad on the parachute. He also registered a star through one of those star registry things and even thought it's not an official thing I found the coordinates to that star and was going to show her where it is with a telescope.

I don't feel like that's enough of an evening though... Like at most that would take probably an hour or two and I've got her for the entire evening. 

Does anyone know of something else I can do to like incorporate her dad into our activities? Ways I could possibly make the day about her and him with some kind of fun thing to do. I'm not working with a huge budget but I want to do something more.

One of my girlfriends best friends is abusing xanax, alcohol and probably some other stuff. There is a guy who is feeding it to her and they will get high for days at a time. 

The friend has alienated all of her friends and family, which has caused them all to give up on her.
My gf doesnt want to do that, but doesnt know how she can make her friend stop. She wont listen to anything my gf says and is pushing her away aswell.

1129,"Hi. So I’m a senior and two days ago, this person in my school 3 years younger than me (I kind of knew him a bit but not really) messaged me telling me he liked me. I was ok with it (I told him I didn’t feel the same way) but after that, he started messaging me a lot and not gonna lie I was kind of creeped out. 

Anyway, I decided that maybe just ignoring the texts would do but the person continued to just message me, this time, asking if I was busy or ignoring him. I decided to just reply later in the night that I wasn’t but I was kind of uncomfortable. He then went on about how he was sorry for disturbing me, saying that I probably have other more important stuff to do so he’ll just leave me alone... and then told me he was ready to die. 

Immediately, I panicked. I felt really bad and confused. I tried to seriously talk to him about harming himself and how he should get professional help and honestly, it was a back and forth conversation. While I was trying to talk to him out of it and to just seek professional help, he just kept on insisting and even told me how he would harm himself previously. Really I don’t even know what to do. Not gonna lie, a part of me felt like I was being manipulated and so as my two close friends (they think that he’s using self-pity to get me to talk to him) because he’s saying all of this and telling me I’ve got other way better and important stuff to do when I’m trying to help but also telling him to seek professional help (which he would resist) because I’m just a teen who knows less and really I’m not much of a help. I’ve got a lot on my plate right now too. 

I ended up just sending him a lengthy “final” paragraph that there’s only so much I could do (listen to what he says) but also for him to just keep on fighting. He has anger issues, depression and Low-self esteem. That’s what I know. But really, I don’t think I can help him out any further. I feel like I’m obliged to help because he apparently doesn’t have friends but I don’t think I can handle this, especially right now. I’m a person who thinks a lot and this situation is all I’ve been thinking about since it happened and I feel constantly scared because of it. 

Later, he replied that I gave him the best help he’s gotten and then just asked if it was kind of weird that I was older than him and he liked me. He also asked when I would get over being uncomfortable. I replied that maybe one day he’ll get over the feelings he had for me and also that I don’t think I can not being uncomfortable...

1132,"Since I was 10 I competed in swimming and I am  usually below average. 

My Freshman year which was my best year, I was improving drastically. I dropped up 15-30 seconds in all 200s. 

However, my sophomore year things took a turn for the worse. I did terrible at my first few swim meets even though I worked my ass off. Ever since then I got really discouraged. I started getting really lazy and slacking off I haven’t dropped time once. (Gained more than 20 seconds in my 200’s)

Im well below average and now all my friends surpassed me and Im left in the dust.

I know I wasted a lot of time during these 3 months when I should have been training, but if it is still possible for me to go pro I will do everything In my power to do so.

1133,"I have a friend at work who started a year ago, and we get along really well. We talked often before the shutdown, and he'd come visit me in my office from time to time. He doesn't have a permanent office, so I can't really reciprocate since I don't usually know where he is, but whenever we run into each other, we always stop and talk. He'll always seek me out when we have group meetings, and there has been some flirting between us (initiated by him) although sadly nothing has come of it. He kind of seems sometimes like he's sort of intimidated by me or worried he's bothering me when I'm busy, though I'm never bothered by his visits.  We hang out sometimes, but it's always been with a group. He had actually turned down a bunch of my invites in a row for a while, so I stopped inviting him, and he asked me why. I told him I didn't think he wanted to hang out with us anymore, but started inviting him again, and he's come to hang out a bunch of times since then. All of this was prior to the shutdown. He's also not much of a texter. He will often stop texting pretty quickly, or even mid-conversation, even when he's the one to text me first. I've noticed though, even when he doesn't respond to a text, he'll sometimes bring up something funny from the conversation the next time we are together in person, as if it was no big deal that he stopped answering. I, on the other hand, have anxiety and am constantly thinking he's mad at me when he stops texting me or that I said something stupid or that he wants nothing to do with me.

Anyway, we haven't talked much since the shutdown. We chatted a little bit in the beginning, and last week I sent him a lighthearted text, to which he responded and then asked me how I was doing. I told him and then asked how he was doing. He never answered. As I mentioned, this isn't out of character for him, but there are some things he's mentioned to me in the past that made me think he deals with depression. I feel like an idiot because I hadn't really put 2 and 2 together this whole time, and now I feel like a crappy friend for not reaching out to him more. Still, I could be wrong, and maybe he just doesn't want to talk to me. I want to reach out again and make sure he's doing alright, but I'm worried about what to do if he doesn't respond again. I also don't want to assume he either has or doesn't have depression.

So I guess my questions are these:
-How do I go about checking in on him or letting him know I'm here if he needs me without bothering him?

-How do I know if his lack of responses are because he doesn't want to talk to me or if he's just not up to talking at that time?

-How do I know when to try again vs give him some space? I feel like I usually air on the side of giving too much space so as to not bother anyone, but I want to make sure he knows I'm here and I care, whether he has depression or not.

tl;dr I think my friend has depression, but I'm not sure. He'll often stop answering texts randomly, which to me, as someone who has anxiety, often makes me think he wants nothing to do with me. I want to know how he's doing, but I'm afraid I won't know what to do if it's hard to get a response out of him.",09Jun2020,1

1143,"Hello everyone, this is my first post ever!

Recently, I have been doing a lot of self reflection given the current civil unrest we are experiencing. Like many ignorant others, systemic racism and oppression were not issues that I thought affected me. I have been very blessed to live a privileged and sheltered life. When I was a teenager (I am now in my 30s), I am guilty of making blatant racist remarks and comments. Even though it's done in a comedic and jovial nature, it does not excuse my abhorrent behavior. Knowing that I have made racist comments, remarks, and posts made me sick to my stomach. My heart felt heavy with guilt. I haven't slept. I couldn't believe I have fed into this issue, I feel so ashamed. I have never felt so much guilt before (and i've done some rotten things). Worst, I did it without ever considering who I would be hurting. I want to be better and I want to do better. I want to understand how systemic racism has affected you, the challenges you face, and what overtly racist remarks or micro-aggressions you face that others may be incognizant about. I have reached out to my friends who are black, I want their perception on what is happening, and how I can do my part to help. They have been welcoming, accepting, and enlightening. I know this guilt will always be with me, but I hope that by being educated, informed, and aware to the struggles of other minorities I can do my part to help. I want to be someone my children will be proud of. I want this world to be better for all of our children. I have many law enforcement officers in my family, including my spouse. We have had long conversations the last few weeks. I hope that by understanding the struggles others go through I can help bridge the disparity between our black citizens and minorities and our officers. I don't think I can change the world, but I would love the opportunity to do my part in bettering myself and those around me. I have never thought anyone to be less than I am as a person, but this doesn't make me innocent. My ignorance, laissez faire, and blasé attitude has fed into systemic racism and oppression. I am ashamed it took me this long to realize it and I am ashamed it took this much for me to realize it. I don't know who I have hurt, who I have offended, or who I have oppressed through my actions. For that, I am ashamed and I am sorry. I would greatly appreciate any advice, no matter how harsh.",09Jun2020,0
1144,"Growing up, I was always an overweight kid. I grew up with my entire family always dieting and losing weight, but I was comfortable with my size until high school.

I’ve always wanted to lose weight since I realized that I was heavier, but never knew how. This year I lost almost 50 pounds from the end of August to now.

I’ve been restricting calories to 1,200 for many, many months. Over quarantine I started working out and still tried eating just 1,200 calories a day without eating any calories back. Then I started working out even more (light cardio and strength training for around 20-40 min in morning and walking 5 miles later on, and maybe more depending on the day)

Today was another day full of guilt because it was my off day for working out and I haven’t lost any weight (I gained some and then lost it so it doesn’t really count) and I feel so, so guilty for enjoying food.

I used to eat so much as a kid and I hate the thought of being like that again. I had an entire medium size bag of chips, sandwich, juice, and some other snacks split with my boyfriend and I feel so ashamed. My mom is making dinner and I just wish I didn’t eat anything today.

I don’t know what to do. I feel guilty for eating anything that isn’t healthy or low calorie but I hate this lifestyle. I feel so guilty for eating and enjoying it. I’m so close to my weight goal but I know I’ll just keep decreasing it after that.

I feel like I should go run to burn my calories from today but I’m so exhausted due to not a lot of sleep.

I can normally hear people fine, but in loud settings (like restaurants), I have a hard time understanding people, so I rely on reading lips in these settings.

I've just started working at a large factory, which can be quite loud. It's difficult to hear people in general, but now due to COVID-19, everybody is wearing masks and I cannot read their lips. I am repeatedly asking people to repeat themselves, which is bothersome and makes me feel bad. I am by no means deaf, as I can hear people just fine in normal conversations without background noise.

Only to know that they regretted making that purchase 10-30 years later. So it really is leaving me in a dilemma. I really like gaming and I can afford the system too but I just don’t want to regret purchasing it later on... in December I bought an iPhone XS Max for $765 CAD, so if I buy the PS5 it’ll be my second biggest purchase.

1150,"I'm currently struggling with a friendship that I'm not interested in sustaining. The person in question isn't a bad person or anything like that, but rather that I just don't feel a connection. Anytime they ask me to hang out it always feels like a chore rather than a gift. They came to my house to watch TV, which should be relaxing, but all I could wait for was for them to leave. This would be an easy thing usually, but this person doesn't have any other friends. The former friends don't talk to them anymore because (in the friends words) they were needy. They already have it rough as it is, but I don't want to be the straw the breaks the camels back by leaving them. Being their friend feels like a responsibility, if I leave I worry that they would kill themselves. Prior behavior tells me that it's possible.

I feel horrible to think of them like this, but it's not fair to either of us to continue the relationship. I can't do it because I have my own bullshit weighing on me and they would be putting work into the relationship while I just lose interest and resent the relationship. It's gotten to the point where any text I get from them (and it's not even that many) gives me an emotional ""ugh"" feeling. 

In my opinion, telling them directly or ghosting them isn't an option. I can't do that confidently without the worry that they'll hurt themselves. What's the best and safest way to go about this?",09Jun2020,2
1151,"**Disclaimer:** This is arguably the most petty thing I've ever gotten this angry/upset over. (Forgot to add: F18)

Recently, it was national best friends' day. My ""friend"" made a post for about 7-8 people not including me. And this stung. I don't have many close friends and I don't go out of my way for many people or call many people but they were one of them.

We've known each other since elementary school and we were close friends back then. We weren't as close in middle school but I could still come to them when I needed something and it was mutual. They left for a while due to personal issues and then returned last year but only started talking to me and hanging out with me this year. I've been there for them through breakups, relationship issues, personal issues, family issues, friendship issues, etc. We hang out together and I almost always pick up their calls, texts, and respond to their stories or comment under their posts and I try to in general be supportive. They have opened up to me about some pretty personal issues and I have opened up to them about some of mine.

When they made this post, I was pretty damn mad and hurt especially because some of the people in it were A) their booty calls B) people they had just met and C) people who they constantly ranted and complained about to me. Do I have the right to feel this angry and upset over this?

I feel so petty for being angry but at the same time, I put so much effort and time into our friendship because I genuinely cared about them and thought it was mutual. But now, I want to push them away. I even considered just all together blocking or unfriending them but I think that's a bit extreme. I'm leaving for college across the country this year so I won't be seeing them ever again unless I make an effort to. I am seriously considering not seeing them anymore and letting our friendship die down.

What makes this even more of a shock to me is that I thought we were on good terms. I don't think they're angry with me. They messaged me the day before they posted it and we talked some about their new relationship. Am I overreacting or is it normal to feel this way when something like this happens?",09Jun2020,3
1152,"Hi! I’m going to a few different subreddits bc I’m not sure which would benefit this question best, but if you don’t want it in here you can totally take it down! 

Basically, my issue is that I feel embarrassed to do anything. I’m living with my boyfriend and whenever he does something, I decide I should do an activity solely bc I feel obligated to do something. I feel uncomfortable starting the activity though. I just feel so odd and I don’t want to, but not doing it also makes me feel embarrassed bc then I feel like a waste of space/a loser. It’s a weird situation that’s hard to explain and not many people I’ve explained it to fully understand what I mean. Trying is just as embarrassing as not trying and I don’t understand why. 

And even if he’s just scrolling on his phone, doing nothing productive, I feel embarrassed getting up and doing something. I have some hobbies, like bullet journaling, painting, baking, unsolved mysteries, and a couple shows that I watch, but I don’t want to do any. I am depressed and have anxiety which I think is something to keep in mind. I’ve always felt disinterested in doing things and often only do things so I can say I do things, but the embarrassment is relatively new. Has anyone experienced this before? Any advice?

We set up a viewing time for this Thursday afternoon.

Ten minutes ago I got a call from him saying that “someone else has come along that met our criteria and we’ve rented the place to them.”

1155,"I (M23) was diagnosed with ADHD at the ripe age of 13 and was prescribed Concerta to aid my focus. For most of my school career the medication worked and helped me sit down and concentrate for long periods of time (which was impossible for me before). After school I went to college and still had the willpower and dedication to get all my work done and to the best of my ability and scored an average of 75% for most of my subjects. But for the past year I haven't been able to get through any work.

I start my day by waking up, eating something, then taking my pills (Concerta &amp; Magnesium) and then showering and brushing my teeth so that the meds kick in when I'm all done. I'll open up my laptop create a word document and have every intention of doing my assignments and writing notes but instead I'll get distracted by anything and everything. (most people think ADHD medication is a wonder drug that makes you focus). Which is partially true, but when you get caught up focusing on something that isn't work, like a distraction, well... You can spend anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours doing that thing without realising it. I usually take a Ritalin later on when the Concerta reaches its half-life to boost my concentration for longer. 

Anyway, everyday I fuck around and beat myself up about not accomplishing anything during the day but then land up repeating the same thing the next day. Everytime I look at my work I just want to do something more pleasurable instead, like watch Netflix or browse social media or reddit. It really bugs me because I want to better myself but I need to start with changing my mindset, which is easier said than done. I have 2 months to hand all my work in and I'm stressing but for some reason I'm not doing anything about it.

It's almost like I have two personalities which are conflicting one another, like one half of me want to be productive and do what's right and sit down and just work and the other side has negative intentions and just wants to screw around and waste time doing mindless, unproductive things. It's hard for me to stick to a schedule aswell (although I've never really given it my all or set up a detailed schedule).

Does anyone suffer from anything similar or have some advice on what they did to combat this. My ears are all open because today was the last straw and things need to change for the better. 

I understand that this is mostly mental and I have to hard wire my brain, but I have absolutely no idea how to enforce that discipline and change on myself, to override that stupid voice in my head that wants to waste time with no regrets and replace it with something more motivating and positive!

1158,"Hey all,

I’m a Uni student and my student accommodation came with this little fridge with a shitty freezer compartment. The freezer compartment just freezer burns whatever is touching the bottom of it and freezes a thin object (like a pizza) a few centimetres away from the bottom.

I like to shop once a week and buy enough food for the entire week until the next shopping day. So food has to last a while with minimal cooking.

Freezable food Is perfect for this, but the tiny little freezer compartment means I can only store two oven pizzas or a packet of 8 chicken breasts, which is enough for dinner time for a week, but means I can’t store anything for lunch. Everything I think of to buy for lunch for the next week all perishes in like 3-4 days at the max.

I need some advice on what foods I can buy, that are either easy to cook or do not need cooking, that can last at least a week.

EDIT: My cooking tools are:

A microwave with a grill function, an electric stove, and a toaster.",09Jun2020,1
1159,"I'm new to this but I'll try explaining everything I can. 

I'm from down under and home to two loving parents and live in a apartment complex. However, last year, while waiting for a brother of mine to come home from school, my father hears on the intercom ""we have your son"" followed by laugh. This got us worried but my brother arrived home sometime after. We were still kinda shocked and got police involved having them look into it but I didn't hear the result and nothing really turned up. My father ended up looking for things and concluded that muslims are the cause for a lot of discord. 

He has been listening to podcasts and American news all about anti muslim and Islamic stuff. I do agree that in the their home, it is quite barbaric and am repulsed by the like but it's completely different in my experience with some of my friends who I've worked and played games with here where I live. He doesn't trust people who are friends with them and longer trusts anyone in the community since a good chunk of it seems to be muslims. 
He keep finding news that he brings to us saying it's a believable conspiracy. He says things like immigration is a problem, they accept muslims and deny christians, the government is corrupt, muslims are taking over the world, Obama is worse than Hitler, Trump is doing good things, anyone who disagrees with those values are leftists or whatever (I don't know which is which), and bill gates is trying to track everyone with a vaccine. 

I've been trying to be a pacifist and try to see both sides of a story, leading me into giving my honest thoughts, agreeing to some and disagreeing to some. But today he showed me some news and said every muslim is evil, corrupt and should be put down. I argued that it's unfair to place that on minors too but he said they are included, no exceptions. I returned to my computer to continue my day but he calls out saying people who think like me are traitors and later on saying he doesn't think I'm safe using the internet. All my thoughts and experience come from real life and none from the internet. I don't look into that stuff and prefer playing games but I feel it's only going to escalate more as time goes on. He says he's done research so I can't really fight back with words and I really love him from all those previous years and he is still quite caring, just not to a certain group.

What should I do? How do I convince him? 
Can he return to normal?",09Jun2020,0

1165,"I have an uncle who I’m very upset with. I just don’t know what to do with my feelings. All I know is I need to talk to him to assess his mental state for myself.

Thing is, my Uncle has been good to me throughout my life. It wasn’t until a couple of years ago I realized that he is mental or something. I think my Grandma might be too, but that’s another story.

The stupid virus crisis is here and the info I’m about to tell you is second hand stories.  

My mom and dad learned that despite the crisis my uncle had went out and snuck in to see my Grandma to help her with her medicine. My Grandma lives by herself, however she lives in a senior living.

This really upset me and I’ve been meaning to talk to my Uncle about it. I want to understand what was worth the risk for all the lives there? It doesn’t help that with his health problems that if he andor Grandma caught it, they would mostly likely die. This knowledge has hurt me and thus since I have been mad.

Mom has informed me I might hurt my uncle feelings and wants to practice with me before I have my talk with him.

Dad tells me that my Uncle is most likely mental and also tries to tell along of the lines that there is no point in me talking to my Uncle.

Mom invited him over recently and I didn’t say Hi, because I was mad and NO ONE wants me to talk to my Uncle. There’s **always an excuse** for why I shouldn’t have a one on one talk to make my own decision about his mental state and if my uncle cares.

I have this sort of angry knot in me. I know my Uncle in the past has been good to me, **but does that excuse** what he did by putting lives in danger? It wasn't even just once he went out. Am I wrong for wanting my own assessment?",09Jun2020,1
1166,"Lived in residence first year and didn't make any friends mainly cause of bad luck and i had trouble adjusting. Going into second year and have no idea how to make friends this year. I'm pretty depressed I've tried counseling found it didn't really help me. I've tried 2 therapists both felt like they didn't really care that much. Tried going to the gym and getting excersize and having a positive attitude but it didn't work. Tried joining clubs but then covid happened after 2 meetings. They likely won't be active in September either so I have no idea what to do.

 Online classes make it even worse. And I have no idea what to do for housing either. I don't have horrible social skills either, if you talked to me you would likely not guess that I'm in this situation, although I am worried that my social skills have worsened cause I've been somewhat withdrawn from society and have been missing out on important milestones during these formative years. Also had this problem for the last 2 years of highschool, it's been almost 4 years since I've had any friends. Feeling like I'm missing out on important milestones and this will affect me for life. Never been to a party or dated.

I Was doing ok before covid cause I had a gym routine but due to covid I'm now very depressed and have a shitty attitude. I'm either angry or depressed, and have a very short temper even when I do feel normal. People just tell me this is normal but that doesn't help and probably isn't even true. 4 years is a long time.

I'm a 15 year old female, and Long story short I've been a very extroverted artist for a while now, I've also been getting my health back on track and been able to wake up and go to bed on a normal schedule
Though for about a month and a half everything's been hard to do without mass waves of sadness or being too tired to get up

It takes me so much energy to speak to my friends, and even small responses take so much mental power, I've been sleeping 70% of my day but I'm still so tired anytime I'm awake, even if it's been for hours, nothing has been giving me a sense of dopamine for ages, I have a bird and a dog I train and take care of, though it's been getting hard to get up and play with them or do anything that's more then the essentials I know they need
Along with drawing, it's been impossible to finish anything, I get one piece done and I'm immidietly wanting to go to sleep, it takes so much energy to focus and finish anything. Usually, drawing is my cope and what I do to just let myself disconnect from reality, though lately even trying to focus sends me spiralling into so many thoughts I can't hear anything otherwise
When I'm awake nothing feels like it should be done, like I get a sense of guilt picking up my phone or getting food or trying to exercise, and it doubles when I can't respond to my friends. I have a daily quota for art I try and finish, though it takes more energy every day to get the smallest of things done, and I worry so much I'm losing my passion for it, 

At first I thought it was burnout. Though it's lasted more then a few weeks, and is really getting to the line of testing my health. I've tried taking breaks from my usual life, went a day and a half without drawing at all, took care of my pets in the morning instead of the afternoon redid my whole room and the organization of my plants, got some new plants even, though nothings helped.

1171,"Hi. As the title states, I am an emotionally and sexually confused female and I don’t know what I’m doing. I’ve got a weird, potentially not great, scenario playing in my head with no real end. So I’m here because I need to bounce this problem off of a few other brains or else I’m going to sail out to the middle of the ocean and sit there and stew on it until I die, which ultimately solves my problem. 

Here it is:
I’ve made two really good guy friends since I’ve moved and I love them both. They’re such cool dudes and make me laugh constantly. We’re all close to the same age (mid-late 20’s) and met each other around the same time, so we haven’t been friends for very long. We’re going to call them A and B. Since quarantine happened I’ve gotten a lot closer with both of them. How close? Well, close enough that I ended up having sex with A. Now, I will say that I’d been kind of flirting him since before we got close and we barely knew each other. I’m terrible at flirting, so I wasn’t sure that I was actually accomplishing anything, but apparently I did and now we have casual sex. We’re both on the same page that we’re just fuck buddies, which is fine. I have no problem with that at all. I know that when we stop it won’t affect the friendship that we already have. That’s not necessarily my problem. My problem is that B really likes me. Like, really really likes me. And I had no idea until I started having sex with A and he walked in and caught us. We’ve all talked about it separately with each other, just not the three of us together. 

When this all started I straight up told B that I couldn’t do anything with him because that’s a friendship that I’m not willing to fuck up. And that’s true. His friendship is by far one of my favorite things. Recently, I think he’s been getting more jealous even though he knows it’s just sex between A and I. I’m horny, he’s horny, it’s still kind of quarantine, and we’re both problem solvers, so the sex continues. He makes me feel bad about something that I feel like I shouldn’t feel bad about. I still love him, but fuck that just feels unfair. BUT I also still feel like a really bad person because recently I’ve been so physically and a little emotionally attracted to B. Like, holy shit, what is happening? 

I wasn’t having sex before A because I have some pretty bad trust issues with people because I’ve only ever been seen as an object and not a person. I don’t feel like an object with A because he still treats me like a friend and a human when we just hang out. B is the same, but he legit has feelings for me and I also might too, but if I’m wrong about my feelings I do not want to jeopardize our friendship. I do not want to do it, but oh my god I want to have sex with him so badly. So badly. Not just because of the sexual attraction, but the emotional attraction. Not only do I not want to mess up our friendship, it feels weird because I’m fuck buddies with our other friend, A, and I have literally told him that I would have sex with B, but he knows why I can’t do it. 

Here’s where I need advice. Do I tell A and B that I have these feelings? I know A would be fine, we’ve literally talked about it, but should I tell B? Should I ignore it? Am I a bad person? Holy shit, I am not this endearing. I’m weird and awkward as all hell. I don’t even know how to flirt. My arms flail, and I dance and sweat when I’m nervous, and I’m anxious literally all of the time. Who do I think I am? This was never a problem before I got super horny. My god, how do people do this kind of mental gymnastics? Advice? Anyone? Please?",09Jun2020,2
1172,"TL;DR at the bottom  


Okay, so I'm 31 (M) and for most of my life I've experienced some significant level of insecurity. Although I don't remember exactly where/when it originated, I can tell you that I was diagnosed with anxiety at a very young age (6, after I experienced a sudden onset of it) and by age 7-8 I had already gotten into the habit of comparing myself to others around me, always feeling inadequate whenever they could do something I couldn't, they had something I didn't, or if they received positive/affectionate attention of any kind that I didn't (even if that attention was due to that person experiencing something bad).  


Fast forward to my teenage years, I slowly began to develop a constant need for reassurance. This was present in seed form before I was a teenager, but over those years as well as my 20's, I began to question and doubt just about everything, whether it be health, people liking me or at least approving of me, my success and proficiency with my hobbies, etc. What I would do is try to prove to myself that things were okay in whatever area I was concerned about. I never tried to address the root of the problem: my insecurity. This way of thinking slowly began to permeate every area of my life until pretty much everything I did involved the thought of ""I need to prove \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to myself"" as part (or sometimes even ALL) of my motivation for doing whatever that was. Even when I would succeed, the boost of confidence was only temporary. I would always question my success (or the positive state of things) and put pressure on myself to re-prove it to myself over and over again. It became like a drug: I always craved it but no matter how much I got of it, I was never permanently satisfied.  


In the present, much of my life revolves around a constant need to prove to myself that I'm capable, talented, that people like me, etc. Moreover, I can't help but feel that all of these things (especially when it comes to people feeling positively about me) are on super shaky ground. Every time a small mistake happens or somebody acts in a way that's even SLIGHTLY suspicious to me (it can even consist of something as mundane as that person not waving hello to me, taking a longer path to get somewhere rather than walking by me, or talking to me in a tone that seems less than enthusiastic), I fear the worst. My mind just jumps there at this point. It's not even just a habit anymore. It's basically a hobby that I'm obsessed with, and I can't turn it off. I am completely and utterly dependent on it.  


This problem is only compounded by my masterful levels of ability to compare myself to other people. Not only do I analyze their every mannerism, word, tone, inflection, etc. when I'm interacting with them, but if they act towards me in a way that is less than what I view as ideal on any of those levels (I expect them, among other things, to come across as being interested in what I'm saying, happy to see me, etc.), it won't stop at me feeling disappointed. I feel the need to watch them interact with somebody else immediately afterwards, and I analyze that interaction on all the same levels that I did when they interacted with me. If their interaction with that other person is significantly more positive, enthusiastic, etc. on any of those levels (let alone several or all), I take it as them not liking me or me being boring, inadequate, too awkward, etc.  


Even though I know that I need to change my thinking patterns and I even know HOW to do so in theory (slowly replacing negative thoughts and thought patterns with positive, healthy ones), it's well beyond the point where it's anywhere near that simple. I've begun, at certain points, to exit the mindset I'm currently in. However, when that begins to happen, I feel empty inside. I know that sounds weird, but it's how I feel. It's almost like those stories you hear about people getting out of prison after 10+ years there and they don't know what to do with themselves for a while afterward even though they are in a better place in life than they have been in a long time. It's as if I've become institutionalized in my own negative mindset.  


I get that, at the root of it all, I've been an overly self-focused person for all these years (and at an increasing level) and that this selfish mindset has driven me to focus on even my smallest shortcomings (whether absolute or compared to somebody else), but at this point it's so deeply ingrained in my mind that I almost can't imagine life without it. Plus, as I've hinted at elsewhere in this writing, my self-esteem and self-confidence is VERY dependent on extrinsic factors and how successful I am at the moment. These are very serious, debilitating issues that I want to get rid of as soon as possible.

Here's the thing, though...I know HOW to go about changing my thought patterns. What I DON'T know how to do is keep it up without going through what feel like withdrawals and having to revert to the way of thinking I've become accustomed to for all too long just to avoid losing my mind or feeling that empty feeling all the time.   


How do I cope with this empty feeling I get on this journey to changing my patterns of thought? How long does it last (approximately...I know everyone's a bit different)? I want to get back to doing things and being with people for all the right reasons rather than having these unhealthy mixed motives. I want to do things because I WANT to, not because I feel inadequate and feel the need to constantly prove that I'm good enough over and over again. I know there will always be moments of insecurity, but there was a time in my life when, insecure as I was, I did things because I wanted to do them. It's almost beyond description how deeply I long to get back into that mindset and just be satisfied with having fun and doing what I need to do in life without constantly doubting and needing to reassure myself.  


How do I navigate this path without becoming discouraged by that ""empty"" feeling to the point where I feel like just giving up?  


Sorry about the long read, but I'm getting kinda desperate here. Any constructive advice is greatly appreciated!  


TL;DR - I'm addicted to feeling insecure and constantly feeling the need to reassure myself of things that even when I began to get out of it, I feel uncomfortable because I've become so used to thinking the way that I do.",09Jun2020,1
1173,"**Preface**: I met a guy in the beginning of March, (I live in France, and we were confined to our places and could not see each other, we did text here and there) However, when our confinement was over, he immediately wanted to get together and I have been hanging out with him every weekend for the past 6 weeks. He mentioned that he had not ""felt this way in a long time"" with me when we went out of town together. I uninvited him to my birthday party on Saturday last minute, because I wanted it to be girls only and had just poorly planned it. Sunday, the day after my birthday, we had met up and it was just a very weird disconnect between us. 

**This Saturday**: It had been 5 days since we had texted each other, and because HE was the one who had proposed to hangout every single time before, I decided to reach out and propose we check out this place I wanted to go to. He had responded in a minute of me within sending the text, which I think would be a good sign? My friend Alice had hit me up last minute and asked if she could come and I said yes. All 3 of us met up, and it was okay in the beginning however, later I realized the guy I had been hanging out with was ALL over her and wanted NOTHING to do with me, and actually actively kept excluding me from conversations, sitting far from me, talking to me condescendingly, etc. Anyway, he asked for her number which I totally knew was going to happen. 

The next day, my friend Alice and I had plans, and she kept talking about it all day, so we did. She had confided that it was really disrespectful, and condescending about how he treated me and the way things happened. Surely, he texted me to invite US to hang with his friends and I left him on read. He then texted me again after I had ignored him with ""Cool, courtesy normally has rules."" I then responded with how it wasn't courteous how he treated me the day before, and I would rather spend my time with people who don't disrespect me. He replies with ""Sorry for the perception I gave yesterday."" I left him on read again, and he responded with ""I will keep it simple - I just like you as a friend, make what you want clear."" and to me, this seemed like it wasn't an apology at all, and it also came off as condescending. 

**WHERE I NEED ADVICE**: So my friend Alice keeps bringing up Saturday,  and how he has texted her. She won't block his number, or consider it. She keeps asking me ""What do I do?"" When I told her what to do a couple times. I am not angry because of the feelings I had for this guy, but I am angry because of the way it happened. How he disrespected me in front of her, she flirted back with him, they exchanged numbers, she won't screenshot the chat between them, and how even days later she is still stuck on how she handle it (to go see him or not). I have told her my boundaries that, if she went to see him, it would be like he can disrespect me and get away with it, and also get to be with my friend too resulting that I am not a respected person. I told her my boundaries that I don't want her to see him because I want him to be out of my life completely. It is so strange to me because she knows every single detail between him and I since I had confided her in it. I think it is also strange that she is so keen to text him back, and consider getting a drink with him when: A) she was a part of the interference and disrespect and B) the dust hasn't event settled. I am not mad about losing him AT ALL, but I am angry about the disrespect and how it turned out.

Am I being dramatic? What should I do? I want to be cool, and I usually am, but I am setting up boundaries and making them clear to her and she is still stuck on what to do in this situation. It's weird that she wants to go after someone that I had slept with, been out of town with, etc. 

What do I do?! Am I crazy and in the wrong? Any thoughts??? I know the friendship/dating between the guy and I weren't serious, HOWEVER, it still doesn't seem right. I feel weird because if they do get together, they would definitely talk about me and that's just......",09Jun2020,1

Long story short, I have to have FaceTime calls (court ordered with my mom who is in rehab right now, so it is really hard. I don't want to see her at all yet, so it is super stressful for me. anyway, I found out that something we did doesn't look good in the eyes of the court, and i just lost it when I realized i would probably be forced to see my mom. I was crying, then hyperventilating, then it felt like I couldn't breathe. It was really , really scary. It was like I felt like I I felt like I was going to puke from heaving so much.

What does a panic attack feel like? How do I know if I had one or not?

1175,"[I’m 16] So my dad and step mother are allowing family from Arizona to fly in to see us. I know this is a bad idea; not only traveling by plane,  but not socially distancing or making an effort to. On top of that, they planned a vacation in July with our entire family (again not socially distancing). My parents are separated and I switch houses every week, I’m worried if I contract the virus I will transmit it to my mom and my elderly grandfather. I know I’ll probably be okay if I get it but people I care about could very well not be. My father and step mother seem unfazed by this even though my step mother is on medication that makes her immunocompromised. I’ve expressed that I’m uncomfortable with this situation but they don’t seem to account for that. I’m not sure how to proceed.",09Jun2020,4
1177,"Not sure if this is the right subreddit for this, I filed taxes electronically (as I have for a few year now) via TurboTax last year and received a confirmation number and everything, only found out a few months ago that this was never actually filed, neither Turbotax nor the IRS were able to locate my refund (Even with said confirmation number) and my only option was to just file my return again (as I was receiving a refund and did not owe money).

So I have to file that by mail now and I did this to the correct addresses for both my state and Federal tax returns and I still have not received anything, no direct deposits or checks in the mail, not even a letter from the IRS. They say online it can take up to 6 weeks to process these claims, it has been 12.

I can't file my 2020 taxes until the 2019 ones are processed, so I need to now file for an extension on the already extended tax due date.

What should I do? Do I have to just mail the forms AGAIN and hope that this time they take care of it? 

The other option I have is in my state (MA) I believe I can still e-file previous years taxes via 1040now if I made under a certain amount (Which I did). Should I just go through that process using all the tax return fields I have to e-file those again?

I also need to make an amendment to said 2019 taxes as the return amount is supposed to be greater but my dependency status was incorrect on the one I mailed.

This is a whole clusterfuck so if a lot more info is needed let me know, and if this is the wrong sub please direct me to the right one, thanks again in advance.",09Jun2020,2
1178,"So I’ve been with girls for a couple of months and we had out first conflict last night. I’m a 19 m and she’s a 20 f. The conflict started when she said something and then I responded by saying “this how you laugh” and proceeded to mock her  laugh. To note I love her laugh it’s so genuine and it makes me happy to see and hear it. She responded “fine I won’t laugh in front of you again” and I said “Come on, really?” And followed up with “Fine I’ll shave my beard since it’s skinny.” Also note my beard doesn’t really grow well or thick so “skinny” is how she describes it when she makes fun of it. Her making fun of it also doesn’t not bother me and she dislikes when I talk about shaving it. After I told her I’ll just shave my beard she says “fine” and I give it a few seconds and I call her a “hoe”. She decided to hang up on me after that and didn’t accept my FaceTime calls afterward and I apologized and told I understood if she doesn’t want to talk to me right now or ever again. I try to be as understanding as I can. She definitely more pc than I am and I can see she takes offense but as someone who is not I also understand I need to approach her different, but I don’t want to change who I am. Should I still continue with this relationship and possibly change a few things about me or should I stop the relationship? I do understand too that when two people come together they keep and let go of a few beliefs and morals that can be applicable to the relationship, but does that require the person to change who he/she is overall as well?

Off topic but this does lead back into what I’m talking about. I definitely haven’t had the hardest life but I have had a few ups and downs in my life. In order for me to cope with these down areas I say some pretty edgy jokes and the range of these jokes go to anywhere. From a women joke to a dick joke, to a race joke about race (not any specific one) , abortions etc. Think of me as a white Dave Chapelle just not nearly as good. I also use these jokes to connect with people ironically enough. I like to have connections with anyone and according to the people I talk to I’m really friendly and for how old I am I have a pretty big sense of self awareness.",09Jun2020,1

Hello everyone. I haven’t updated in in a few days because I’ve just been dealing with a lot following my assault. 

my former friend (White M22), who raped/assaulted me (Black F20) due to a disagreement we had regarding the recent protests that are going on right now, waited for me after work on Sunday night to confront me about telling all of our mutual friends that he raped me. 

He shoved me up against my car &amp; yelled in my face. He went as far as to put his hand up my shirt and groped my breast, while saying that he’d rape me again because the cops won’t do shit to him, is what he said to me. 

I honestly believe him. The police let me down. I reported my rape and literally nothing was done, now he knows that he can get away with doing whatever he wants to me. Why else would he show up to my job and sexually assault me, by groping my breast? 

I’ve been a mess ever since. I hate the fact that we were friends because he literally knows everything about me, where I live, work, some of my family members residence’s, secrets, and much more. It’s just too much. I can’t escape him.",09Jun2020,2

These gatherings that she goes to, rarely, if ever, come up in conversation and usually only come up over text or whatever. Am I being crazy?

1184," 

So I noticed that an old school mate of mine (26F) had followed the far right English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson's now banned Facebook page and had liked a couple of his posts. Recently I have also by chance seen her following a similar controversial hate provoking far-right social media page. She has followed this content on her FB page where she clearly states that she is a teacher.

I'm all for freedom of speech and the freedom to subscribe to whatever political ideology that you desire in most circumstances, however this individual is a primary school teacher who is responsible for children aged 7 to 8. In this particular case, I find it quite alarming that someone who has endorsed divisive, xenophobic, discriminatory content is in such an important position of influence.

My nephew used to attend the local primary school where she now teaches although their paths never crossed. I really think our children should be taught early on that despite our religion, background, ethnicity, skin colour, gender and sexuality that we are all equal and should all be loved and treated with respect. It saddens me that there is a teacher with a potentially biased, predjudiced outlook in charge of overseing these kids developing perspectives.

Is it possible for an individual to effectively separate their personal beliefs from their professional duties in such a case?
Is it acceptable to like a post criticising South Asian Muslim immigration into the UK, yet have several students with a South Asian Muslim background in your class?

I'm torn between this. I have a screenshot of her following a controversial extremist political social media page. Would it be wrong or right if I highlighted her social media conduct to her school head?

I don't want to get someone seriously disciplined at all, but should a conversation with a superior or observation be suitable in such an instance? Does anyone have any information as to what standard procedure might be within an educational establishment in such a case?",09Jun2020,0

So my 13 year old cousin is having a bit of a hard time right now, between starting high school (UK), becoming a teenager and struggling with her body/body image and self confidence. She is really down right now and my entire family are worried about her, especially during lockdown, being isolated. I experienced something similar myself at her age and have been offering advice however I’m aware that my advice is very subjective. 
I decided to write her a little “self help book” (a reference to an inside joke we have together) full of advice, self care tips, stories, music, tv and book recommendations to help her. She doesn’t like to talk about things very often, which I can relate to but I’m trying to encourage her to talk more. The aim of this book is to give her something which (even when she doesn’t want to talk to anyone about what is going on) she can reach for to support her. I’m hoping that even if she feels alone and like she can’t talk, she can open this book and feel a little-less shit about things.

But I need help! Because my advice is so subjective to my experience I’m reaching out to people here who have varying experiences/tips/advice to put in this book. I don’t have all the answers for her but I’m hoping this can help give some impartial advice.

If you’re happy to share, please let me know what advice, piece of information, song, book or show you would tell your 13 year old self about if you got the chance to?? Happy, sad, funny or poignant, I think it would be nice to share this with my cousin to help her feel better :)

1189,"On October 25th, my (23f) house was invaded. I live in a building on the first floor and even though my windows are tall, someone entered my house by my bedroom window. I saw him entering my room as I was arriving home and as soon as he entered the room, I ran to the door to trap him inside my house. I opened the door, ran to the room and he was lying under my bed. I could see his boots sticking out and I said ""I saw you jumping into my house and I can see you under the bed"". He didn't move.

I was afraid he had a gun or something so I locked my bedroom door and left him there while I called 911. He was caught by the police 15 mins later entering another home the same way on the same street.

He didn't take anything from me but he messed all my drawers looking for money probably. The only valuable thing I have in my room is my 10+ year old TV.

He was searched and had a knife in his pocket. This was not his first offense, as he had left prison a month earlier and had 20+ complaints only from that month.

He's a drug addict, doesn't work, he's 28m and lives with him grandma who is in denial he could ever do this.

Right now, I don't know if he's in prison or at home. He hasn't been to trial yet.

The appointment was for 1pm. He shows up, asks about some details for one access panel I want made from one of the drywall holes and says he will go get the supplies from a local home depot and meet me back here. I tell him I also will go to home depot for some furniture moving pads and I will buy the ceiling fan I want installed. 

2 hours later I am back (the home depot didn't have the fan I wanted). 

Almost 4pm I call and ask their status. They said there was a huge line to get into the home depot and they are running late. I say ok and go to a neighboring town to get the fan that I wanted.


 I am back by 5pm...6:30pm he finally shows back up. He measures the holes and drops his ladder off saying he will go to his shop with AC to cut all the boards. At this point, I am getting frustrated since I traveled back in town to have this work done. The sun is going down and nothing has been done yet (except his ladder is now in my kitchen). 


7:30PM I call and ask if he plans on coming back (as it's getting late), and his wife answers to the sound of saws cutting in the background. 


Now I don't think I am being too unreasonable. I had an appointment at 1PM, and now it's 8PM with no work done. I leave to go back out of town tomorrow. What should I do?

I was devastated but I liked her so I forgive her and thought we can work this out. 2 weeks later she dumps me because things got too serious and her friends asked her to break up with me. She had no remorse and did not feel sorry at all, just ghosted me blocked me and went cold turkey. 

I was a mess and had depression, tried to contact her but blocked. A year later I sent a flower bunch to her house to which she wrote me an email to not contact her.

Haven’t been able to sleep eat or stay sober in 5 days.  For reference I do not ever drink especially not like this.  Since the break up i’ve been told advice like move on and use the time i spent with her on myself.  I’ve started going on runs in the mornings and it makes me feel temporarily better.  Problem is I can only run for like 20 minutes.  I have dumbbells and resistance bands but I don’t know any workouts to do with them.  I’m not a weak person physically speaking and I used to workout a lot, but i’ve put on some weight, if i’m not worried about muscle gain more so fat loss, i’m a fairly athletic person but i’m not fast i’m shorter (5’8) and strong.  Any exercise and diet tips to help me lose the fat faster because a diet is just as important if not more than the workout.

I’ve taken steps to remove myself from seeing her in photos.

She knows i still have feelings for her so I’m not going to reach out to get back together because she initiated the break up.  

I would still like to be her friend, I’m upset about this but she’s not a bad person she just lost feelings, I understand that happens sometimes but i’ve never been so emotionally distraught about a girl before, she was my first love and my first girlfriend, but i felt like she was the first person to like me back too, which is why it hurts so much.

1202,"This is my first post, sorry for any issues in it.

I am 17(F) and play video games in my free time. One Game I play utilizes discord, so I often talk to other people online, and will message them to organize things in game. I like meeting new people in the game, but never really interact with them outside of it.

Well a week ago my sister was teaching someone new to the game how to play, and left me to help teach him(16 M)  when she had to go.  I gave him my discord so that we could communicate easier, which is very common for this game.  We played for a couple of hours before I left, and he talked about how much he enjoyed playing with me.

I was surprised when he later messaged me saying hey, I assumed he wanted to play and didn't know any other people with the game, since he had mentioned that he got the computer a week ago for his birthday.  I agreed to play, and later on we kept messaging.  I found out he lives a couple of states over due to us being in different time zones, so he knows which state I live in, which is fine since it is quite a big state.

As we continued to talk we discussed issues we had dealt with in life, and I wanted to help since he seems to have gone through many things I had at his age.  However as we talked more it becomes very clear to me that he likes me.  Mentioning that I can message him every minute of every day if I wanted.  I assumed he just meant he was always open to talk, but now I see that he really likes me.

He confirmed my assumptions later on when he mentioned that he has a crush on me. However I see him like a younger cousin, or sibling, and regardless I don't want a relationship any time soon.

I told him that I liked him as a friend, but I am not sure he completely understood, as when I mentioned that I could not cook, he said he would cook for me, I pointed out that I live far away, but he insisted that it was not too bad, and would like to travel when he grew up.

He is very kind, but I feel like I am suffocating, he has put me on a pedestal, and I don't know what to do, however I am worried about hurting him, as he has mentioned that he is going through some stuff.

I don't think he has much experience with people, and has grown attached to me perceiving me being friendly as being interested. 

I am unsure what to do, I have never dealt with someone getting attached to me before, and don't know how to tell him that I treat him the same way I treat everyone else, that I am a friendly person, and that I always try to help people with their problems. I don't know if I am blowing this out of proportion, but any advice is welcome.",09Jun2020,1
