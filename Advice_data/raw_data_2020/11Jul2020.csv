0,"So I graduated from uconn (CT USA) in the fall but am planning to take a gap year working essential job(s) like grocer / barista before grad school, and my two friends and I are planning to move to denver in october, when theyve saved enough. I have enough to rent out a room there now, and I am considering going ahead of them for the sake of landing a job before unemployment ends and the market is potentially flooded. Am I just on this theory, is it a good idea? 
I have enough to last me a few months at least, so waiting till october may not be so bad as long as i can find a job in a few months. Just throwing it out there since ive been having difficulty in deciding what to do.",11Jul2020,1

2,"(25m) My life has been a rollar coaster of emotions that I never got the proper help and support growing up.
It's always been a matter of owing my family and I paid that in full.
I dropped out of college just to go back to take care of them. Since that's what they've always bugged me to do.
They always complain and whine how I never help and just had to silently deal with my mother's alcoholic behavior since I was a kid and got a lot worse in my teen years.
""I gave birth to you"" is the very reason why I want to kill myself but continue living to spite her.
Since the last lend she hasnt drink much and downright quit. I'm happy she finally kicked addiction. But I feel cheated and drain out of my youth.
I've had trouble sleeping since I'd always go to sleep at 3-5am and wake up at 7 for school, all to get peace and quiet
I wish she hit me so I could at least made the pain stopped and return that strike with lethal force. But.. Since I'm still here  that never happened.
My gf whom Ive been with for 3 years.. Had blindly been in love with me at first and now is a better partner just as I am for her. I've made improvements to myself and for her since I was toxic
 her only reason is to live for me and thats really stressful on my part. I just don't know how to talk to her about these concerning thoughts 
I don't have time to think for myself and mindlessly numb my brain falling asleep to youtube and has gotten so bad that I can't even remember what I did last week or even yesterday
I've always fantasize about abandoning my life. Getting rid of my citizenship and start a new life in a different country in order to finally live my life. But... I'm a coward, I never knew much about anything and the best I got is a highschool diploma

TL;DR my life is hell and I want to start a new life",11Jul2020,1
3,"To be honest I don’t think I can type the details out without having a breakdown but here’s some background info: 

16 y/o female
Grew up with a dad who is sexist 
I’m the only female in my family
I despise being a girl and want to puke every time I see my body 
I hate being a girl in case you haven’t guessed 
I’ve wanted to be a guy since I was young 
I don’t really like to think about my gender or sexuality at all
I constantly feel like people see me differently because I’m a girl and I hate it

Do you think I have gender dysphoria? Even if I do, I’d rather die than go through the transition (not a joke) so I’m either fucked up or fucked up.",11Jul2020,1
4,"So I kind of have to drop my life story in order to get to the point I am today.

I was abused as a child until I was placed into foster care at the age of 10(2002). My father then got custody of me and we moved to Texas(2002). I lived in Texas until I was 17 and I moved back to Tennessee(2010). Me and my sons mom broke up and I moved back to Texas at 18(2011). I stayed in Texas and after a really bad relationship I moved back to Tennessee (2014). (My daughter was born in 2013 in Texas). I decided that Texas was home and I moved back to Texas in 2018 and things were great. Then I had a really bad anxiety attack and moved back to Tennessee, I literally just packed during this anxiety episode and started driving (2019). So today, I feel lost and like Texas is where I belong, then when I'm there I miss Tennessee.. I really do not know what to do because I have a child in each state, and I really haven't been the best father, because I feel as though I am neglecting at least one of them by being in the other state. I have no idea where to go or what to do as far as a career.

My daughters mom said I am scared of commitment and failing and being abandoned. Well yes that is true, because of the way my life has been up until now. My father and my entire family want nothing to do with me because of the mistakes I made as a teenager (after enduring abuse for 10 years from my mother, I was a fairly angry and upset teenager, attempted suicide and was always depressed and angry). 

So here I am at 27, wishing I could somehow take everything back and have some sort of stability in my life, yet I do not even know what stability is or how to get it. I do not know how to get past this point in my life and to settle down.",11Jul2020,1

7,"My new manager started about a month and a half ago and since her first day has been treating me unfairly and belittling me in front of my colleagues. I have heard rumours from other managers that she is trying to get rid of me which she doesn’t hide very well so I believe it. I have asked to move office and have been told that my reputation is now ruined with the other managers in the company. I feel completely singled out and bullied and it feels like they are trying to get rid of me. My colleagues will also agree with these statements. I have spoken to my HR and they suggested having an informal meeting with HR and my manager to try and work things out or I can also go the formal route of making an official bullying complaint which will be investigated more.

Would you recommend going the informal route or the formal route? I feel like if I go the formal route then it will just stay the same as the last time I had a meeting about this issue it got worse afterwards.",11Jul2020,1

10,"hello. 

i am feeling very overwhelmed after a difficult few weeks. i will not get into all the details, but will give a summary of what has occurred. i have been very lonely lately, so i decided to deposit a gift for my neighbors to try to start a friendship. they were quite offended by the gift (which i still do not understand) and when i tried to apologize, they got their lawyers on the horn and are now threatening to have my beautiful garden destroyed via fire. i have now been guarding my garden day and night, getting little to no sleep. 

in addition, today i found out that someone in my circle has been lying and using me and my many friends for her own benefit. she has also been lying about a serious medical condition. although there is ample proof, she refuses to admit her mistakes. some of these people are even choosing to believe this ghoul despite the evidence. we have a convention soon and i am worried that i will have to be around people defending her.

11,"My ex broke up with me a few months ago and i’m still very hurt and effected by it, while it seems he’s completely fine and has moved on. I made mistakes and (talking to other people while i was with him, looking for validation) and that was the catalyst for our break up. 

Following the break up he did a complete 180 and turned into someone i didn’t know. He said many hurtful things, which at the time i disregarded because i was so desperate for his love, that i accepted whatever he said about me and apologised profusely, hoping that he’d take me back and we could make it work.

Basically, i still feel really hurt and betrayed by this. I was genuinely in love with him, and he was one of the most important people to me. And for someone who you trusted and let in, who means that much to you to treat you like shit, and move on from you so easily really hurts. 

Now i feel like with new relationships i’m so scared and hesitant to let my walls down and give my trust because i feel like they’ll just turn around and become someone completely different. I don’t trust in people when they show their love for me because it feels so phony and shallow, given how my last relationship turned out. 

How can i stop letting my last relationship affect new friendships/relationships?",11Jul2020,1

16,"Basically I (F19) need to decide where I’m going to university by July 20th.

I have always been fucking shit at making important decisions, but it’s worse than ever with this because it’s so huge!! And what’s worse is that practical reasons barely come into it - I can only seem to think in feelings and intuitions and random whims. I am struggling so much and second, third, fourth guessing myself. 

I think it’s got something to do with anxiety and mildly obsessive behaviours - I just hate the idea that I can’t sign up for the guaranteed future/life I want, with the right people, right vibes, right place, the right version of me. I can’t accept that this is out of my control. I cannot just pick a place, let go and forget about the other options and what could happen instead.

I’m not gonna go into the universities because like I said, the relative practicalities of my choices are actually irrelevant - all my options are good places and I would be happy to go to any of them.

But the issues mainly come down to this - one place is where I actually want to be (South London, I just loved the campus and the whole small community feel of the university). Another place has the year abroad I want to do, and is also in London. Another couple of places have the specific (rare) joint honours course I really want to do (philosophy and psychology as opposed to just psych). And the last option is the *other* place I really want to be, which happens to be at the total other end of the country, but I love it there too.

I don’t know what is more important to me.
I don’t know what I need. I’m fucking scared that I can’t guarantee my happiness. I just need so much more, from life and everything and I want to make it happen but I’m terrified of fucking it up by picking the ‘wrong’ place.

I think my head is stuck in a fucking movie sometimes. I need everything to be ideal and ‘romantic’ and beautiful, or it feels like it’s not worth living for. I’m aware of how dramatic and stupid that is, but I can’t really help it. I am getting way better though - this time last year it was awful lmao and I’m so much more rational and healthy now, but obviously still not enough to manage this. 

Please help me - how do you make big decisions when you’ve already taken into account all the small technicalities? How do you just pick one thing, and stick with it, and not blame yourself when it inevitably turns out not to be completely perfect?",11Jul2020,1

21,"There's an artist who's somewhat popular. He's got 60,000 monthly listeners. Well known within his circle, but not a *huge* name. He's inspired me to make music, and I would definitely not be making the music I do if it weren't for him. I emailed him this back in 2015, and he responded. We talked a bit, and I ended up sending him a few songs I made. He really liked one in particular and edited it himself. Meanwhile, I kept making music but found myself departing from the style of his and developing my own style. Last year, he did an AMA and I asked if he had remembered me, and he said he did. Now, I'm starting to feel my next album coming together in a style that's closer to what he does. Id love for him to have a riff on my newest album that I could layer on top of, and given our history, I don't think it's completely insane for me to ask. But it makes me hesitant. I don't want to come off as obsessive, or desperate. I'm not doing that because I want to leech off his fanbase, I genuinely just think it'd be cool to have a collaboration with someone who I feel would fit the aesthetic of the album. Secondly, he doesn't have a good reason *to* do it. I have like 200 listeners a month. I'm not well known at all and he'd be gaining nothing at all from it. On the other hand, I could promise him commission on what money is made on that song. But all said and done, I don't want to ruin the good image he has of me by asking something stupid like that. Should I ask? If so, how should I word it?",11Jul2020,1
22,"Long post alert:

I have a friend of six years. I've known them since high school, and during those years we got really close. Like, almost a couple levels of close. They were really reliant on me to provide them with emotional support, and I was happy to oblige because I had feelings for them. However, it got difficult when they started talking to me about their depression and their suicidal thoughts. I tried my best to listen to them, show that I care, and direct them to a therapist. Despite my efforts, they didn't seek out the help that they needed and continued to rely on me for support.

I never knew how this friend really felt about me. I had already told them my feelings, but they wouldn't give me a real answer, neither accepting or rejecting me. So being the naive teen I was, I thought I had a chance, so I stuck around. They would keep me close, closer than any ""friend"" should be, and with the amount of emotional vulnerability they showed me, I was hooked.

They would continue to tell me about their intense feelings and I would continue to listen. We would spend hours of every day together talking, playing games, watching videos, and I would end every day feeling very drained but not understanding why. After a couple of years of this, I was getting very tired of it. So much so that I felt like their depression was starting to consume me as well. I felt like they were using me, so I began to withdraw and take more time for myself, but the two of us remained friends.

In the middle of my process of getting over them, they called me out of the blue. On the phone I could tell they were crying and in a lot of mental anguish. They went on to tell me about how they were in a depressive state and had thoughts of suicide. I did my best to console them, again recommending that they see a therapist. They agreed that they needed professional help, and went on to talk about how I was one of their most trusted friends and that ""they think of me as more than a friend"". Frankly, I was shocked. But I felt really uncomfortable with their confession because I felt like it was something they said in the heat of the moment (which is something that they do sometimes). I didn't think their confession was genuine, but I didn’t say that out loud. They already seemed really distraught so I didn't want to add any fuel to the fire.

During our senior year of high school, they announced that they would be joining the Marines. I didn't know much about the military, but I was really worried at the time. Considering their mental health, I didn't think that would be a good idea. Nevertheless, they joined and shipped off to the other side of the world. I was honestly relieved to not have to spend so much time with them anymore. This might be terrible to say, but I felt so free the first few months they were away.

I got completely over them and I started to invest more time into myself. In the years that they were gone, I graduated college, got a Masters degree, landed a great job, and threw myself into my hobbies.

But couple days ago, I awoke to a message from them asking if they could call me. I thought it was strange since we hadn't really spoken in a while, but I agreed. Apparently, something happened which triggered their depression and suicidal thoughts, and they called me because I was the first person thought of to call. I wasn't able to tell them anything other than what I had already told them in the past. Much of what they said in this conversation was the same as what they said in the last phone call. They even said ""they think of me as more than a friend"" again. And like last time, I patiently listened to them, even though I felt very uncomfortable. I checked in with them again the other day and they said that they would see a therapist. I have yet to confirm whether they have or not.

I care about them, but quite frankly, I don't want to help them shoulder their baggage anymore. I thought this behavior would be over once they joined the Marines, but that doesn't seem to be the case. How do I prevent them from dumping this on me again? Ever since that phone call a couple of days ago, it's been hard for me to concentrate on my work and other parts of my life. It feels unfair that they do this to me because they only call when they want my emotional support.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: A depressed friend relied on my emotional support for years until they went to the Marines and stopped regularly talking to me. Out of the blue, they call me first thing in the morning saying that they had suicidal thoughts. I told them to see a therapist, but I'm unsure of whether or not they actually did. I'm tired of repeating this cycle. How do I prevent them from dumping this on me again?",11Jul2020,1
23,"Well, this is how I am. ""Aggressive and inconsequential"" is how this guy just described me two hours ago. And he has a reason for that. We were everybody talking in our class group when suddenly this guy started to be intolerant, and he tried to justify his intolerance while everybody was arguing about how his position is harmful to society. And what I did? As soon as he didn't change his point of view, I started to insult him, calling him an imbecile, stupid, etc. I was being aggressive, and the other folks were telling me to don't act like that. He then told me to never speak with him again, which doesn't make a difference to me, but it made me think about how toxic I am.  


Really, I wouldn't like to have to live together with someone like me. Some weeks ago, a very close friend of mine told me she didn't want to talk to me anymore, because I am, in her words, ""a very aggressive person"". That loss truly affected me. She is one of a kind, and I admire her a lot. Some days after that, I just exploded with two buddies while we were playing online, and it was again something that I am not proud of, but it's the kind of thing that I keep doing. I feel it's not a matter of ""if"" I do, but ""when"" I will do it again... 

You know, for the past 30 minutes I dwelled on how I could have been so graceful and elegant if I wrote a longer text, without insults, being careful and detailed with my arguments, and most importantly, treating with respect another human being. Instead, I did the worse I could, being a shame for not only that guy, but for my friends and for the other people from the class that had to see my unpleasant ""show"".

And wanna know what is funny? Until here, Grammarly says that the overall tone of this text is ""Angry""...

I'd like to change, be different, a nice person to live with. But I'm simply not sure whether I can do this or not. As a matter of fact, I don't even know where to start. However, it hurts. It hurts a lot. It hurts while I'm acting like that, and of course in the aftermath. We were never friends and usually we disagree on a lot of things related to the school when we have to discuss something, but the certainty that he is so disgusted that he doesn't want to talk, well, it makes me suffer.",11Jul2020,1

27,"I am 21F and one of my REALLY good friends is 26M. 

I'd say early/mid-way through forming our bond, boundaries were set, he asked if we were just friends, i vehemently agreed as he is like an older brother with the bond I wish i had with mine; it is the brotherly feeling I never knew i wanted until now. I value it and hope he stays one of my good friends. I have a lot of fun with him and we hang out often.

I understand where he is coming from as multiple female friendships of his fell through because either he or the girl caught feelings (sexual/romantic). Now, i will admit he *is* **attractive**. He asked me awhile ago if i was **attracted to him** i said he was **attractive** so he then reiterates the **attracted to** part and I shake my head no. Because i truly am not.

Now, i may be reading too into it but do you think He believed me? I really value the friendship we have; like i said, he is like an older brother and I love that bond. I keep thinking that maybe I shouldve just said he was good looking instead of attractive as attractive is used interchangeably with attraction.

However, upon my delayed entrance into the workforce of researchers in my community, I was met with something my textbooks couldn't have prepared me for. 
For those not aware of academic circles, researchers tend to keep a lot of what they do under wraps, so information doesn't leak to the public and cause misconceptions before it is published in a scientific journal. After gaining access to the frontier of human knowledge of the different species of animal kingdom, I can firmly say that what we DONT know is severely understated.

31,"My brother was given an ancestry DNA kit a couple years ago as a gift. Just last week he got a message from a girl who claimed to be related to him via her DNA results. It stated he was either her grandfather, uncle, or brother. He's nowhere near being a grandfather, and the closeness in age makes it highly unlikely that he's anyone else's uncle, it's easy enough to determine that he's her brother. 

After asking my mom for more information, she admitted that right before getting together with my dad, she got pregnant by some other dude. 

My brother and I grew up believing that the people raising us were our parents. But my dad isn't his dad. Everybody knew. Everybody. They kept a 34 year old lie.

We both always suspected something, even as kids, we asked questions, but there was constant denial. 

The real problem is that my dad was rather abusive growing up. Both physically and mentally. And now knowing that he knew my brother wasn't really his son, and my brother always got it worse than I did, I'm angry at my dad for doing what he did, and at my mom for letting another man lay hands on her son.

My brother seems to still be on good enough terms with my parents since the news broke, but I'm wondering if I should still be upset and angry with them.

Earlier this week I planned on getting a blood test done today since I haven’t had one in a while. I think the last time I had one was about two or three years ago. I tried to get one done last year but I showed up only to sit there and cry for two hours while patients around me came and went as though it wasn’t a big deal.


Today however, I tried my best to get a test done. My boyfriend woke up early to drive 50 miles to pick me up, drive me, and hold my hand to get the test done. I had mentioned how terrified I was and I requested to lay down. They made all the accommodations for me and I still couldn’t do it. I just sat there shaking, crying, and shaking my head when asked if I was ready. It was full on terrified, uncontrollable tears. I kept tensing and balling up, and I kept pulling my arm away from the lady who was supposed to do my blood. At one point it felt like I had to fight her, and she even said “you’re fighting me”. The farthest I’ve been able to get is having a tourniquet placed and getting an alcohol swab.


I was really, really embarrassed and ashamed. I’m 24 and can not get over this fear. The lady tried her best to be nice and patient with me but over time became tired and said she needed to get back to work. At that point I apologized and left. I had to walk through two lobbies still crying feeling the most shame I’ve felt in a while. My boyfriend was very patient, kind, and understanding. I couldn’t have asked for better support. He would get my attention and I’d look into eyes. I felt warm when it looked at him for a brief second, but then the fear set in that the lady would take advantage of my distraction and do the test. They say I should look away when it happens, but I feel so vulnerable with my arm extended out like that and not paying attention to it. I can’t even stretch it out like that when I’m alone without feeling a cringe. I don’t even like when anything is resting in that spot of my arm. I need to get over this fear so I can start being more careful with my health and regular check ups. This is actually one of the reasons I’m not sure I even want to have kids. I don’t think I could handle regular pregnancy check ups that require blood work.


I don’t know where this fear comes from. Vaccines aren’t as bad for me, although I still get scared. Watching myself bleed isn’t that bad either. It’s just putting myself in a position where my blood is being taken from me. All I can think is, “I need that to live” and “that needle is not supposed to go in there”. Even the lady said babies could get this done. I just really need help getting over this fear. I can’t stop feeling so ashamed, guilty, and embarrassed. I wasted everyone’s time.",11Jul2020,1

35," 

So I was good friends/fwb with my ex, friends with his ex and good friends with her now boyfriend.

He has decided not to be my friend anymore and blocked me and she has also done the same and her now boyfriend has done that too.

She is almost 21 I am 35 and he is 38.

He did that because he is poly and feels I get too jealous because I freaked out when he was being affectionate with his ex right in front of me and she has now in a monogamous relationship.

Basically we were told that lockdown will be reinforced again the following day and she decided to have a birthday dinner as her birthday is during the lockdown.

He came upstairs to get me and we kissed and asked me for a blow job I said no because they were waiting downstairs for us.

When we got in the car he barely acknowledged me and cuddles up to her I felt upset and used and to be honest I felt that during the whole time we were together and in a relationship he was just doing that until she wanted him again there was even a time when we were in a relationship I had asked him for sex he said no he hasnt been horny lately and went and asked her the next day (we were poly).

Anyway I have been accused of being abused because I got upset when the following situations occurred I would cry and voice how I feel I dint name call etc I did say to him I dont want to see you again and take it back because i was conflicted so maybe I was a bit manipulative but NOT abusive.

I was going to tell him I want to be juts platonic friends because this was all too much for me but he has blocked my number and on social media etc which has really hurt me furthermore she has got her now boyfriend who I havent wronged at all who met through me had sex in my bed in front of me and are monogamous together which has also hurt me to not talk to me and she is going around saying I'm a bad person etc and who knows what else to anyone who will listen.

This has hurt me a lot I dont know what to do.

Also this mess and stress caused a lot of breakdowns and caused me to miss work etc.",11Jul2020,1
36,"So to start off I spent 5 years in the military and became very good at showing no emotions. I have been out since 2008 and started on the road to recovery from the emotionless nature I had put myself into.  But within the last 5 years I have had 3 very dear friends pass away 2 from suicide.  Had 3 really good relationships crash and burn, most recent one was a few weeks ago. 

As a child I was the middle, older brother had 4.5 years one me so he could do no wrong and my sister is handicapped and couldn't physically do anything wrong, in my parents eyes. So I always got the beatings. I as a child felt empty and emotionless like when I was in the military. So the feelings are nothing new. 

With everything going on from hating my job to the breakup to my broken foot, about to become homeless again and exc. I have started to feel empty and emotionless again. I just dont know how to pull myself out of it without becoming suicidally depressed or becoming an alcoholic (again, from when I was getting out of the military).

37,"Nine years ago I worked at an entertainment company and was very overt racial discriminated against, this forced me to leave my job after three years.

I was the only black person in my department and I was always being reminded of this fact. My coworkers would call me Beyoncé and Rihanna instead of my actual name. When I asked why they didn't call me my name they said it was because I was a pretty black girl like them. Management knew this went on and ignored it. I worked the same position as four other girls, all white. When my manager would come downstairs to see us, she acknowledged everyone but me, she was always chatty with the other girls and never asked me about my life but knew about the girls very personally. In front of my coworkers she would say things to me like ""do you think my shoes look ghetto, you know...because you know what ghetto would look like"". When she would acknowledge me she would say ""hey girrrrl"" and snap her fingers. She was very tough on me compared to the other girls, offering them all promotions and never me. A girl was even offered a position who was fired and rehire for fraternization but not me. She didn't know I was close with the other girls, she would talk badly about me saying that I was ""aggressive"" and even saying that I ""have such an awful personality, how could she have friends"". I eventually quit because she wouldn't give me the day off to attend my friends funeral who passed away suddenly (while i was at work). 

Maybe it's the quiet of covid that has got me thinking, but i feel like saying something to HR. I was so much younger and thought no one would believe me and im worried for other poc who work under her (shes upper mgmt now). Am I over thinking this? 

I've also been thinking about my experiences at a very high end hotel as the only poc in my dept. I faced sexual harassment from guests and 3 male managers. One of the men liked me, he made that clear on my first day, commenting on how nicely my uniform fit as he literally undressed me with his eyes. I kept it very professional with him, even after he reached out to my cousin to ask for my number over social media. He told another manager (he didn't know we were close from a pervious job together) that he wanted to rip my uniform off and f* me in my a*. After this, i kept it strictly professional.. He didn't like this and made my time there hell. I wrote down dates and times of the comments and aggressions and showed them to my female manager who basically said she couldn't do anything. I went to hr and told them he was being aggressive, they told me that was his management style. I never brought up the sexual harassment because i didn't think anyone would believe me, especially Becuase 2 other male managers lied on his behalf. They were disgusting, i caught them watching porn in their office on their phones. He now works in upper management. 

Should i keep these things to myself? These are very popular, luxurious brands.. Idk",11Jul2020,1
40,"Overtime, my friend group has become friends with this person named... John. After a while, John introduced us to his friend group. They’re pretty cool yk, nice but sometimes offensive or really blunt, but it isn’t annoying. Anyways, we all became friends, met and have talked over discord many, many, many times. And usually I would be the person to start those calls or constantly talk to them and recently I haven’t felt the need to constantly talk to them or someone else. 

Esp because my best friend.. hannah has recently got a boyfriend, so we don’t talk much. She is more busy compared to before. We used to talk everyday, facetime or have atleast a conversation via imsg
but not anymore. So, I just stopped attempting to spark anything.

But anyways, they ALL have had a “conversation”? (idk because hannah won’t tell me, apprently something about privacy, but is it really if i already know the group their from??) and they all have said i’ve changed. she confronted me about it a while ago at the WRONG time but she did and now it’s just awkward. 

I don’t know how i’m supposed to change back because I literally do not know what the me that they’re used to is, so what do i say??? what do i do?? it’s just so annoying because i tend to overthink and the thought that they’ve been talking about this 7

Some people were supposed to come live with us and we knew them so we started to renovate the basement. My father likes everything perfect and therefore puts so much pressure on my mother. He also blames everything bad that happens on her. He was really into speakers and dumped around 10 grand into speakers and blamed my mother for spending too much. He never seems to be happy with anything my mother does. He puts a lot of pressure on for her to get a job he makes her takes these programming classes wether she likes it or not. She usually spends a lot of time studying but and still doesn’t have a job and my father says it’s because she is not trying hard enough. My mother doesn’t have an income and my father provides most of the money so she is kind of stuck with him. He had an ex wife which he never really told us how they got divorced and likes to dance around the subject but I’m pretty sure he did the same thing with her too.

43,"For context, I am a 25 year old female.

I recently quit my job at a hyper-growth mode cybersecurity company. I was a top performer. Making more money than I ever could've imagined, and offered much more (as in, six-figure gains). Liked my job and had a good manager. Was provided the opportunity to advance as well. A few friends at the company and met my boyfriend through the experience.

But about a year ago, things were really different. I was in a lower role and was getting viciously bullied by multiple other people at the company. Management completely mishandled it in my opinion, as they basically took my bully's side (he ended up falling on his face when he was promoted; I succeeded well past him in comparison). But I can never forget the horrible, disrespectful personal attacks, nor the fact that I was completely neglected when all I wanted was for somebody to say ""stop."" (He had been making up rumors about me doing sexual acts for advancement, and saying that I was a fraud generally speaking).

Now, I am leaving for a much lower paying job at Google. I am still grateful for the ""brand name"" but as I see my current (well, now former) company's stock price shoot up in light of COVID-19 and everyone around me says ""how can you leave?"" I second guess myself. I feel weak. Feel like I shouldn't be the one forced to give so much up just because I was mistreated but I really have been struggling to move past what happened.  Don't know if there's any way to really fix that either. Plus, I have been in an overly dependent relationship with the boyfriend I met through this company due to the emotional support he provided during hard times. I've wanted to break up with him for a long time, but have been having a hard time while we worked together.

I have issues in everyday life that keep me very focused on myself and my problems so I literally forget my two grandmothers and I feel horrible about it. 

My parents rarely forced me to visit my grandparents as a kid so I never learned the importance of doing that until I started feeling bad. My parents basically made me do the bare minimum. I've always been bad at keeping in touch with people, I tend to keep to myself. My parents always call me, I rarely call them, and my grandmothers rarely ever call me because they don't want to bother me (they've said) so you can imagine how little I speak to them. We can't really relate or bond over anything, they don't keep up with the times at all except the news.

53,"Background on medications I receive:
Monthly:
Anxiety med, schedule 3 1mg / 2 tablets per day
ADHD med, schedule 2, 20mg / 2 tablets per day.

I use CVS Pharmacy for my medications as they are the closest pharmacy and my PBM is CVS Caremark.


Complaint goes as such:

I am going on vacation tomorrow, July 11th, 2020. The medication fill dates are 07/12/2020. I called CVS caremark last night and inquired about a vacation override. I was told more than once and beyond a shadow of a doubt, that the override was successful and I would have zero difficult filling my meds the next day. Then comes today, I called my local CVS pharmacy and I asked if my medications were ready to be picked up. After a lengthy conversation, unnecessarily tense in nature(completely on the Pharmacist'spart), I was informed that under no circumstances would CVS fill these medications for today or even tomorrow. As we were hanging up the phone, the pharmacist muttered the word junkie under their breath which I could clearly hear and which I assume that they meant for me to hear. Humiliated and angered at the same time I immediately called my pharmacy benefit manager AKA CVS caremark to explain my dilemma and distress.  Upon reaching a supervisor, I explained EVERYTHING, sparing nary a detail. I completely and fully understood that she would need to call my CVS and confirm both sides of the story. After a short but anxious five minutes, she immediately began by apologizing profusely. When I asked why she apologized, she said in all my years I have never seen such a lack of respect for a patient. Not only did she verify everything that I told her as true, but she also said that the CVS and the pharmacist tried to claim that for 6 plus months now I have been trying to get medications early. As my pharmacy benefit manager, she has complete access to every medication that I've received ever. That being said, she told me straight up and she also told them straight up that that was categorically false and slanderous towards my character. She also said that if they're doing this to me God knows how many other individuals are being treated such a way. The supervisor recommended that I call CVS corporate office and file and immediate complaint and that she would back me up 100%. For 6 months now, any time that I would receive a medication at at that particular CVS they would tell me that the medication won't be in stock for 7 to 10 days. The supervisor that I spoke to said that upon or a view of stocking around those times she could clearly tell that those medications not only were in stock but they also weren't being held for any other customers so so the true fact of the matter is that whoever I spoke to me, whether on the phone or to my face. I am beyond disgusted with 2690 Hylan Boulevard, SI NY and boy would I HATE for redditors to boycott them ;).

If you read this far, would I have grounds for a lawsuit given that I have all of this documented? Thanks if you read my complaint y'all. I am humiliated to have been treated this way. My wife is a doctor. My family are all cops. To be called a junkie because I have ADHD and Anxiety is despicable. 

Purposely withholding medication that I need to live a normal life? Well that alone is just horrifying. I hope karma finds this woman and gives her a taste of her favorite medicine. (Hate)",11Jul2020,1
54,"So for context, I’m a college sophomore and because of corona, I’m staying with my parents. I’m currently in summer school to catch up on classes and a couple of days ago, I took a seven day free trial on Disney+ (at least I hope it’s free). I want to get a Disney+ subscription, but my credit card account is tied to my parents’ and I don’t have enough in my ATM account to afford a Disney+ subscription and there’s no guarantee that I’ll have a job in the fall. I get a monthly allowance for college and I suggested to my parents that they take out $10 from my allowance for the Disney+ subcription, but they won’t budge. I tried telling them that it’s cheaper than Netflix and of the streaming services, only Hulu is cheaper. Still not budging. The trouble with this is that Disney has such a monopoly that by not having their streaming service, there’s hundreds of movies and shows that you can’t watch since Disney owns them. I would try and use a friend’s account, but none of my close friends has Disney+.

I’m willing to pay for Disney+ if/when I get a job in the fall, and I’m willing to do most anything for that subscription, but since my parents manage all the money in the family, I have to get them to agree to it.

He's has told me in the past that he literally cannot remember his life without Daniel being his best friend and that he considers Daniel his blood brother. So 9 months ago when my bf learned that his best friend was killed in a hit and run it destroyed him. I was with him when he got the call from daniels mother than daniel was hit by a car and was in the hospital. I have never seen him so scared and he literally rushed to the hospital. When he got their daniel sadly has already passed away and my boyfriend was quiet. Like he didn't cry he didn't even seem sad it was like he was dead inside. He was like this even at daniels funeral and when he spoke at the funeral I could tell that he wasn't all ""there"" if you know what I mean.

So fast forward to last night, my boyfriend and I were looking at old pictures of me on Facebook laughing at my emo stage when he got a notification for Daniels and His friendship anniversary and when he saw it he just froze and started balling crying. I thought that he had somewhat accepted his death as he would crack jokes about stupid things he and Daniel did would laugh about it. So when this happened I had no idea what to do. I tried to comfort him but he just didn't seem to acknowledge anything around him, He has always been a closed-off person that didn't share anything much even when something was clearly bothering him, so whenever he was feeling down I would give him space as he has told me in the past that sometimes he just needs to clear his head and just be left alone. But I feel like I just cant leave him alone about this problem. I know that he likes to keep certain problems to himself but this is a problem that I feel like he needs to talk about.

If she catches you looking she quickly stops and gets visibly embarrassed. It obviously really grosses me out.

It’s got to the point where even my mum has pointed it out to me. I just don’t get how she has no shame. 

What makes it even more disgusting is the fact that she makes no attempt to go wash her hands afterwards. I cringe when I watch her pick her nose then touch all over the tv remote, light switches or dips her hands into share size bags of snacks. It’s really unhygienic and disgusting but she doesn’t seem to actually care or listen apart from being a bit embarrassed when confronted.

He doesn't exactly understand what covid is since he has a 5 year old mentality and cerebral palsy. Her response? That I was overreacting and should stop worrying about it because I don't know my results yet and ""if you get it, that means we probably have it, and we can't do anything about it."" Last night she asked me if I could go get some cigarettes from the corner store for her and I said no. I was sleepy and really wasn't in the mood to drive. She went to get them instead, but I can tell she wasn't happy. This morning I told her about my symptoms again and she just said I was being overdramatic. Later on today she was going out, so I asked if she could get me some Sprite for my throat. At first she said yes, but then said no because I couldn't go get her cigarettes last night and I can't expect her to get me something if I couldn't get her something simple. *huge sigh.* My 17 year old sister just asked if I could buy her some band aids because she cut herself at work.

I told my mom I didn't like her tone, but she said she doesn't understand why I paid so much for a car if I didn't want to drive. Its like she doesn't understand that I'm concerned about having covid. I told her I wanted to quarantine in my room (me and my sister share a room) but she told me no and I could either get a hotel or go to the hospital. 

My mom ALWAYS does this. I'm not sure if its just my community, but I'm black and in the black community, our parents like to say were being dramatic or overreacting when we have a legit concern. Its not anything new from her, but I thought she'd be more understanding since my brother has a illness. I love my mom, so please don't call her name. She's a good mom, but I don't know why she's being so dismissive and nonchalant about this. Anything I can say or do?",11Jul2020,1
63,"My last post on this explains most of my situation, but to sum it up: 
My parents are divorced, my mother cheated on him, and I’ll be living with my mother.
See, my mother wanted me to meet her boyfriend ( the man she cheated on my dad with ) but because of the amazing advice I got, I decided to talk to her and she understood, sadly the “ understanding “ seemed to have a limit.

Me and my mom don’t have the greatest relationship, but I’m living with her because I worry for my little brother ( he’s 8 ) turning out worse than he already is. She says I favor my dad because he argues with her a lot about what happened, but when I say something that seems to be “ against “ her, she seems to not see me like her daughter. 

My mother claims I’ll never want to meet her boyfriend , or let him come over, basically keeping her from being in love with him. My little brother loves my mom, and instantly picks her over anyone, but my mom seems to pick her boyfriend over her kids due to the fact she made food for him at his place and just ordered pizza for me and my little brother. 

She says once I turn 18 she’ll move away with my little brother and kick me out. I love my little brother and want him to have a better future, he thinks I’m ruining his life because I tell him to turn off a game.
I feel hurt that my own mom doesn’t want me around because I’m holding her back, taking my little brother and most likely not going to raise him correctly due to her “new life”. 

Should I just let it happen? Should I let my little brother go with my mom and not fight about it?",11Jul2020,1
64,"So i’m (15F) and i have been told by a couple people that a small group of my long time friends talk about me behind my back. They never seem fake with me and i’ve never brought it up because i’m scared of confrontation i guess. i’ve always just ignored it and pretended i was never told otherwise.

I don’t know what to do as i don’t feel like i can talk to anyone about it. my parents are friends with their parents so that’s out of the question. i don’t want to tell any of my other friends as it makes me feel like everyone secretly hates me and is just putting up with me.

i keep telling myself that it’s only high school and i will make long lasting friendships but i don’t want to live out the rest of my childhood waiting for it to be over.

Tonight I finally sucked it up and went upstairs. I knocked twice but no one answered. I really want to address the noise but understand no one sets out to have loud kids. 

Does anyone have advice on how best to approach this? 

My more passive approach is, “Hi, I’m XX, I live beneath you. I came up because there’s not much of a noise barrier from your space to mine and the running/jumping gets really loud. I know it’s hard with the kids cooped up right now, but I wanted to let you know.”

70,"As I get older (23m), I get really worried about how living my life, as if how I'm currently living it isn't okay.

I like to lift weights, run, play videogames, watch movies, smoke weed, and hangout with my girlfriend. Those really are the main staples of my life. I also work part-time and go to school full-time for engineering. 

I will occasionally do other things like swim, hike, hang with friends, garden or other miscellaneous things. For example, I recently took weeks preparing and buying items to house a betta fish. 

Other than these things, my life is pretty simple, and I enjoy it when I'm not worrying about how I'm living. The only time I'm unhappy is when I'm worried I'm living my life like a loser. I think these things because I don't have many hobbies. I've tried writing, reading, guitar, and drawing, but I don't enjoy them. I also worry that I'm a loser because I play videogames, and like to smoke weed when I do it; however, I limit my smoking to only after 9pm when I have nothing else to do. The other reason is because I very rarely hangout with anyone. I get most of my socialization from work, which I enjoy, or I get from my girlfriend. I'm completely fine with this, but I do wish I had a good friend I really could connect with on a deeper level. I would say I have lots of friends from school or work, but outside of those settings, we don't hangout because we don't have the same interests or connect on the same wavelength.",11Jul2020,1

77,"23/F I have been dating someone 24/M since about February—he’s great, we don’t have many problems, and when we do, we’re able to talk through them without becoming angry. We are very similar and tend to like a lot of the same things. It’s a pretty stable relationship and we are best friends. I love him. However, his step dad is relocating to a different state for his job and my boyfriend wants to take over the lease and have me on the lease as well, so we’d move in together. It’s close to my current job, in the general area I’d like to be, the apartment itself is cute—but the house looks awful on the outside and the housemates aren’t my favorite. It looks like a frat house from the outside and is the dingiest house on the block. The apartment is really cute and quaint. It would be the perfect space for me, my cat, and him. 

I am extremely torn about moving in with him. Right now I live with my parents, I am their only child, so they can be very protective. I know that they want what’s best for me, and I understand why they think the way they do and I know that they’re just trying to protect me from making bad decisions. I highly respect their opinion but at the same time I need to make my own decisions and if that comes with making mistakes, so be it.

I’ll start with some immediate problems:
1) He told me that if I do not sign the lease, he can’t afford anything on his own and he would have to move with his step dad to a different state and we would be over. 
2) I have some pretty overprotective parents, to the point that I withhold information about myself in fear of judgment. I know for a fact they do not want me living with a boyfriend and definitely will be very disappointed with the house and the people who live there. 
3) I’m nervous that if something doesn’t work out between us I would have to break the lease. That could mean that I have to pay the rest of the lease’s rent or something similar. Maybe not, but I’m still nervous about the repercussions. He can’t afford anything here on his own so I would fuck him over because I have my parents to fall back on while he does not. I would most likely move back into my parent’s house, meaning “they were right all along” and “that was a mistake.”
4) I have to sign the lease in the next six days, but I won’t be moving in until September. I’m under an extreme amount of pressure, with our entire relationship on my shoulders.

79,"This past week for whatever reason I’ve been super self-conscious about my friendships. I think it’s because I’ve been realizing I don’t really text my friends that much. I’m in a big group chat with them all so I’m always in contact with them, but I rarely text them all one on one while they often do. I know it’s partially my own fault for not reaching out, but I struggle with texting and finding things to talk about individually.

Today I found out that a couple of my good friends and roommates went down to our school to hang out at our house we’ll be in this year with another person in our group chat. Now to be fair, I don’t know the whole story, and there are plenty of people in the chat who didn’t go and probably weren’t invited. In fact, I’m fairly sure that one of the people who I never really became friends with in the group initiated it, and he’s good friends with my roommates.

I know they’re not obligated to invite me, but it still hurt. They’re a couple of my closest friends, and it’s made me start thinking that none of them like me, or that I’m a bad friend for not texting enough. It’s really frustrating",11Jul2020,1

problem is, they don’t know who i really am. we’ve been friends for nearly two years now. 

i grew up with a single mom and a sister who my moms ex spouse had custody of and i haven’t seen either of them in years. i was lonely and didn’t think this friendship between all of us (i think there’s 4 or 5 of us) would last long. 

so i told them i had all these siblings and two loving parents. oh, the coping mechanisms of a lonely thirteen-year-old. we know a lot about each other and tell each other all sorts of things. we talk about deep stuff. (don’t worry, we’ve video chatted and stuff. i know they’re not creeps) we plan to meet up when we’re older. 

anyhow, it’s hard to keep this all up when a lot of my feelings surround having all these siblings. i used to and sometimes still tell stories about my « siblings » and stuff. my « siblings » are real people (close friends/cousins) and include my actual sister. i know, i sound crazy. i don’t know what i was doing. 

and so i decided to tell them that my moms ex spouse is getting custody of my older sister and taking her. that actually happened, but i was way younger. i made up some things that make sense as to why a couple other « siblings » are going to go away (moving out, we only had temporary custody, etc) and now they’re giving me sympathy. i feel like a dick. 

i feel like such a fucking liar. i could come clean but i feel like they’d hate me and think i’m crazy for the stories i told. they only know my first name. when we do meet up when we’re like nineteen(we plan on going to this cool resort on the beach) they’ll have to know my last name. and if you look up my first and last name, there’s a lot of evidence that i Do Not Have All Those Siblings. 

i don’t know what to do. i don’t know how to get myself out of this situation and i feel awful for getting sympathy from these people about something that’s not even happening. i’m tempted to just leave them but that would be even more awful and i’d just miss them because i’m super close to them. i feel awful and like i’m some crazy manipulative bitch. i wish i could go back and tell my 13-year-old self not to tell them that i had all these siblings. nearly everything else they know about me is true. i know i’ll be downvoted—what i did was awful.

I would brag to my cousins that i was popular, smart (my grades were average but i was about 2 years younger than everyone so i thought i was smart). I thought i was good looking and could even become a model someday, when im taller and grow into my looks.

It took me getting properly bullied (people pointing out my flaws), realising that the people i thought were my friends going out without me and getting held back a grade (because of my age) for me to realise that many people didnt like me and found me annoying. (They looked at me like a kid- an annoying kid they just had to tolerate)

My brother is now like this (has ADHD too) and i dont want him to get hurt. What do i do?

Also, were you guys narcissistic as children?",11Jul2020,1

https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineDating/comments/hmv7nb/i_am_29f_catfished_but_i_cant_let_him_go_help/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

Last night, I confronted him as advised. Others said I should drop and leave. I missed out to mention that for months he never asked for my personal information such as full name nor social media accounts. He said there would be a time. As mentioned, he was posting a fake photo of himself. 

Upon confrontation, he told me that he will not gonna lie now and said its true. He didnt want to explain. He said the best thing is to stop talking and forget. He even said he didnt like me and such. Of course I didnt believe. A guy wont be talking to you for almost the whole day if he doesnt like me. He insisted not to push for all these cause he wasnt sure if we gonna meet. I talked about my feelings and such. I asked questions as well. After all the talks we decided not to continue. Until last good byes. We said byes many times but couldnt stop messaging. Until we talked again. This time he told me his reason. Our start was totally not good. We were calling out each other ugly and such. We insulted each other in an anonymous app. He didnt believe me as person cause of our anonymity. So he sent fake photo. He didnt expect (myself as well) that we would get attracted to each other. So when all became more than friends he has troubles to tell me. So we talked more agreed more. Then we decided to pick each other back. We would be honest this time. We talked from 7pm to 4am. Now, we decided to continue.",11Jul2020,1

108,"Hello, my girlfriend and I are going to celebrate our first anniversary in the next few days. That being said, one of my principles and agreement in our relationship is that whenever something is wrong, I'll tell, no matter how painful to hear.

So she is emotionally unstable, and her being diagnosed with depression wouldn't be surprising (but due to financial reasons, she can't consult a doctor). She has years of trauma , causing her to be deeply insecure about a lot of things. I've only learned about these facts when we are both deep in the relationship.

I always prime myself as someone who's good at supporting and listening to people. But with her, my patience is constantly tested and is ultimately affecting my mental health. We're having constant arguments about her physical and mental capacity, with her constantly belittling herself and me constantly assuring her that she's not what she thinks she is.

But I can't keep up. This isn't something that I signed up for. I feel like I'm being a therapist. 

So last night, I talked to her about my thoughts, and for a second I feel light because I've been keeping these feelings inside me for so long. Yet, there is this crawling sensation of guilt, and I now doubt if that is the right thing to do.

Did I do the right thing? And what should I do next?",11Jul2020,1

110,"Here's my situation.

Was working for my parents business for many years.

I made decent money from it, good enough to buy my own home. 

My parents decided to sell the business last year. I was not happy with it, but I got some money from it.

Afterwards, my dad had an accident, and we had to pull money together for surgery and hospital stay. I helped pay as well, but that has put me in a lot of debt now.

I have a home that I can't afford right now, I have about 40k in debt, and because of covid and my lack of a resume, it's hard to get a decent job. 

What are my options here, is it only selling my home and paying off the debt? And starting from scratch? 

I wanted to refinance, but I spoke to a couple of companies, and because my debt is high and I have no income, they can't do it...Even with a job, I would need to earn more than half my monthly debt for it to work. 

I feel very damn helpless and not sure what to do.",11Jul2020,1
111,"I am an 18 year old college drop-out. I had a full ride too, which makes this all the worse. 

Very early on, I knew I hated the formulaic ""American Dream"". I'm American, but didn't grow up in the States. I know I'm not special, just another stressed out kid. Like a lot of young adults, I was fed the idea that to ""make it"" (whatever that means) you need to go to school, get a degree, so you can live a comfortable life. Nothing new, right?

So before I could even decide what I wanted to do with my life, I was drafted into a University on the East Coast. My hopes fell little by little and so did my grades. I totally lost motivation. I didn't believe in what I was doing. I didn't care about the degree I was working towards. I didn't care about making lots of money. And I definitely didn't care what people thought of me. Well, maybe a little bit. But the fact is that I didn't buy into the idea of a society-pleasing life. 

However, I did find joy in simplicity. I loved the idea of solitude and a pressure-free life. People glorify busy-bodies and workaholics. I can't seem to figure out why. Most of these people just don't seem happy. By no means am I implying that working hard is a bad thing. It's not. I am questioning the root of it. That's when I began to read Friedrich Nietzsche and what he had to say about solitude. Nietzsche was a fan of solitude from what I could read. The principles behind solitude really resonated with me. At one point I read this:

"" Some people are so used to solitude with themselves that they never compare themselves to others but spin forth their monologue of a life in a calm, joyous mood, holding good conversations with themselves, even laughing."" -Beyond Good and Evil

It made me think. I felt as though I need to remove myself from society completely to better understand what I need and how to pierce through societies gale. I need to be stripped down to solely my physical survival, and my thoughts. I truly believe this would bring about perspective, allowing me to enter back into society with a clear head. 

So my question for you, Reddit, what are the dangers and benefits of making the choice to isolate myself, mentally and physically, from society. Is there something I missed?",11Jul2020,1

121,"I've had issues with picking my skin in the past. I had terrible, terrible, painful acne from around fifth grade up until tenth grade. I didn't take care of my face and I wasn't taught hygiene when it comes to washing your face. Because of that, as well as genetics, I got really bad acne. Even when I did take care of my face, I got bad acne. I would pick at the dry skin, I would pick at the pimples, I would pick and pop anything possible and even scrape my nails across my cheeks because they would get so dry that dead skin would come off. It sounds disgusting and it was, but I couldn't stop. Eventually my skin cleared up enough to where there wasn't a lot to pick at, so I got used to not doing it anymore. 

Now I'm picking at my scalp. I have dandruff, it's from a mix of having an oily scalp and a dry scalp. I mainly pick and scratch the area closest to my forehead that's on the top of my head. I drag my nails across it and then pick at any skin or spots that don't feel flat. I also pick at the area near my temples. When I'm about to wash my hair I take the pads of my fingers and rub my scalp vigorously because that's the only time I can do that since I'm about to wash any skin that comes out. It's not a lot that comes out, I'm forcing skin to come up that wouldn't normally because I'm picking it. I'm also doing it because it's just aggravating and itchy now. It's not always itchy, but some of the time it is so I end up picking even more. And no, I don't have lice or anything like that. All of the irritation I have is from when I started picking and making my scalp more irritated.

124,"I (21F) recently had to move back in with my parents due to my university closing from the pandemic. So now I live back at home with my parents and my older brother (23). It’s been rough moving back in after living on my own for 3 years so I’m still getting used to it. My parents are saying all the right things about the pandemic, like that people should social distance, wear a mask, and travel only when necessary. When they go out to the grocery or to work they follow by those rules. That’s great! 

My problem is, they are making an exception for my brother’s girlfriend to come up from Florida to stay with us for a month. I’m not comfortable with that at all, especially since Florida is a hot spot for the virus right now. I go back to school in about a month and I don’t want to potentially get the virus(I have very weak lungs so it’s something I fear greatly),or become a carrier right before I’m supposed to go into my final semester of university. 

I have tried bringing it up with my parents that it’s not safe, it’s not a smart move, and that I’m extremely uncomfortable with it, but I keep getting my thoughts and feelings blown off.

125,"We have 2 cats, both around 4 years old. One of them prefers to chill indoors, but the other LOVES to go outside. As in, he will stand at the door and shout until we let him out. Until recently, we would always just let him out and he would go outside. But I feel like this is not healthy, for the cat and for the environment.

Firstly, he is not up to date on vaccinations or medications. My mom claims they're too expensive and that they're not necessary. We've been lucky so far, no ticks or fleas or anything, but it can't be safe to let him just roam around. Rabies? Feline HIV?

Second, he catches animals. Lots of lizards, birds, and mice. I have shown my mom articles about how cats are threatening many species, how many have already been driven to extinction, but she blocks it all out. She uses the old ""letting one cat out won't change anything, so it's fine"" excuse. And yes, he did recently bring back a rat and a bird. In one week. And I'm sure he doesn't bring everything he kills back.

Finally, I want my cats to have LONG, happy lives. I've shown her articles about how outdoor cats lead significantly shorter lives (like an average of 5 instead of 20) on average, but she claims he's happier outdoors so it's good for him mental health wise. I feel like this is an empty excuse though because she hasn't supported my clinically diagnosed depression at all, and has claimed multiple times it's not a real problem.

I've been training him to go outside with a harness and leash, but it's a slow process and he's not super excited about it. In the mean time, she still will NOT STOP letting him out right now because she finds his complaints annoying. How would you guys deal with these issues?

130,"I've always been a pretty empathetic individual, but prior to this year I had a pretty good grasp on drawing emotional boundaries &amp; not letting things get to me. I always knew that malice &amp; ignorance abounded in the world, but I was able to throw my energy into causes that helped instead of focusing on the negative. I believed the world was becoming more progressive and we were slowly but surely getting better.

But the past few months have absolutely worn me down. I live in a southern US state where COVID is spiking and safety measures aren't taken seriously by the public. Our governor is useless and keeps pushing for the opening of businesses despite record high numbers every day. People I know (and some I used to call friends) are eager to adopt conspiracy theories over scientific consensus. (My own mother thinks Fauci is up to something.) 

I even started arguing with people online when they spread misinformation- which I previously NEVER did out of principle- but now I'm thinking, what's the point? People will still plug their ears to the truth. The arrogance of some people to look at science &amp; expert opinion and reject it is just... baffling to me. People are dying, and some armchair experts think it's all just the political left trying to infringe on civil liberty. 

Then the BLM movement happened, and I emphatically and vocally support it 100%... but seeing people express their racism so openly and unabashedly opened my eyes to how far we still have to go. White supremacy is alive and well in the US. I guess I was hoping we were better by now.

And don't even get me started on our political arena. I've lost all faith in our current administration. There is no justice for the rich and powerful; their pockets are too cushioned to face legal action. I'm terrified for November and waking up Nov 4th to find four more years of this same bullshit. I'm a little hopeful given our recent polls, but very cautious and exhausted.

Social media infiltrating my headspace is probably to blame... but so is the news, even unbiased sources. And even if I get off the internet, there are still awful people running around without repercussions. Curating my own echo chamber doesn't change how much ignorance and corruption exists out there. 

And I can't fix it. I feel like the weight of all the suffering and injustice in the world is just smothering &amp; suffocating me. It's a constant sinking feeling in my chest. I've become so bitter, cynical, and negative over the past few months.

I used to draw and write for fun, but my energy has been totally zapped. All I want to do is lay in bed all day and watch TV and avoid thinking. I wish I could go on a morphine drip until 2021. 

And to reassure- I'm not suicidal or in danger of harming myself.  I have been diagnosed with depression/anxiety in the past- have been to therapy (though I'm not currently seeing anyone) and take Zoloft daily. And I'm sure I'm not alone in this- I know the public's general mental health has been low this year due to all the above reasons. 

How do I move forward? I feel like a shell of myself: just constantly enraged and sad. Nothing brings me joy these days. I'm getting less and less hopeful every day for meaningful change. 

But choosing to ignore these issues for my the sake of my own mental health feels irresponsible- there are people who don't have the privilege of being able to ""turn off"" injustice &amp; oppression in their own lives. Maybe the scales only recently fell off my eyes, but I can't go back to pretending the world is okay. This reality is crushing, but I don't know how to cope with it.

134,"Dedication to self-improvement is pretty central to my personality. My friend, on the other hand, is less motivated. They complain a lot about being socially awkward and passion-less, but claim they don’t have the energy to actually work to be a better person. It frustrates me to bear the burden of their complaining, but get ignored whenever I offer advice.

Of course, I think part of this is due to their insecurity. I’ve tried to be more empathetic and compassionate lately. I can’t expect everyone to be full of motivation, especially since my friend and I are still pretty young—we’re both about to head off to college. I know it’s normal to not have self-discipline at this age... wish they didn’t complain so much though, but the point of friends is also to listen to someone else rant, right?

Now, I’ve been laying off on giving advice because they get defensive and unresponsive. I understand that sometimes, when ranting, it’s nice to have someone who just listens instead of tries to solve your problem. I’ve been doing this for weeks now—Not giving advice, but just going “ah” and “it’s okay” and so on. 

However, now I’m wondering if this is the right course of action. Would I be a better friend if I gave them some “tough love”? If I was more transparent on what frustrates me about them, more involved in helping them improve, and ultimately much harsher? Like how my parents signed me up for swimming lessons, which I hated at the time, but ultimately benefitted from later... although this analogy isn’t perfect. But is it arrogant for me to assume what would benefit them?

Further, would that kind of bluntness drive them even further into insecurity, and cause them to feel even less willing to take action and change? And is it even my role as their friend? Or are parents supposed to be the pushers?

TLDR - My friend complains a lot about their work ethic and social awkwardness, but is unwilling to actively work on bettering themselves. Should I give them some tough love and push them? What’s the best approach?",11Jul2020,1

He then comes in and holds out a watch and gives it to me. At the time I was really surprised and thanked him with a hug. He said ""God Bless You Son"" and went on his way.

Fast forward a day or two later and he calls the store again looking for me. My manager was on the phone and I wasn't working at the time, so no information could be exchanged due to the respect of privacy and common sense.

Well i think the main reason i got turned off is she's not active enough to touch me, and when i grab her hand and put it to my little bro, she pinch it and it hurts like hell, i told her the last time she did it and i think she's afraid and doesn't even touch me anymore. The next part is I'm too focused on making her feeling good, that i forget about myself.

She don't want to do oral, and won't let me oral her either. Idk if that's matter but i think it would help both of us at least ?

I ask her whether she's feeling forced or not comfortable she said no, she told me she just lose the desire in the middle of foreplay. She said she wants it too but the feeling just kinda go poof disappeared.

I wanted to discuss it more with her but she's too shy and don't want to talk about it. I can't fix the problem bcs idk what's went wrong from hee side, i ask her how she wants to be touch, she told me a few things but I'm sure she's still holding back bcs she's too shy.

138,"tldr: me and my significant other are growing more distant from each other and i'm finding some of his traits more irritating than before.

sorry for the bad formatting and messy listing, i'm on mobile and really stressed out lmao.

posted on here before on another account (deleted the post), but now i'm really and truly having doubts about my first relationship.

this is a relatively long story but i'll try and shorten it as much as possible.

at first, it went really well: we were both invested in the relationship and even joked about our futures being intertwined, ""destinies"" and such (i know, very cliché but we really do love each other)

ever since maybe april or may, we've grown a lot more distant from each other. i've been thinking more about our relationship.

originally, i was having my doubts about practicality. i was wondering if i was really ready to be in a relationship. this worry still remains, but another worry has been piled on.

our text conversations have become much shorter and much less engaging. we've become more passive-aggressive towards each other, and sometimes it feels like i'm having to drag out conversations or keep it engaged.

occasionally he'll send insults as a way to be humorous and follow it up with ""heh luv u tho"" but often times it'll be a bit hurtful, even when i know it isn't malicious in intent. i jokingly confronted him about this, and he responded with a short paragraph saying that if i ""take things further than surface level, then idk what to tell you""

sometimes i'll crack a joke to break the awkward barrage of smiley faces we send each other, and he'll just say something like: 

""not funny""

and i'll respond with ""come onnn i'm trying""

and he'll say ""no you aren't""

admittedly, texting has been feeling more like a chore or a responsibility. sometimes i won't know what to say so i'll send some half-assed smiley face or emoticon (which is my bad).

the other week i didn't know how to respond to something he sent, so i just cracked a joke. he responded like the following (verbatim):

""quite odd to think that your attempts at “engaging” me could still hold up regardless of every other circumstance, but that’s just my opinion. perhaps if it was under a specifically different context, that joke would have been much more engaging as you would say and much less irritating.""

i tried to discuss with him about our conversations becoming more dragged out a month ago  but he said that he feels that i'm ""less present"" in our conversations. that's my bad, i'll admit, and i told him i'll try to work on that. for a while, i tried to be more engaging, start conversations on meaningful topics. and for a while, all was well! we got along much better, and i was regaining hope.

but sometimes, when i do try to be engaging, it feels as if he dismisses it. it feels like sometimes he's tense in our conversations. he'll send distant paragraphs where it feels like he pulled out a thesaurus just to send that feel disingenuous (like the quote above). i don't know what to do. i've been unable to get this out of my mind the entire day. 

am i doing something wrong?

this is my first relationship, so i don't have any experience whatsoever. i'm feeling confused, and it feels like these thoughts are interfering with my daily life. i really care about him, and i know he cares about me. but i don't know what to do.

i can't talk about this with anyone else. no one knows about our relationship.",11Jul2020,1
139,"As the title says, my dad refuses to set a time for us to do things together. Sorry about formatting blah blah. 

My dad has a type A personality and is constantly moving. He lives by a code of conduct that requires him to be productive at all times and he over romanticizes burnout and exhaustion. He stretches himself thin, and, I believe he has undiagnosed anxiety based on how he responds to stress (he’s usually patient, but when he’s stressed he becomes extremely volatile, and sometimes violent). 

When we’re supposed to sit down and talk about something, the most he will agree to is “Friday, sometime in the afternoon”.  He has repeatedly scheduled things with me at the same general time as other things, so the thing he planned with me ends up being an after thought and gets cut shorter and shorter. 

I’ve tried asking him but he says “if I promise you I’ll do something at a certain time, and then I can’t you’ll get mad at me.” And then cites times when I was 5-12 years old when I was disappointed with him for not following through. 

It really hurts my feelings that he doesn’t prioritize activities with his family, even important things like discussing vacation details or paperwork. It makes me feel like he doesn’t value my time. I often end up sitting there, waiting for him to finally follow through even on Saturday nights when I could have made plans but I have to block out the entire afternoons for whenever he dains to be ready to do what he says he’ll do. 

Yesterday we we’re supposed to discuss our plans for vacation at the end of summer. We were supposed to meet “for lunch” so I waited at their house at noon. At 2 pm they still hadn’t text or called me, even though I called him twice. He kept giving me “we just have to run one more errand”. So I left. At 5 pm they finally text me and asked where I was. 

How do I approach this? He gets defensive when I bring it up and is so stubborn",11Jul2020,1

145,"I work as a lifeguard for a private pool company and I was at a pool today single guarding. It was my first and only time at this pool, as I was subbing for someone. In the last two hours, I had a group of 5-8 guys in their twenties come to the pool and they started 'roughhousing' - for lack of a better word. They were tackling each other and wrestling on the deck, pushing and throwing each other into the pool, jumping onto each other's heads, pinning each other in chokeholds etc. 

I repeatedly told them to stop and threatened to kick them out, then told them to leave the pool, but they would not listen to me AT ALL. They claimed that this was normal at this pool (which it might be but it seemed very dangerous and I didn't want to be liable for any accidents) and that they were adults so they could do what they wanted. I am 5'2, white (this is relevant), female, and look way younger than I am, so they were not taking me seriously. I ended up having leave them be for the most part, and try to get them to stop every 10 minutes or so.

I have been lifeguarding for 6+ years and have never had people refuse to follow rules like that, and while that might be normal at that pool, I am sure it is unsafe in any case. I don't really know if I overreacted about their rule breaking, but the real issue is that they started saying that I was telling them to stop because of their race and that I was essentially being racist. (I wasn't: I can assure you that I would have told anyone not to jump on other people's heads.) They then said they would report me for it.

* I used to live overseas country with my parents and I've recently moved back to my home country. 
* My uncle (on my mother's side) raped my sister. She was around 7 or 8 at the time. This happened a while ago and was revealed many years after it happened.

When my parents found out about the rape, most of my family cut ties with that uncle, and my grandad and parents kicked him out of my grandparents' house. My grandma blamed my dad for ruining the family and getting my uncle kicked out. 

After my grandad died, my grandma started bringing him back into the family and supporting him financially, he eventually moved back in. Because of this, my family and some extended family distanced ourselves from her as well.

Its little comments that don't fit in with what we're talking about at the dinner table. I don't want to get into an argument, because he's stuck in his ways and nothing will come of it. Also, as mentioned, he's letting me live in his house for free.

150,"I’m (F28) using a throwaway and for confidentiality purposes, going to alter some of the details (names). I am hoping one of you kind souls can offer some guidance on how to best support my dope, amazing, beautiful partner, Leila (F25)

First off, we are both women (28 and 25) and have plans to spend the rest of our life
together. We want to do life together... but the impact of her childhood trauma is something that can’t go unaddressed. 

The other night, Leila shared something that she has never shared with another living soul— for several years, her older STEP brother CJ sexually abused her. She thinks the abuse started around age 10 (CJ WAS 16) and it lasted for several years (until CJ was 18 or 19) It may have started earlier than that. Since confiding me, more memories and details of the abuse have began surfacing. Leila has never considered therapy and her admission came after I opened up about a sexual assault that happened to me years back. 

I love this woman with my whole heart— I told her how brave, how strong, and how loved she is by me. I reassured her that I am not going anywhere and that I am always on her team and in her corner. She is not broken, or dirty, or messed up— we both cried and have been crying on and off since when it comes up. We also laugh a lot too, but the tears do sometimes come when the conversations turn heavy. 

She told me yesterday (the topic has come up a few times since she first told me— I try not to pry for details because I don’t want to re traumatize her) that she is considering writing a letter to her sister (she doesn’t think her sister was also sexually abused but can’t say for sure). She said it off hand, like, “so I think I might tell Sasha what happened, but in a letter. I can’t do it face to face and I can’t do it over the phone. I don’t want everyone to look at me differently for the rest of my life though...” I was supportive, but didn’t want to push. I feel like her control was robbed from her as a child, and I want this road to recovery to be one that she carves for herself. 

I need help. I have been reading, researching, and I will admit— I stalked CJ on social media a bit. I arranged to meet with a therapist (for myself) in order to get more help/guidance supporting Leila... but I think Leila would also greatly benefit from therapy. I can’t force that, so how do I help her see the benefits of going? She is never been and doesn’t think she is there. IS it beneficial? What type of therapy works best when it comes to child sexual abuse? She is best friends with her mom and tells her mom EVERYTHING— but she doesn’t think she can ever tell her mom about this. She has kept this secret for so long. She has lived in a prison of shame and secrecy for about 15 years. I cry thinking about the things he did and the way he acted afterwards. Ugh. My stomach is in knots writing this. 

Her mom is no longer with Leila’s stepdad (they separated when Leila was in college) but they all remain in contact and still see one another every so often. Leila and I will be seeing CJ in a few months at a wedding (it will be my first time in his company). I am at a loss here. I want this predator in prison. The abuse occurred in a southern state... and according to the statute of limitations, the dude could go away for a long time. Leila doesn’t want to walk down that path though, which I have to respect. He and his wife are pregnant with their first child. 

Please, weigh in if you can. Any advice (or constructive criticism) is so appreciated. Thank you!",11Jul2020,1
151,"So today I went on a day trip with a new friend to a beach town. I drove to her house which was 45 min away and then drove to the place we were going which was like 1hr 40 min away.

While in the city we visited all she really wanted to do was go to very basic stores that doesn’t have in her town (like target &amp; home goods).

He moved back here about a year and a half ago, and he wanted to hang out at that time. I was pretty excited about it but then the closer it got the more anxious I became so I ran, more or less and just never texted him. Up until a week ago I hadn't talked to him since, but I did apologize for all that and he told me he was the same way so he understood. I do better with hanging out and making plans when it's spur of the moment, the farther away it is the more time I have to consider bolting.   


He was excited to hear from me and vice versa, he asked to hang out twice but it was my dad's birthday and then I had to finish up homework both times he asked. I suggested a different day and we we're both thrilled and talked about what we were going to do, etc...That was last Saturday, then on Sunday I replied to a text from the night before and I just get 'lol.' Monday, I realized we hadn't said where we would meet so I text and ask him if he was still up for hanging out and where he wanted to meet but he never responded. It's been almost a week now since and I still haven't heard anything, and he hasn't been online anywhere at all.

I'm getting worried. I'm not sure if he felt really anxious like I did and bolted or if something is up. I was going to just wait and see if he texts me but I keep getting more and more concerned. I'm not sure if I should just wait this out and see what happens or just send him a short text that says something like ""sorry we weren't able to hang out, hope you're okay.""

Basically I do computer science in DCU (Ireland) and it's pretty hard and I am not the best at it. My interest has fleeted but I am still pretty interested in some aspects such as networking.

In secondary school I did art class and I really miss it and I kind of wish I pursued it more, I miss expressing myself and creating for others even more. I can't just do art for myself. I'm afraid it might be too late for me to change as I would have to wait until next October if I was to change. On the other hand I think I might just be discouraged because of my disappointing performance in my first year of computer science as most of it was completely new to me.

To sum it up, should I consider basically wasting a year and restarting college doing something art related (or even english related) or do another year of computer science and see how it goes. Opinions are greatly appreciated :)

161,"TL;DR my sister's dog has severe separation anxiety and I don't know what to do anymore

So some backstory. I'm a 27 year old man who works a basic 40 hour week. I live in a trailer out in the sticks. I live with 5 dogs, one of which is my sister's dog, we'll call him Brock. 

So my sister got Brock as a puppy about 5 years ago, he's a pyranees/retriever(?) Mix. The only time I would see Brock once she got him was a couple of years after. He was covered in fleas, malnourished and high energy and hard to handle. We could see his ribs. In the weekend he stayed with us we were able to make him look fuller and healthy.
A year later my sister and I were sort of kind of ""roommates"" and I realized how hard to handle Brock is. He has some major separation anxiety. 
My sister is a bit of a ""free-spirit"" kind of person. She liked to party and hang out with friends. She didn't really have the commitment level needed for raising a dog in the first place, and I understood the first week of living with my sister and her dog how Brock's upbringing must have been.
He teared apart my sister's stuff, DESTROYED two kennels, and would howl and holler when my sister was gone. It was pretty insane.
My sister ultimately abandoned him with our parents. I was living with them a couple of years ago and felt like Brock had bonded with me and my pack, my first dog and her son, so I decided to adopt him when I moved into the trailer I currently live.
It took a moment for everyone to adjust. It became quickly apparent how debilitating Brock's symptoms were.
 He tore stuff up when he was bored. I fixed that with making sure there were plenty of toys for all the dogs. He doesn't like to be handled. He stiffens up when you touch him and he'll flinch sometimes. He'll growl if you try to grab him and he squirms way too well for a dog. He has trouble listening to commands. I had to drag him back into the house a couple of times so I could go to work all while he's snarling, squirming and clawing and biting me. 
Then, there are his episodes. He gets these random anxiety episodes where he does nothing but shiver and pant. I've tried comforting him, I've tried ignoring him. He makes it hard for me to sleep cause he turns my bed into a massage mattress. 
It was real bad this fourth of July. I live out in the country, so guns and fireworks the whole week leading up to the 4th. He still anticipates the booms to this day and begins to stress out even if nothing has happened.
We've tried an anxiety shirt and Trazadone, but his anxiety powers through and I'm just about at my limit with this dog.
He's a fun and goofy dog, but his problems make it hard to want to deal with him. Especially when I have 4 other dogs I need to take care of and none of them have behavior problems. 
I feel like shit for even thinking about abandoning this poor dog, but I don't know what to do. My biggest worry is surrendering him to a shelter. I would just make his problems worse and if he's too much for the next person I'm sure he'll be put down. So if that's his ultimate fate, wouldn't it be best for me to be the one who does it? Or should I go ahead and see if there IS a better chance for him and let him be someone else's problem?",11Jul2020,1

The title says it all. I know a couple (well call him Jack and her Jill) who have been married a couple years and have 4 kids together, all under 5. I've known Jack since we were kids, and met Jill when he introduced us when they started dating. 
Jack has a history of abuse. Not going into too much detail there. 
Jill has confided in me several times that hes hit her. Shes wanted to leave him for awhile but he would gaslight her and tell her she had nowhere to go, as he had ruined all her relationships with her family. I'm seen as a ""safe"" friend bc I've known Jack for so long. 
Jack has also cheated on Jill at least twice in the relationship. While that was at least two years ago, lately hes been hinting to Jill that shes ugly and not his type. He hasn't physically cheated recently, but he continues to message other women. 
My husband and I just moved into our own place. As usually happens, Jill called me in tears about what had happened tonight. I told her that now that I have my own place, she and the kids are always welcome here, I can watch the kids while she works, and we have the extra space in the house for them. I've been telling her for at least a year that she needs to leave Jack, but she always goes back and since I didnt have the means to help her, I was powerless to help. 
She just told me shes going to stay with him for the kids' sake. I know this is a bad idea, and i tried explaining to her that her kids are going to grow up and see how shes treated by her husband, and think that's okay. But she still doesnt get it. How else can I help?",11Jul2020,1
165,"So I’ve been really into this girl since about May and in the past few weeks I’ve fallen in love (cheesy gross I know). I constantly think about her and look at pics of her and have been texting her nonstop nearly for 2 weeks and would text her before that too though not as much as now. We hang out pretty often, couple times a month in a group of friends we have. THE CATCH TO ALL THIS: well she’s about a year and  half older than me ( I am 18 turning 19 in December, she’s 20 turning 21 in March) we have been friends for over a year now and she jokes a lot about how I’m a child and how young i am. Obviously it’s just teasing but I can’t help but see this is a major obstacle. I get the feeling she thinks of me more as a little brother or something rather than a possible romantic interest. The other major issue is her inexperience with boys in her life. I don’t think she’s ever had a boyfriend and has probably only kissed a few guys in her life. I do subtle compliments and flirting but she seems to think I’m joking most of the time or something like that. I am really good friends with her and don’t want anything to get ruined but I like her too much to not try, so I’ve been planning on asking her on a date soon but don’t know if this is the right way to go at it.

166,"Let me start by saying I’m the “advice person” in my family and friend circles, but my sister and I have been talking about this for a while and I’m not sure what to do. 

Backstory:
My (25M) father cheated on my mom when I was 4 (my sister, 23F, was 2) and left my mom to marry my now stepmom. My mom let him have every other weekend custody (in exchange for child support that was literally never paid as my dad is a serial-unemployment get-rich-quick sort of person) and we did that until the begining of high school. The relationship has always been tenuous as my step-brother is the same age my sister and was always favored and pampered above both of us (including when we all shared a room on the weekends and we had to sleep on the floor). I could seriously go on for pages about how he had constantly chosen my stepbrother and stepmom’s wishes over my sister and I. So we sort of split ways and have been cordial but not really engaged, we haven’t talked to him since September when he decided move across the country (on my birthday). 

My sister and I were happy with the separation as it was sort of physically how it always felt inside, but my sister just had her first kid, and my dad and stepmom want to re-inject themselves into my sister (and also consequently my life). We both have never told them both how they feel (they are not what you would call the most emotionally mature or stable people) and we’ve never wanted to rock the boat, we’d rather have them just fade away. 

Them trying to capitalize on grandparent-hood when they were never really parents to us to begin with has left us both really annoyed but like they maybe finally care, and my sisters husband has said that he doesn’t want the toxic relationship (and people) to be around his daughter. 

(Side note he has also been reaching out to me and wanting me to come visit them in BFE, all really since the baby announcement) 

I feel like this is my dad trying to make up for all the fuck-ups he’s made in the last 21 years, but neither of us are sure that we want to let them back in, what should we do? Is it worth letting them back in? Can we break things off without being mean? Is cutting people off (esp your biological parents) okay? 

Thanks in advance for any advice y’all might have.",11Jul2020,1
167,"Hello!  I hope I am doing this reddit thing correctly.  

As anyone would, I am taking to the internet to hopefully get some solid advice.  Hit me with your best shot lol. 

Here is the situation:

I graduated in December of 2019, and started a great job in January of 2020.  I was thriving in my role until I was laid off in March of 2020 due to COVID-19.  Through a series of legislative oversights (a subject for a different day) I was denied unemployment and PUA.  My fiancee graduated in May of 2020, and is applying for jobs but has not yet gotten any interviews.

We have both wanted to move out of our area our whole lives, and no one in my family has EVER left our area (South Jersey).  

I have a job opportunity with a large company in my field in Charlotte, NC.  The role is what I was doing prior to my layoff, but with a much larger company that has not had any layoffs at the office I would be working out of.  My fiancee has been actively applying for roles, but has not yet received any interviews as of yet.  We are visiting Charlotte next week to see if it is somewhere we could genuinely see ourselves living there.  

This is where I get to asking if I am a small stupid idiot quickly heading to my doom...

My family is extremely against the move.  They cite COVID as their main concern.  ""The economy is in shambles and things seem to get more uncertain with each day that passes.""  What's to say I wouldn't get laid off a month after arriving in Charlotte??  Plus - why would I move for a role I could likely get in my area and save money while living with my parents (we won't live together before getting married).  AND my fiancee hasn't even gotten an interview yet.  We should stay close to home where we can live for free and try to apply for jobs and maybe if we both get career jobs then we can move..but to move when only one of us has an ""actual, salaried"" job seems like a quick trip to chaos.  That's my family's perspective.

To provide some further insight into our situation:

We have 22k saved.  After moving and paying for our wedding we would have around 5k in the bank - that's if no one helps pay for the wedding (which may be the case) and no one gives us a single wedding gift (which I doubt would happen).  

Are we total, complete, idiots for leaving everything we know to move to a city for my entry level job?  I know people move every day and move just for the experience, but is it a huge mistake to move in the midst of such economic turmoil?  I have budgeted so that we would pay our bills and have ends meet even if we were making $14/hour (I figured Target is paying $15/hour now, but just to be safe), but I get scared due to the points my family makes.

Is anyone in a similar situation?  I know people make larger leaps of faith to varying results, but COVID and its economic effects are a major factor. 

I feel frustrated by COVID and scared by the risks, but this is the time I am on Earth and want to get on with my life and marriage.  Is this short sighted?

I sincerely appreciate anyone who took the time to read this post, let alone respond.

Thank you so so much.",11Jul2020,1

169,"Hey, I'm 23(m), and I have social anxiety. Overall I'm definitely more introverted, being social just feels physically and mentally exhausting. My childhood was kinda rough, through elementary school I was relentlessly bullied. I was easy to pick on, I always gave the bullies the reactions they wanted, and it was a thing through all of elementary. Junior high was way better, but most people still weren't too thrilled to have me around. 

My social life in high school was significantly better, but after the first year, I got diagnosed with a crohn's disease, and I did schooling from home for the remainder of high school. I started talking to a therapist and psychiatrist, and my official diagnoses were ADHD, minor PTSD, treatment resistant depression, and generalized anxiety disorder. I generally stay at home because thats what I can afford. Infusions are pretty much where all the money goes, and I havent really been able to afford therapy as of late.

My childhood depresses the hell out of me, but I know my 20s wont be any different if thing's dont change. My biggest problem in life (aside from illness &amp; ) is that I only know how to isolate myself from my problems (guess thats convenient enough for a pandemic). I just feel like when I'm in a social setting that everyone is watching me, talking about me, waiting for the moment to laugh.

171,"I feel like when you're in someone's house you should be respectful of their ways and try to mess up their place. I'm a little particular about some things but I think they're pretty standard to be a clean human being? For example; some things my bf often do that really bothers me are:

&amp;#x200B;

* Throwing wet towels straight into the laundry bin instead of hanging it up (he says because he's done using it) I've asked him multiple times to hang it up anyways because that's how mold will grow and he'll ruin a good towel- MY towel

&amp;#x200B;

* Being messy when cooking and not wiping it up (My apartment is old and has a problem with cockroaches so ofc I wanna keep it clean at all times)

&amp;#x200B;

* Putting clean utensils straight on the kitchen counter and sink (Again, with the cockroaches and the fhecking mess he makes why would you put CLEAN utensils on dirty surfaces??)

&amp;#x200B;

* Stepping on my futon (People who are okay with bed stepping are people who have sold their soul for bitcoins and have no empathy)

&amp;#x200B;

* Throwing the wrong trash into the wrong recycle bin. THIS can get so ridiculous he puts burnable trash and paper and plastic all in the obviously cartons bin-?? He's the Japanese one here he should know it better than I do!?? I have to pick up and reorganise the trash after I come home from work. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another reason that it bothers me even more now that usual because I've recently got a 9-5 job + work on half the Saturdays of the year and I rarely have time for myself- let alone to clean my house as often as I'd like to. Having to clean up after him in addition to everything is just so infuriating to me when I'm struggling to find time to update my comic for my paying patrons.

I've told him not to do these things and even gave him the reasoning behind it, but he always forgets; which results in me having to tell him the same things again and again. He hates it and says that I'm noisy but it's only these few things I'm always HAVING to repeat to him and I wouldn't have to fhecking repeat it all the time if he LISTENS- am I wrOnG??? I hate it even more having to repeat myself over and over again- it's my pet peeve that drives me crazy.

I try my best to hold it in and be calm but we had a fight the last time he came over again and repeated ALL of those things.  I really hate getting mad/ arguing; my brain shuts down and it really messes with my mental health. I like hanging out with him when he comes over so if it's possible I don't want to ask him to stop coming over. 

I haven't spoken to him in two days to get me some me time. For now I have placed a clean cloth on the kitchen counter so there will be no chances for utensils to touch bare counter surfaces. What else can I do preferably not advices about 'talking to him about it' because I have over-talked to him about it at this point. 

If you think I'm a crazy neat freak- well maybe I am just try to be nice because I am also a fragile babey",11Jul2020,1

I’m a guy who finds the little gestures, such as hand holding, hugging, and lying down together, as intimate.

I even went on to talk to her to tell her that my friend did nothing wrong, and they should not break up over the issue. Last night though, I had a dream where I was supposed to meet my friend and his girlfriend for lunch, but my friend did not show up, so it was me and his girlfriend only. When she arrived alone, she instantly held my hand and asked for a table. I wont continue the dream, but it was not sexual at all. I was just so happy in the dream, because honestly I wish I have a person to do these simple things with, like hand holding and having late night talks. Now, I feel kind of bad that I had this dream about my friend’s girlfriend. Its as if I want to be with her, which I really don’t. I just want to have this bond with someone I love.

For reference, I live in a flyover state. So finding a therapist who would A) accept my insurance and B) accept adult patients was like finding a needle in a haystack. I found one who I called and didn't hear back from for a while. Only to then be told that they only do sessions over the phone. And considering my rocky family life is the reason for like 99% of my issues, that was a dealbreaker and I had to decline because there would be no way I could ensure any privacy at home for a phone session.

But they were the only one I was able to find until I broadened my search through my insurance provider's website and found only one other therapist that meets my criteria but their practice is about a 2 hour drive away. However, I decided it was worth the compromise and gave them a call too. Only to get an automated message asking to leave a voicemail, which I did, and haven't heard back from them for well over a week now.

I feel really disheartened by this. Literally all I say in these messages is ""Hi, my name is (name) and I'm calling to see about scheduling an appointment. Please call me back at (number). Thank you."" So Idk what I'm doing wrong. Is my personality really that repulsive where even just a phone call, that is spoken in the most robotic manner possible, gets me rejected? Or do they really not give a shit even though they claim to be taking new patients? And if so, what does that say about how they practice their therapy if they can't even care about helping someone who needs it?

Like... What am I even supposed to do here? Just show up during business hours and hope for the best? I'm at a loss here.",11Jul2020,1

180,"I graduated last June. I’ve been doing service industry jobs in the meantime trying to figure out what the hell to do next. I don’t know what do do next and I feel like the world is leaving me behind. Everybody says it’s okay to not know what to do but I am literally paralyzed and have been in this loop since June last year. 

Some background information, the type of life I think I want is photographer working for myself, with the freedom to go anywhere. I see so many people doing this so I know it isn’t impossible. It’s just felt impossible to me. I have no mentors, no family willing to guide me. My parents are strict and it’s college or nothing, and I thought I could get by without their support but this past year, all I’ve been doing is flailing and freaking out for feeling behind and paralyzed. 

It’s like, I know that art as a career is the riskiest (and some may say dumb, which I understand) thing to do, but I’m not sure I can deal with my parents breathing down my neck for the rest of my life if I don’t immediately make their ROI if I did get a film degree or something. I also don’t think I can put myself through school to get a certification or a bachelors for no reason. It feels so pointless, there are so many ways people are making money without degrees or not even using their degree, and I missed my chance for a full ride scholarship at my city’s university, which, before making the decision college wasn’t for me ( summer before sophomore year), would’ve been the plan. Honestly, the plan the whole time since elementary was to go to the best school in the state and become a doctor. There was no wiggle room. I was just gonna do what made the most money and what my parents would be the happiest about. Then they’d be able to go to their friends and talk about how proud they were of me and I’d be happy because I’d finally feel like I was getting the approval I needed from them, that they’d hold back unless I performed to their standard. For context, I was straight As in elementary, middle school, and freshman year. I always said I did it for myself, but I was only doing it because it would ultimately please them. 

Then, some things happened that year and I happened upon a lot of info and I saw so many people living lives working online, making a living from photography or something creative, just not a typical desk job or 9-5. I wanted that. I wanted the freedom to go anywhere and do anything. So I researched so much about how to become a photographer and then I was set on that. Then my new thing became digital nomad lifestyle, because I wanted to be able to work from anywhere. If other people are doing it, why can’t I? So the last 3 years of HS I told myself I’d figure it out as I went and it’ll be okay, I can get a working holiday in New Zealand or Australia and just live and see how things go, even if I don’t have a stable or high income.

Fast forward to graduating last summer, I’ve been doing that, but my parents have given me no choice. It’s college, or fail at life, stay at home, we’re not gonna help you do whatever the hell you’re trying to do, you’re on your own. Which I completely understand. Who wants their kid to be doing nothing?i know it comes from a place of love and them wanting me to do well, and also maybe just not understanding how things have changed since they were young.

And it’s not like I’m TRYING to give myself a hard time. Like, I could easily just do what they’re telling me to do, grab a bachelors and just be a teacher or something. I don’t even hate that, I love kids. I could do that. I could also just go get an associates if I’m REALLY in a rush, and grab a radiology technician job or dental hygienist job. Those pay like $50-$60K! That’s fine! Literally I can do any of these things, my parents would get the F off of my back, and I can finally get a dog and cat and just walk them in the neighborhood with a house that I buy within a few years time at my new job and I’ll live happily ever after.

But I just can’t!!! I can’t. I can’t do it because I KNOW theres so much more out there and I refuse to settle for anything less than, cliche as it sounds, a life I’m proud of, and will be proud to show the generations that follow me that they can do the same. That they CAN have a job they enjoy and make enough to have the house and dog and cat. Not that I want a house immediately, but yeah.

But I just feel so paralyzed. Not going to school and getting a degree is so risky, and I’m the least risky person out there. I was willing to go through medical school for Christ’s sake and I was comfortable and used to the structure that gave me—get good grades, get scholarship, get good job. There’s order. I know what the next step is. But not going to school, not doing what people are telling me to do has so much open space. There’s so much room to mess up and not know what’s coming next. There’s so much room to fail and the unknown and people not getting what you’re trying to do and things not going right. If I went a became a pediatrician, or even a therapist/social worker, which I always say would be my alternate reality if I did go, 
at least I’d know what to do if I didn’t pass the bar or final certification exam or whatever test it is! At least I’d KNOW that all I have to do is study harder and I’ll eventually pass and get my license and then I can practice and just live a life w/ a routine and get my f-ing (don’t know if we can cuss here) dog!

So I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to make this too long, I know it’s long enough as is. I’ve just been flailing, aggressively, for the past year and my head is running in circles, and it just feels so much easier to just collapse under my parents and family’s expectations and just do what they want me to do. It’s just so difficult for me to justify. If I go, we’ll probably have to take out loans, and my heart isn’t even completely in it. If I go, I’ll be in the classes not knowing what the hell im doing it for. And I know it sounds like  obviously then the clear answer is to just go be an art person and follow my dreams or whatever but it’s really not, because I don’t know how to do that. Especially with COVID right now, what is a freelancer supposed to do with that?

I just need a neutral perspective, What does this look like from the outside. I’ve been in this headspace for a year now and I feel like I’m going nowhere. I don’t know who to ask for help and my parents will just tell me to go. They’re willing to pay for an art degree anyway, they’re just desperate for me to go at all. Please help 

TL;DR I don’t know what to do with my life— college or no college, but I feel like college (an art degree) will either be a waste of money or if I get a teaching degree or medical degree my heart wouldn’t be in it. If I continue without college, I will continue to flail and freak out and be paralyzed, please help",11Jul2020,1

184,"Hi everyone, 

&amp;#x200B;

I was planning to move to Atlanta this coming August as my girlfriend would be returning to college there. Her school has previously announced that they would be returning to in-person classes and opening the campus, however, Atlanta has started to rollback their opening process and the school said there is a possibility that they will not reopen. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have found a lease in a very good location for really cheap ($550/month) and while I want to commit to the lease, the possibility of campus not reopening would mean she would stay home and I would have a lease in Atlanta for no reason.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm torn between waiting to sign this lease trusting that things will work out and being cautious and waiting, any advice would be very appreciated!

i posted this in r/confessions the other day, but i thought i’d try different subreddits bc i want different viewpoints. but basically, i met this guy on this app where teens can meet other teens, and he asked if i wanted to send him some pics for $50. now since i’m a broke teenager and he was also supposedly a teenager that seemed to be nice at the time, i decided to do it. it went fine at first, but it ended in him saving and screenshotting everything because i didn’t wanna give him my instagram. i blocked him, he found my insta somehow, and added me on snap from another account, threatening to send my stuff to all my followers (he had screenshots of them) if i didn’t “be his sl-t” for 2 more weeks. it was the first night of a family vacation when this happened, so he ruined it for me from start to finish because every night i had to hide in the hotel bathroom and video call him and hurt my body by doing things i’d never done before, for his own pleasure. unsurprisingly, when 2 weeks was done, he said he wasn’t gonna be satisfied until i bought something to use in another video. i got it today, and he says it’s gonna be another week. i’m so mentally and physically exhausted, and the stress of this all has made me want to vomit several times. i know it’s my fault from being irresponsible on the internet, but no one should have to go through what i’ve gone through. i think he actually is not capable of feeling any emotions besides anger. i just want advice is all.",11Jul2020,1

I do have Panic disorder and have been known to dissociate but this is completely different than anything ive ever had to experience before. Whereas I used to get full blown panic attacks, I now kinda just sit here and wonder if anyone around me notices anything. I dont know how to express the feeling or put it into words but the best way I can put it is sort of a nostalgic sadness mixed with a feeling of not knowing what the hell is going to happen in the next day.

187," I’m feeling a lot of different things so I don’t know how concise I’ll be able to keep this, but I’m desperate so I’m going to try my best.

I’m a 23M living in Texas and I’m currently in college, but have been staying with my dad since Spring Break in early March. We are both considered high-risk, so we have been almost completely isolated that entire time.

I’m normally kind of an introvert and greatly value having some time completely to myself. Despite the fact that we’re very different people, I love my dad, but I can only take doses of him. He is extremely overbearing and controlling with me—constantly asking me what I’m doing, what I’m reading, if I’m ok, etc. If I decide to go on a run in the neighborhood and I take even slightly too long, he’ll start blowing up my phone wondering where I am. It feels like someone breathing down my neck 24/7. I would have gone back home by now, but the problem is that I feel stuck.

I was originally planning on heading back home about 2 weeks ago before things started getting really bad in TX regarding the virus. When I was beginning to remind him that I’d be going back home soon, he would completely flip out. I have been hospitalized a couple times with asthma and he has reminded me more than once that he and my mom would not be able to afford a huge hospital bill if I were to catch the virus and end up in the ER. He has called my friends stupid several times saying they would get me sick, and he doesn’t understand why I want to leave. Any time I indicate that I want to go back home, he says things that make me feel guilty to disagree with, like “you’re already home.” Once I actually do leave I can already foresee him making a big scene about it and making me feel guilty the whole way out the door.

I’m also concerned about his well-being. Other than his dog, he’s completely on his own at the house. His dog is very old though and his health is increasingly deteriorating to the point that I may suggest that he puts him down soon. My dad is type-2 diabetic and has been eating pretty terribly the entire time I’ve been here and sometimes skips his medicine unless I remind him. I have not even seen him take a blood sugar reading once. He has shown signs occasionally that his mental health is also not the best and I’m concerned that me leaving would only make things worse.

I feel guilty that staying with my dad is making me this anxious. But I also know that staying here for for much longer will not be good for my mental health. That being said, going home will make me feel guilty for leaving my dad all on his own, especially with all that he’s done for me while I’ve been with him. He’s been furloughed from his job and has nowhere to go.

I am so conflicted and I feel like a giant asshole for even thinking some of this stuff. Any advice on what to do would be very very appreciated.",11Jul2020,1
188,"So I am sensitive to people chewing with their mouths open/picking their teeth/talking with a mouth full of food. I try to be calm about it and most of the time I can control it, especially if people only do it occasionally or by accident. 

When I was little, my Dad was extremely strict about table manners. My little sister and I were often yelled at or embarrassed for eating with our mouths open when we were very young (fair enough) and he often talks about how he refused to eat with us as kids because it was “disgusting”. 

So fast forward to now. For a few years my Dad has been eating with his mouth wide open, talking while chewing, smacking his lips, cleaning his teeth out with his tongue, etc. It is extremely off putting, revolting and it’s to the point where I can’t sit with him at all while he’s eating. He’s not elderly and there’s no medical reason for this. My mother and I have gently reminded him hundreds of times about it. He either ignores us completely or apologised, says he has no idea, and starts eating perfectly normally for a day. The next day though, he’s back to chewing with his mouth open. 

It fills me with a rage I can’t even describe. He knows he’s doing it, he’s been told a hundred times, and the cherry on top is that he’s totally intolerant of any annoying habits anyone else has. At parties, he STILL talks about how he couldn’t eat with us as children. 

I’m at a complete loss. It’s making me hate him and I feel like he’s doing it on purpose. I don’t know what to say, I’ve told him so many times. It makes me sad because I now just refuse to initiate spending time with my dad: I need to get my license but driving with him makes me scared I’ll crash the car because he insists on bringing a snack or some chewing gum.

190,"Hi,

My brother has a 2 yr diploma and won't use it to find a job. He sits at the computer all day and plays games, buys expensive goods and eats. He's not in shape and is obese.

Besides playing games, he keeps bragging about how good iphone and apple products are and I bought him the 11 pro. Keep in mind I work 2 jobs so he has no idea how difficult it is to buy something $1300 and change. He has health issues but I don't see that as an excuse. Ever since he got the phone he wants airpod pro and the new series 6 watch. Also I bought him a bike seat which he didn't like so now I'm refunding it.

This addiction makes him always spend more than he makes from gov't support. And he's gaining weight due to boredom and eating. He hates running but would bike which doesn't burn much calories.

Tonight I had an argument with him. He kept on showboating the apple brand it made me pissed so I made fun of his health condition. After that he did a strong kick to my lower back and I was so fucking pissed.

My older brother and parents all defended him and said he has health issues so it's not his fault. But they enable him to live this way because he won't take responsibility. He's lazy and hasn't had a job - we're both 25.

He doesn't take for granted I worked my ass off to get the things he desires and he can physically assault me and get off Scot free.

He’s actually a wrestler so he’s used to being injured so needless to say it was very uncomfortable being in the room. She got a lot better, and now her mannerisms are changing again. Her mannerisms always change when she relapsed, but the mannerisms are different this time. I think she’s doing more than weed now. To keep myself from ranting I just have no clue what to do, but I’m pretty sure she may possibly be using accelerants, or whatever the opposite of a depressant is. She just calls me horny when I try to talk to her which isn’t very often. I’ve only texted her twice during quarantine.

We’re a majority white population too. This makes me extremely worried about their (the students and parents) reaction to someone kneeling during the national anthem. 

I should also mention that I’m the class president. I will be making a speech and technically, I’m suppose to represent the class. People may be angry because graduation “isn’t about BLM” if they see me kneeling. 

I’ve talked to my friends (who are also really involved with BLM), but they’re also expressing hesitation. One friend has to sit next to some of the most racist people in our grade and she’s concerned about their reaction to her. 

So is it really appropriate, as a white woman, to kneel at my high school graduation? I want to support the movement, but is this a good way to do that and/or bring attention to the issue in my community?

200," I've \[21 M\] been together with my girlfriend \[20 F\] for 6 months. We know each other for 2 years and have been best friend for 1 years+.

We love each other very much, we almost talk to each other every night non-stop on all sort of things.

But there are some problems with both of us, where we've been facing similar issues over and over again for times.

I am a very open-minded person and really wanted to solve the problem with my girlfriend to improve the quality of the long-term relationship. This is why, I seek help here.

This is my second relationship, hers too.

I learnt from my first relationship that I need to really care about what makes her unhappy, and really need to communicate things out. Hence, whenever she unhappy about me, I jot down it into a notebook and be more conscious about these problems.

These are the problems where she don't like about me, and wish I improve:

1. Me being very weak (she like that I am gentleman, loving, caring, and generous to her, but she don't like me being weak)
2. Insecure and emotional most the time
3. Doubt her (she like to make jokes about breakup and always tell me she feel sad that I am fat ugly and wish to have a handsome rich boyfriend, I talked about it before with her that it's not funny and I will feel more insecure about it, and she said she was joking most the time, and she wouldn't leave me)
4. Stubborn when I wanted to something (eg. I want to see her, I want to hold her hand, I want to hangout with her) - She feel I am very manipulative and stubborn in some occasions
5. Always just love her through words, but didn't protect her in action
6. She don't like something, but I still make mistakes and did it (this is a serious problem where she almost breakup with me)
7. Indecisive and always ask for her opinions
8. Slow in learning and adapting new things
9. Can't do things right on the first time. Very clumsy, always give her bad impression.

She feels she more like the boyfriend than me.

The problem I don't like about her, which I also talked about it to her before:

1. She always make bad jokes that makes me more insecure
2. She don't rely on me that much (where she argued that I am very unreliable, she don't feel she can rely on me unless my actions prove it)
3. She got this mindset that in this relationship, all her friends and family think that I am the nice person and she is the terrible person where she always bully me, abuse me. (I told her it's not true, but she told me it is suffering when everyone keep tell her she did not appreciate me enough and she is being toxic to me, which she feel very frustrated why everyone frame me as a good boyfriend but frame as a terrible girlfriend)

This is the background of both of us. We talked it out few times, and things actually improved time to time, but the root problem keep reappears. (me being insecure, she feel she don't deserve to get blamed for everything, she feel why being in relationship so suffering)

I would say, most of our time are great together, we buy gifts for each other, spend time with each other and it was all great, but whenever there are conflicts happened (whether it caused internally or externally), it leads back to the same problem.

She feel very disappointed that I am so emotional and not being a strong boyfriend to protect her. She told me she love to have me most of the time, but when she at her lowest, my actions are so terrible. She said I am a great boyfriend in term of taking care of her daily lives and helping her out in every part of her life, but a terrible boyfriend when there is conflicts.

She said, her patience might have limit. she said if I keep challenge her limits and disappointing her, she might really leave me one day.

I need help.  
I know my major problem is being a weak and too vulnerable, but what can I really do to improve myself to really improve our relationship?

TL;DR

Me being too vulnerable, insecure and weak in my relationship. I am clumsy, and always made mistakes that my girlfriend don't like even tho she already told me she don't like. She feel very frustrated what is the point of having me this weak boyfriend.

She feel i am great in most of the time, but whenever there are conflicts, i am super useless.

The advice I seek is to whether or not tell here hospital that she is putting those in the hospital at risk as she exposes herself to high risk activities, is she careless and only thinks of the moment.  She always goes out in large groups and does these things that are very high risk for COVID-19. Her friends and her are not the most responsible people, they are careless always posting dumb things as it if were cool but they just come off very off.

so my college (HC in Mass) has decided that none of my courses will be in person. I can’t justify paying room/board just to sit in my dorm all day...so do I:

(A.) Spend the semester with my parents in IL despite not knowing anyone/having any friends there. My parents are pretty strict re Covid, so I wouldn’t be allowed to leave the house either. For the record, I haven’t been able to visit with any school friends since early March, so this would just add to that time.

(B.) Spend the semester alone in CT. My family owns a v small lake cottage in northwest CT. I would live alone but at least my friends live nearby. I could probably get a job too. Might get lonely though.

(C.) Get an apartment with some friends in MA. I could possibly work and split rent with some friends for a cheap apartment in MA. This is the hardest option, but it is conceivable.

I was furious when I found out the mother said this to her. It explained a lot of why she never even looked my way. I should have said hi either way. I should have cleared it up then.

There is a part of me that wants to reach out. See how she is especially with COVID. But I also think it is a bad idea for multiple reasons. Maybe I just miss her too much tbh. Should I reach out? Even for a meetup, clear things up? Or should I just pretend I do not know she thinks this way?",11Jul2020,1
217,"1. I forget and have the worst memory ever and mostly because i get distracted. i have been scolded multiple times by my parents. this memory loss is pretty bad im pretty scared of being trusted to remembers something important.

2. I have been told in the past i was hyperactive (But Nothing too serious and id just shrug this off as horsing around excessively.)

3. I have trouble concentrating and focusing on studies because my mind goes into day dreamer mode. i try hard to improve my grades but see a pattern where I basically loose intrest. i keep thinking about alot of things id rather be doing.

4. i have been told im irritating and annoying and talk alot by several people including my own parents. i sometimes interrupt people and i think i talk way too much compared to listening. sometimes i do listen but thats when im  most empathical. I srsly feel very bad about talking alot but have hard time shutting up and listening.

5. i am emotionally sensitive. i didn't think i would be, but its hard fir me to be a hardass. i just cry in front of people on sensitive topics and have a hard time controlling it. i easily get frustrated and /or angry and ive smashed stuff because of this. i get jealous easily. i feel sad easily as well and/or hurt by remarks and situations.

6. I have a problem grasping stuff academically and always seen ppl around me excel in places I can't. but i have art skills and that's pretty much it. i can build styff from scratch but if i really focus. i really love my passions more than my studies and probably wud spend half a day slacking ofd and avoid studying.

7. I have a short attention span for stuff. example is when i try something new, most of them just end up being neglected. i have a hard time committing. especially new projects.

8. im very impatient.  i want stuff to be done quickly.

9. i cry. this may not be related. i feel very sad and alone when i do. i feel depressed about my self esteem (it has reduced over the years and now i cry aprox. once a month.) i cry about my insecurities and the moment the thought comes into mind i start tearing up. I have low self esteem and believe i am not as smart as my friends and have a hard time grasping things.

after seeing all this i saw how GOOGLE described ADHD and had a feeling i probably have it. But maybe im overreacting and being dumb. i have no way to find out and dont know who to see about this. i told my mom and she refuses to believe or even suspect she says mental illness/conditions and medication is all in our heads and a scam by doctors. i mean she is very cultural. im trying to talk to my dad about getting a diagnosis just to be safe hope he understands. i just want to be sure I don't have it or may have it. 
because it's useless going on like this trying to study when i clearly have problems doing it. i just want to know if im being dumb or actually being safe to get a diagnosis.

It mighy sound dumb but i suspect it and i just dunno what to do. hopefully someone can help me? someone who is experienced in this?

TL;DR: i have short term memory loss, commitment problems, loss of focus, talkative , loud and emotionally sensitive.",11Jul2020,1
218,"About 10 years ago I cut a friend out of my life because he was a horrible influence on me &amp; the relationship was just toxic in general. I thought I made it pretty clear I wanted to no contact with him after that point. 

This friend &amp; I grew up together &amp; were really close all the way through college. I started really struggling with my mental health in college &amp; said friend was no support. In therapy I started to realize that not just that friend, but that whole friend group was having a very negative impact on me. So when I moved away I wished them the best, but told them that I didn't want to continue communicating.

Fast forward to now, where I'm thriving &amp; haven't thought about them in years. It was absolutely a choice for the best. Today I received a call from that friend asking if we could get together sometime because he misses me (we're living in the same state again - he said he noticed it on my Facebook profile, despite the fact that we're not even friends on Facebook). 

I sort of skirted around the question saying I'm busy (bad idea, I know I panicked), but now I don't know how to handle this. Ghosting doesn't seem like an option, but I also really do not wish to make actual plans. Just thinking about it is drudging up so many awful feelings that I've dealt with &amp; thought I'd put behind me. 

Should I meet up with him &amp; hear what he has to say? I mean I suppose after 10 years he's changed since I have drastically, but I think the memories I've associated with him will make it too hard to move past. Is it better to just say hey I'm not interested? Or will that be hurtful that I'm not giving him a chance? 

Thanks for any advice! 

TL;DR a toxic friend I had cut off wants to meet up to talk &amp; I don't know if I should give him the chance or if not, how do I navigate out of this situation?",11Jul2020,1

221,"Good evening! I will try to summarize as brief as I can. I’m a 29 year old male, with an 8-5 office job. My whole life, I have never worked an office job, and I like it. I like it because I have worked mainly physical labor jobs my entire life and never made as much as I do now. There also is downtime during the day in which I can focus on other tasks, such as my side hustle. It doesn’t interfere with my main job now, and that is great! 

There is one major downside to this job, though. I FEEL like I do not fit in, at all. The company is a very small company, only a couple guys inside, some outside guys, and my boss and accountant. It’s all guys. But I never fit the traditional “guy” stereotype. Everyone here is into sports, I am not. Some of them hunt, I do not. They are all older, and have made some very racist remarks and homophobic jokes. I am not racist and I have gay and trans friends. I feel extremely uncomfortable with things like this. But they all seem to have a good time with it. 

I am not sure if they actually are racist or homophobic but it seems as they definitely have some certain prejudice. They also are all married with children, I have a girlfriend but no kids.

My bosses father (founder of company) comes in regularly and has given me vibes that he does not like me numerous times. I will try to strike up a conversation to get closer to him and I get a vibe like I’m bothering him so I generally just walk away after a couple minutes. He knows I am not into sports, which is all the dude talks about, so I feel like he thinks less of me. It’s just a feeling but I believe it to be true.

I feel left out, because they all talk about certain things and joys they have and I just feel so different. I’m a musician and love music and any new band I play for them immediately they say “ what the f*** Is this garbage” and only want to listen to the same music ALL of the time.

I feel like I am younger and just on a totally different wavelength. I don’t want this to ruin a job, but the way they talk about others personal choices rubs me the wrong way. I am scared I won’t be able to find another job making what I do. I don’t have a college degree.


Tl;dr I like my job for the work aspect, but feel left out amongst my coworkers and feel very uncomfortable some days",11Jul2020,1

223,"Okay so, I'm having a hard time trying to lose weight because even when I try keeping up with something for even years, I just can't see myself differently. 

Almost 2 years ago, I was a really fit person. I was happy doing a lot of exercise and encouraged myself to eat healthy, but everything quickly changed. I found myself in stressful situations and I'm pretty sad most of the time. I don't know if that has anything to do with this but I felt awful.

I'm recovering thanks to some friends, and obviously I don't want to sound like I'm suffering a lot, but my parents keep telling me how slim I was and all that pressure doesn't help me at all.

I try to keep up with diets and exercise but it doesn't last more than two weeks.

It's gotten to the point where I've thought about getting an eating disorder or causing myself some serious damage to with operations or recovery or whatever just so maybe that'll help me get slimmer. Obviously I stop myself from doing anything. 

I feel disgusted by myself but at the same times sometimes I feel like I'm not that bad.

I don't want to blame it on anyone, specifically because this is obviously my fault, but I don't know how to get better. I thought about asking for advice because I've talked to some Redditors and you all are really nice! Also, I thought it'd help with me keeping up with things.

Do you have any advice on how to keep up with a diet or exercise? Maybe also advice on what to eat and what to avoid?

This isn't all mentally, I want to be healthy and slim, because I've gotten too fat, gaining almost 20kg, and it's getting worse with all the quarantine thing going on.

I appreciate every advice I can get and, sorry if this was long or I have grammar errors, my first... language(? Is Spanish, and I'm not that confident in my writing skills.

224,"There’s this guy at work who I had a crush on. Despite my nervousness, I did my best to approach him and talk to him when I could. My friend told me that he liked me back and I was surprised because I’ve never had someone reciprocate my feelings before (sad but true) 

I suck at hiding my feelings when I like someone, so most of my coworkers found out about my crush. They constantly asked me if I would go out with him and I said yes. I’m pretty sure they told him what I said. Anyway, after a few weeks, his friend gave me his phone number and we started texting. Then he called me for the first time and we talked on the phone.

Somehow I mustered up enough courage and straight up told him that I could see him as more than a friend if we continued talking because he seemed like a genuinely nice guy. He didn’t answer me, he just sort of chuckled(?) and asked me what I thought about him, which threw me off. I said that I already told him what I thought about him, but it was like he wasn’t satisfied with my answer and he kept repeating the question. I got slightly annoyed at some point, and I explained to him that I couldn’t be more specific because I didn’t know him that well, I only knew him at work.

Later in the conversation, he mentioned one of my friends, a coworker, and said that we were *really* close even though we were just friends. I found that weird. It felt as if he was implying that there was something going on between my friend and I, which is not true. One, because my friend is married, and two, because I don’t like him like that at all. We’re buddies. He then tried telling me something negative about my friend, and when I pressed about how he knew that personal information, he would just say, “I don’t know. I’m not sure.”

After the call ended, I could actually feel my interest fade. I didn’t appreciate the way he spoke about my friend and I didn’t like how he wasn’t direct with me. His answers to my questions were ambiguous, it felt like I was the only one who was answering honestly.

A week later, I got Covid-19, which was an awful experience by the way. I didn’t see or contact him for a month, and that helped me get over whatever was left of my feelings. He, however, didn’t get over his, and I know this because he recently messaged me about how we were barely getting to know eachother, how he missed me at work and that he liked me.

Im not sure how to tell him that I don’t like him anymore. Also, I really suck on one-on-one conversations. Just thinking about talking to him is making me sweat and my heart palpitate. But I need to talk to him regardless because I don’t want to lead him on.

I considered quitting my job for a couple moments so I wouldn’t have to see him ever again. That’s how nervous I am about this and that’s why I put the serious tag 💀",11Jul2020,1
225,"Hey guys, posted this on the NASCAR sub but obviously got taken down, but I need some advice. 

NASCAR has basically been my life and I honestly don’t think I can live without it. Everything revolves around NASCAR with me. If my mom asks me what I want for dinner, I’ll typically mention NASCAR in the response. Example: This week I’ve been super pissed at AG (Alan Gustafson, CC for a Chase Elliott) for his call on Sunday so my mom asked me what time I work the next day and I said “I don’t want to work until Alan Gustafson isn’t working for Hendrick”. It’s to a point where I’ve been told that my addiction is a problem. Today, the voters ballot came in, my dad told me and my brother that we are all going to vote Democrat because Trump is racist against our kind (Muslim). He then looked at me and said that I better not vote for Trump because he likes NASCAR, I said “Well I might, I love NASCAR (Obviously joking).”. He then proceeds to tell me how fucked up I am for putting NASCAR over religion and then tells me no more NASCAR in any form in his house whether it be IRacing, on the TV or merchandise (specifically diecast). He then said if I do not obey that order, I can’t live with him anymore. So yea, I’m not gonna give up what I love just to stay with my parents. Am I wrong for thinking this way? I am leaving out a lot more that has went on over the years, but it’s been brewing for a while. I’m also 19 and literally the only problems I have with my parents is me liking NASCAR too much. I also do have a job, but not enough money saved up to live sufficiently, also don’t have my own car. Would appreciate the help and guidance guys!",11Jul2020,1
226,"I haven't ever had sober sex that ended with my feeling anything, and I've actually come to the conclusion that I'm a demisexual as a result. I also only started making friends once I turned 16, and only held any after 17. Following that, at 18 I immediately made the dumbest mistake of my life and took an ecstasy pill which basically turned my brain to mush and confused doctors who just assumed they needed to heavily medicate me beyond anything I had ever seen. Sure, I had ADD medication growing up, but I was given what my mother described as a cocktail. The worst thing that came of it all is that my mother passed away before I was able to return to being her son, after having most of those chemicals removed from prescription, so all she saw for over a decade was a slow, lost, nothing.

I can't pretend to be anything, or anyone and I honestly have no skills with instruments, but I do own a bunch. I own a couple sets of drums, and guitars, as well as a piano. I don't think it's possible for me to understand any type of relationship right now, and I need to find out how to make a few friends.

Unfortunately, I'm a weird person who likes to make voices for people and just see them smile. I don't really want to be anything different from that because it's my default setting. I want people to be happy, and I feel a need to be sure they are. I will never be cool, and I can't really try because all the friends I ever actually considered to be real were just considered sisters.

I enjoy pop culture, and I do some pretty feminine stuff, but that's just who I am. At least, I think it is. I know I'm straight, or at least hetero-romantic. When I write, which I do, I try to be sure everything I write has heart and not just definition.

My life has been tragic. It hasn't honestly existed, but I was a Boy Scout and I liked to be a part of that. It's where I learned most if not all of my social skills. Which isn't saying much since circumstances kinda ended badly with whole troop due to my mother remarrying to our scout master.

I haven't had friends for over a decade, and the one person who spent time with me was just a kid who lived in the last group home I lived in, who I felt sorry for so when he begged for attention or showed up at my house randomly, I would let him in until I realized the damage he was doing to my life.

This isn't really asking for advice, it's more asking for help. I don't know how to start a 32-year-old life with the experience of a 17-year-old who had just begin himself. I literally have 1 single actual year of making, or having friends.",11Jul2020,1
227,"So I applied for a job as a server and got an immediate response. The manager (a woman) however asked if I could be dishwasher for the day because they didn’t have one and she also said she would explain the role of a server to me. 

So I went in and worked for 4 and a half hours in a small kitchen where it was very warm. I had worked as a dishwasher before so I kinda knew what to expect but it was kinda a lot to take it. 

Anyways, so I got paid that night in cash and she told me she would text me the following week. Well, it’s Friday and I still hadn’t heard from her so I texted her this:

“Hi ___.  I thought last time we talked you were going to call me to discuss moving forward and training. Is that still the plan or did I misinterpret something? 
Thanks, 
____”

And I thought I sounded a bit pushy. And I guess I did because this was her response:

“Yes that's the plan.  
You have to understand that we have a solid team in place and applying to the landing right before the 4th of July is not ideal for your cause. 
The rest of The team has been learning and serving together for Well over a month. 

I will give your name to mark Litherland to get you in. It will be after The 18th of July tho. 
Thanks for your patience.”

230,"Apologies if this is a long post. Throwaway account for obvs reason and I’m on mobile.

I (30F) have been close friends with this woman, (31F) for approximately 10+ years. We met in school and have been friends since. She’s been there for large milestones in my life and I’ve been there for hers. Her children affectionately call me Aunty. I’ve always been on the quiet side and don’t have many friends, and as the years have passed, she has essentially become my only lasting friendship. 

The problem with her is that she is insanely homophobic, and transphobic mixed with a holier than thou attitude because, according to her, “she is a woman of God”. 

What she doesn’t know, is that I am bisexual. I’ve never told her or any of my family members because I fear of the consequences, (we live in a small town that’s very close minded). She genuinely believes people are gay because they’ve been “influenced”, and every time we hang out she somehow finds a way to bring up something nasty about the lgbtq+ community, and every time I have tried to educate her, I have told her I have no problems with gay people and trans people, that when she speaks that way it makes me very upset because I don’t share the same views as her, etc. Yet she still does it, and it’s so exhausting. 

There is a new sex education curriculum for children that includes learning about different sexualities/transgender people in an effort to provide education and support. She was practically foaming at the mouth when she learned her children would be in a class like that, so I decided to ask her what she would do if one of her children were gay and she said she’d disown them, no hesitation. I can’t imagine she’d want someone like me around her kids, “spreading my gay”.  Since she’s a lost cause I’ve been wanting to cut ties with her for awhile, but chicken out every time. 

Since the lockdown has started I’ve had to deal with a lot of heavy stuff (depression, family members dying, job loss, etc) and I haven’t had time to talk with her in like 3-4 months. Things are a little better now, but I still haven’t called her back. The more I ignore her calls the better I feel, even if it means losing the only friend I have. I do however, feel guilty for not explaining myself since it’s like I’ve disappeared and won’t return her calls or text. She called me again today and I didn’t answer, because I’m scared that speaking to her would mean outing myself and I don’t want to do that. When she’s not spewing hate she is very sweet, but I just can’t take it anymore. So, should I cut off contact completely or be up front with her and out myself?

I was cleaning the house cuz she was in one of her clean the house moods again when she turned around and asked me why I never clean the house, why I dont do my chore like I'm supposed to, etc. Then said that in the bible it says to honor your parents rules, and because I dont clean that I'm not honoring her which means I dont love her. 

I hadn't cried her entire yelling fit until she said that I didnt love her. I love my mom, I wouldnt be alive if it werent for her. But whenever shes upset she throws that out there. And then we find out my grandpa george just died. Hes the only grandpa I remember from the beginning not judging me for my mental disabilities. Mom came into my room and told me, but the whole time she was talking to me she was on the phone. When she left my room that when I let loose on my tears. 

But then I became overcome with pain and sadness and loneliness. We moved across the country away from the family I've known since I was born to one I hardly know. And their an hour drive from here at least in our new city. And I dont have many friends here because I was homeschooled before, during, and after the move. Our neighborhood is filled with old people and little kids. So there isnt anyone I can really talk to about this. 

I want to die and have tried so many times, but then I think about my mom, and my baby brother, and my animals since their the ones I'm closest with. When mom was yelling at me earlier I wanted to grab the gun from the kitchen and blow my brains out. But I couldnt bring myself to do it. I tried to before with the gun to and a few months afterwards, mom put the gun to her head for a few minutes before putting it away and looked at me and said,"" I'm not selfish enough to do it even though I want to."" And it made me want to do it again. I'm too scared to talk to the suicide hotline in case someone overhears. My depression and anxiety have been skyrocketing from everything lately and I'm scared and lonely and lost. Any advice is very appreciated.",11Jul2020,1

242,"I'm 21yr old male.
 I've been going to college, lots of people tell me that I barely look 18, if not 17. But I could tell they were being nice.

in my old job, people thought I wasn't even old enough to work.

I got a new part time job at Pizza hut to get some extra cash while going to school. Today was my first day. This girl showing me how things go around asked my age and I said 21. She was surprised and shocked. She said she couldn't believe it. She told me I looked 16. I was surprised too because she's 17, 4 years younger than me.

2 hrs later, a new girl is showing me how to make pizza. She also asked my age and she was also shocked. She thought I was a highscooler. She was also 17.

Why do they think I'm younger than them?? It was really annoying.

I know I'm a shorter/smaller guy. I'm 5'7 and 128lbs. Im skinny but its because I'm a runner for my college. I also eat really healthy. 
Can anyone let me know how to look older?

243,"I am 27, F, and bisexual in my first long-term relationship. When I came out to my family at ten years ago, my adoptive mother was extremely upset. She was religious so she believed it was sinful, shameful, and ""caused"" by the sexual abuse I suffered before adoption. Because of her rejection and my father's complete silence/neutrality, I became secretive about my dating life. Don't ask, don't tell. The only time they knew I was in a relationship was when they'd find me crying over a breakup. When things became more serious with my current partner of nine months, I tried repeatedly to speak to my parents but they chided me for my lifelong secrecy and told me they ""didn't want a gay child"" and were ""happy I was happy"" but wanted me to be with a man.  


Now that I have moved into my own place, I invited my girlfriend to come to my place. We haven't seen each other in 4 months due to COVID and we only have two weeks to be together before she goes out of town for another month. When I told my family casually I would have her over, they became furious that I would have her over at my place without first introducing her to the family. They say I am doing things backwards, disrespecting their household, and rejecting all of their values. They flatly all think what I am doing is wrong and told me that if I did have her over, they would out me to my grandmother- who I never came out to because I know she will cut me off.   


Is it wrong of me to have her over without introducing to my family first? Have I truly disrespected them?   


TL;DR My homophobic family didn't accept me when I came out and didn't seem interested in learning about my current partner. When they found out I'm going to have her spend a night at my place, they felt insulted and disrespected that I didn't introduce her to my family first. Am I in the wrong?",11Jul2020,1
244,"MASSIVE TW. 
Background on the people (besides me):

Jenna (18): my best friend 
John (20): Jenna’s ex boyfriend of 3 years, emotionally abusive and an asshole. 

Some background on me (18f) I have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder, PTSD and general anxiety for almost 4 years now. I grew up with a TERRIBLY abusive stepdad (he’s now out of the picture entirely) that emotionally, physically and sexually abused me, all beginning by the time I was 6 y/o. I’ve also had some pretty terrible boyfriends abuse wise- one only found me attractive if I weighed a certain amount, wouldn’t let me have certain friends/wear certain clothes, etc. the other was physically abusive, and manipulated me into believing the abuse (part of which involved cutting me with razor blades) was just kinky sex. 
Some context on Jenna- we’ve been friends for just over 2 years now. She broke up with John within the first year of our friendship, and is finally accepting that he was terrible to her (which I’m very happy about.) He would pressure her for sex (though as I’m told he DID stop if she said no, not excusable but relevant to the story), didn’t allow her to have certain friends and DESTROYED her self esteem. 

Now for the issue- I’ve been having a very rough time recently with my depression, and I’ve continuously tried to talk to my friend about it. She is also having a rough time accepting the situation with her ex-boyfriend, although she has vented to me a LOT (at least 3 breakdowns in my car within the past two weeks). I don’t mind her venting, and I’m happy to help, but I feel like it doesn’t work both ways. For example, every time her ex drives past her work (his car is very recognizable) she’ll have panic attacks, which she regularly calls me to help her through and sometimes pick her up. However- one day we were at the public park, and the ex that had physically abused me was at the park. I told her I was anxious and wanted to leave, but she continued driving around the park. I explained that I was panicking, and she took another 5-10 minutes to leave, it felt as though she wasn’t taking me seriously. I talked to her about it, though she just cried and said she felt like she’s not good enough for anyone (bringing up her ex John).

Another example that happened yesterday; we were driving around, and I once again tried to talk to her because I’m having a rough time emotionally. I said that I’m struggling with wanting to have sex, and she said “really? I’m the opposite!” And I tried to explain that I was finally addressing my sexual trauma and therapy by saying “well, I have sexual trauma.” And she said “yeah me too.” 
I don’t want to discredit her trauma, because John pressuring her into sex was absolutely a form date r*pe and I’m more than happy to listen to her, comfort her, and encourage her towards therapy. The only reason I’m upset is because she regularly says these kinds of things, almost comparing, despite me trying to talk to her about it. 
I talked to another friend asking if it was irrational for me to feel upset about her comparing/bringing up her trauma every time I try to talk about mine, and he said that I wasn’t. I very well may be- she’s an amazing friend, this is just one area that I feel like I can’t talk to her. 

How do I confront her about this? Every time I’ve tried to talk about it she cries and it turns into a mental breakdown that includes talking about John. Please help, and if I’m being irrational Id like to know.",11Jul2020,1
245,"So, I met this guy 2 years ago in university and we have been friends since. We have a discord and group chat with other people that is active and multiple days a week, have voice chats. However, in the past few months, another mutual in out group and I have noticed him being more of a downer. When we play games, he takes the losses more seriously, quits them and starts bringing himself down.

Another issue that arises is that he is denial that over his current feelings over his ex of about 2 years.  We will be talking about certain topics like music or movies, and he will randomly bring up his ex and get sad. He has her blocked on social media and does not text her but she is still clearly on his mind.

We are both currently in out final year of University, and he has convinced himself that he will not get a job out of college and either be forced to pursue higher education or do a job that he hates. This gets him on a spiral of depression leading to self depreciation because he thinks that he did not try hard enough.( He is a 3.8 student, so he gets good grades)

Im writing this because I am concerned about his mental state and want him to seek help but I do not want to seem preachy or self righteous. Is there a way to bring this up but not be rude?

Whenever we eat lunch or dinner, I always finish first because I eat fast and I only eat a little amount of food. They don't talk or converse even slightly whenever I'm still there but when I leave and go to my room, I can hear them laughing, sometimes making fun of me or saying how disrespectful I was. 

Recently, my sister asked me to go to the grocery and meet someone there because she bought something. When I got there, the person I was supposed to meet wasn't there so I waited for 20 minutes (I didn't bring my phone with me because she told me it would only take a short while). I went home and got mad ate her. I told her she should've made sure that the person was there so I wouldn't have to wait long, especially I didn't bring my phone. 

She got mad and told me to go back because the person I was supposed to meet was there already. I went home and never spoke to her or any of my family. 

Dinner came and they were all saying and shouting how I was an asshole and why I acted that way. Why I always fight with everyone and get mad at everyone. 

I refuse to talk to them or say sorry because it's not my fault. I always say sorry whenever I know it's my fault, I always try to talk to them first. 

All of the words they're saying are how bad I am, how disrespectful, how they'd rather have me live in another house. 

I know it might be petty but this kind of treatment has been going on for almost a year now. I try to stay calm and not cry whenever they tell me those things but I can't help but cry when I'm alone. I feel like they always blame me for everything, like every fight with my family or sisters is instantly my fault.

247,"It’s been almost a year with me a M17 and my white girlfriend F18, we got together last year October 18th. We met online and we barely met in person the times we have met was her being my homecoming date, breaks i have at work and or me sneaking out pretending i was working but going to visit her but me going out does not happen often. We call on discord and FaceTime almost everyday because that’s the only time I had even before COVID hit the United States I was never allowed to go out to anywhere because of my Vietnamese mom just never letting me go out, turned me down all the times I asked to go out and the only times I went out is when an asian friend was there to be able to speak Vietnamese and or Cantonese to her. I barely have any asian friends and I only went out a couple times in my life time. And even then when I went out they have to have someone there to supervise me

 for example I went to a friends birthday party at the mall which was like a small hang out only because my mom was in the mall too, waited out the 5 whole hours I was there and drove me home when I needed to and that was the only time i ever been ""out"" and i was 16 at the time it was because there was one Vietnamese friend there and that was it.

 the more time i was with my girlfriend on the phone and or just on the computer my mom would complain about it and say its ""that girl again"". Talking to monks from Vietnam whenever anything does not go her way. going on tantrums over it, leaving the house and coming back. going as far as even if i were to keep dating her my entire life would go into shambles because of a prediction from Buddhist monks. My mom has started to take my phone away at nights because i would sleep in call with her sometimes. now i have stopped and she still takes it away from me. assuming i call her 24/7 when i need to take my phone back from them to check on my job and or my schooling in the canvas app. i would never realized how sheltered i was and how horrible my mom is without my girlfriend she means the world to me and i want to be with her. my mom wants me to date only asian girls to be able to ""understand our culture"" but i dont want that i just want a person that makes me happy. as i talk about this with her it just gives her stress and anxiety knowing that my mom not accepting her and that it just makes me anxious with her presence and or talking against her. As I was thinking about our anniversary that’s coming up soon I was crying to the thought that if I went out without my moms permission she would like yell at me and or hit me that thought just gave me fear and put me to tears i got extremely anxious. I talked to my sister and hopefully my other siblings soon about this and she says I have trauma from my mom. I dont know what to do. i still want to go out and celebrate at least my anniversary with my girlfriend but at the same time the fear can just almost petrify me in my footsteps she would beat me when i got out of line and my other siblings too. 

it was scaring to me seeing my sisters getting beat right in front of me and to just shoo me back inside of my room and or making me watch in tears. she stopped only because of a CPS (child protective services) visit but she just complains more behind my back on how stupid i am and even ease drops on my conversations i have in my own room. the only way i knew about that was beacause my siblings told me that mom told them to ""talk some sense into me"" also my mom telling me she ease drops on me as well. its just jaring to me and i dont know what to do. we are in a pandemic and there is my anniversary coming up that is very important to my girlfriend and me i just dont know what to do.",11Jul2020,1
248,"I'm at a loss where to post this. But I have to get it off my chest.

   I am a technician at a retail pharmacy. Yesterday one of my coworkers (who works on the retail side) tested positive for covid-19. 

    I'm not 100% sure on the steps my employers are required (if any) to follow. But I believe they have a moral obligation to tell our customers or the health department what happened. As well as require all other employees to be tested or at least screened everyday before work.

    There is no way physically possible to be 6 feet from customers or coworkers at the registers or in the pharmacy. Some employees have doctors notes excusing them from masks.

    When I came into work today, I was immediately told by my pharmacy manager not to discuss that employee or their positive test result. Apparently a customer had overheard employees talking the day prior and complained.

    Following that, another co-worker told me the manager and district manager had decided not to take any action. We wouldn't close for cleaning or do any extra screening of employees or inform customers publicly.

    How is this ethical? As a retail pharmacy we directly contribute to our customers wellbeing or harm. I wait on hundreds of people a day, fill hundreds of prescriptions.

249,"About a year ago, I got into a fight with a couple guys online who then proceeded to try and dox me because I was careless about what I said online.

To this day, I’m very confident they don’t know who I am, however what they said to me was enough to scare me (they have a list of about 15 people who could be me, but no evidence to determine which one of those people are me). When I told them my info, I knew they’d know this list, I just didn’t think they’d care enough do anything about it.

Anyway i stayed in contact with them for a bit after that. We made up, they apologised and left on somewhat good terms. If they were to try extremely hard they could probably find me, but it happened a year ago and the fight wasn’t that bad so I’m certain nothing will come out of this.

However I’m a huge over thinker and I’ve became so paranoid about everything and get stressed when reminded of the incident. I go weeks where this doesn’t bother me at all, but there’s sometimes like a 5 day stretch where it seriously gives me anxiety. However most days I’m completely fine.

For example, I just remembered I have an account to a small website in my name, and now I’m thinking of deleting that account just so my name is completely moved off the internet, even thought I KNOW they won’t ever find this website nevertheless know it’s me.

I’ve learnt so much from this situation and I know it won’t happen again. There were definitely positives from the situation, I’m just tired of this holding onto my life at times. I’m finding it tough to move on.

252,"So this might be really long so bare with me. So I'm basically gonna explain a bunch of stuff about my life and stuff with my parents and I want you guys to tell me if it's just normal or our my parents bad. I'm gonna try to be as un biased as possible.

So to start off I'm 15 and I have a basically an 11 o clock bedtime during summer. Non of my friends have bedtimes and I always tell my parents this but they dont care. I was sneaking out past my bedtime to play xbox with my friends and my parents found out and acted like i committed genocide they got really mad and took away my phone and xbox for like 2 weeks. I got it back and they reasoned with me a little bit sometimes randomly my dad would call me at like 11 and say time to get off the xbox which made me mad because its summer and almost all kids stay up and play xbox till at least 12. So after a while of them not understanding me my dad calls me and says time to get off I say can I finish this game he hangs up and about 3 minutes later he turns off the wifi kicking me out of my warzone game. I get mad and we argue. My parents basically screamed at me super loudly took my xbox and threatened me and shit so I lost my xbox for another 2 weeks. Now they give me a time limit which is only 2 hours a day. DURING SUMMER. I tried to reason with them saying when I'm not at a friends house I have nothing to do. And my sister watches tv all day so what's the difference you dont care about her doing that. But ofc they didnt care.

So now let's give some more examples my friend inv me to a 4th of july hangout and we never get to hangout with eachother because of schedules. So I'm really excited and I tell my mom like a week in advance and she says no. I ask if my sister can take me she says no. Then I say my friend can pick me up she says no. I just dont get this because they dont want me playing xbox but when I want to go to my friends they say no. We werent doing anything as a family that night either so I ended up doing nothing all night just watching tiktok depressed asf because I dont know why my parents didnt let me. 

I'll give a few more examples.

Last year I went to a bball practice it was the first one of the year. The coach kept us past the time to talk to us when I got into the cat my dad screamed at me for being late even though it was out of my controlling and I tried my best to get to him not late but he didnt care and litteraly punched me in the arm like 6 times.

So basically from this, are my parents normal or are they toxic. And should 15 year olds have bedtimes during summer. I have countless more stuff I can tell you in the comments if your confused or need more context. I just need to know because whenever I'm balling my eyes out in my room after they yelll at me I want to know if it's normal or my fault or what.also is it normal for parents to threaten you physically and swear at you a lot.

Last weekend I was out of town so i don’t know if he stopped by, but tonight he starts pounding on my door at 12:30 am again. I’m sure he called and texted but I have his number blocked.

Now I have no problem with this. I have no friends or even close acquaintances besides my mentor and I seek to only surround myself with successful people to succeed. I want to become the best person I can be and spend the next decade improving everything about myself and building myself into a machine. Nothing up to this point bothers me. It’s just the fact that doing the things I’m doing. Cutting everything from my life feels weird. It is part of what only the top .3% have done to become billionaires. My goal is $250,000,000 by the age of 32. 14 years from where I am now. I set that goal because you will only achieve what you set your goal to be. 

So that’s my goal. It just feels weird. I’m becoming a different person and like usual, I don’t recognize myself. After recovering from severe mental issues I felt like a completely different person. Now working 18 hour days has me feeling like an unrecognizable person. It’s weird being different from everyone else. 

Do you think I should try to be a little more normal? Embrace it and roll with it? No you are insane? Yes, because you have to be like no one else to achieve like no one else?

260,"This is my first post. A few friends suggested I try coming here for advice. I am really at a loss on what I should do in my current situation. I have worked for a small technology company for three years. It started out really well. The work was engaging, the pay was competitive, and I had a flexible schedule. However, the previous owner decided to sell the company to his son who has a poor work ethic and management style. He chooses to manage, by not managing. Several employees have some pretty bad habits that just never seem to have been addressed. To list them all would be tedious and time-consuming so I will drop the most egregious ones to date. Racism in the workplace is rampant with two guys in particular. Several employees have written formal complaints, nothing will ever be done about it. One guy who was falsely accused of sexual harassment was driven so crazy by how bad it's gotten has filed so many legal complaints it's almost crazy. He posted about it in r/RegularRevenge ""Incompetent CEO gets what's coming to him"" Which a few of us at work found pretty funny because the guy is so quiet and reserved. He got driven nuts. He's did everything from calling OSHA, to the Federal Board of Labor, the IRS, and now filed a lawsuit for a hostile work environment and quit. I feel like it was excessive, but I can't say I blame him at this point. Recently an employee assaulted another in what was a pretty heated altercation. As a result, the owner who acts as the manager decided it would be best if everyone turned in their key and work from 7 am-9 am. Which hurt a lot of guys because a lot of us had second jobs and had to quit. The guy who assaulted the other guy still has his job, and never got in any trouble. Which kind of sucks, because I had to quit my second job because of the whole fiasco. This week I found out from the former manager whose role was minimalized to engineer, that we will no longer be getting raises. What is weird is, that the day before, the owner announced that all of our paychecks will be covered by a PPP loan and business is good. Which to the best of my knowledge covers payroll and is forgivable as long as he retains all of us employees for the most part. Minus the dude who lost his cool and quit. Then the owner talks about how he is listing his house, so he can buy a new one. So I'm thinking we probably aren't getting raises ever again because this guy wants to buy a new house. I don't know if this assumption is reasonable, but it's the first place my mind went to. Today I'm going to work on my next project and notice we have no materials to begin working with. I ask my boss, the newly demoted engineer and he says ""Due to financial concerns those materials aren't being ordered."" I don't know if the lawsuit is causing financial problems or if the company is in hot water from COVID-19, but the business hasn't slowed down. None of us were laid off, furloughed or let go during this epidemic. So I'm super confused as to the ""money problems"" going on or how they may be happening because everything has been business as usual. I'm looking for other jobs because I definitely am recognizing a pattern of behavior with this owner. It seems like ever since he took over things have progressively gone downhill. It's kind of pathetic because he just ignores any problems within the company. I think maybe he thinks, if he just pretends they don't exist, they'll go away. Which seems like a really childish way to behave. It's gotten to the point I have drafted a resignation letter. I am considering just never going back in on Monday, and just ghosting them. COVID has the job market locked down pretty tightly in my area. Any job that would pay comparable to this one does not seem to exist atm. I just don't know what to do. I hate going in there every day now. I hate looking at the owner and knowing something shady is going on. I think he's just probably living it up on the company money and spending too much and got a PPP to CHA (cover his ass). I just don't know what to do, I don't want to be like the other dude who filed the lawsuit, but I've considered it because saying the work environment is hostile is an understatement. Sorry, this was so long-winded. Any advice is kindly appreciated. What should I do? What are some alternatives I am not seeing? Am I being immature?",11Jul2020,1

As soon as a guy and I are talking and I’m aware he’s interested, I immediately become attached in a way that it unhealthy. I will stop responding to other guys and focus all my attention and energy on this one person even though we’re not dating and except the same in return. I’ve realized how ridiculous this is, especially since men usually talk to more than one giro at a time, but I just can’t fathom the idea of talking to more than one guy at a time. As soon as I’m interested in one guy, I suddenly feel repulsed by other guys and I see no purpose in entertaining them when I only want one person but that’s unhealthy. I need to find a way to engage with other men without becoming too attached, especially when they’re not even worthy of my time. I’ve given a lot of guys the time of day who were nice to me for two seconds, even if I wasn’t attracted to them in the slightest or we had nothing in common. To make matters worse, even when someone has made it clear that they are invested in me I become really afraid and distance myself. I don’t understand why my behavior is so self destructive, and I really want to find a way to be better.",11Jul2020,1
262,"Hi, here is some back story

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 16 (I am now 18) and could drive I got an internship fixing Chromebooks at my school. My dream job field is IT so I thought this was great. While working with these people (there was only 3 of us) we all became great friends and I was picked up for a paid internship to service more than just the student's Chromebooks. I was treated as a normal floor technician with all the responsibility of one, servicing all the districts buildings and completing tickets. I might add as well that we didn't have a power hierarchy it was more whoever had the best sounding idea was usually followed. It was a great internship because my employers didn't take everything seriously and you could joke around and talk freely as you please. Working for me at this time felt more like a paid summer camp than actual work. During this time they also made an effort to show me what they were doing whenever possible so I would come to know basically everything there is to know about our district and how to service it. They also began to teach me how to manage servers, switches and other networking equipment. However, they never really got into it deeply or there wasn't enough time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to now: My district decided they were not pleased with the current IT contracting group and with only a weeks notice replaced the original contracting group with a new one. Since I get paid through the school and not the individual contractors I basically came as a gift to the new people. 

To them I was someone who knew everything about the buildings, could service almost anything we had and they didn't have to pay me for any of it. Now seeing as this is the case I was hoping the new company would allow me to continue to learn or at least continue what I was doing which was essentially the duties of a tier 1 ground technician. Once I worked for about a week I quickly realized this would not be the case. 

They basically had me take inventory of everything in every building, which I had already done with the previous company but they would not accept the previous inventory. Then they began moving into the office. I was not there when they were moving everything but apparently they believed that I had a better chair at my station and so they took the chair and part of my tool kit. When I asked for it back I was dismissed because the person who took it had ""back problems"" and was stiffed with a partially broken chair and half a tool kit. After these transgressions they had me doing grunt work moving heavy stuff that they didn't want to and doing unnecessary tasks like reorganizing things at that were already previously organized. If this wasn't bad enough the thing I hate most is that they have allotted times for bantering, if you joke around while working to make it seem not so tedious they will say something along the lines of ""alright lets get back to work"" and just say silent the entire time. Now I can handle doing tedious stuff if I have someone to talk to while doing it but them leaving and basically telling me to do things while twiddling their thumbs at their desk is infuriating. The only reason I haven't quit yet is because they are ""teaching"" how to make windows images and test them out. I put teaching in quotes because they offer to help all the time but when I ask about something specific I get a general answer along the lines of ""its like that some times"" and end up googling and troubleshooting it myself. Finally this new team will not open up or allow me to conversate in the manor that I am used to doing. For example most of my humor is that of a younger person and comprised of memes and internet references, the new team would be qualified by today's standards as  boomers and most of my humor goes over their head. They also dismiss my ideas for do things because I am ""just the intern who doesn't know anything""

If I were to quit now I would have 2.5 years of good experience in my preferred field but burn a bridge with this new company. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question for you dear reader is that: Do I bite my tongue and finish my last 5 weeks before I go to college or do I quit now.

&amp;#x200B;

p.s I pretty much already made up my mind I would just like to know if my logic is sound in this decision or if I am just being dramatic. I have tried to provide an unbiased description of my experience.",11Jul2020,1
263,"I recently posted something on the subreddit for relationship_advice relating to my friendships during my dieting. I got a lot of responses and advice for eating and exercising and some people sent DMs which were perfectly fine with me.
I mentioned in my post that I am 16F. One guy that sent a DM said that he's 19M and has lost a lot of weight after calorie counting, exercising etc. He asks for my IG so he can send a transformation photo/video of himself. 

I'm of course very suspicious, so I gave him my second account where I only follow fan accounts and artists. It has zero personal information about me. 

He asked ""What do you look like? How much weight are you looking to lose?""

After answering I got a notification from him saying ""Can I see a photo"" and I haven't clicked on it because Instagram shows it when people read messages.

Somehow my dad new that I had downloaded and redownloaded Snapchat on my phone and he confronted me about it, causing me to lose it for 3 weeks and counting. I snuck on it a few times to search for tracking apps or anyway he could have found out but the phone was clean. I’m using an Apple XR and am on a family plan with him, except any purchases made don’t show up once deleted. I have no clue how he found out and am struggling to find an answer.

I have trouble getting back on track after summer break. I’m not sure if I’ll still be relevant after 7 (potentially 14) months away. My mom fully embraces the “sooner it’s done the sooner it’s over” philosophy, so I figured I’d go ahead and distance myself. I already left the discord server we have.

269,"She's definitely might not be the best influence (does drugs and sh!), but she's very kind and a good friend. As soon as I started talking about her, they started stalking her social media pages and constantly criticize her (ex: my dad called her out for looking slutty/being arrested at a protest for basically nothing, my sister and Mom said she looks like trouble). 

Anyway, after I went to her house today to teach her first lesson of guitar (it went very well) my mom told me that she needs to start coming over to OUR house and be out in the living room in the open instead of going to hers (this was after just the first time I went over to hers). While I don't necessarily mind, it's obvious that they just want to watch us and don't trust me for whatever reason.

I guess I'd consider myself a ""good kid"" and don't ever really get into any trouble or anything but my parents always seem to be extremely manipulative and it causes me a lot of anxiety because I always feel like they're looking over my shoulder and I never feel like I can do anything without them criticizing/controlling my life. (They even have one of those apps that tracks where I am using GPS)

I needed to get this off my chest because it's a very overwhelming/reoccurring situation for me. Is there any advice that would help? I'm not really sure but if there is then it would be much appreciated.

However it happened a year ago and everything has been resolved, but I’m becoming really paranoid about everything I do (Eg. Whenever I post online, triple checking no personal details are in my username as well as deleting old social media accounts linked to my name even though they’re realistically impossible to find by the guys who tried to dox me).

276,"**TLDR  AT THE BOTTOM!**

I (30/F) am the oldest of 8 children, our dad is an abusive alcoholic to his kids and wife and causes us to leave home earlier than normal (around ages 14-16 ish, thats about the time we've had enough). I don't want to write out an entire backstory but verbal abuse and violence is a commonplace in our home. This has given us all our fair share of coping mechanisms and weird mental health. Some of us are doing ok in our adult lives, the rest are either in jail or currently suffering while the rest still live inside our dads house. It's safe to say our dad raised a giant mess and only a few of us are doing our best with what we got. 

Anyway my little brother (**I'll call him B**) just turned 18 a few months ago but has been acting very out of character and strangely aggressive in the last month. He house-hops, never stays in one place, the few times he's went home he got into a physical altercation with our dad (who still drinks every night, to be clear), or he's at his girlfriends place.  He constantly smokes weed, which wouldn't be a big problem but he also doesn't work or literally do anything except for smoke weed and stay high all the time. He will go to the ends of the earth to make sure he has weed at all times even if it means resorting to petty theft.

This week was the week my siblings and I noticed a ton of weird shit going on with **B.** 

He came over to my place for 4th of July, but due to social distancing we just hung out in the apartment, stayed up with coffee and played videogames.  Weed doesn't bother me, so my husband and I didn't mind if he wanted to use his vape pen while he gamed. But through the weekend he did not sleep, he did not eat and he obsessed over his phone. As if he was having a long intense break up via text that lasted 3 days.  We knew he had girlfriend issues but wasn't sure what would lead to not sleeping or eating for 3 days. He also made the habit of going into our bathroom and just.. hanging out in there for 15 minutes at a time but would leave without flushing or hand washing. He wasn't using the bathroom. He just hid in there a few times a day or until someone knocked to ask him to get out of it so someone else could use it. It's a very small apartment, and he wasn't making any calls , we would hear it. 

I found him pacing around and sort of having a panic attack the last night he spent at my apartment and I had to grab and shake him into focus and ask him what the hell he was doing, and he appeared to me to be having a straight up panic attack. When I asked him, he apologized profusely as if he wasn't even really awake.. and told me he absolutely had to see his girlfriend. He felt like she was sleeping around and had to go see for himself to make sure she was being faithful. It was midnight.. but I just wanted him to chill out, so I offered to take him and it was a 25 minute drive through super thick firework smoke. I didn't think it through, so I just told him I'd drop him off and he'd have to find his way home somehow later because I didn't want to make a second trip through what felt like a silent hill movie.

I didn't hear much about anything else until today. My sister called me earlier in the day and said she was going to let **B** stay with her for a while and help him find work and try to change his focus from his girlfriend to getting his life together. He's freshly 18, hates living with dad and wants a job. So it seemed like a nice thing for her to offer - I did warn her what I had witnessed the last he was over (4th of July) but she said she was aware and was ok . 

That leads to right this moment, I just got off the phone with her and she was in tears after dropping **B** back off at our dads house. He had apparently not even been at her house for 6 hours before she gave up and sent him right back. He became violent, unprovoked, and started to attack my sisters Fiance for literally no reason. Sadly.. the Fiance won the battle since he was substantially bigger and our little brother is just 18, he's basically still a kid. So the fight didn't last long at all, but it was enough to get people up in arms. My sister had explained he kept pacing around the house, hanging out in the bathroom and not coming out, insisting he peed when he didn't do anything at all. He did not have a phone at this time, so he insisted all night to keep borrowing their phones to text his girlfriend, to which he said he no longer had contact with. He would ask for their phone every 30 minutes, forgetting he had just asked 30 minutes before, and it lasted all night. She decided to drive him back to dads, and the whole way there, he kept asking for a phone charger. But **B** does not have a phone, and he asked every few minutes after forgetting he just asked a few minutes before. 

When she dropped him off at dads, a folder gum wrapper fell out of his back pocket. He picked it up and she asked him ""What was that?"" and he answered ""I don't know it's just a gum wrapper."" She asked again ""what was in that?"" and he answered ""I just always have a bunch of gum wrappers it's just gum"".  

She called me on her way home and cried about the entire experience. Together, we did some research on the internet going over his behavior and may have come across information leading to a potential drug habit. What we do know is that he uses a weed pen, and sometimes something called ""Dabs"". 

I'm absolutely horrified at the possibility he could be on something much worse, his psychotic behavior is NOT normal for him, and it's only been happening for the last month according to similar stories I heard from siblings that live at home. I already have a 24 year old brother in prison for drug related felonies. I don't know if we will get through it again if another brother ends up in jail over something that could have been prevented. I don't know what to do. 

What is anyones opinion on this??? What kind of drug causes these behaviors? What is the appropriate course of action? The home dynamic is toxic and so an intervention doesn't seem possible because our dad also drinks every night... What do we do now? Is there something we can do before it gets worse?

\-

***TLDR******:***  **My 18 year old brother recently started exhibiting strange, extremely paranoid, jealous, and violent behavior. Our family has a history of substance abuse since the family dynamic is toxic as kids into adulthood.** 

**How can we help the situation?** 

**The home environment is a breeding ground for violence and dysfunction, and so the concept of a family intervention is not an attainable goal.**

278,"For some background I had a wonderful boyfriend but it didn’t work out for many reasons such as the age gap, distance, and I found out he did coke at least once a day. I ended up breaking it up because we where kind of drifting but that’s on me not checking my phone as much and sleeping most of my days away or drinking. My current girlfriend had been trying to get with me for months before this and we have dated a few times for no more than a week each time because I couldn’t handle her and I don’t know what it was but I couldn’t fall in love with her but I always liked her. She is quite complicated to be honest, she never pays attention to you for more than 6 seconds at a time, her stubbornness will be the death of her and her attitude. But it as a mix of “I’m not like other girls but I’m exactly like other girls”, the attitude of a “hot Cheeto, long nails girl” and the “I’m so quirky” type of girl. She doesn’t try anything and is plain lazy. She gives up at everything because she got frustrated easily because it didn’t go her way. I’ve caught her telling a mutual friend of ours bragging about how she sometimes will guilt trip me into spending time with her when I already don’t do anything else but be with her. She can be nice and will get me things back over the 100000000000 things I’ve gotten her but only on a good day witch could quickly go bad if one thing goes wrong.  She will say she doesn’t like the things you don’t like to get along with you but turns around and does those things. She is very forgetful but never on our anniversaries. I’ve surprisingly made it almost a year with her but most of the time she does make me want to leave but I feel like I can’t. Our friend group is only made up of four people witch already go against me half of the time because she says things to them that never happened and then says that she doesn’t remember any of it. The more I’ve spent time with her I’ve grown to love her but get annoyed at all those little things that was listed. The only thing keeping me from leaving from that alone is that she will make a big deal out of it because she can be very dramatic. I’ve noticed that she doesn’t anything for attention such as fake falling/ tripping very dramatically, dramatic facial expressions, going on tik tok without me knowing because she had blocked me and has put some extremely sexual things online as if she was wanting someone else. She will flirt to many guys trying to sleep with her and it makes me feel unimportant. Her friends will tell me that she doesn’t stop talking about me but when I’m actually with her, she acts as if I’m not even there unless there are other people around. She always follows trends to be more popular and well most girls do. But she over does it when she tells me that she hates those types of things and people and that she is nothing like that so many times. I’m okay with it if she was but I’m frustrated that she lies to me about it for no reason. 

Sorry for the long background haha..
So now we get to where I am now. She has kind of forced me to get with her before I’ve gotten a chance to say goodbye to my ex-boyfriend. And now almost a year later I still think about him sometimes and wonder what he’s doing. I know I can’t go back to him for the reasons before and how I left things, that’s on my part. But not only that, pride month has reminded me of how lovely it would be to have a boyfriend again. I always joke about being gay, but this girl, even though I think I love her, I think she helped me realize in a way. But I can’t go fully gay, I don’t think I am. But for the most part, I would prefer to have a boyfriend who can actually treat me like a person again. Pay attention to me and not go on there phone and forget everything I’m saying within the next 5 minutes, a guy who will just love and accept me for who I am. Who won’t lie about their personality and say brutal things to draw more attention to themselves all the time. I know that’s a lot to ask for and I’m not trying to say that I’m picky or anything I swear but right now, I feel trapped. Trapped in my small town, my relationship, my house, my head, my rib cage, my lungs.

I know it’s a lot to read and I’m sorry but if there’s any advice of anybody who has come to something similar who knows what it’s like or anything, anyone, please help me.

TL;DR: my girlfriend is hard to keep up with and has showed me that I’m more gay than I thought so now I want I boyfriend that will treat me better but if I leave her, it will ruin my life in this small town. I’m trapped. Help",11Jul2020,2

282,"Background story:

I graduated in December of 2018 with a business degree and pretty good grades. I naively thought things would be pretty simple: I can work for a year or 2, then go for my MBA and go on with a leadership position

I managed to get myself an internship at a startup biotech for business development, then through connections another internship in a venture firm in NYC...then the pandemic hit shutting down the city, unfortunately before I was going to take the GMAT for business school

After a few months of working from home, I kinda realized that this kind of work, while interesting, isn't something I think I'd be willing to do for the next 10 years or so. The pandemic DID kind of slow things down to a crawl to be fair, but the work is a bit less exciting than I imagined it'd be...at least at my level

Regardless, when work slowed down during the pandemic I had some time to think. After some soul-searching I realized that my driving force most of my life was just to please my parents, but now I just cannot seem to find my passion in my degree. Especially painful is that I'm kind of a disappointment to my dad right now anyways. Regularly now at the dinner table, I keep hearing the whole ""back in my day"" stories of how he had things much harder and he still carved himself a successful life right now and he's critical of my lack of passion

Regardless, here I am, in the middle of a pandemic, with disappointed parents, unsure what my passion for my field is, and not knowing where I should even go. Do I keep trying to find work in this pandemic and maybe find a field I can join? Do I try and return to school for something else? Is there some alternative? I just...feel lost",11Jul2020,1

Apart from removing all social media, changing my name and hiding ------------------ what can I do to defuse these extremely passionate/violent people?

Hi --- I am new to reddit, I saw Reddit on YouTube and thought to ask this here due to anonymity.

I wrote a FB post identifying someone who did something similar a USA school shooting here in my country and he killed 53 people. --- He also live streamed it on Youtube.

All my post, to a closed FB group, said was ""This is a photo of the guy and his name is xxx"". thats all it said

A screen shot of my FB post went VIRAL in Asian countries where that group dominates and because they could not read English the people thought the name in blue (the FB posters name) must be the killer of their compatriots.

During the initial phase I received 100's of friend requests and rather disturbing (want to kill me) emails on FB ---- trouble is that even today, 16 months later, I still get the occasional ""friend"" request from these psychotic people. ------

If you look at the FB pages of some of these guys they are full of images of violent religious protest and bloody human corpses that result from the violence of this religion.

I tried to be understanding with it bc her mom was ill and couldn’t risk catching COVID but idk it seemed sketchy whenever she’d invite me to the park and cancel, for 3 months she did that. Literally didn’t see her once for those 3 months. About 2 days ago I confronted her about how she’d been making me feel and stuff with cancelling all the time but still going out with her friends here and there. She told me she really does love me but shit is tough right now. And she asked me to trust that she’ll change and work on her behavior. So we hung out today and I realized that there really is a lot going on in her life. She’s really mean to herself too and I felt bad about it, but it also made me feel weird about her and I. She’s told me that she’s afraid of commitment bc she has the tendency to sabotage everything. This is due to her lack of self-respect. Her mom also just passed last month and it’s been even harder on her and she always tells me that if it’s not one problem, then it’s another. I’ve been there before bc I lost my dad 2 years ago and I remember not being completely available but the girl I was seeing at the time still waited around for me despite me not showing up 100%. At first I felt like this girl was playing me bc she’d always cancel on me whenever SHE would make plans. I don’t blame myself for that even if it was quarantine, I still thought it was weird and seemed fishy. But seeing her again opened my eyes up to the bigger picture. I feel like she genuinely wants me in her life bc she told me she does, she also said she does want to pursue something with me really bad and even went as far as saying that she wants sex to be meaningful. We had sex once and it was good but I know that when a girl says she wants meaning to it then she genuinely likes me. Am I being stupid by waiting around? I don’t wanna feel naive about this situation and waste my time. Needed some opinions and advice :/",11Jul2020,1
285,"So I was really excited to start this new internship working in a lab in a field that I was passionate about. On the first week that I worked, the company did not have any safety equipment and did not tell me that the chemicals were hazardous. I checked the labels and found out that some of them were and so I asked if I can have goggles and they said they had them but couldn’t find any. I asked at least 5 people if they had any and all of them either brushed it off or said they couldn’t find any. I was really uncomfortable with working with the chemicals so I put them aside and did other things. There was no fume hood or anything. The next day I went in to work and brought my own goggles to finish what I didn’t finish they day before.  The person that I was working with told me working with the chemicals can give you a headache and if your head ever hurts, just go and breathe some fresh air. He also told me we’ve all done this and we are still alive and that I was going to be fine.

Later in the week, they took me into this room to handle very hazardous chemicals and I had no training with handling any of that and I told the person I was working with that I was really scared and they didn’t really give me any response and just took me into do it. 

I later told my manager that I felt really unsafe and uncomfortable with doing things like that and he told me that he would never want me to feel uncomfortable at work and gave me this face mask thing but honestly I feel like this company doesn’t take safety seriously at all and it is stressing me out. The labs literally don’t have any safety equipment and I think that I shouldn’t have to ask for every basic safety equipment especially when I don’t even know what I would need or not need because I don’t even have a clue what I’m dealing with. I’m just told to go do it. I really want to quit this internship but I’m not sure if there can be any repercussions. This job makes me so anxious to go into work everyday. I don’t want word to go around in the industry about how I’m a bad worker or anything. 

Should I quit? How should I talk to my manager about it..?",11Jul2020,1
287,"This is such a trivial issue, but I’m just a little sad about the experience. So...
There’s a local hair bow business on Facebook that I get my daughter’s bows from. They’re gorgeous bows and the seller is quite nice, from what I perceived through the few correspondences we’ve had. There’s other moms that have over 300 bows from her, and people put bulk orders in for 60 at a time. The seller does it all on her own too, it’s really impressive! 
I had reached out about her doing a set of custom bows for my daughter and her cousins that matched the theme of my wedding. She agreed to do it and said she’d reach out soon. I know she’s a busy person so I didn’t nag about it, but she didn’t reach out until four days before the wedding saying she forgot about the order and apologized profusely. Again, I understand she’s very busy so I played it off like I had also forgotten and told her not to worry about it because I didn’t want her to feel bad. Then she did a like giveaway thing within her shop where she’d randomly select a few people to receive free bows or shop credit. I won ten solid color bows that I was able to pick the colors of. (This is where my real conundrum starts.) I won the giveaway well over a month ago, and still have not received the bows. In this span of time, there was a couple bow releases that I purchased two bows from (one of which being a Fourth of July bow). Her and I agreed that I’d pick up and pay for those two bows when the other ten were ready. Last week, I ask for an update on the order and she said she’d have it finished by Friday (July 3rd). Then Thursday she said it’d probably be done the next week but I could come pick up the two others. Well now it’s been a full week since last Friday and I haven’t heard anything from her. I don’t want to keep nagging and I feel like I don’t have a right to be upset because she is a very busy person and those bows are free, so it’s not like I’ve lost money on them. My mom on the other hand, thinks I should discontinue business with her after this. 

What would you do? 

I know there’s bigger problems in the world, but this has been weighing on me. I never really win anything and I love to spoil my daughter with cute things like this, so I was quite excited to win them. I just feel as though I’m not going to receive them.",11Jul2020,1

290,"I just turned 20 and have been dreaming about moving out since 16. I love with my parents and my brother. For a very long time my parents have been helicopter parents and very suffocating. I had a pretty decent amount of friends when I was younger and I was never allowed to go to any events probably some if I was lucky. If I did I would have to be dropped and off and picked up, text my friends phone number, they had to speak with a parent and I had to update with them every 5 minutes. They would always stick their nose in my personal life and I was never allowed to make decisions of my own. When I turned 18 I figured they would back off but it’s gotten worse . They feel I should listen and do everything they tell me too. I have a boyfriend of 6 years and they still can’t wrap their heads around it that their 20 year old daughter is dating. My mom treats my boyfriend like he’s a strange criminal and I absolutely hate it. Everytime I go out with my friends or boyfriend they have to call or text me a million times. Once it reaches 11pm I already have 30 missed calls and text massage. Who would think it’s irrational for a 20 yo to be out past 12am. I find it quit toxic and suffocating if you ask me. Every decision I make on my own they get upset that I dont run it by them first or ask if it’s ok. Whenever I voice my opinion or talk about something I plan to do they have to put their two cents and get mad whenever I don’t agree and say I never want to take their advice then compare to their other grown successful children. Guys I’m in nursing school getting my education I’m graduating in a year and I will have a job that will be paying good and stable and I have many business ideas that I’m working on with the little money that I have working at a shifty pharmacy. Now if that doesn’t scream that I am in fact successful and responsible enough to use my own God given brain then I don’t know what else to do. I have my own car that I pay for and try to give my car curfew. My mom threatens to cut off my phone service whenever I don’t answer her calls or texts. Most of the time she calls and texts for no reason just to see where I’m at and who I’m with and yell at me for being out when it’s dark even I texted saying I’ll be home soon I’m still outside at least I have the respect to communicate that I’m still alive and ok. Whenever I’m out with my boyfriend forget about it my phone is going off the hook. There’s been times I’ve been at my boyfriends house and my parents are ringing my phone off the hooks while we’re having sex and it’s pretty actually embarrassing. Just because you pay for my phone bill doesn’t mean you can just bombard me with calls and texts. Every single argument with my mother she finds a way to bring up that I feel like I’m a grown woman because I have some boys(my boyfriends) attention. Guys....my boyfriend and I have been together since my freshman year of high school I’m 20 yos now my parents have known I’ve been with this person this long when is it going to end. Literally almost everyday I think about packing my bags and moving in with my boyfriend but i don’t because I rely on my parents on paying for my tuition and phone bill and little things here there I may need I want to move out and work things out for my own but I don’t want to risk moving out and struggling but I also don’t want to “play it safe” by staying home. And being miserable and feeling like I’m in jail because of financial issues. I also see this hurting my relationship because my boyfriend and I don’t really get to see each other as often as we want because of this and when we’re out and I’m constantly being questioned by parents and her get any actual alone quiet time because I’m always answering to my parents. My boyfriend actually told me that he doesn’t know if we’ll work out because of my parents. I know he didn’t actually mean that cause I know the type of person he is but I feel like he said that so I can finally get the courage to stand up to them and set boundaries but idk. Listen to this also....as the years went one I’ve began to resent them and the only thinh keeps me at peace is being in my bedroom all day and night. Being my age and not a 12 yo You would think it would be ok for me to leave my window open at night during the dead of summer to get some cool air. But no....every single fucking night my mother comes in room demanding me to close my windows because she’s afraid someone will climb up the roof and come in the window. Guys I live on the SECOND FLOOR that is way way way way way off the ground so please someone please explain this logic to me. I think I should be able to determine if I want my window open in my own room and not deal with this anxious bs. My granny just got her visa so she can live in the US with us and she goes back and forth between me and my sisters house. When she’s here my peace doesn’t matter. I help when I can and when I’m up for it but my mother makes it a full time job whenever my granny is here. I never signed up to take care of her and do every single thing but my mom gets mad whenever I don’t and whenever I help I’m being criticized. My mother also makes it a big to say good morning and good night every single night to her and the whole house for what??? I have no idea but it’s exhausting why can’t I just live in peace without having to do all thisZ. I already deal with depression(undiagnosed) and I feel like I have a personality does order or some type of bipolar issue so doing this on a daily make me feel uneasy. Guys please tell me what to do I’m in desperate need of help I’ve been in out of depression since I was a kid and literally homelessness would be more pleasant than this. Can someone give me some valid advice on dealing with my situation and how I can move out and break from them financially",11Jul2020,1
291,"I (24f) have become pretty good friends with my coworker (29m). I like him and I got the feeling that he liked me as more than a friend as well though there’s been no overt flirting. We got a long really well in the office and since covid we’ve been texting and video chatting regularly. He’s described himself as socially inept and while I can tell he likes me as a friend, he has always been quieter and this awkwardness is coming through over text. He’s not super talkative over texts and I’m never sure if I’m forcing a conversation he doesn’t want, or if he’s just poor at texting. This isn’t always the case but more than with anyone else I’ve texted. 

Surprisingly enough, when we video chat, he is much more talkative and seems really happy. He suggests the calls more than I do and always says yes to it when I suggest it. This makes me think it’s just an issue with texting, but because we text more than call, I tend to feel insecure about if I’m annoying him. I say this give some backstory for our previous communication.

Recently, I asked him if he’d like to go for a hike sometime because we’ve been partially furloughed and have the ability to get together as our state opens up. He waited an few hours then answered “THATS A MAYBE” then said “I’m  actually trying to set up a trip with my buddy who has some vacation days to burn”. I said “cool, doesn’t have to be during furlough either.” Then, he started typing for a bit then stopped and ended up not sending anything. He’s kind of a forgetful aloof person, but he remember little details about me so I’m unsure if he forgot I asked or thinks I’m going to bring it up again to ask more directly or if that was his polite way of saying no. 

Should I ask again or let him bring it up? I would normally assume this was a polite no, but he has straight up forgotten important work things that make me think he could easily forget this too. There’s also been other situations where I thought he didn’t care or didn’t want to talk etc and he just misunderstood. Basically this is to say, he exhibits behaviors that normally one would assume mean disinterest, and then that totally ends up not being the case, he’s just poor at communicating. So I’m not sure if I should bring up going for a hike again, or how to say it.",11Jul2020,1

Over the next 7 months my boyfriend sexually abused me and forces me to to things and won’t stop til I’m bawling my eyes out crying.

294,"This may seem open and shut ""do what you want"" , but there are several factors at play here. 

Firstly, it's a fancy lightsaber. 
Yeah. 
I've been a Star Wars fan for several years now but quarantine has kicked it into the big time and I really want a souped up, stunning lightsaber staff similar to Darth Maul's in the Phantom Menace. I do honestly want it not just for myself and to keep as a keepsake, but I know me and my friends would have a lot of fun playing with it at least for a while.

That is part of the concerns, it's 450 fucking dollars and while I am currently in a place to afford such a purchase, this could change in the future. I grew up in significant poverty, and am only recently discovering its effects on both my physical and mental health. One of these effects is that I cannot spend any amount of money without a serious amount of guilt, and I don't want to lose the passion I have for Star Wars due to a misguided purchase that will haunt me forever. 

Alongside this, a very close family member has recently been diagnosed with a serious, potentially terminal illness (i cannot provide further details for privacy's sake) but this is my only remaining family member who I would say holds any degree of unconditional love for me. I am autistic, which is part of why the rest of my family do not want me/will not provide support, but I have had close friends express concern that I am dealing with the news extremely badly and this out-of-character purchase could be a symptom of the grief/stress.

These combinations of factors make it very hard to trust my own judgement, and I don't want to ask friends this for fear of their judgement. My autism means that while i go through phases of Extreme Love for a hobby or media, I don't ever really lose the interest? but 450 dollars is still a Lot of Money. 

Please no advice on the family member situation, i am in therapy and  we are facing the future together, i just want to know if people think I should buy a lightsaber to go alongside it.",11Jul2020,1

296,"About two weeks ago, I fractured my ankle while at a party and haven’t been able to walk. I’ve been scooting around on a walker around the house and it’s so exhausting doing simple tasks for myself. I’m already depressed so this makes it so much worse for me. 

Since I haven’t been able to do much of anything except lay in bed, I have to ask my boyfriend to help me do things to help out, which I’m usually the one who takes care of the house, myself, and more times him, too. So this is tough for me.

Recently he’s been frustrated because I’ve been asking more of him when I need it, and it’s made me more depressed. More of the time, he leaves me at home for him to go off and hang out with his friends all night, sometimes bringing them over to our house while I’m in the bedroom crying.

297,"As I'm only 11-13, I still live with my Mom and Dad. And I share a room with my sister. My parents, like most, also have us clean our rooms. And my sister is younger, were gonna call her Vanessa. Vanessa, has never cleaned up our room by herself, and she's younger and I don't expect her too. So I'm okay with me always cleaning it up by myself. But my parents, are always telling me ""Aesthetic\_Daisy if Vanessa never cleans up the room. She'll never learn responsibility."" I do understand where they are coming from, but I was worried that our room would never get cleaned. As I said, I've been cleaning up our room for years. As Summer vacation is coming soon, I've wanted to pull an all-nighter. And my Dad said, ""Well, you need to do what I've been asking you get to done."" And I'm okay with that, so I ask my sister to clean up our room, and I tell her to call me or ask me for her with anything.  She starts off fine, I put on Youtube on our TV while she cleans up. I don't wanna clean anything while she's doing it just in case she needs help. Now almost 4-5 hours later, she's practically made no progress. She gets distracted, and I play a HUGE part in this, so when we lose another hour or two I'm not upset bc we had fun and it was fine. I told her again to come to ask me if she needs help. I talk with my older brother, well call him Andrew. Andrew is explaining his version of a Marvel and DC crossover, and my Vanessa keeps coming in and playing around. I ask her very nicely, and I'm starting to get a little frustrated because I have been asking her to clean up the room and come get me if she needs help. Andrew starts to notice me getting flustered, and talked to my sister. And I was just telling him not to bother, and I should just go get my Mom and/or Dad. He told me not to worry, and I was getting mad so I just walked out. Soon after I heard her say, that I wasn't helping her. But I just decided to brush it off. 1-2 hours later, little progress has been made. So I go talk to my Dad, hoping he would help me. (BIG MISTAKE) And he starts saying, ""Well, you were probably telling her and not asking her."" And, I might have but I told her I'm sorry if I was being mean and everything earlier, and she told me I wasn't. Long story short with that first conversation I had with my dad, he made me even madder. Not EVEN 15min later, he decides to come to bother me after he KNOWS that he hurt my feeling and I'm gonna need a minute to collect myself. And he says, ""Your attitude isn't gonna work from me, and that all-nighter probably isn't going to happen is you keep this up. And I'm trying to be ""nice"", but you're here taking advantage of that, as well being MEAN to your sister. If I were you, I would make a 180, with your attitude."" And I'm absolutely in confusion at this point. And I say something which I along the lines of, ""Well, I wasn't trying to be rude, and I should have come and got you. Andrew was trying to defuse the situation. But I should have come and got you."" And I at this point, I'm getting even madder, he says something about how I should have gotten him or my mom. Or I could have cleaned it up by myself, and I feel like my mouth was wide open. Because they have been telling me for months that I need to let her clean it up by herself. And this made me fly off the handle, but I knew I couldn't show that because he would retaliate and do something outrageous. So instead I just say, ""Well you guys have been telling me I need to let Vannessa do it-"" He cuts me off and says, ""I meant YOU need to clean up most of it. And let her clean up the rest."" And I'm thinking in my mind, that he is CONTRADICTING every little word he says. And Vanessa isn't a baby she is fully capable and very intelligent. She also probably has the biggest heart ever! But, when he says this I could have yelled so loud in this face, I would have knocked him into next week.  Then I just ask Vanessa to stop, and then he gets on my case saying, ""Well don't make her stop, and you already said you'll clean it up tomorrow."" At this point, my blood is boiling, I stop and think to myself if it's really worth it to fight with this person at this point. Even though I disagree with everything he is saying. I just ask him, can I clean it up and not expect to do the all-nighter anymore. And I shit you not, he says ""No, but good talk."" He gets up and walks away, I wait for me to start venting under my breath. My mom is trying to calm me down. But I'm just too upset, and I'm asking and wondering how in the WORLD does that make sense to stop cleaning! First of all, we have bunk beds and I happen to just of the top bunk, which is my bed, I could land on something and hurt myself. And as I'm also a dancer that would be, ""No, Bueno!"" And I start listing off things in my head of more reasons as to why my dad makes him look like a moron. Everyone else in the house just leaves me alone.

303,"This is my first Reddit post so please forgive me for any mistakes. I am a 19yr old girl who has decided to take a few months off from college because I’m not sure if what I was studying for is right for me.

For my whole life I was pushed towards being in the engineering/computer coding path. It’s what my whole family thought (and still thinks) it was what I was going to become. I’ve always been put in classes like robotics, high school engineering classes, computer science classes, etc...

But now that I’m in college I don’t know if engineering or computer science is something I actually want to do or if it’s something I’m just expected to do because it’s all I’ve known. 

I don’t know if I should do anything else because I know I’m good at what I do. My family just says “you spent so must time doing it so what’s the problem?” 

My dad doesn’t know I’m taking a break from school. And he’s the one who always supported me no matter what. 

I know I’m young and have plenty of time to find my own way in life, but I don’t wanna disappoint anyone. 

My family would always brag about how proud they are of their “future engineer” who’s supposed to “make it big and be successful.” 

It’s been this way my whole life. 

Should I continue going into this field of work or should I try something new? 

Is it okay to suddenly not know what to do with a career choice?

How do I go about telling them in questioning what they raised me to be?

I still don’t know if this is something I want or not, but any advice you can give me will be amazing.

I'm mostly worried about the social aspect. I don't have any friends at the moment (long story) so I'm going in completely blind and without a crutch. I'm on par with my school when it comes to workload and my education, so I'd assume that I'm good on that, but I can never be sure until I go in.

306,"So I have loved this girl since high school. We have fallen in love and I'vefound out she has herpes. She won't kiss me but she will hug me- they're wonderful. Although She strongly refuses to sleep with me,  in fear of passing it to me. She has said that when she passes I can make love to her before she's buried.  She recently has been talking about suicide, and wants to do it in front of me so I can experience her afterwards. I would be the last thing she sees when she leaves this world and ill send her out with love. It sounds super romantic but I don't want to watch the girl I love die. What do I do?",11Jul2020,1
307,"I just found out that a coworker has tested positive for covid. No one at work was really surprised because apparently they all knew that she completely ignored all the precautions and was constantly leaving to go to Mexico. Now her whole shift is gonna be on leave indefinitely since one of them has begun to show symptoms. This also means that I’ll have to work a lot more to cover their absence. This is the least of my worries to be honest. 

I live with my dad. He happens to be very sick. And the fact that I may now possibly have the disease scares the hell out of me. I’m afraid to go home. I’m afraid it’s already too late and he’s got it now. Just a few days ago I worked with one of the possible infected people. 

I’m pissed off that this person ignored all the safety and precautions. I’m pissed off that my other coworkers knew and didn’t say anything. (I’m the newest hire there and even though I’ve been there for a year, I haven’t really built friendships since the age gap is as big as 25+ years). 

I’m really stressing since I found out and I even considered just quitting on the spot. But I can’t because Of the way the world is right now it be difficult to get another job and I really didn’t want to screw over the other coworkers since a whole shift is out already. 

Our job is already stressful enough as it is and I just don’t know what to do. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",11Jul2020,1

I took two Advil maybe an hour or two ago because of pain. It doesn’t really help that much and because I kept complaining about it my mom offered something stronger for me to take (a hydrocodone/acetaminophen pill, better known as a norco I think) 

I refused at first because I was worried about mixing it with the Advil but she kept pushing until I took it, which was maybe 45 min at most after I took the Advil. 

A little after that I started feeling kinda dizzy and lightheaded and at some points nauseous. I tried eating something and drinking water and it hasn’t helped much.

So my husband told them we could take in their cat (again, supposed to be temporary). This cat has turned out to be a terror. 
He tries to literally walk on and swat our 6 month old. He’s very floofy so everything is always covered in hair no matter how much we brush him or how much we clean. 
He kicks litter out of his box. We thought it was because it was too small so we got a much bigger one but he still continues to kick litter out everywhere.
He’s broken multiple window shades on multiple windows. 
He scratches at our door every night (waking the baby, who sleeps in the room with us) and has left claw marks on the door. 
He scratches at our couches despite having multiple scratching posts. 
He attacks my ankles if I get up for water at night. 
He scratches or bites every other time he nudges us to pet him. 
The in laws themselves are an issue but at least they don’t live here. The cat lives here and has made new mom life more difficult than it has to be. We’ve tried to remedy his bad behavior by catering to anything that could be bothering him (with the exception of letting him in our room because of the baby), but he continues to be an a**hole.

321," 

So, I rented a basement suite not too long ago and fully moved in on the first of May, this year. When I initially came to check out the basement, (before signing lease and paying DD) my landlord told me that they were currently in the middle of renovations upstairs. That's fine. I have a small dinky little kitchen area, with no stove, though he told me they would get one installed before I moved in.

In the basement, there were three rooms - two bedrooms and one other room which I didn't find out about until I moved in. They showed be the bigger bedroom and said the other one would be for their AIRBNB business... Okay? I don't like having strangers in my basement suite but I was really desperate for a rental, so I let it slide.

Time skip to the first week of finishing my move.

I am now told that I actually will be taking the smaller room, which is the size of a laundry room, and the bigger one is going to the AIRBNB. The other room which I had no idea what was inside turns out to be my landlords husbands drag room. They also sprung upon me that they would be staying in the airbnb room until upstairs reno's were complete. So not only was I basically having my privacy invaded by my landlords constantly, but I was getting a bedroom downsize as well.

But again, I was desperate for a rental, so I let it slide.

Time skip to now. Their renovations have been fully completed for four weeks now, yet they constantly come down to my suite to use my kitchen and bathroom. And oh my god-- they are total clean freaks. They get mad at me for having a dish in the sink for under ten seconds while I go take a piss, they get mad at me for having my skincare products neatly placed on the bathroom counter, and they get mad at me for how I hang up my towels. Yesterday I was served with an eviction notice because of the towel, actually. Their reasoning was because it was not ""folded neatly and with care on the towel rack"".

I am so disappointed. I just moved into a new, big city, and I already am getting evicted? Do I even bother with trying to dispute the eviction? I don't want to live with landlords who constantly breach my privacy and want me to keep everything looking like a hotel! I can't even put a dish in the sink for a minute while I go pee! Help!!

323,"Honestly this last year has really ruined my relationship with both my parents. Over quarantine I started harming myself in more drastic ways because of homeschooling difficulties plus then quarantine(cutting). I’ve burned myself before and when I was young I’d hit my head and yank on my hair in the back of my head, my mom would always get mad and tell me to stop being a baby and hitting my head. Now with the quarantine my depression has gotten worse and I was struggling with suicidal thoughts almost daily. I gained a little weight like everyone else, and I happen to already be chubby. I’ve started wearing pants because of the cuts, my clothes may be hot as baggy but I can still fit into 90% of them just fine. My mom is convinced I gained so much I can’t fit into them, and after my continual reassurance it’s not that, she wouldn’t stop. She bought me 6 pairs of shorts 2x my size (it’s really no hate, I’m chubby, it just hurt to see her do that). She knows I don’t like being bought clothes without being consulted(she gets annoyed if I don’t want them, but doesn’t get me stuff I like and constantly pushes me to keep them even tho their always too big.). Today she got mad I don’t wear anything but sweatshirts and pants. Then we had a conversation, where she told me I draw more attention to myself wearing ugly unfitting clothes, keep in mind she doesn’t comprehend I know how clothes feel, she says everything is too small, even when my pants were literally falling of if me cuz the waist was too big. It really hurts, she’s never once even questioned my mental health, she only got irritated I didn’t dress up or wear anything besides sweatshirts, and when I do she makes fun of it and gives her opinion about how I look. It’s a constant conversation about how I’m bigger, and lazy, and pretty much to sum it up a disappointment. She just gets mad if I forget to take my medication, and the other day got angry my friend and I were eating to much. She’ll defend my stepdad and his horrible and creepy actions till the dawn of time using my dad as an example”well you’re dad did worse “, but constantly blame every fight on me calling me selfish, after she literally got angry I didn’t agree. She’s so stuck in her own opinions, she lies and tells everyone our relationship is amazing, but last week was the first hour we’d hungout in months like we’d use to. She wants me to count calories Etc, and honestly doesn’t care what I think about it. It’s like she’d be happier if I had a eating disorder, which she basically approves of. She makes fun of how the calories I don’t eat during the week are made up by me eating with my friends. I asked if I could take a day off in 2 weeks from my hour and a half of class to play with the puppy we’re getting, she literally got mad and called me lazy. She wants me to do things I don’t know how to do, that honestly she should do like making my school transcript. She never cooks, but complains about how we eat out but then defends it by saying I should step up. I know I sound selfish, but I feel like half of the shit she wants me to do is her job, she lets me buy stuff a lot and in those aspects is nice but honestly she hasn’t been there for me months if not years. I don’t really know her let alone wanna be affectionate with her anymore, but she pretends we’re perfect. I feel like everything with me is summed up in my weight, test scores, and my ability to get a job in the future not me and my happiness. My dad is barely there, but gets grumpy I don’t see him, when I explained how what my mom does really hurts, he said “well we don’t want you being obese”. Like yes I understand that, but there are so many other ways to discuss it with me then shaming me, and making me feel guilty whenever I’m hungry. He moved when I was young, and lately it’s been bothering me how he just up and left me for another family. I feel guilty feeling upset with them, but honestly I’d trade anything to feel like they were at least happy with me. I’m in a constant downward spiral of self hated, and the only thing I can do is sit there and take it, cuz I’m not allowed to be upset by what either of them say.",11Jul2020,1

Now I don’t think her boyfriend likes me much at all because sometimes I catch him staring at me with look of hatred or at the very least anger/ distrust, whenever he talks to me he speaks with a lot of attitude, and he didn’t do these things before I was friends with her or before they were dating. To add future fuel to the fire friends of mine have noticed the same things I have and one friend said the when her and I are alone working together he always watching it at the very constantly looking at what we’re doing.

Around this same time, my mental health has been going at a decline, in which I haven’t told anyone (they either wouldn’t believe me, they wouldn’t care, or I’d be too scared of bring seen differently.) So, as you could imagine, I’m feeling pretty shitty about myself as it is, and this person is simply not helping.

So suffice to say I hate making mistakes and when i do, i usually lie about it and cover up.

I'm maturing now and realizing the importance of being truthful and the consequences of lying, I'm trying my best to be more open and honest, even though it is difficult, since its little more than my fight or flight response to confrontation.

Anyway, my best friend is very conservative and more on the religious side of things, so she hates smoking and the general hook up culture we live in. On the other hand, i don't care for such sentiments so i usually commit these 'sins'. However, fearing her reaction I didn't really tell her about this side of my life.

Bob and I have been friends since childhood. We're in our 20s now. While Bob and I jive as friends, Bob does not jive as well with my main group of friends. I hold a party each year for said main group of friends. I invited Bob over once, but I think their presence made some of the other people uneasy. Since then, I do my own thing with Bob (and a few other people who also jive with Bob), and do another thing with my main group of friends.

I'm not sure if Bob knows about the continuation of these social events without them. High school Bob would have been very hurt that they were not invited, but we're adults now and I honestly don't know how Bob would feel. Something tells me knowing they have not been invited all these years would make Bob feel at least a little bummed out.

Bob recently told me they have been going through some rough stuff, and wants to confide in me. (They haven't yet.) I said I'm willing to listen. It's important to note that Bob holds me up to very high esteem. They always talk about how great of a friend I am. I feel guilty about this, because I might have done something unbeknownst to Bob that hurts Bob.

338,"I (30F) recently started a new job in a new company and industry. Being new, I made an extra effort to be friendly and open with everyone in the team. 

My coworker (~40M) (who is married and has a five year old son) last Friday as I was packing up to leave work, asked me if I wanted to get a drink with him on the weekend. At this point, no one else was in the office. I was taken aback by the request and said no I was busy. I’m a single parent with a young child and mentioned to him that I wanted to spend the weekend with my child. Then he said that was ok, and that we could go somewhere child friendly. The persistence and his lack of ability to take a hint was stating to give me anxiety (I am still on antidepressants from my postnatal depression which started two years ago) so I said I had to go and started to walk away. At this point he said let me give you my number. I said I already had it from the corporate directory (of course I didn’t), and he said “no it’s not on there” so I said ok give me your number and if I find free time I’ll text you. So I took his number and left. 

The following Monday, I had a standing meeting with my manager and mentioned how uncomfortable I felt with this interaction. She told me she believes it was innocent and that because his wife and son are overseas (they were meant to come to the country we live in but due to COVID that’s been put on hold), this coworker is lonely and because I was so open and friendly that he genuinely wanted to be friends. At first I accepted this answer but thinking about it again, I feel like this is a cop out and making excuses for him. She asked what I wanted her to do and I said for him to be reassigned to another project and be removed from mine entirely to help give me some distance. She agreed and he was reassigned to another piece of work. This reassignment was confirmed with him twice on two consecutive days, and his manager came to my desk to confirm it to me personally.

Then yesterday I get an email from him which said in the email that I should take as an official request for me to “not exclude him” from any correspondence to do with my project. His reasoning was that he needs to stay across it from an awareness and learning perspective, and because he started working on it with me, he doesn’t want to lose track of it. 

I don’t know if it’s relevant but he’s from the subcontinent and maybe there’s some sort of cultural elements that are coming into play, but all I know is that my gut is giving me a bad feeling. 

Am I being nuts? What should I say back? I’m thinking I will just say something along the lines of “thanks for your note, &lt;his manager&gt; informed me on xx day that you are no longer working on &lt;my project&gt;. As such, it may not always be appropriate to include you on all correspondence. If you have any concerns with this please speak to &lt;his manager&gt;.

In a nutshell, let me tell you the relationship I have with my family, I love them, my parents love my sister more than me, for them she's always RIGHT, and I'm the one who is wrong. Psychology says that if you keep doing things for someone (in my case, parents) unconditionally, they take you for granted. My sister does nothing for them, shouts at them (this shouting makes them believe that she is correct, as it gets intimidating for the other end), makes up stories to ensure I don't get to do what I want. She has an upper hand over me, no matter how much I try to prove my innocence and concern, I'm never believed by my parents. Once due to the agony I've been enduring for a long time I punched a wall with my right hand, fractured it to a point that it resulted in an abnormality post treatment. Why did I hurt myself, adding more to what was already there. Now I live in fear of hurting myself as there is way I change things, I feel helpless, I've talked to people for advice, for them of what they have seen of her is opposite of what I tell them, as she has a different face for people outside and at home. Some agreed with me and called her an 'attention seeker', a person trying to dominate others, if failed to do, she's gets out of control and again that shouting, the other person is forced to take their words back as in public space such as work, a women shouting over a man is considered the man's fault (atleast in my society).

All I'm left with is to take good care of my parents till their last breath, and settle with how the atmosphere is, which is not going to change. I decide not to overthink things, but it's hurts to have unjust behaviour against yourself.",11Jul2020,1

351,"Strap in for a long, wild fucking ride folks; this shit gets bumpy.  （＾Ｕ＾）ノ 

So I (15f) lost my virginity.  Yesterday.  I’ve never been too caught up on the idea of virginity (or losing it for that matter) or anything like that, I never thought it would be some great big deal.  I didn’t even think it would necessarily have to be with someone I was dating.  I’m not on any kind of birth control, keep that in mind.
So this is where the story starts: I’m a lifeguard at a pool and working with to other guards (both guys.  I’m in the pool chilling because no one is there and we can do that when we’re alone.  One guy walks up to me and obviously started hitting on me.  I freaked, lied and said I wasn’t a virgin so I could seem cool, and things led to other things and... well I’m not proud of this, but we ended up fucking in the goddamn pool.  No one else could see, and it only lasted 30 seconds or so because he asked if I wanted to head somewhere more private and I said “let’s wait til the end of the shift and finish this then” bc I was freaking out because I just had a dick INSIDE ME for the first time EVER in a public place, without a condom.  Nobody saw, including the other lifeguard there so that’s good.  He didn’t cum or anything so there’s probably not a high chance of me getting pregnant I don’t think.
I’ve always been very good at seeming like everything’s okay when they are very much NOT so (very angsty, I know) so I just got out of the pool real seductively and went to the bathroom to wash up.  And by wash up, I mean A) pee (bc Im pretty sure you’re supposed to do that after sex to prevent a yeast infection or help with STDs or something?) and B) wet my fucking hands with the sink and scrub the inside of my cooch for a minute or so.  I was shaking from adrenaline and freaking out at the thought of either getting pregnant somehow (I know nothing really happened but precum is a thing and the women in my family are all super fertile, and I started ovulating today so there might have been a chance) or maybe getting a whole grocery list’s worth of STDs.  Afterwards, I went and read for about 30 minutes out of the water, then got really paranoid again and got in the water to viciously and violently scrub in and around vagina for another minute or so while no one was looking.  We never ended up doing anything afterwards (thank god) because I had to scram as soon as the shift ended to go work a shift at a different and very far away pool.  We have each others number already so we messaged for a bit (I played it totally cool like nothing was wrong).
It’s been about 36 hours since it all happened.  At the beginning I felt so worthless and disgusting, I just wanted to curl up into a ball and never leave.  I never cried or anything, I never do, and for the most part I didn’t react physically.  I got home around 10 hours later and played it cool, nobody knew anything had ever happened and I will NEVER tell them.  Although that sounds naive and immature, I genuinely have a problem with sharing things with others, even close friends and family, and it would bring on a whole other slew of problems for me if I did tell someone.  I also think that somehow in a really convoluted way, keeping it a secret feels like a way to gain power back in a situation where I felt powerless.  Anyways as soon as I got home (about 10 hours after we did the deed) I showered and went immediately to bed.  It was almost like I was in shock, I didn’t want to cry nor was I happy, I just wanted to feel numb, feel calm.  I just remember thinking every once in a while:  ℎ𝑜𝑙𝑦 𝑠ℎ𝑖𝑡 𝑑𝑖𝑑 𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑡 𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑦 𝑓𝑢𝑐𝑘𝑖𝑛𝑔 ℎ𝑎𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑛 𝑡𝑜 𝑚𝑒?  Mainly I think I was just terrified of getting pregnant or and STD.  
Now that the initial shock has worn off I’ve started to notice something odd: I’m really fucking horny.  I’ve always been a somewhat sexual person and I’m no stranger to pleasing myself, so I went to town today.  The only difference is that I usually go for the clit, but today I was REALLY feeling it and went straight for the 🕳 and the whole time I thought about the dude.  And we’ve been messaging all day, me telling him how horny I am mostly, but I’ve actually been busy so I can’t (and am kinda scared) to meet him again.  But I think I’m...  excited?  Call me a slut all you want but I really want to have that experience again, this time with a condom and a proper atmosphere and finish ;)
Mostly I’m just concerned about STDs.  How likely is it that I got one from him?  He was very obviously not a virgin, he both said he wasn’t and acted like he wasn’t so pretty strong evidence to suggest he’s been with other girls before.  We were only... tango-ing for like 30 seconds before we stopped, we were in a literal chlorinated pool, and I scrubbed my cooch clean TWICE within like 30 minutes of it all.  
But, there was no condom...

If we do go at it again, there will most definitely be a condom involved btw 🙃.

But yeah how screwed am I scale from 1-10?  I’m not too worried about pregnancy because of just how slim the chance is, but I know I won’t hesitate to get an abortion if it comes to it.  Is it normally to feel this horny after my first time?  This may be way too much info but is it normal to have major diarrhea afterwards?  I don’t know if I can credit the shits I’ve had all day to my terrible eating habits, the fact I had sex yesterday, or if I’ve gotten some sort of fast-acting STD.  Will I ever come to full terms with my sexuality?  How can I get to a place where I can feel both comfortable enough with my own body and my hormones to have sex comfortably ever again?
Side note but can I get an STD from giving a blowjob?  If so will it affect just my mouth area or yknow, spread into my immune system and shit.  Asking for a friend.

P.S. if you’re the dude who I fucked yesterday, sorry if you just read this, situation was fucked from all ends my dude (no pun intended), but we should still meet up ;)",11Jul2020,1

369,"I got hired on at a small restaurant as somebody that would be trained as a cook, I thought cool, as long as it’s not dishwashing because that’s what my first job was and I hated it, there was no indication that I would be dishwashing and there was indication that the owner was hiring on dishwashers which made me think there was already one or two. Well wrong, my main job has been dishwashing which a side of basically being a helper wherever I’m needed and learning a bit here or there when it’s convenient. To be blunt, I’m hating it, the staff usually bring all dirty dishes they’re done with back at once not allowing me to finish in a timely manner. I made two food ideas today, spent the rest of my time either being a helper or washing dishes over my shift. We didn’t get out until an hour an a half after closing. Frankly I’m hating it. I’m afraid that if I leave I’m fucking over the person who hired me and that I’ll seem like a puss for not being able to handle this job, I just thought I was being hired on as a cook to be trained but very little training has happened.

370,"Okay, so my friend (let me call him X) is an aspiring youtuber. He has linked his Instagram account to his channel, and now has almost a 1000 followers on his Instagram.
His Instagram posts are usually snippets of his YouTube videos, promos for them, or just little content that didn't find its way into a video.
Recently, somebody he knows in person (let me call him Y), started posting hate comments on many of his Instagram posts. Most of these comments were derogatory terms, and calling X a trans, etc.
X asked Y to stop, but Y flat out refused. X tried deleting his comments, but they keep popping up again and again. 
Y claims he is doing it so X 'doesn't have to face it in the future'. Which is bullshit. 
X has asked a few close friends to report the account for bullying. I disagreed, and told him we probably need more people reporting for any action to be taken (ofcourse, I reported the account as well). I asked him to put a screenshot of the hate comments in a story, and ask his followers to block/report that account.
X refused, saying they have around 300-350 mutual followers, and they will most probably take his side, so he doesn't want to post any such story.
Ofcourse, the simplest solution would be to block that user, which X did, but Y made a new account and starting doing the same thing.

372,"The title says it all. 

I have been wanting a dog for a long time but never actually got around the ida to adopt one. I have been seriously thinking about doing it for about a month &amp; have been researching a ton about various fog breeds i can adopt. 

I believe this will make me a responsible adult,  help me make friends, help me with my loneliness &amp; in hindsight also make me seem a tad bit interesting to girls since having or being a dog lover is a rage now a days.

The only problem I have is my roommate is against the idea of a house pet as I work crazy 50-60 hours a week &amp; most of the time I'm worried my roommate will have to rake the dog out for a walk &amp; do the fog chores.

How can I convince my roommate that having a pet is something that will actually help me &amp; my loneliness, make me a better person somehow &amp; honestly (I hope so) could possibly break my streak of continuous romantic failures and rejections.

My roommate has his own business &amp; doesnt work more than 5-8 minutes driving distance from his business location as opposed to me who works an hour away from home &amp; back.

Firstly,  is it a good idea to adopt a dog &amp; if yes. How should I break it up to my roommate?

Due to those things last night I made the mistake of harming myself. It’s not something that I turn to often and I never have the intention of killing myself because I’d feel to guilty for leaving my loved ones behind. It’s been an on and off thing since 2018 and I haven’t done it in months but after doing it yesterday I feel extremely guilty.

But because of Covid, its not like I can get out and hit the gym or socialize anywhere. It's hard to find things to do with friends I have because it's the video game we bond over.

375,"Hello there!

**Context:**

This thought just came to me after reading a post in another sub. A specific comment was about how it's never ""good /bad"" to break up with someone for different reasons and a reply was basically ""while I agree this shouldn't apply to marriage"". Guy then elaborated that he meant it's all too common in modern society rather than trying to solve issues. Another person wrote societal norms are basically juvenile, bursting love vs. marriage but that won't ever work because the purple haze won't last forever and then problems start to emerge...Problems most won't try solving since they are young enough to find someone else. Basically, guy said we aren't mature enough to have great marriages.

**My problem:**

It's not whether I agree with context above or not, it's more about the idea that I feel I am mature enough to make an effort to solve problems in a marriage or simply, a relationship before that. I feel mature but when I see around I see people breaking up over trivial matters, getting batshit crazy over trivial matters, lying instead of having a thicker skin and tell their SOs what their concern is so they can actually come up with a solution...well, when I see all this, I just have this almost automatic wall of distrust. I know I should open up to people but cowardly or not, I fear disappointment. I simply want someone who's open and confident enough to work as a team. To criticize me and let me criticize her (in a constructive manner, that is). Someone who can be pulled back down to Earth if needed and someone who pulls me down to Earth too if needed.

But this wall prevents me from forming any kind of romantic relationships. Does anyone have a few ideas where to start? I know I need therapy but I'm not in a place I can afford it...yet.",11Jul2020,2

I have been meaning to find a new job for almost a year, I am bored with what I do, I lack motivation. I have been doing what I am doing for 4 years, nothing is exciting, it's repetitive task. I have spoken to my manager about it several ocassions but he just like me where I am. I was also overloaded so I asked for help, eventually my manager hires someone BUT this guy is very senior and joins in with a senior title. I will address him as 'new guy' in the rest of this story; so anywho he gets very enthusiastic and suddenly takes all the lead to improve whatever I have built for 4 years. He is also not a team player and likes all the focus on him; I find it very hard to interact with him. 

Unfortunately for me- repetitive work, lack of interest compounded by lockdown, my productivity has gone down. I am dragging to finish deadlines; while new guy is shining and checking my work.

Anywho, today the whole team is on video call; my manager tells that we have some restructuring and that one of the junior guys will be directly reporting to a colleague (not the new guy, who is someone who started 6 months later than me). So, I nod my head and say how we will also be interviewing for another junior role in the future; to which my manager says ""yes that's right and that person will be reporting to new guy"". I am sure everyone say my upset face, I sat through the rest of the meeting trying to keep it cool. I obviously was hoping any new help will be reporting to me but vola! 

Today I found myself worthless.

Today I felt useless

Today I felt my self respect had just been shot.

381,"Hi there,

I see a lot of instances (through various forms of media, posts, etc) of people getting in to careers they love, without going to school or really having a background in it.

I have about 2 years of college under my belt at this point (I’m 25 atm, have been in and out of school a few times). But I’ve never really found anything that speaks to me. I have a few interests that I would love to be able to pursue professionally, but I have literally no experience in any of them. 

I see a lot of stuff about “just doing it” and learning as you go. But that seems so unfathomable to me. I’m interested in filmmaking and pizza making (weird combo, I know), but I have no idea how I just “go do it”. I live in a studio apartment that barely has a space that would qualify as a kitchen, and it seems to me that filmmaking requires a decently big investment to get started. 

I feel like I might have a bit of a defeatist attitude, or maybe I’m just making excuses for myself. But, I really truly wish I could find a way to pursue these career paths I idealize.",11Jul2020,1

384,"I have multitude of issues that range from career choice to relationships to accepting the life I am given.

&amp;#x200B;

I am 28 years old, and just experienced the first deployment in our marriage. I have two useless degrees, one of which I had an incredibly low GPA with no experience or expertise to show for it. Because of my history of sexual assault, abuse and drugs use, I have developed anxiety and depression which now keep me from pursuing anything, really. I'm easily terrified of doing anything and the only comfort I've had is working office jobs at schools. And because my husband is military, I doubt I will have any stability in career choice (I'm too stupid to be a nurse). I'm also scared of doing delivery-type jobs because of the area I live in, plus I'm a woman. Although a flexible job seems ideal, I know that won't be enough for the lifestyle that my husband wants.

I worked as a substitute teacher but because of COVID-19, I am unemployed and realized that it is NOT  a secure job. I feel incredibly stuck; I've spoken to academic/career counselors in my last college I attended, programs for spouses and even considered enlisting in the military.

I've developed chronic urinary tract infections since the beginning of college (8 years now) and I know that will prevent me from taking on careers such as military and law enforcement.

I watched from my window until the middle floor neighbors basically said ‘sorry we don’t know you or anybody by the name you gave so we’re going to bed’

At this point the mom starts sobbing and I just saw her two little kids in the car crying too and it broke my heart so I went down there and said they can stay here but I literally only have a single twin sized bed that they’ll all have to share and no tv or anything either, which she’s okay with.

We come inside and the kids start talking about how they hate being homeless and the mom tells them that they should be grateful to be homeless because it lets them travel around to all these fun peoples houses and swim in the hotel pools.

Mom full out in front of the kids if I want to smoke a bowl with her and whips it out in front of them. Let me preface this next part by saying I am by no means qualified to talk about how poor people spend their own money, because I am pretty broke myself and honestly life is really rough for some people right now. I am just worried that this mom somehow has enough money to buy weed but not enough to find a roof for her kids’ heads. Not only that, but she smokes weed nonchalantly in front of them (they can’t be older than 4 and 6). I don’t know what I should say in the morning or what obligation I have to continue housing them because I can’t just let two little kids live on the fucking street but this apartment is practically an attic and I barely have any food and also don’t feel super comfy with people being in here when I’m not, and I don’t wanna feel obligated to stay at home all day because of that.

388,"had to create an investor pitch presentation and this involved research and completing financials, business models, etc - things I've never done before. Took me hours, spent all week on it, and I truly did try my best. I've never done it before so it was a challenge for me. When I presented my boss pointed out everything that he could possibly find that is wrong with it. It was so humiliating and it was in front of like four other co-workers as well, and i could lowkey see them smiling awkwardly throughout it bcs of how stupid I must have looked. I was so embarassed afterwards.

 Even the color scheme was ""wrong"" (which we don't even have one yet so I just went with shades of blue, grey, and white) anD the template itself was wrong bcs it was too ""techy"" which i don't get how bcs this is gonna be presented to investors putting their money...  into tech ....  make it make sense ...They just kept pointing out how wrong everything was, including all my financial numbers. I honestly did the best with what I had which was googling everything. 

It was so embarassing and idk man every other coworker is constantly being praised for their work, so I guess it hurts a little. I get pointing out if the content was wrong, but with the VERY LITTLE INFO THEY GIVE ME AND HAVING TO DO EVERYTHING FROM GOOGLING IT IDK I'D SAY I TRIED MY BEST. 

As soon as that presentation ended (it was online btw) I shut my laptop and burst into tears immediately. Like it was just so humiliating and it's been hours but I can't stop thinking about it. Im not a very confident person so knowing that people think I'm ""stupid"" and being embarassed like this, I can't stop thinking about it. 

Idk what to do now. I obviously have to fix the content and show it to my boss again, but idk im just embarassed overall. I think I'm just gonna keep it low for the rest of the contract. The managers are always joking around with the other employees but never with me, idk im not a social or ""cool"" person and have a hard time acting like that with my superiors. I feel like they don't take me seriously, idk if it's cause I'm younger than alot of of the employees or they genuinely don't like me, but nothing I say is ever taken to the same regard as everyone else's opinion. 

One time before this, there was this budget that I didnt even fill out but the employee who had done it filled it out completely wrong. But, they think I did it and start explaining to me everythiNGGG that's wrong with it and how I need to fix it. I said yeah I'll fix it, but I wasn't the one who did. They didn't care and still spoke to me like I did it and they were like ""did you see what you did wrong the first time? :))"" idk if they realize I don't have the confidence to take L's like this like I'll literally just cry myself to sleep at night  ❤️❤️❤️

Yeah, I just don't think they're ever gonna like or take anything I do. Even though this post is long as hell it felt nice to write it down. Idk this is life I guess. It is what it is :/

392,"So my girlfriend has been working at a supermarket for about a year now and she’s having an issue with one of her coworkers.

 (let’s call him Jim(18M)and we’ll call my girlfriend Sam(18F) I am 18M.)

Let me make it known that Jim knows very well that me and Sam are dating and that she has no interest in him... and yet he still does this anyways.

So Jim started off by buying Sam flowers which I didn’t think too much about. Next he would start to change the days he worked so Jim could work on the same days as Sam which her and me didn’t realize until recently. 

The thing that bothers me the most is that recently he’s started touching her. Not sexually cause if it were that I would have already done something but being OVERLY “friendly”. 
When they see each other, Jim will go in for a hug and hold on for as long as possible. If he needs to show Sam something or any excuse really, he’ll grab her hand to guide her there. Jim will randomly surprise her by grabbing Sam around her waste and saying “boo!” or whatever the hell. Even during the covid-19 social distancing rules, he continues to do this. (plus Sam is VERY VERY sensitive about people touching her because of some childhood trauma that I won’t get into).

It started off slow but at this point it’s happening at least once every time she has a shift with him and he doesn’t show any signs of slowing.

Sam has snapped/yelled at him multiple times and yet he doesn’t let up.

I want nothing more to give him more than a piece of my mind but Sam won’t let me. In 3 weeks from now she’s quitting her job because she’s going off to college and she thinks that me getting involved will just make her final few weeks of working that much harder. 

I’m afraid. I don’t want that prick putting his hands on Sam and I’m afraid of how far he’ll go. I don’t want my girl to have to deal with it anymore but she doesn’t want me getting involved.

394,"So I want to keep this short. I keep a small group of friends. I have one called Richard and one named Trevor. These guys are one of my closest friends. My friend Trevor lives 3 minutes away from me only a few blocks down so I go to his house whenever he invites me. But whenever I ask he says he’s busy. About 2 days ago I figured out that Richard and Trevor hung out without even telling me. They even had a sleepover without even telling me at my friend Trevors house which isn’t too far to me which I could’ve went to. Should I drop them as friends because they also play video games in private but never seem to invite me. Am I being petty, should I give them another chance or should I drop them and find new friends? Thank to anyone who may answer this. This subject has had be depressed for the last few months and is something that I never let my friends know of.

395,"Before I get into the question: 

He is my best friend and I love him very much. He loves me too and I’m considered his favorite person. We talk every night. I haven’t even considered my emotions to be “crush” territory because that label seems so juvenile. 

I labeled our casual jokes about each other’s kinks and using them against each other as banter and he said “oh so that’s what we’re calling it now?” 
I didn’t know we were calling it anything honestly...
I know it’s something because I feel the vibe change and he gets super sweet and stuff but I just need advice and some bulletproof ways to tell if someone is flirting?",11Jul2020,1

399,"We're in the US. I think my wife and I are generally on the same page—we both wear masks and try to minimize trips out to the store, but she is more lax than I am when it comes to hanging out with her family. Her family has a ""no big deal"" approach to this. Our area has been lightly hit so far and it has lulled people into a false sense of security, IMO. 

She considers her family low risk, but her parent and siblings aren't  distancing. Their ""circles"" seem to be pretty open. 

For me, I think it's okay to see them as long as the rules are followed: outdoors mostly, maintain physical distance, mask up when necessary, wash hands etc. But they can't even follow these simple rules.

400,"So I’m 17 and I’ve had a friend for a year now hung out everyday, basically brothers. We ended up getting into a big disagreement where he then refused to give me up to 1k worth of shit and said I wouldn’t ever get it and to never talk to him again. I then out of rage called the police on him. I then told the police to drop the charges and move on but him and all our mutual friends are shaming me for calling the police. I feel completely alone and to think everything was perfect a week ago and now i feel like I’ve permanently fucked things up with everyone.

I’m incredibly depressed and have very little optimism that this will work out. I lost a brother and no one trusts me now since I “involve police” into situations and they refuse to hear my side.

I need someone to help me feel better about this. I feel like my whole life is spoiled currently.",11Jul2020,1
403,"Hi everyone, I would really like some advice. I have a group of friends who I've been friendly with for a while. I used to do a lot of things with them ( driving places, eating out etc). Recently, I've felt replaced by another person and since this (amongst other things), they've spiralled down a wrong path (not going to go into it). I have felt very left out by them because they've been to different places without me very recently. I also seem to be the one driving constantly in the past and the present (not much anymore because of lockdown etc). A minority of them have passed their test and they've rarely driven around. I don't recall them ever driving me to a far away destination like I've done with them. They always ask me to drive and if I ask them to drive when meeting up, the excuse is 'I'm too tired' or 'I was drinking'. I don't wanna confront them because if they were truly my 'real friends' they would invite me out like they used to. I have also heard reports from others that they've been using me for my car. As much as I don't want to believe this, I think that my other friends are right about them. It's very difficult to try break away because they know personal stuff and secrets about me. I'm scared that they could use that against me (they love writing indirect stuff about people constantly). There's more to the story but I've went off everything trying to work out what to do. When they ask me to meet, it's always me driving and they've asked me to lift them to places without paying me gas money. Am I being used or am I overreacting? If so, how should I distance myself property without doing it directly? In the past, I just cut people off with no hesitation, but it's very difficult to cut these sort of people off. It's because they live pretty close and we have a lot of mutual friends. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",11Jul2020,1

My friend group were talking about old friends we use to talk to, games and how they were better a few years ago, and other things which triggered a nostalgic response in all of us and honestly it was hell and heaven. I talked about my old friend group and how we were so close and how one fight ruined us since it was 3 of us only and the other two hated each other’s guts but it made me anxious I mean thinking back on what I’ve lost and how that got me to my new friend group of 7 which I love so dearly makes me scared.

411,"The day I cheated, I lied and told my bf I was going to the park to meet a female friend. I was actually going to meet this very attractive guy, who had been pursuing me. Obviously we were text-flirting before arranging to meet up, and I did behind my bf’s back. 

We met, things got sexual, but I didn’t actually have sex with him. 

I wasn’t checking my phone throughout the time. 

Afterwards when I got in my car, I saw my bf messaging me asking if I was ok. I wasn’t replying for hours, and he wanted to have my presence before going to bed. 

I never told him what I did for months afterwards. Eventually I told him. 

The worst part is, I don’t regret cheating. In fact, I still feel very much “behind.” What do I mean by this? 

My bf allegedly had 23 sexual partners before meeting me. I lost my virginity to him, pretty late in life (I was originally saving it for religious reasons until I deconverted). 

Although I knew this from the beginning, over time, my resentment towards my bf grew, even though he was faithful and loving to me. Especially over time, he grew more and more of a better boyfriend, more emotionally available, more affectionate, etc. 

Anyway, I don’t know why, but I wanted to share this. Is there something wrong with me? Do I have no heart at all?

I told my bf over the phone before he had football practice. He told me after football practice, he cried in his car for 40 minutes and cried driving home. Even hearing that, I didn’t feel that much sympathy. 

Tldr: I cheated on my long distance boyfriend, mostly out of “petty revenge” that he had such a colorful sexual history before meeting me, whereas I lost my virginity to him. Logically I know he did absolutely nothing wrong to warrant my cheating. However, I feel justified. I don’t feel remorse and if I could, I’d cheat more to “get even.” 

Did I even love him?",11Jul2020,1
412,"My roommate and I are completely fed up with this situation. This woman’s car alarm keeps going off periodically throughout the night, and even sometimes during the day. She’ll let it go for at least 10 mins or more before coming out to turn it off, or sometimes she won’t come out at all.
 
We took a picture of the car, and we’ve started recording every time it goes off. But to be honest I don’t know if that’ll do any good. Is there anyway to report this, or maybe be able to tow her car away? 
  
Our apartments have 4 rows of buildings then an L shape building with a cul de sac. She lives in the L shape. We’re in the rows. She purposefully parks her car away from her. More so she usually parks in front of our bedroom windows. 
    
This has been going on for a long time and other neighbors are getting fed up with it to. I’ve thought about trying to talk to her about it, and maybe even offer to pay for it to be repaired. But for it to go on for so long, she must of had opportunities to fix whatever is going on with her vehicle.

I have talked to him about this many times, both before being pregnant and more recently. We've tried a lot of different things, but he doesnt stick to any of the stuff that's on his end of trying to solve the problem. 

He's gone to the doctor and they said that he needs to lose a little weight to solve the issue, but that was years ago and it's still happening.

414,"**Kind of a long, complicated story. TLDR @ end. Thanks to anyone who replies for any input or insight  shared. It's greatly appreciated!


My partner and I have been together for 2 years, he has 2 amazing daughters (9 &amp; 16) from a previous marriage and we are expecting another addition to the family in the fall. His stepmother is unfortunately a special kind of horrible person; completely self-serving, narcissistic, full of bitterness and hatred. She's somewhat convincingly smiles and niceties to literally EVERYONE'S face(including her own children and grandchildren) and then says the most awful things behind their backs. She often drops the act and is appalling to friends, family and even stanger's faces. Mocking a server's skin condition while he was within hearing distance, telling her then 8 year old granddaughter that her new medication was making her ugly and fat, confronting her husband's ex-wife with documentation proving that he never finished the adoption process of her two sons from a previous marriage at their son's wedding, etc... My partner and I don't really like spending time in that environment, but my stepdaughters are close to their grandfather so we grin and bear it when necessary. 

I've put a lot of time and effort into building close relationships with each of my stepdaughters. Like I say to them, I love them like I made them. After a recent dinner over there the 9 year old asked to stay the night. When she came home the next day she was visibly upset and after a little prying we found out it was because of the things her grandma had said about me after we left. 

Apparently she's decided that because I'm not showing much despite being towards the end of my 2nd trimester and COVID-19 restrictions prevent my partner from going to any appointments with me, I'm faking my pregnancy. The woman has seen the ultrasound pictures! Not to mention, for what possible reason would I be faking a pregnancy? Financial gain? We've long been cohabitating, my partner has a mid-range salary and I pay all my own bills! To push my partner into more of a commitment? He's always been the one driving us forward, plus making it official was already on the horizon and got back burned because of the baby. If she had bothered spending 10 minutes getting to know me over the past couple of years she might realize that I'm more of compassionate nurterer, not a manipulative sociopath who would do something like that. Also, not complete moron...like what would I do to produce a baby in a few months time? Try to buy one on the black market??

I can usually brush off her awfulness, but this one really stings. Making my stepdaughter uncomfortable by saying those ridiculous and cruel things to/in front of her is probably my biggest outrage. It's also pretty infuriating that she used my partner not attending the appointments as ""proof"", claiming that it's really because I won't allow him to come. The reality of the situation being that the pandemic regulations have been difficult for both of us, causing many emotional episodes; me feeling like I'm going through it alone and him feeling like he doesn't get to be a part of what should be this special time as a couple.

I was pretty ready to give her a piece of my mind, then my stepdaughter asked me not to because she was worried about grandma being mad her for telling me. She said she only told us because of how much it upset her to hear someone say all those bad things about me. So because my love for my little munchkin is much stronger than my rage at my partner's stepmother, I decided to keep my mouth shut. 

Unfortunately my sister has already sent out the invitations for my baby shower in September. She is on the guest list because I'm the type of person to include everyone; bring people together, open arms/doors with kindness and love, that sort of mentality is what I was raised in. However, I would really like to disinvite her now. I don't have any desire to allow her to be involved in the remainder of the pregnancy, the birth or anything related to it. Considering the obstacles our timing has already put in place, I'm not willing to let her truly taint this experience for my partner, myself, or our girls(we've tried to include them heavily, make it something we're going through as a family to reassure any concerns about being left behind or '2nd best').

Do I really have to play fake nice with repulsive person at this particular event after everything she said? I can't stress how much I do not want her to attend this particular celebration due to her absurd accusation, but I honestly can't think of a way to revoke her invite without confronting the issue and hurting my stepdaughter in the process. Obviously pulling a child in the middle of this isn't going to happen.

------------------------------


****TLDR: Either l can suffer through my baby shower faking nice with my stepmother IL after she ABSURDLY accused me(to my 9 year old stepdaughter with whom I'm very close) of faking my pregnancy with the ""evidence"" of me not showing much towards the end of my 2nd trimester and her own insistence that my partner is not allowed to attend the appointments because I won't allow it instead of the actual reasoning of COVID-19 restrictions not allowing anyone to accompany me to them or I can disinvite her, probably hurting my stepdaughter by confronting her grandma and putting it out there that she had told us what had been said, as it upset her to hear me talked about so degradingly. 

Of course, I have no intention of handling this situation with any actions that may put my little munchkin in the middle of anything. The obstacles we've been dealing with due to our timing, such as him(or anyone else)not being allowed to accompany me to appointments have been emotionally trying for both of us. We've worked really hard to make this pregnancy a family experience, including my stepdaughters every step of the way to proactively reassure any concerns about being left out/behind or about being secondary in anyway to the child who lives with us full-time instead of half of the time. Everyone was so excited until this negativity the other day, wanting to pick out baby clothes and vote on names. The enthusiasm has been dampened by the tension hanging in the air around this uncomfortable and unresolved incident.

Is there really nothing I can do to exclude this horrible person and her hateful bitterness from poisoning the rest of this special time for our family that my partner, myself and my 2 stepdaughters are trying to enjoy together?****",11Jul2020,1
415,"So I’m 15(f) and I’ve lived with my cousin(19)f all my life so we’re kinda like sisters. So we’re both 5’4 and I’m on the chubby side so naturally my clothes are bigger and hers aren’t. I got these new shorts and I haven’t worn them yet and the next day I see her wearing them and I got mad. I said “I barely worn them and I don’t want you wearing them” she then took it off and I said “thanks”. She has a record of wearing clothes for a week straight and returning them stained and dirty. We have the same size shoes and I love my shoes, I treat them nicely, she also has a record of making them dirty, burning them, and also making them stink to the point no matter how much I clean them I cannot get the stink out. So, naturally I’ve stopped letting her wear my stuff but she still does. I want to tell her to stop wearing my clothes and just wear your own but she’s like a child. I’ve seen her throw tantrums about not getting what she wants. I don’t want her to get that way when I tell her I don’t want her wearing my clothes but damn is it getting on my nerves. 

So, I’ve had the shorts for about 2 weeks now. She puts them on and I was okay with it but then I find out she’s wearing my bra! I was not okay with it so I told her and she said “well I can’t find any of my bras so let me wear yours” It’s a strapless sticky bra. I only wear it when I wear tops that are strapless or backless. (We are the same size cup) I let her wear it. I told her how to treat it and everything. She then proceeded to be gone a week. She put paper towels ( to protect them from dust when she wasn’t wearing them) in the bra so they aren’t that sticky anymore. She was at a friends and she washed the shorts so I was okay with that. I’m really close to snapping at her and yelling at her but I want to have a nice conversation with her and just talk things out with her. I’ve stopped wearing her clothes because I got a bit chunkier and stopped working out, I don’t want to stretch her clothes out. She got home and she fell asleep with the shorts on and I have a feeling she won’t take them off in the morning. She yells at me for not doing laundry which I do when we’re low on clothes but she never does them so when the top she wants to wear she goes “why don’t you do laundry?” And I ask her why don’t you, her response is “I’m meeting a friend I don’t have time “. I do laundry and when it’s done she takes her top or whatever clothing article she wants and takes off. She doesn’t tell me it’s done so I can hang up the clothes. She doesn’t do it.",11Jul2020,1

His daughter came first, than mine like anyone you’ll say oh my baby is a angel she’s perfect she’s beautiful. However my BFs baby has become let’s say VERY healthy! By that I mean like... HUGE to an alarming point before my daughter came I thought of wow babies are huge! But now we’ve had a few play dates (we all have our Tdap &amp; covid tests) she is 3 months mine is 1 month but the most recent doc apt for my friends daughter the doc said his baby is 3 months but the size of a 6-8 month year old. I don’t know much about babies as this is my first one too but omg this baby is so huge and I am not trying to shame it I understand babies gain and drop and even out etc... but wow I feel so bad his baby is so adorable but like EVERYTIME he brings her over she poops so hard she “blows out” meaning she shits so hard it flies through her diaper and all over her clothes. My baby mama and I stocked up on NB-3 month - 6month - 1 year clothes in preparation and bc it was so fun shopping for all these dope clothes for babies Lol my daughter has more yeezys than I do lol but so we go okay she “blew out” her diaper it happens what size is she? this baby is just now 3 months wearing year old clothes... I dono what my point of this post is I think it’s bc I saw a joke on family guy about a baby called “Diabetò” who was very obese and I’ve been calling my best friends baby this as a joke to my baby mama (and know one eles)... ugh I feel awful and I know she’ll fill out but I also fear this mom is over feeding her! How is she so big this is crazy we posted a story on my Instagram of them hanging out and most of the comments were saying (big baby) was looking at my baby as a snack smh... I dono obviously I would never say anything just wondering if anyone’s ever dealt with a situation with babies/weight/being afraid to cross a line with a good friend like this or... have dealt with awkward situations with friends who are basically family where you feel out of pocket saying something... maybe I’m a ass for even posting this sorry this isn’t anything super juicy!

417,"My husband and I have been married for 5 months now. We're both young, me (F - 19) and him (M - 18). We've been together since we were both 17 in high school and have known eachother since we were 14. In the beginning of our relationship, 3 months in specifically, it was rocky because I caught him speaking with two other females in a sexual way about a month apart from one another. I confronted him both times as a result of me being suspicious because whenever something would go amazing (for example like meeting his family went well) in our relationship he would do something self destructive. When confronting him, he used to get really defensive but since then he's really listened to me about things and stopped doing those things all together. I know he's made mistakes in the beginning of our relationships but I still stuck it out because I always believe in the best of people even if they hurt me. I've been emotionally abused my whole life by friends and family but he never once has manipulated me into anything. To escape home I joined the Navy and he had joined before I did. He left before me, I supported him throughout all of boot camp, and stayed loyal to him (of course). I wasn't paranoid when he was gone because I knew he couldn't self destruct by just being in boot camp, he's making himself a future that he chose. Before I went to boot camp, we got engaged for our year anniversary. I went a couple months after he graduated from RTC and I was kicked out during the end of my training at RTC for being diagnosed with depression and ""showing signs of self harm"" (which I had not) but whatever. Separation during boot camp was strange altogether and deserves a post of it's own. I told my fiancé (now husband) that I wanted to live with him in his duty station because home with my family was not a place for me. I eventually got shipped over to him after a month of being in separation holding and I've been living in this new place for 8 months. I suffer from depression, anxiety, and panic attacks which my husband has dealt with since the beginning. He's always been helpful and a very calming person to be around. I have this anxiety and severe insecurities with myself in this relationship because what if he is cheating or has cheated on me when I am not around or when I was gone. I never felt the same after catching him twice talking to females. I used to be a lot more secure. I have talked to him countless amount of times, he says that I don't trust him, and he doesn't think I ever will. I love him, of course I want to trust him. It's been over a year since the confrontations happened but I live with the fear of I will never be enough, I can't make him happy, and I can't be what he wants. I'm just not sure what I can do anymore. I love him so much and our life together but I am living with this fear looming over my head and I can't help but wonder if he truly loves me for me or if he feels bad for hurting me and just tries to make up for it.

When I told her not everyone who gets COVID dies, she disagreed saying that ""most people do \[die\]"", and when I tried to show her case to fatality numbers in the city I want to move to, she started citing conspiracy theories, saying that the WHO created the virus to thin out the world population. After asking her if she was kidding, she said she was serious and that I should ""look it up"". By the tone of her voice, she definitely was not kidding.

She used to be really smart, offering me genuinely good life advice pertaining to finances, education and other classic stuff that parents are generally known to teach their children. Now, she thinks the WHO is behind the virus in an effort to thin out the world. She also holds weird beliefs surrounding weed, and that it is an instant gateway to the devil and stuff like that. Don't smoke it personally, but it was a big election issue back in 2015 that she was really passionate about.

Lately I've been actually wondering if there's something wrong with her, but have no clue how to approach getting the issue resolved. It's seriously worrying going from being genuinely enlightening to believing and living by really ""out there"" conspiracy theories. We're not a dysfunctional family, and we've lived what I would consider a pretty normal life up until recently. Not sure where to even start looking, but I've tossed the idea of therapy around, not sure how I should approach it or even convince her to go. Just wondering if anyone else has experienced something like this

&amp;#x200B;

For a little more perspective: I'm 22 and a student, I plan to move regardless, but moreso just want to let her know of my plan when she brought all this stuff up. I don't recall her undergoing any traumatic experiences lately

427,"Male. I am going to attempt to make a long story as short as possible. I've always up until recently (maybe 6 years) have been a very jealous person when it comes to relationships. Friends, girlfriends, those who I consider family (my living biological family wants nothing to do with me, the ones who did have all passed away), and so forth. My last 2 long term relationships I feel I was done wrong but not everyone agrees. The first of these two I caught 2 diseases, one of which I caught twice which was easily cured and the other I think is lifelong even though it is common and most people have a shot to defend against. The second long term relationship I was blamed for being unfaithful though I honestly was faithful due to the same easily curable disease making an appearance three times. This second long term relationship I proposed and was married but many times situations happened where she had encounters she claimed to of turned down with individuals both male and female who are close to me but their stories don't match. This relationship ended with her evicting me from our apartment followed by her starting a relationship with a married couple we know (though it was denied to everyone we know including her family) which ended up in her having a child. I got over these relationships and got close with an old female friend who always had a crush on me but I never wanted to pursue. We have now been together for half a decade from just linking up on Valentine's day to keep each other company (nothing happened that night and it wasn't like that) due to us both being recently separated from unfaithful relationships. We know everything about each other, we've known each other for years, but one thing makes me very jealous. She has had threesomes in prior relationships. One of which was with her former husband and a friend of hers who was also seeing her husband behind her back. I want a threesome myself. It bothers me that her bad relationships were able to experience that enjoyment while I'm left fantasizing. I hate that I've contracted diseases so many times from unfaithful relationships, one of which I still have but she is same from because of a shot but have never experienced what the males who have been with my girlfriends have and the male who was married to my current girlfriend have. I can't help but dwell and picture what an amazing exciting time my current girlfriend and prior unfaithful companions had during what is still only a fantasy to me. Am I jealous or do I have reason to feel this way?",11Jul2020,1

I've never felt this way about anyone and he's been a great friend over the years and I don't want to complicate things between us. I kind of mentioned how I felt about a month ago, but then I hadn't realized how deep my feelings were for them and when I told them that it was tied up in a lot of other things. 

Yesterday I messaged them a long message and they said they didn't feel like typing out an essay so they'd just say it in a call. He never got to say it since we kept having to go do stuff until after midnight, and by that point I don't think either of us wanted to get into something like that. 

The past few times I've talked to him I've wanted to say I love him but I've always been terrible at articulating my thoughts and saying what's on my mind so I've just bit my tongue and simply said goodbye. I'm not really sure they were gonna say and I keep getting worrying that they don't have any feelings for me. Neither of us have really been in a relationship so I don't know how he'd react to me telling him my feelings. On top of this, if we did get into a relationship we'd have to hide it from almost everyone if not everyone.",11Jul2020,1

I have a great opportunity to move across the country with a close friend, who is pretty much considered family to me. We spent a year together living as roommates and had no issues. I would be living with his family until I find my own place, for maybe a few months. My friend moved across the country to be with his family, and after a year of being apart I still want to move. 

I can’t help but feel selfish for leaving my family, because almost all of my family members rely on me in different ways, and I benefit them way more than they benefit me. I would feel really guilty leaving, but at the same time I have to to what’s best for me

I wanted to reconnect with her for years, but I could never seem to find her, since the site we met on closed. I only ended up finding her facebook and insta recently because I knew the full name of one of her friends. Keep in mind, the last time we talked we were both around 13-14, and we are 22 now. 

I want to reach out to her and see if she remembers me...but since she never told me her last name, I’m afraid she'd be creeped out that I somehow found her social media.

435,"She's been through a lot of trauma and difficult life experiences. Kicked out at 17, injured from a suicide bombing at 28, ugly divorce and simultaneously breast cancer four years ago, and about a year ago her father (the sweetest man that had ever lived) which she recently reconnected with and the only person from her family that she actually talks to, suffered a severe head injury and is unresponsive.
I love her so much, and appreciate everything she has done for me and my little brothers, but she never got any real therapy for her PTSD and only now is she starting to explore the nuances of how it affects her life and behaviour.
She says that throughout her marriage and me and my brothers' childhoods (I'm f 20, they're teenagers) she had always given up on herself, tried hiding all her anxieties and episodes just to keep the peace, but now she finally realizes that it only hurt her and wants to claim back her rights and freedom to express herself.
All power to her, right? 
The thing is, it created an atmosphere in the house in which I'm walking on eggshells around her. I can't say anything that might be construed as criticism or else she she starts a highly defensive, emotional fight. She goes off shouting at me in the middle of the supermarket if I'm not highly attentive to what she's saying (crowds trigger her I think, especially since the whole covid thing started), and once I started answering back and getting hurt over her harsh words she said it's her PTSD and that I'm just going to learn to live with it. There's a political debate show she likes watching every Friday, in which the hosts and guests constantly argue and shout over eachother's words, and because she's hearing impaired (thanks to the bombing) she turns it all the way up in the living room and it's a major anxiety trigger for me. Once I told her that she got really mad, blaming me for being selfish after all she has done and still doing for me, and that she's done giving up on herself and if we don't give her the rights she deserves, she'll just have to take them without asking. 
I understand her outrage and her will to be free and accepting of her PTSD, but I think she doesn't know how to do it in a balanced way.

436,"i dont know if im bicurious or gay or a pedophile because this shit is fucked and idk what to do about it. so im 20 and my friend who is a guy is 16 and ive seen his dick like multiple times already. the first time it was a total accident, i swiped on his phone and saw a picture of it, and the other times were because he just wanted to flash me. like tonight for example, we were swimming together and i was underwater and he swims in front of me and flashes his dick in front of me. He thought it was funny, and I did too but I got a boner from it which i know is fucked up and it was just awkward and I don't know why I feel this way whenever I am friends with someone for a long time. This shit even happened with my old friend who im not friends with anymore because he thought i was too sensitive and couldnt handle the stress of me venting to him all the time. back in 2018 i made a friend who was 14 at the time and 15 when the friendship ended and we hung out all the time and had lots of sleepovers. i ended up getting attached to him and forming a little bit of a crush on him in the middle of our friendship which made things awkward. He used to let me rub his ""abs"", I hugged him once after we had an argument and I got a boner, and i even asked if we could kiss to see if im gay or not (which he refused). oh yeah i did that to my current friend too, asked if we could kiss but he takes everything as a joke and dosent care about what i say. i ask if anything i say bothers him and he says nothing i say bothers him. we even go as far as to slap eachothers ass and ive put my hand on his thigh a couple times while he was driving as a joke while we were messing around. I know the shit i do is gross and i honestly would never do anything to hurt my friend(s) and thats why i would never go farther than ive already gone. i would never do shit to someone while someone was unconscious, i would never beg for sex from a minor, and i would never force myself on a minor either. i know this shit is fucked and i honestly cant believe i even have to type this shit up. I guess it would help to say ive never been in a sexual/physical relationship ever in my whole life. ive never kissed a girl/held hands with a girl/hugged a girl/done anything like that. the only experimentation ive done was when i was like 8 or 10 years old and my friend wanted to always run downstairs until our pants fell down or lay on top of eachother butt naked or shit like that. anyway if anyone has advice for me that would be great because im honestly really needing it right now.",11Jul2020,1
437," So about a year ago, I met this guy who seemed pretty damn nice. He was funny, kinda short, and didn't have the best table manners but was a cool guy all around. The only problem was that he was not a confident person. He seemed to blame himself for everything and was genuinely a guy that was very desperate. I felt bad for him at first when he talked about being lonely but I never wanted to go out with him. Call me selfish but I need a guy who loves himself if he wanted me to love him. He understood this and after months of trying to ask me out, he realized how serious I was about this.

Not only that but it seemed like his friends were turned away by his attitude as well. They would tell me that he always complained when they were busy and ""couldn't be there for him"" How he was a little too emotional and how they started hanging out without him because they couldn't deal with him anymore and didn't want to try and make him happy. I know I'm being vague about this so let me give an example. When The group of friends hung out at this cool ice cream place he got mad at them for not inviting him and said that this wasn't the only time they did something without him or even asking him. After 2 months of this, he eventually started to change. He became happier out of nowhere and even his friends noticed him acting differently.

After a few months, his friends finally started to invite him places and would even insist he come with them even if he was busy. Eventually, I started to find his new attitude sexy, and seeing him become more of a suave person who seemed to have finally figured himself out made me proud of him. So after a year of becoming closer friends I finally said yes to the 10th time he asked me out. We didn't become an official couple until out 4th date and he made it clear he wanted to put a label on it sooner but I was scared that going in to fast would be too much and told him to wait. I could see it was agony for him but I didn't think too much of it and thought we were getting together anyway so it didn't really matter. Unfortunately, he kept pushing for our relationship as fast as possible. He wanted kisses, cuddles, and was just a little touchy. I kept telling him to wait and of course while he was compliant he seemed to be very sad and sometimes on our dates he would barely even smile.

One day I asked him what was wrong and he came out and said that he felt like I didn't even love him. How I would barely even hug or kiss him and how he never felt like anything he did (Pay for our dates, Spend time with me, just talking and texting.) Never felt like enough and I saw tears in his eyes So I kissed him and told him that I would try to be more affectionate I explained that I had been in a relationship before and I went way to fast. It leads to me doing some pretty bad things (Not going into details.) He asked me ""why didn't you tell me that from the start, I blamed myself for so long and felt horrible thinking you were gonna dump me."" and I told him it was embarrassing and that the way I treated him was never his fault.

We kissed and after a while, we started getting a lot closer. We would cuddle more at his and my place We spent a lot of time just complimenting each other and skip to a few weeks ago and unfortunately I finally decided he had just been the best boyfriend I could ask for. So I decided to spend the night at his place. He was hesitant at first but I told him this wasn't a (You've earned this) Kind of thing. I just loved him so much and I wanted to finally be in bed with him. Unfortunately, after he made us some badass tasting steaks and we spent 2 hours doing nothing but feeling each other's bodies. I took a shower and noticed something on his sink. It was a bottle of antidepressants and a really big bottle.

I walked out of the shower and asked him what he was doing with it. I asked him why didn't he tell me about it. and what was going on with him. He broke down telling me how he's been suffering from clinical depression and didn't get any real help till over a year ago. His friends didn't take him seriously and they would always use his depression as an excuse for why they didn't want to hang out with him. And of course, there was me. He had loved me ever since he laid eyes on me and he wanted me to be with him so badly. but when I told him about how his sadness was the reason I didn't want to be with him. He realized he needed to finally change. He hated himself for having this disorder and the fact that I didn't know seemed to keep us together. The fact that I didn't know how sad he really was every day. and the only thing that made him feel happy was me. Now He by this point had done a lot with his life. Had a good job, Loving mother and big brother, had his own house before 30, and basically had what many people would consider being the perfect early aged life. So when he dropped this bombshell on me I didn't know how to deal with it.

I felt like the person I was with for the past year and a half and had been silently suffering and I didn't know if it was my fault for making him feel like his depression would hurt our relationship, or felt betrayed that he lied to me for so long and was basically putting on a mask. At this point, I don't know what to do. I really love him but the reason I was so against his depressive attitude before was that I've dealt with depression in my family and it destroyed my mother and fathers marriage. I don't want that for me and my bf. I haven't spoken to him in a week even though he keeps blowing up my phone and I'm really considering ending this until he can get really better but I still love him and don't want him to be alone through this. so what should I do Now?",11Jul2020,1

442,"We've been dating for 8 years and we both live in our respective homes about a 40 minute drive from eachother. I've been friends with our mutual friend (will go by Mf) for at least 15 years, while boyfriend has been friends with her about the same amount of time we've been dating. We are all in our 20's.

Around February, Mf's boyfriend dumped her and she's been really down since. While she has already been diagnosed with depression, covid, her inability to obtain a job after university, and tensions at home make things difficult for her. Not only that, but she's always been more of a night owl and long sleeper, so she tends to be up from 5pm to 8am. 

This is where boyfriend comes in. The two of them live in the same city and though they didn't talk too often before, recently boyfriend has been asking me (while he and I are hanging out) if we want to hang out with Mf. I was all for it at first, as we would go for walks and have a good time, and it made her a little less lonely. 

But now they've been going on walks about 3 times a week, because he gets off work at 10pm and she'll be up for a while, and can go as late as 230pm. They usually walk around the local park, grab mcdonalds, and then he'll drive her home since it's late and she doesn't have a car.

I know they are 100% not doing anything sketchy. Mf has started doing these walks with a couple of her friends too. Despite *knowing* this, I *feel* so insecure about it. Logically i tell myself that they are doing normal friend stuff and it's good that she gets to see someone because I know she's stressed. I also like that boyfriend is getting some exercise because he's pretty overweight and is insecure about it. But my mind keeps going to intrusive thoughts of ""oh they're probably having deep conversation and gaining attraction for eachother"" or ""yep they're probably making out right now"" or ""she's lonely and hasn't had male companionship in months"" (i feel so horrible for even typing these things)

I know these are illogical thoughts, so it makes me embarrassed and ashamed. I want to ask him if he will tell me when he hangs out with her, but the thing is, I don't ask that he tell me when he's hanging out with his other friends. So it will be clear that I'm insecure, because if he was doing this with a male friend I wouldn't mind at all. I'm all for men having healthy friendships with the opposite sex, and yet I'm like this.

I spend the night feeling all insecure, especially because with the game they play on their walks (pokemon go) they don't get push notifications and i don't get a response for a long time. I hate that I wait on their responses.

Should I ask him to tell me when they anyway? More importantly, how do I stop these stupid thoughts? I refrain from asking because I know he's gonna think ""wow she's insecure and doesn't trust me""",11Jul2020,1

I have a very close relationship with my parents, especially my mom, it hurts me to hurt her. I can't wait to come clean as this has been a huge weight on my mind for the past 2 years.

I need advice on how to break the news to her, at a distance, as smoothly as possible. She has been having some health issues and has high blood pressure and I am scared she might pass out when hearing the news and going to the hospital in my home country during these times is not safe for her.",11Jul2020,1
450,"I've been crying all day. I broke up with my boyfriend a while because I was too mentally burnout. I asked for an advice about this last [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/hnbgvy/should_i_break_up_with_him/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share). He was a nice guy, but it feels like we were together in a wrong time. But I am extremely hurt, guilty and regretful although we've been together for only 8 months. 

I don't feel okay with our gap. I am an incoming college and he's an incoming sophomore. I felt like I would be a hindrance to his growth and I kept on manipulating him to be a specific person instead of his natural development. I also thought of myself sa pedophile for that.

While I was cold few days ago, I was quite irritated with his consistent messages asking me how I was doing and updating me with his actions. Right now, I feel empty. I kept on looking back to our conversations and wished I didn't break up with him.

The problem is with me. What should I do?",11Jul2020,1
451,"I am a 21 y/o Psych. major at a community college and I am needing help. 

I am trying to decide should I pursue an associate’s or bachelor’s.

To give context I’ve never been the greatest at college; I’ve been at my community college for 2 years now (since 2018) and my GPA is shit, I’ve been on academic probation and suspension on and off, and my academic success continues to get worse. I’m not passionate about school and probably never will be, so my question is should I just obtain my associate’s? I’ve been Googling and it seems like a lot of people aren’t successful with that degree.

Next year I plan to launch my own social media, event planning and marketing business / youth-led initiative in my city. However, in the back of mind I wonder if obtaining my associate’s will help me in my professional life.

Please help as I do need advice because I don’t know what to do. I want to get a bachelor’s, but my heart just isn’t in it.

Will I be successful with an associate’s? If I start my win business, will a degree determine my success? Or should I just buckle down, raise my GPA and get my bachelor’s?",11Jul2020,1
452,"Background, I’m 21, I’m a father to two little girls, i have a fiancé, and I’m the only money maker. I hate my job. With a passion. It’s mentally and physically exhausting, and while I bring home almost $5000 monthly, I’m constantly looking at much less paying jobs, wishing that I could build up the courage to take one, because they seem much less stressful. Recently I found an opening for a Dish technician paying $16 hourly with overtime,  and even though it’s a big cut from my $23 an hour job with 60 hours guaranteed and overtime after 40, I so desperately want it. I could see things being tighter for sure, but possible. And I see more time with my family, time at all for my hobbies that I’ve painfully had to let go, more time for myself to be happy. I just can’t see wether or not it’s worth it. I know it’s doable, but with rent and all the bills I have to pay on top of things for my daughters, I don’t know if it’s the smartest thing to do. Has anyone ever faced this? My job makes me feel depressed, but a big part of me was raised to say suck it up and be the best possible provider, but every other part of me is screaming to go for it.

455,"okay it is a very long story of how i even moved into my current place, but basically i lived somewhere peacefully for a year and a half before an asshole moved in and started accusing me of stealing shit and just trying to fight with me every time i came out of my room. tried some conflict resolution with another roommate to mediate, but it made the harassment worse. so i was in a hurry to find a new place. 

i found this place on craigslist, i am 26, the roommate i contacted and interviewed with is in her early thirties. it seemed really legit, and like what i needed. roommate said she was a direct communicator, and didn’t like passive aggression.

i’ve lived there since june. i haven’t really connected with the roommates due to mental health issues that include severe social anxiety disorder, mdd ocd, a tic disorder that was described to me as “basically Tourette’s”, unresolved trauma, as well as likely being somewhere on the autism spectrum (and people have tended to catch onto that without me spelling it out to them, though they were aware of my social anxiety and tic disorder before i moved in). i am a fucking mess of an adult, but am partaking in as much therapy and treatment as medicaid will pay for. i am also just a deeply introverted artist/gamer type and enjoy being alone in my room doing things that make me happy.

tonight i had my window open, and heard what i thought were my neighbors (some college aged folks) smashing bottles and screaming “fucking retard” and “fucking retards” over and over. i soon realize it is my roommate (the one i interviewed with) because she comes banging into the house like the door slamming open then banging shut multiple times. she is downstairs screaming “fuxking retards! can’t even close a gate!!” and then i just heard so much stuff banging around and the sound of more glass smashing than i have ever heard in my life while she kept screaming and calling us fuxking retards. then i hear her get closer to the stairs and yell “i don’t have a dog any more because you morons don’t know how to close a door!!” and then just so much more banging and glass smashing. then like the smashing stopped because i heard the neighbor say “uh hey your dog is over here!” and my roommate and her FRIEND who was there the whole time go get the dog, come home, and just doesn’t say shit.

apparently the dog got out, and i was the last person in the kitchen. here’s the fuxking thing though, the baby gate and the back door were open when i got in there, so i assumed my roommate and her friend were out back with the dog. the backyard is fenced and has a gate and the dog runs around out there alone sometimes. i left the kitchen gate open tho and the back door, because that’s how it was when i got down there.

i think one of my roommates was home but she didn’t say anything. the roommate and i share an upstairs, and she probably heard me sobbing quietly and having a panic attack and SI in my room. 

my mom drove an hour to come get me from my house because i was in no shape to drive, i literally was on hold with the trevor project for an hour just needing someone to text with (so the roommate wouldn’t hear me) because my 2 friends ignore me when i’m upset or worse (even tho i put in so much emotional labor for them). i was genuinely scared that my roommate would have hurt me or smashed stuff near me had i been downstairs. i’ve lived in some sketchy situations but that was the most violent outburst i’ve experienced in a long time.

i really want to fuxking dip the fuck out of there. asap. i do not feel safe, like that kind of language is wrong anyway to use, but it also felt weirdly personal due to Who I Am, as well as the fact that my childhood abuser (a close family member who died in april which was very painful) called me those exact names on an extremely regular basis. i am just beyond Actually Triggered and i have just been put into such a dark and scary place after like a month of feeling like i was in my new safe place.

is it valid to move next month, if it’s possible? my sister needs a new place too and i would love nothing more than to split an apartment with her. 

how should i bring up moving? i am kind of scared to just be honest and say that i don’t feel comfortable or safe with that kind of language and explosive outburst (it was pitch black when i left so i didn’t see the aftermath but i swear it just sounded like dishes being taken out of the cupboards and being smashed on the floor more smashing glass than ive ever heard)

LIKE. i totally understand that she was in a crisis, her baby had escaped, but calling me a retard over and over and smashing shit is not the kind of response i can live with. if she had yelled “THE DOG GOT OUT SOMEONE HELP!” like i would have been running down the street barefoot in ten seconds. instead i was in my room sobbing for three hours with the door locked like a little bitch waiting for my mom to pick me up.

am i allowed to leave??? how do i leave without making things worse???",11Jul2020,1
456,"I have been working since I was 16 and have had a total of 5 jobs in my life and all my previous ones I have left on great notes and have always felt like my employers really valued me. I started at my most recent position right after I graduated (bachelors). I live in a small town and was desperate to get out of the fast food industry (which I had been working at full time throughout school) and into something at least semi relevant to my degree and potential career path. I accepted a job that I wasn’t totally interested in and got to work. 

I was with this company for 7 months and yesterday I was called into my bosses office and handed termination papers. It was completely my fault. After covid started ramping up and businesses started adapting our company switched to a work from home model, which wasn’t too bad. All of our work was computer based anyway. I was able to adjust pretty quickly but over time I realized I preferred working in the office. Fast forward a month or two and we slowly started letting people back into the office with the stipulation that we closed an hour and a half earlier than normal. 

I chose to go back because I felt more productive there and wanted to get out of the house. While I was in fact more productive there, I was also have some issues adjusting to the new schedule and having to be up an hour earlier to get ready and commute. I fell asleep at my desk for a few minutes and got in trouble for it. About a week and a half later I came in and managed to doze off again while waiting for my next assignment to be emailed to me. I wasn’t really asked to explain myself just briefly talked to by my supervisor. At the end of the day I was let go. This is the first time I’ve ever been fired. I completely accept responsibility that I could not sort out what I needed to to meet my employers expectations and am frankly very embarrassed about the whole thing. I am having a lot of anxiety about what kind of picture this paints when I start interviewing again and I guess I would just like some advice and hear any experiences you guys have had with something like this.",11Jul2020,1

Okay, I know it sounds bad by the title, but here me out...

(Me:19; Kira= 22, best friend; Tristan: 24, Kira's bf; Lucy: 21, mine&amp;Kira's close friend)

Me and my best friend Kira have been close for about 3 years now, we tell each other everything and do everything together, we're even planning to move in together soon. She's helped me out through so much shit in my life and she's pretty much my older sister at this point, I would give everything up for her. Last year, Kira met a guy Tristan at college and they've been ""officially"" dating for the last few months. I use quotes because she's a very religious person, so they don't do anything more than hugging. Tristan used to drink and do drugs, and as she's really religious, he stopped and ""changed for her"", which I feel is a little suspicious since when they got into a fight he went out the next day to a bar and then called her drunk and had her drive him home. I wouldn't mind if he drank and smoked, as when I first was getting to know him--she suggested Tristan and I have a day in the city to get to know one another better--he offered me weed. I declined, as I do smoke and drink (and other drugs) but hide it from Kira. I have since quit, it was a short period of my life, but I realized I have an addictive personality and it came to a head when I had a week long bender. Tristan once told Kira he caught me smoking a cigarette and told Kira, which really upset me because I had quit for a while (which Kira knew) but I had been stressed out and started again. He saw me and felt it was his business to ""report"" me to her. Me and Kira got into a long argument about it, which she sometimes brings up.

As I got to know Tristan, I realized I really don't like him. A lot of his stories paint him out to be the victim (an example being that he had a crush on his bisexual friend but the feelings we're reciprocated so he felt ""lead on"" in his words), and he's pretty much a borderline simp. In all fairness, she truly loves him, and not gonna lie I see them getting married and having kids, like I do see a future for them. I've mentioned to her before when she would include him on group facetimes or try to fit him into our girls days, that I want to spend time with just her or just us girls but she gets offended on his behalf. She's even tried to have him reach out to me every once in a while (not subtly no doubt), and I know she's behind it because when it happens it'll be a few minutes after we finish our nightly facetimes. Like I get it, you want him to be friends with your friends, and mine and Kira's mutual friend Lucy gets along with him well, they'll talk together and hang out, I just don't want to be a part of it.

In all fairness, it's nothing he's done, he just reminds me of a bad experience. One of Tristan's friends (who we'll call J) sexually assaulted me, and I don't want to bring it up. I just can't look at Tristan anymore, I just don't want to be around him. Tristan and the guy weren't close friends either, but he's the one who introduced me to him. I was invited to a kickback, got a little too drunk too quick, and the whole time I was sorta jokingly talking shit about J but everyone knew we didn't get along. I passed out on the couch across the room from J, on the shoulder of the girl who invited me. I came to with his fingers inside of me. Point is, I haven't told anyone about this, and don't plan to. It's my shit experience I have to live with, I don't feel like broadcasting it, and I know it'll taint how people see me. I've been sexually abused as a kid, raped before, and sexually assaulted in the past. Yes, I take responsibility for some of the situations I've put myself in, but the ones that happened when I was a child? nope, that's not on me. Point is, I've dealt with this shit before, I don't want to tell her that I feel uncomfortable being around him because of this. Plus, she'd eventually ask how it happened and I'd have to tell her I was drunk, which will mess up our relationship (if one lousy cigarette caused problems, this would destroy us). So am I the asshole for not wanting to be around her bf? What do I do?",11Jul2020,1

461,"So, I went over my bosses head in an e-mail, for a reason. 

Many months back a team in my company messed up my compensation. I put in a lot of effort to earn those commissions, and I knew somehow, something got screwed up. So I asked my boss to look into it for me. A month goes by, and I send my boss another email asking him to look into it for me. This time, more of my commissions have been messed up, so the problems getting worse. Again, my boss didn’t reply. 

I get busy, and about one month later I take matters into my own hands, and email the team in charge of our commissions. I’m angry, so my email was direct, pointed, and I was demanding answers. At this point, most of my commissions had not been paid for 5-6 months+. Keep in mind, commissions make up about 40-50% of my income. My base salary isn’t that stellar, relatively speaking. I also had plans to buy more real estate with my commissions, so the delays prevented me from being able to do that and other things. 

The email ruffled some feathers, and my boss’s boss calls me asking me why I didn’t just take this problem up with my boss. Essentially, he wanted me to go to him with these issues, and not with the team that reviews our commissions. 

I didn’t rat my boss out. I covered for him and took it to the chin. I agreed to reach out to him in the future and that I shouldn’t have sent that email. 

Should I tell my boss I covered for him, and essentially took a bunch of crap for something he could’ve resolved months ago, but continued to ignore? When you cover for someone like that, or take the fall, do you tell the person you took the fall for them? A part of me wants my boss to know his inaction caused me to take matters into my hands, which ended up damaging my reputation and making me look like the a-hole that blows people up. Another part of me wants to let it go and not a make big deal out of it. 

TLDR: My boss ignored my multiple requests for help with a payroll problem, so I took matters into my own hands. I ended up pissing people off in the process and got scolded by a senior manager for stepping over my boss’s head.",11Jul2020,1

465,"
My SO and I have been close since the end of 2013. We started dating in spring of 2014. Since day 1, she has NEVER been a fan. I have no reputation, so you may be asking yourself, ""Why? What did she do?"" 

Well, lat first, I tried to understand her point if view, and just do my best to show her I was wortht of love, whether it be hers, or my SOs. 

When we met, I was ending a very unhealthy, tumultuous marriage. There were a lot of working parts. Financially, I couldn't afford to just up and leave. Physically, I was dealing with the beginning symptoms of what would later be diagnosed as cancer, but we'll get that. So, we were sharing a house together. We slept separately, and for a while, and I behaved as if I was still married, because I didn't want to cause any unnecessary problems or put myself in any sort of danger. 

During our separation, I found a second job. That's where I met my current SO. At the beginning, we were simply co workers. At some point, we started working together almost 5 nights a week. I couldn't even begin to explain how things happened. They just... did.

One evening, after a particularly bad day of being physically and emotionally abused by my ex, I found myself in the storage area of the store where I worked. A completely and total mess. My SO, then just a co-worker who I'd barely known a month, found me. 

He consoled me in a way that was completely harmless. You could tell he couldn't understand my pain to a point, but he wanted to. It was just a basic human need to understand and comfort someone he saw in pain. He was only 20 at the time, so I was several years his senior. He'd only had 2 semi serious, short term relationships. Compared to what I was experiencing now, he just did his best to be good person.

Over the coming months, we started to get close, but it was difficult. My soon to be ex husband still treated me like his property. From time to time, hed threaten my friends and that include this coworker. 

At this point, my SOs mother began to express her concern. She'd say things like, ""Why would a married woman want to be friends with you?"" No matter how many times he explained that we were seperated. No matter how many ways he explained our relationship wasn't like that. When I'd invite him to get togethers, or outings she'd say things like, ""Isn't her group a bit mature/old for you?"" Even using their dog as an excuse why he couldn't go out.  What bugged me about that was we had a lot of mutual friends in common. So often he would be invite not only by me, but by other mutuals as well. 

Fast forward to 2015, early spring. We've been dating for a year, and she hasn't let up. At this point, I've taken the time to get him a drivers license and teach him to drive.  Helped him get a better job. I have purchased groceries for their household, paid for furniture so she had a place to sleep, and a surgery for their family dog. I've tried to come by, spend time with them, get to know her, but she simply, doesn't want me around. 

My ex has completely moved on. Hes moved another woman into our home, and were talking about selling the house, when I find out hes been taking money from me to pay the mortgage, but hasnt been actually paying it. So, things for me are getting more interesting, however, his mom, knows nothing. As a matter of fact, she doesn't even know were dating. She still thinks were friends. Shes made it that clear that she hated me. We don't argue to this day, but one of the only arguements we ever had, was during this period. I needed support more than ever, and she was making it difficult to even get a response via text. She would constantly bug him about who he was talking to, and make it pretty clear he wasn't leaving the house. If he did, he had to come back in under 3 hours, and he never could stay the night. Most of the time shed use their dog as an excuse. We both knew it was me. 

By late spring, hed told her we were dating and she made him choose. Me, or her. 
Knowing I'd never make him choose, he picked me, hoping that hed be able to go back to his moms and make things right eventually. He moved in with me the same evening. 

From there, it was a rollercoaster ride. One of his siblings, the only one he was truly close to, a brother, was autistic. She used that to her advantage. Shed speak about me, and about my SO, and eventually he turned on us as well. He'd say rude things, things he overheard either accidently or on purpose. Well never know. Call me fat. Tell me I was gross. Accuse me of being on drugs. Rumors that I had him ""strung out on drugs and unable to speak out or leave"" swirled around. Rumors of sexual abuse. Mental and physical abuse. 

Now, how did I hear these rumors, you might ask?
We live in a very small town. 
I don't like to brag, but people that actually know us, would describe us as the ""poster children"" of healthy relationships. That were ""so cute and lovely even after 6 years it would make cupid himself vomit"". To anyone who knows us, works with one of us, or even just sees us in public, were sickeningly perfect. That's not to say were without our issues. Were not really perfect. We just know how to grow, communicate, and love unconditionally. 

Now, up until 2 years ago, May 1st, 2018, I had just taken this in stride. I helped her and the brother get an apartment. We were neighbors. Wed visit. Sometimes she would even text me. But I was sick. I'd been diagnosed with uterine cancer.  I lost my fertility. In the middle of treatment,  I slipped and fell, rupturing some disks in my back. A few months later, I lost my brother,  at only 20 years old to intentional suicide. 

This is all to say I was at a point in my life, where any unnessicary drama or stress could have easily meant death for me. 

So, we moved. 

Not far, and we obviously still wanted to have people around and in our lives. But serious changes were needed. I started perusing things I'd been passionate about before life got away from me. He started working harder so I didn't have to. We grew very close. By December 2018, I was trying to paint. I started a website, youtube, and was writing frequently. I was branching out, and hoping that in my recovery, I could find peace and happiness. By December 2019, I'd quit my job, and was hoping to make the website and my art a full time gig. I was mending my relationship with his mother, or at least I thought. 

One of her biggest complaints was that I would spend holidays with my family first. That wasnt on purpose. I have my dads side, and my moms. They always plan months in advance. His mom. Doesn't plan at all. So, as soon as wed know what my family had going, wed reach out to her. She typically worked holidays anyway, but this Sept, my mom relocated, and that meant more time for his. 

 Each year wed make plans. She'd sleep through them, or cancel with expectations to reschedual. It never happened. I spent weeks making her a custom painting last year... I still have it. We haven't seen her since... and here's why. This is why I decided to write this. 

I thought we were making progress. We've been together for 6 years this past April. 6 years. We've never argued in front of her. He's never vented about me. There's nothing to vent about. Honestly, she's the primary reason we argued when we did. So that stopped years ago. 

It started in November.  Alex had gotten a pretty expensive speeding ticket. As usual, I told him it would be fine. We'd figure out a way to fix it. Being a relatively new driver, I was shocked it took 7 years to get one. That being said, he also has wrecked SEVERAL of my/pur vehicles. Probably 4 in 6 years. Its a lot. 

At that time, he reached out to his mom. Something he had been putting off, was telling her he wanted to ask me to marry him. He wanted her to be the first to know, so he needed to check that off his list before anything else. The incident with the speeding ticket, and the graceful way I handled it, were reasons he cited when he decided to tell her that day. He told her that I loved him unconditionally and all that gross stuff and that today was just another example of that. He expressed that I encourage him to be better and through our relationship he was growing. Changing. All for the best. 

Her response was short, but remember, at this time, her and I have been on okay terms for about 2 months now. 

Fast forward to Christmas.  She blows us off but this is nothing new. We all work so it happens... she said she plans to do a get together sometime late Jan early Feb. Wed treat that like Christmas when her job was slower and she thought she could get time off. 

Ok, fine by me! I was planning for my first big art show and was trying to crank out jewelry and paintings for it. I needed all the spare time I could get! 

My SO offers to travel with me to the 2 day art show. Not only because of my health, but because it's over an hour drive, its winter in the midwest, and I can't see shit at night. The event was during the evening. A music and arts festival. A lot of the bands there were ones hed missed out on seeing before. So it was a win win for both of us. I had someone to carry my tables and chairs up 4 flights of stairs, and he got to see bands and drink a few beers. 

The first day, went well. 

The second day, she sends him a very long text. 
The jist of it was that she didnt understand why hed need to be there, or want to be there, unless he was insecure or couldn't trust me. She went on to say that I was selfish for asking him to come on his only days off, and suggest there must be some abuse, either mental or physical, because theres no way any man would attend an art show unless they had art there. 

I was stunned. 

I tried to enjoy the weekend, but my first event was ruined. I was back to square 1 with her. It broke my heart. He didn't want to even tell me, but it was eating away at him. We'd been having a blast up until that point. 

In the following weeks, his brother would pass away. It really effected my SO. It wasn't the one he was closest to, with autism, but the brother that I was close to growing up. During that time, he needed some space. He became reclusive. After a while, I found out that something about his death had brought his mom back around full circle. Instead of manipulation and suggestive messages, she was straight telling him that he didnt care about his family. In 2 years she'd never seen our new place. And she was furious that she attended her son's funeral without him. Her other son didn't attend, but she wasnt mad. 

For the record. This was his first funeral. Not his first loss, but first funeral. He did go. He couldn't bring himself to to inside. I wasn't with him. I offered, but because of her, he thought I'd make things harder. He couldn't make his legs work long enough to go inside. He tried. He tried so hard. He called me several times and he just couldn't.  

Shes basically disowned him. And its ripping him apart. She doesn't even open his messaged. She doesn't read them. And it's all because of me. I know there is a lot I'm leaving out. Theres a lot I could better explain. 7 years is a long time to be on this rollercoaster.  I know he'd ""choose"" me even though I would never ask him to. But I can't help but see his pain and think I am the one to blame.

Has anyone ever delt with this? 
What did you do? 
What should I do? 


Ps, i have messaged her, tried to sit down with her, apologized. Been the bigger person. I've always tried to approach and so good and make amends any chance I got. 
I truly have. 
She hasnt offered assistance or asked how i was when i was sick.  Part of me figures she was hoping I'd die, or my infertility would drive him away.

466,"I'm 18 and live with my parents in Canada. About 3-4 months ago during spring break, I masturbated too often, and this injured my fingers. I developed a repetitive strain injury, or flexor tendinitis, I don't fucking know and I'm tired of guessing. I've tried healing it myself and nothing is working. I need face-to-face professional help. I don't know how I should go about getting it. 

Part of me wants to tell my parents, but my situation is embarrassing and I don't know how I would tell them. I've waited too long and this has probably made things worse, so they might blame me for not telling them earlier and make me feel terrible. I don't know if I should tell them exactly what happened, or if I should fake an injury like some people have advised me to do, or tell them I injured my fingers some other way. I'm afraid they'd find out if I'm lying and blame me for lying to them. If it turns out I need to wear a cast or something, I'm really uncomfortable with them knowing it's because I was so stupid that I jerked off too hard. My parents often criticize my actions, and I think they'd try to find something to blame me for, like ""It's because you're on that phone all day!"" or ""You see? This is why you need to exercise!"". Even the thought of talking to them about it makes me nervous. Some years ago, I had to talk to them about a somewhat sex-related issue and I don't think I've ever been more nervous. 

Part of me wants to try to find a clinic myself, get directions and drive there one day, under the pretense that I'm going over to a friend's house. But I don't know if I can find the right person to go to. And I'll probably be given some sort of treatment (medication, cast, heat pad etc) and I would have to hide that from my parents, which wouldn't be easy. And if they caught me, I'd have to explain the whole situation to them without lying, and I'm so uncomfortable with that thought. I know that anything I say to a doctor in confidential, but I've heard people say that if it's serious, parents are contacted or documents need to be seen. I don't know what I'd say if they found out I went to a doctor without them. That could create trust issues between us.

If I do decide to talk to my parents about it, I don't know how I should approach them. I don't feel brave enough to talk to them in person about it, I want to do it over text messages instead. I don't know if I should tell my mom, dad or both. Each one will have a different reaction and tell the other, which they will then have another different reaction. I've thought about only telling my older sister (21) but that would be awkward and she'd definitely tell our parents. 

This injury has affected me physically, emotionally, mentally, sexually, socially and academically (for the short time when I had e-learning). I can't let it go on any longer. I hate myself for not telling my parents months ago, and now I fear that this may be a long-term injury that could take months of healing and support from my parents to get better. I don't know what I'm going to do if I get the bad news that I won't be able to masturbate the way I used to ever again. I don't know how I can deal with the rest of my daily life being greatly impacted when stupid horny teenage me decided to crank a few out when I was fucking horny and should've played video games instead that night.

I'm so fucking nervous typing this. I've tried seeking help on multiple different subreddits, and each one just made me feel worse and make more stupid choices that injured me even further. I didn't even have the courage to make a throwaway account for this. I want this to be over. I want to know if I can go back to the way my life was before I fucked everything up, or if it's too late and the rest of my life won't be as good as the first 18 years. I'm so scared of that moment when the doctor will tell me which one it is, but I know I have to do it. But I have so many obstacles in my path before I can even get to a doctor. 

I don't know what else to say. I've embarrassed myself enough times online already, and hopefully this can be the last. These past few months have been an emotional roller coaster for me. Sometimes I felt optimistic and good about myself, sometimes all I wanted to do was sleep all day because even my nightmares were fucking better than what I had to deal with each day. The pain isn't even that bad. I can still do most things that involve my fingers. On a scale of 1-10 I'd rate it a 3. But having it constantly stressing at the back of my mind that one of my main stress relievers was gone just made me feel like a literal piece of garbage. 

I don't want to keep typing anymore. I've been shaking all while writing this. What should I do?",11Jul2020,1
467,"Curious, as I already i think I know the answer for myself but I'm not 100%. Im a 22 f and my partner is a 25 m. We have a 16 month old son. I've put my chef career on hold for about the last 2 ish years ( pregnant, had a kid, did part time now at a very cruisey job) but I have been offered to  leave my current position to take a really good role at a hatted restaurant. Which is the best I'll get in the country I'm in as we dont have Michelin stars. Its 5 days, 10 - 12 hours each shift compared to the 4 days I was working but only 6 - 8 hour shifts. 
Its longer hours, and will show me way more intricate methods but I'll get less time with my son who is a year and a half

Before this my partner was the one working 12 hour days until he decided to go back to school part time, 3 days a week. I'm very passionate about culinary arts but I'm conflicted about maybe missing out on my sons growth. On the other hand I've put my career on hold and my partner missed a lot so we could swap roles while I pursue something better.

468,"He’s a great, funny friend at his best but spiteful and somewhat toxic at his worst. He’s always close minded to new things, people, etc. I think he has a lot of insecurity that’s born out of jealousy, but he hides it the best he can. I also think he’s a bit depressed because he sometimes talks about how all his days are the same. 

I used to be this way but realized the faults in my mindset and changed for the better, and I wish the same for him.

But the problem is that if I were to directly say any of these things to try to help him, he’d get defensive. I wish he would realize that many of the problems he has aren’t solved by hiding them, but instead directly facing them and making changes in his life. His family is also a lot more traditional so it’s more difficult to address mental health for himself, whereas I have a pretty affectionate family that would support me no matter what I do.

What do you suggest would be a good idea to opening up his mind a bit? I think he truly has good intentions for himself and his friends but gets caught up in a lot of the insecurities I mentioned.

Also suggesting seeing a therapist wouldn’t work so avoid anything that would be that direct or drastic.",11Jul2020,1
469,"So I’ll give some background before asking my question. 

For the last 10 months my boyfriend and I have been separated from each other because his mother and father don’t approve of him dating a girl that’s a bit overweight and doesn’t have a high school diploma and I also have Bipolar and Depression. 

Now my bipolar and depression are stabilized due to medication and because I have to take meds to keep myself stable they think I’m crazy. I’m actually quite the opposite. 

I dropped out of high school my junior year because I had epilepsy and it stopped my heart a few times and I couldn’t keep up with classes. I am currently working on getting my GED.

My weight issues are due to the fact I ate heavily when I was young after being sexually assaulted by a family friend. I couldn’t cope with what happened or tell anyone so I ate. I now diet and exercise and have lost a good amount of weight.

They wanted me to change completely as a person so I have but still to no avail my boyfriend is not allowed near me.

Now onto the point.

A few days ago my boyfriend and I were arguing because I was tired of him telling me he was going to be coming back any day now and that I just needed to be patient. He’s been saying this for the last 10 months of being gone. Also it’s important to note my boyfriend is 18 and I’m 19. We are adults but he’s afraid to leave home.

The argument started getting heated and he started calling me names and insulting me and telling me to stop talking and that I was the problem. I felt overwhelmed because I just wanted him to come back and for him to stop lying to me. 

After he hung up on me during the argument I went and deleted a an account of his that he was working with for a project. The project has been in the works for the last 10 months on rating tv shows and video games. He had over 2,000 done. I was angry at the things he said to me and I felt like I was never going to stop crying.

After I deleted it I felt bad but I wanted him to feel the same pain I’ve been feeling since he left. He’s been verbally abusive and emotionally abusive since he left so hence why I was feeling pain. 

I apologized numerous times and have been since it happened. My mother told me not to feel so guilty as I was feeling angry. My boyfriend said the same thing that it was okay and that he was sorry that he’s been treating me so badly.
My question is “why am I feeling so guilty about wanting him to feel the way I feel but then at the same time I feel horrible about hurting him”? What’s wrong with me?

(Also I know acting out of anger was wrong and I plan on working on my impulses).",11Jul2020,1

472,"Okay so im going to start out by saying I'm a 14 year old Enby who is forced to ride horses because of my moms horse training business. 

Before you go off on me talking about how nice it must be to have horses or talking about how ""rich"" I am or that I and lucky and should be happy that I have horses, I wanna tell you why I hate them.

About a year ago I was riding My young 7 year old Mare(female) Kaira, who is very reactive to sounds and the emotions of people who ride her, she can tell when your scared and will buck you off the second she senses weakness. She is a fast horse with a short stride and a sassy attitude. Anyhow I was riding her and was about to transition from trot to canter on the ""easier"" direction (left) but as she normally did she swung her neck pulling me forward then proceeded to buck me off. I fell off and landed on my head on a metal bar I fell from the bar to the floor on my left shoulder. I didn't get a concussion luckily.

well I stopped riding her for a while but the few times I did get on her my left shoulder hurt like a searing pain. this spring I tried getting on her again and she tossed her head while going from trot to canter off the lead and on the left side. I didn't fall off but I got scared and zoned out and cryed later.

Side note. The people who work at my barn see sitting around or not riding as laziness and therefore ignore pretty much everyones fears because ""you need to get over it"". also my mom won't let me quit because we have like 8 horses that all need to be ridden every day because otherwise they could colic and die(horses be sensitive)

Now whenever I look at Kaira my back gets the searing pain, its also started to happen when I've ridden other horses besides Kaira. Im not sure why this happens when I ride horses and I don't know how to fix it without quitting(which I wish I could do) Please help?",11Jul2020,1
473,"I [M19] have been in a relationship with my girlfriend [F22] for a little over a year. I've always known she's had depression but recently it's been really hard for her and it's been hard for me to know what to do.

For the past month or so she's brought up suicide a lot. She went to this water a few weeks ago and she was right next to the big drop at the edge of a cliff, and she'd told me she thought seriously about jumping and couldn't get it out of her mind. 

Over the past few days she's been bringing up suicide a lot and I'm really worried and not sure what to do. Today we were talking over the phone as we usually do every night and she told me that she's never truly been happy. She told me she realizes suicide is selfish but she wants to do it anyways because she doesn't think she'll ever be happy. She's been taken advantage of in all her relationships and has had many abusive relationships as well. She thinks it's easier to die because it's too hard to find happiness. No matter how much I tell her its worth it and that I need her to keep living it seems like nothing I say helps her.

I honestly don't know what to do.. I hate the fact that I agree with her when she says that it's too hard to find happiness, and that dying is easier. I want to help her so badly, I just don't know what to do and I'd really appreciate some advice",11Jul2020,1

It used to only happen with close friends who basically knew everything about me which from what I understand is pretty natural. But the past year has changed a lot.

I went through some things that gave me a lot more stuff to talk about when I needed advice or just needed a deep conversation.

I’ve realized that I tell the hard things in my life to people who have stabbed me in my back before- people I know will probably do it again. I tell myself it’s because I know what to expect from them.

Other times it’s just people I don’t know very well but I’m chill enough with to have a conversation and I just end up telling them about everything that’s happening because they’re willing to listen.

I’m not exactly sure why this happens but my thoughts are that it may have something to deal with the fact that I’m generally scared to actually converse with the people I’m super close to anymore because one fucked me over and left me because he didn’t want to listen anymore.

I’m sure this is pretty vague but if anyone has anything to say to help/figured out a reason for this I’d appreciate the help.

479,"So to preface, i suffer from borderline personality disorder so i'm aware i overreact to things often and don't process my feelings in the right way.

Recently my fiance has taken to watching twitch a lot. I'm generally ok with it, except for finding out he'd lied to me about paying for a subscription despite swearing he would never do that. To be fair to him, once he knew i would be upset about it he cancelled it immediately but the lying stung.

My issue now is that there's a specific game series i've recently purchased as i'd like to try it. My fiance tells me he has no interest in it at all, but hopes i enjoy it. Last night, i found out he was up until 5am watching his favourite streamer playing the game he says he has no interest in. I don't care about him watching it but i can't help feeling shitty about it - why is he interested in this streamer and not me?

There's another streamer he watches that's currently playing his favourite game so of course he's interested, but when i suggested giving the game a try he talked me oit of it and was completely disinterested. 

I just feel crap about this, like i'm not pretty or funny or interesting enough. Am i the issue here? Should i talk to him about it or am i insane?

I can only motivate myself to study when I failed and I’m disgusted with myself.

I can only motivate myself to workout and diet when I feel unhappy about my body and ended up with so much negative thoughts about my body i had an eating disorder for a while

I can only meet deadlines when I’m being scolded under social pressure (family or friends). 

And recently I found out I didn’t get into the #1 university in my country because of my grades and now I’m disgusted with myself. I always thought I was a bit smart but just didn’t apply myself. I didn’t plan to go there anyway but my pride was still hurt I didn’t make it and I feel so insecure about it. It was probably because I was lazy during my last year that I didn’t get good enough grades for that university.

This wasn’t always the case though. I used to love working out for fun. I used to be an okay student and person who took up projects and wanted to do many things out of passion, not compliance.

Now I feel so dumb and useless. I’ve tried to stop wallowing in my feelings and do things to make me feel better about it. Because I feel bad that I was lazy, I want to do everything NOW as if to compensate — workout all the time, start a small business up, learn a foreign language, and work part-time, etc. These things sound good to me on paper, but I can’t get myself to do them.

485,"My dream job is astrophyscist (sry if spelled wrong) and of course I gotta visit school, college and all that stuff, to reach it. But I hate school. I don't wanna think about it. All I see in school, is suffering. I didn't even learn anything I learned, in school. All of it, from youtube videos and stuff and my own research, and I am still slightly above my class average. So school, is basically useless in my eyes, it's just their source of money, by putting children trough pain.   
Also, I am incredibly self-concious about every single action of mine. I always feel watched and judged, even when I try to just read something, or sit. I fell judged by both students and teachers. They never say anything to me, but I *know* they judge me. I've overheard them several times talking about me and my behaviour being weird. When I confront any of them about it, they just say they don't do that, or tell me I shouldn't cry about the truth (I do not literally cry). So I am sure, you can tell I hate being inside the classroom, cuz everybody judges me.

I used to talk alot with people. Like a ton, I was the most talking person in my entire year. But all I got from that, is that I am an annoying piece of shit. Now I barely talk. When I talk, it's only when someone asked me something, and I speak silent instead of loud. I baerly even lift my head answere something in class, which gives me a bad ""vocal grading"", if you can call it that. But everytime I do lift my hand, my teachers just tell me how wrong I am, and that I should pay better attention, sometimes they even laugh at my answere and make a few jokes about it. So somehwo I figured, that I am not welcome in school.   
I am feeling way better in lockdown then in school, altough I still feel trash. I hate talking to my teachers and classmates, even if just trough a screen. And you can't tell most of them anything. They all are in a giant hivemind. Most of them even think, that there is no way, a man can experience- 

The most I hate about school, is the teaching they do. You basically are a failure to them, if you don't learn like they exspect you to. I, for example, can't learn by memorizing stuff, and just being told to write it down with a few exercises. That lead to me, being trash at many subjects I am not good at naturally. An example of that is latin. And german (which is even my native language). While I am class best in english, that does not come from school. I literally learned english by playing games on english and only watching english speaking youtubers. This may sound like a joke, but it is true.

Every. single. morning. when I wake up, I am just at the verge of crying, for having to go trough this  hell another day. It's not getting better. It's getting exponentioally worse. And why is school so early anyways? It doesn't really make sense in my eyes. All you get from it, is a bunch of tired kids going trough puberty. 

And why the fuck are we gettingn graded by a paper with a few questions? AND WHY DO WE HAVE TO EXPLAIN OUR WAY OF THINKING AND GET TAKEN AWAY POINTS IF NOT PROVIDED?! It's my fucking mind, none of your business. And when I DO provide it, most of the times it gets makred as wrong. How does one even mark my way of thinking as wrong? 

The school system is incredibly broken and fucked up, to the point you can only fix it by a completely new system. That goes for every country. Not just america, or germany. Every of em.

I want to drop out of school, even if that soudns extremly dumb, I still think I am better of without school. My parents think I am just being dramatic and making it all up, or that I am just straight up false. They also don't want me to drop out, and I can see why. They think I won't be succesful by dropping out, which I can still very well be. There are lots of dropouts that are incredibly succesful.

Another thing preventing me from dropping out, is my dream job. I see no possible way of reaching it, by dropping out.

488,"Hi all, this is a long post but I am at my wits end and could really uses some help.

I’m having an extremely difficult time with my elderly father who has over the last 5+ years been in a steady decline of health and now really let himself go. He's always been somewhat of a problem but it has become unbearable.

He is of sane mind (arguably - read on) but suffers from depression and has multiple ailments (obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, COPD). He is barely able to walk without getting out of breath and will move only from his living room to his kitchen (twice a day) or to the car once a day (to go get take-out food for ‘dinner’, every day).

He is 72 and lives alone, his house has become really very disgusting. 20years ago he would have never lived like this. He’s been hoarding for years to the point of throwing out his bed to make room for more junk (he sleeps in a chair in the living room). If I visit, he won’t let me in the house but from the door/window I can see what’s going on. I don’t think the house has been hoovered/dusted in maybe 2years, there are cob webs and bugs everywhere, a foul stench. The kitchen worktops (visible from the front door) are piled high with dishes/tins/food waste. You get the idea. Aside from his house, he has also filled a garage and managed to accumulate around 5 or 6 vehicles. Having filled everywhere he has access to, he has now rented and filled 5 shipping containers with second hand furniture (he says he is starting a business!). All his previous ‘business’ attempts have failed and resulted in only more accumulated junk.

It's been bad for some time but has got worse. Around 2 years ago he was rushed into hospital when he hadn’t taken his blood pressure meds. He was in hospital for 3 or 4 days but I had to fight with him to stay there, (even though his heartrate was 200bps he was off trying to leave after half a day on the ward (I came back from fetching him food to find a ‘friend’ taking him out in a wheelchair)!. While in hospital he made so many apologies and promises to change but he’s done nothing and actually got worse. He has the money and resources for help (I work 60hrs a week in another town) and I’ve talked to him about cleaners and carers over the years, he seems receptive but nothing happens.

He’s not been the greatest father, he was not in my life growing up and there is more to that, his three other children want nothing to do with him, I’m probably only still in his life as I pity him and he has nobody else.

He has two elderly siblings but they don't live close to him and have little contact. His closest friends (some who were actually good influences) have all long passed away and he has just a couple of 'friends' who will fetch him groceries and run errands for £20 a time. I think I'm the only one in his life these days not being paid to be there.

I have tried to talk to him, convince him to change his habits over the years, even offered to go to the docs with him to get help. He refuses to accept his health issues are of his own making (a life of poor diet, heavy smoking, heavy drinking and for the last few years completely sedentary) and he insists it is all just old age! He disputes that KFC and Chip Shop food are unhealthy (fish and chicken are both good for you right!) and it’s got to the point where I’m talking to a brick wall. He thinks he will be around for years and disagrees that he is massively putting his life at risk.

Three weeks ago, I wrote a very stern letter (email) expressing my concerns and asked him to read it and give me a call once he’d had time to process it. I just got texts telling me I’d made him depressed and he wasn’t ready to talk and it would take weeks to get over it (nothing in the letter was stuff I’d not previously raised with him, only I was firmer in writing). After the third week/text of him not being ready (and me having lost sleep for three weeks) I just went to his house (didn’t get to go in) and talked to him. It went as I expected with him rejecting my ideas of small improvements he could make and not open to any change as ‘he’s too old’ and ‘people don’t change’! He will not give up his ‘independence’.

I have suffered from depression myself the last few years; my job is extremely high-stress and he knows this. I am worried not only that he will die, soon as a result of all this (he ticks every box for a stroke or heart attack), but also for this shit show he will leave me to deal with. He doesn’t like talking about death, has no will or testament, so I alone will end up having to clear/sort and store (£) everything until his other children can be located (2 from a different marriage) and his estate can be settled. This could take months and will cost *me* a ton in storage.

To be clear I don’t care about his worth, I’m not interested in his money, I just don’t want to have to deal with all this and I certainly don’t want to end up in debt because of his actions. I’ve spent the last 4 weeks losing sleep over this and it’s affecting my own family life (it’s all my wife and I seem to talk about in the evenings as I cannot shake it), even my young children have made comments about their grandad (who they rarely see btw).

&amp;#x200B;

* Has anyone else dealt with anything even remotely similar to this and have advice on how I can get him help?
* His house is rented (local authority), I don’t know how they can let tenants live like this – will they do anything?
* What about from a health perspective, I’m sure trying to talk to his doctors surgery will be fruitless (patient confidentiality) but is there any other angle?
* Any other organisation/social care type agency that can hammer some sense into him?

He will know that I am the one who has involved whoever might try to help and will resent me for it but what else can I do?

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR: Hoarding father in poor health &amp; living in squalor.**

Refuses to recognise it as a problem, refuses to listen to me or get any help but has motivation to try to start a ‘business’.

I'm worried about the risk of his death (partly), my own mental health and the cost to me to sort out the mess he’s made (mostly this tbh).  Who can help knock some sense into him?",11Jul2020,1
489,"When I was a freshman in college, I met a guy (let’s say Mark) who was a couple years older than me who lived in my dorm. We would talk about different things like film and politics, and make fun of each other sarcastically. Over the course of a few weeks, I developed a little crush. A couple months later, we ended up making out in a study room a few times, and the crush got bigger. 

Then randomly, he dropped off the face of the earth and started dating another girl (let’s say Laura) in our dorm. I was crushed. Upset, I decided to go out with another guy also in our dorm (gotta love all the dorm-cest) and dated him for a few months. In the meantime, Mark and Laura broke up, but by the time I broke up with my guy, Mark had already hooked up with a girl I had thought was a close friend (Let’s say Megan), and hidden it from me.

Furious, I didn’t speak to him for a few months, then summer came and I didn’t see him until the following August. Fun fact about this next year - while Mark was dating Laura, he agreed to sign a lease with her and her best friend - which he still had to follow through on, even after they broke up.

So sophomore year began, destined to be a shitshow from the start. Looking back, a large part of it isn’t clear in my memory, because that winter I was sexually assaulted by a TA and my trauma brain just skated by in a daze. Through this, Mark and I remained friends and would talk from time to time. In the beginning of the year he briefly dated a friend of a friend, but it didn’t last. After the assault, he would come over and watch trashy reality TV shows with me and cuddle and be a generally kind respectful human, which meant the world to me after what I had been through.

However, Mark was very bad at expressing his emotions, and I don’t remember how it happened but we stopped talking again. I brought a male mutual friend (lets say John) who I was mildly interested in to Mark and Laura’s house for a party, and we just did typical college things like play pong and sing bad karaoke. Then halfway through the party, I noticed that my best friend (let’s call her Katy) had disappeared - and so had Mark. The last time I had seen the two of them, they had both been extremely drunk. They both emerged half an hour later from his room about a minute apart.

I confronted Katy the next day, asking if anything had happened between them. She said that nothing had. This was a lie. I had always suspected that Katy had feelings for Mark, because she would always ask just too many questions about our dates or time together. However, Katy was upset and admitted that they did make out, but he had treated her very aggressively and that she was hurt by it (whereas tbh for me his intensity had always been a turnon). While he hadn’t been physically aggressive or crossed any boundaries, he hadn’t been sweet with her like she had expected or whatever.

In later talks and reflections I would learn that Mark had been jealous of John (and generally lonely), and Katy was pretty and his friend and there so went for it bc he was upset. 

The only thing I knew was that I was deeply hurt, and although again I was not with him, I had always had feelings for him, and he had now gotten with TWO of my good friends. Which to be fair is hard to be angry about since our entire friend group of 15 people did all get together with each other a lot in a typical messy hormonal teenager way.

Fast forward to fall of Junior year, Mark had graduated and was being shipped off to officer training core for the marines. He reached out after a few months of us not talking, and asked if he could visit me for the weekend before he went to quantico. Excited, I said yes, and he came to visit.

At first it was amazing, both because I had missed him and because it was great to have all of our friends together again. This time it felt different though, because he had come back specifically to visit me. He stayed with me, and we had a great couple of days. Then I brought up the conversation of where things were going and/or what he wanted, and he shut down and didn’t say anything. Nervous of the silence, I cracked a joke like “not planning on hooking up with any more of my best friends any time soon, are ya?” and at that point he completely shut down and didn’t talk to me for the rest of the day. I apologized and asked him to say literally anything, he didn’t, i cried, he stared, then he left and got drunk with a friend and came back hammered that night to sleep without saying a word. He left the next morning with just a hug and a “goodbye”. 

Completely heartbroken, I cried myself to sleep and rearranged the furniture in my apartment because every time i would look up i would see him staring into space on the sofa saying nothing. 

We fell out of touch for awhile, and a few months later he friended me on Facebook and would talk to me sporadically - mostly sharing memes or cracking jokes like when we first met.

This continued for about 2 years, during which time he would occasionally drunk call me. One of these times he asked if he could show his officer a picture of me, and I said yes. I then asked why, and he said “I told him it was a picture of my girlfriend”. Another time, he called offering to fly me out to his base “so we could fight” (again part of a bantering conversation that I stupidly wanted to take seriously). He of course never did. 

About a year ago, he started messaging me only when he was drunk, and I was in a committed relationship and fed up with it so asked him to only talk to me sober if he valued my friendship. He obliged. So we would just talk every now and then about random life things or current events or comedy. 

A month or so ago, I got out of the aforementioned relationship when it turned abusive. This guy had been controlling and emotionally abusive for awhile, but the final straw hit when he hurt my cat. 

I started talking to Mark more and more frequently and it turned into an everyday thing. At one point I mentioned the breakup, and he responded with “oh, you’re single?” And started talking to me even more. He admitted that after he left after the shitty weekend he had deleted my number because he felt so bad about how he had left things and wanted to text me all the time but didn’t want to hurt me even more - but then created a Facebook account specifically so he could talk to me again.

I brought up the trip to base he once had jokingly promised, and we decided to make real plans for a visit. Right now they are in limbo with COVID. 

Tonight we had our first serious conversation about feelings ever. We both said we cared about each other. He talked about how he doesn’t know if he believes in love and relationships because so many people have left in his life, and I relate after losing a lot of people both by choice and by death. 

I told him I wouldn’t want to visit if at least the possibility of a relationship was on the table beforehand. 

I want to emphasize how big of a deal it was for him to share his actual feelings tonight, because he quite literally has never done that before with me or by his own admission to anyone else either. 

Although I’ve had different partners over the years (5 now to be exact), he’s always been in the back of my mind. A part of me has always loved him, and always will. I know if we start a relationship now it will be hard because he lives 1000 miles away in Hawaii and I’m in mainland US. 

But I just wanna say fuck it. I’m tired of all the bad timing and the bad communication and the obstacles keeping us from each other because at the end of the day I just want to be with him. He keeps me balanced and I keep him grounded and we are the annoying as hell Ross/Rachel of our friend group and I don’t give a fuck because I love him. If he proposed tomorrow I would say yes, because he is the kind of person who never ever makes a promise and doesn’t follow through.

495,"I live in an area which is looked down upon. In my city, people of the east region have a reputation of ""uncivilised people"". The houses are smaller, the areas aren't that clean. People are rash. Roads are choked. It's not necessarily a rich-poor scale issue but alot of girls would stop talking to me if I tell them where I live. 

People often stop talking to me when they find out where I live unless they are worse off than me. I always lie when someone asks me where I lie. I've lived all my life about it. The truth is, from my observation people in this are actually very ill-mannered. They have very a sick mentality. It's very noisy here too. 

I don't even feel like making many friends in this area. I have one friend who is a decent guy who lives near my place. He will be moving from here in a few months.

All my friends live in posh areas. My friends come from good families. Being a musician alot of the people I see time to time are pretentious. They'd judge me if I tell them I live in this locality. You know how fancy can some people be, right? My life is full of people like them.

Recently I found out my brother lying to someone about where he lived when he was little. My brother doesn't live with us anymore but he grew up in the house.
When I was out with him he lied about where he grew up. 

My question to you guys is, how would you deal with it? I don't see going all truthful about it as a solution as it would put me in situations that are too embarrassing to deal with. I don't see lying all the time as a solution too. 





Optional backstory of my parents -

My mother lived close to a red light area when she was little. She had seen alot of bad stuff growing up. My father was not a city boy. He came from a small town.

496,"I (21 M) have been great friends for about 7 months (20 F).
I'm a fairly extroverted person but I do make deep connections with only a few people and I don't really trust a lot of friends that I have to the extent I trust her. She's a bit introverted and doesn't really make plans to hang out etc so I made that my job since the time we met. She's a bit socially awkward and even the first party she's been to was my bday party a few months back. You get the picture. Classic extovert introvert friendship.

We basically hung out a lot pre lockdown and since then we've been constantly texting/calling each other. But last week I noticed that I'm always the one who makes the first move. I'm sure that she does enjoy the calls and she has shared a lot of her personal stuff to me so I do know she values me a lot. 

But the problem is that I randomly decided that I wouldn't be the first to text or call last Tuesday and we've had zero communication since then. 

Untill now, I didn't mind being the person who makes the effort to connect. But it's a bit disheartening that we'd just stop being friends if I stop making the effort from my side.

Should I confront her about this? Or should I just let this friendship dissolve itself? I've spent a couple of hours everyday for the last few months on us so it's kind of like breaking off a relationship at this point. I don't know how to bring this up without making it an awkward conversation tbh.",11Jul2020,1
498,"Hi, 

So this may be a lot lighter than the issues that tend to get posted here, so I hope that's ok. I'm not struggling in life in general or having suicidal thoughts or anything.

My problem is something that I've read about before but I can't remember what people tend to call it, so looking for advice has been difficult. Personally, I've taken to calling it ""choke mentality"". Basically, when I have to do something perfectly, instead of visualizing doing it perfectly, I'm in constant terror of making a mistake, and because thinking hard about not making a mistake is kinda the same thing as thinking about making one, I end up making one. 

This has become a problem recently because I'm trying to record some music at home. Just some simple guitar songs, which I can easily play on my own or in front of other people, but when it comes to recording them, I'm in this constant state of panic. I'm *sure* from the moment I hit the record button that I'm going to fuck it up, and I can't get through a single take without doing so. I basically have to leave my PC on record for about half an hour while I just mess about until I've gotten distracted enough that I've forgotten I'm being recorded. Even when I manage this successfully, I'll get to the last minute or so without messing up, then realize that I'm SO CLOSE to actually getting a good take, and start panicking. Of course, this means I suddenly forget how to play. It's driving me crazy, I just wanna get some demos down so I can take them to a recording studio and say ""Hey, help me make this again using decent equipment"" but I don't wanna waste their time and mine being a nervous wreck who can't get through one take.

Anyway sorry for the wall of text. If anyone has any advice that'd be awesome, or at least remind me what this problem's called so I can go do some reading. Muchos gracias either way :)",11Jul2020,1
499,"For starters, I(22F) suffer from Panic Disorder, anxiety and mild-depression. 
My anxiety and panic disorder have been really bad this past year (i mean, 2020 hasn’t been the best for anyone right?)

I’m driving up to where my birth parents currently live for unrelated reasons next week. I know that this is where they currently live because my sister visited them not long ago, and she said it was a shit show. They are not now, nor have they ever been good people. All my bio siblings except for me have gotten in contact with them at some point since they turned 18, but I just never did. All of my sibling had a bad experience reaching out, what with the verbal abuse and the attempts to manipulate them into giving away money and their freedom. Being the youngest and only a baby when we were taken away, I have never felt a strong connection to them, and after what my siblings went through, I just didn’t want to risk my mental health for them. I wasn’t healthy enough or curious enough. 

However, I have experienced a lot of healing in the past couple of years. I have been to therapy to work through traumas and I no longer harbor the same resentment and misplaced attachment to the people from my past. But I am still a little bit curious and would like to just see my bio parents one last time before letting them out of my mind. 

I literally just want to see them. Like I just want to knock on the door, get them to confirm who they are, and then leave. I have always had this fantasy since I was little that if they saw me, they would immediately know who I am, and they would hug me and everything would be better. I know that this won’t actually happen, but I feel that I owe it to young me to at least allow it to be able to happen. I think it would help me gain that little bit of closure I need. And I know that I am healthy enough now that I won’t break down or beg them to love and accept me. 

But if they don’t recognize me, I don’t want to let them know who I am or anything like that. I just want to see them and then leave. My dilemma is that people don’t just walk up to other people’s doors, ask them their names and then leave. I would need a reason to be there. I was thinking about getting a box and putting a shipping label to them on there, and then say something like your package came to my house, and putting stuff in the box that would clue them in to the fact that their biological daughter just came and went from their lives, but I feel like that’s too dramatic, even for me.

508,"I live with my mom and step dad currently, and my dad has been calling me every two days to check up on me to make sure I am staying sane inside. 
Recently, my mom and step dad have been encouraging me to get a summer job before I start college in September, just to make some extra money for myself and to get in a habit of a schedule again. I graduated in June and since then I’ve just been at home waiting for updates on college/and if I will be residing in the dorms or not— so I have lots of free time. 
I applied to work at my local Bakers, a fast food restaurant, and I got accepted to be a cashier via a phone interview. My mom and step dad were pretty excited for me, and I will begin working next Monday. My dad however, was not so excited— in fact he was very worried for me and my safety. 
While I understand where he is/was coming from, he basically insinuated/indicated that he thought that I was going to “die” or “get killed” while on the job by people or via COVID 19. Or even hinted at me being sexually assaulted— I don’t even know how to properly approach this topic. He began listing statistics of bad instances while working at fast food places, and basically instilled fear into me that I should not work in fast food/ or get a job at all. I tried to tell him that at the fast food restaurant they are required to wear masks and gloves and to keep the works sanitized and healthy at all times— but he would not listen to me. He even went as far as to just offer me 120 dollars per week, just so I don’t work. 
For me, it’s not about the money. I was to establish good working habits and experience because I have never had a job before and this would be the first time I could be “adulting.”

At the age of 14 my aunties husband started to bully me his son was just a year or so old and he felt his son was never gonna live up to his expectations so he took it out on me and bullied me was purposely the worded role model he could be as my farther wasn’t around at the time and my mother never bothered with us it ended up me getting drunk at the age of 14 at a family get together and I made a fool of myself and said things I didn’t mean or regretted then he used that as an excuse to bully me weeks later when he took me to work with him and threatened me and said he has a so called vendetta against me, ever since then he has trolled my life used every chance he’s had to put me down I’m 35 now and I’ve moved 20 miles away and believe he found out where I live and slashed all my car tyres I believe this because I visited an aunt 2 1/2 years ago and his wife came in and the past came up and for some reason they said there’s things on this fone for you to see if you show us yours stupidly and being naive at the time I thought I’ve got nothing to hide so I did I was shown a video of inside my own flat somehow he had got in and made a video I was shocked couldn’t believe or understand what I was seeing then I was told the my gf’s car would get done over i said leave a stick so I know it’s you, I felt embarrassed about some of the things I opened up about before seeing this and left with them either videoing me or had me on video call I don’t know, low and behold a year later my gfs car was done over with sticks left below the smashed window shock, no one believes me everyone thinks I’m paranoid and the thought of having to go to family events And be anywhere near them again is horrible my aunt married my real uncle so my mother and her are sisters and my dad and my real uncle are brothers the third sister the one who is the one with the bully so there’s so much connection when it comes to family there I can’t escape it, I have moved since and nothing really has happened since then, I feel I can’t go back round my old town to visit friends as he has people who would see me and inform him where I I’m it’s horrible I feel like my life has his a road block living in a town I have hardly and friends. Any advice would be very much appreciated thanks if you took the time to read this.",11Jul2020,1
516,"I have reason to believe some people in my community have slandered me and given me an extremely false, distorted identity. There must be allegations serious enough that nobody is willing to say them to me directly. But their attitude towards me ALWAYS changes considerably between the first time I meet them and later on, even though I didn't say or do anything that would cause such a change between those meetings. I suspect, in fact, that it's the work of the local police, falsely characterizing me, potentially as a ""psychopath"". I have no criminal record and am not facing any official accusations. Is this where something like a freedom of information request would provide me with knowledge if they are doing that? How about a lawyer or private investigator? Otherwise, how can I broach this topic with acquaintances in a way that would get them to tell me the truth?",11Jul2020,1
517,"***Family setting. I'm not like this to other people.***

I've been having this feeling for a bit of a long time now. I always want to have things my way and if it didn't I'll get mad, i'll sulk, stay quiet and i won't talk to anyone until i get what i want. Also I feel like it's unfair when my cousins receive better things from my parents than what I get like they receive something for their birthday while I didn't, they give them more money/allowance, they pay for the things my cousins buy while I had to buy my own using my own savings. I also hate this attitude of mine but I can't help but feel that way.

I don't know if it contributes to my behavior but I am actually the youngest but I'm not that young anymore. I'm in my late teens.",11Jul2020,1
518,"This might be long and I’m sorry, I’ll add a tldr. I am 18F and I am a nursing student. Growing up I had a physically and emotionally abusive childhood. My parents were never meant to have children. My dad used to beat the shit out me as a small child for the smallest things like a bad grade or a messy room.  My mom never really touched me but she was emotionally abusive and never stopped my dad from hitting me and my sisters. Soon after my youngest sister was born my father left and moved back to his moms house. He has since tired to contact me apologizing and telling me how much he regrets his actions and how much he wants to kill himself over it.  I’m not sure if I should forgive him. If I’m being entirely honest I kind of want to forget he ever existed. Is this a normal feeling? He seems to genuinely be sorry but I’m not sure if that’s enough. My mom denies the abuse ever happening. She has also stopped *most* of the emotional abuse but when she gets mad it always resurfaces. There’s times where she claims she’s a bad mom and runs to her room sobbing. I don’t console her because I agree but I’d never actually say it. I don’t really agree with her trying to seek validation through her children. Nonetheless my question is should I forgive her? I can never get my childhood back. Is it wrong to not care about how my parents feel about me distancing myself? I have extensive emotional and physiological damage I’m still working through every day. Advice on how to move forward with my relationship with my parents would be helpful. 
TLDR: bad childhood has me wanting to cut my parents off even if they are sorry",11Jul2020,1
519,"Hello, this is my first post and I’ve been thinking about this a lot recently, and didn’t to know who to talk to so I’m here. 

So, Me and my best friend, we’ll call her Y. I’ve known her for 3 years, we dated the first year we knew each other for a few months, then she ended things because of her parents/wasn’t ready for a relationship. I had very strong feelings for her, and she was my first love. The feelings continued on after we broke up, and then just barely last year, I got over her. We talk every day, a lot. And a couple months ago, I began to fall back in love with her. We’re both single, but we basically act as if we’re in a relationship with each other, even though we’re not. We call each other babe/baby, we tell each other that we love each other, multiple times a day. She’s told me before, that she really wants to keep me as a best friend, but the thing is, she doesn’t come off that way. She calls me those names, tells me she loves me, and talks about having an apartment/house with me. She even made a family on Sims to where we’re married and have kids. She has a heart problem called Congestive Heart Failure, and she recently broke up with her ex boyfriend at the beginning of the year because of it. She says she can’t commit to a relationship/isn’t ready. What do I do? I’ve fallen back in love with her, but I don’t know if she is just using me for the attention, or if she gained feelings for me again? Some days she’ll be super affectionate with me, and then other days she’s different. She has a lot of friends, and I have anxiety, so it results in me overthinking a lot. And sometimes I feel very used emotionally. I want to bring this up to her, but I’m afraid she’s going to stop liking me/not wanna talk because of it, I dont know why I think that, it’s just anxiety things. I want to ask her that once she’s ready for a relationship, if she would be willing to try again with me? I don’t know, I’m very confused. She treats me differently than everyone else, and treats me like a boyfriend basically, but we’re not bf and gf. Should I even bother mentioning it? Please help, I’m in a crisis and I hope to god this turns out the way I want it to, because I’m really in love with this girl, but she confuses me.",11Jul2020,1

521,"My parents have been married for 32 years, for 25 of those(my whole life) my father has been a *total* pos and shameless mooch.  He has never worked while ive been alive.  He uses a back injury from his last job threeish decades ago as the reason he cant get any job at all period.  (The man is able bodied enough he could do walmart greeting or mcdonalds or something.)He also cant even be bothered to take care of himself.  He eats twice a day, and its usually JUST ice cream and a tv dinner.  He will not bathe unless he needs to leave the house for some CL deal,and even then its *seldom*. In the past few years he has also become an *insane* conspiracy theorist.  He wakes up turns on youtube and binges the most hateful, insane shit, and me an my mom can see the toll this has taken on him.  Me and her cant have a congersation about ANY current event without him hearing and beginning inject his “government bad/ theyre all gonna throw us in camps/coronavirus is fake” toxicity into EVERYTHING, whether its relevant or not.
His only hobby is buying things.  He will pester my mom for hundreds of dollars at a time and spend all day in ebay/ali/letgo/craigslist ALL day.  I mean all day. He buys things to sell things to buy more things and perpetuate his own depression nest.  He promises to pay her back but doesnt.  He buys musical gear he never used to make it big in bands he ALWAYS quits.  
If he doesnt get money from mom he asks me and my sister.  Ive never given him a cent.  If he doesnt get money he throws fits and calls mom things like bitch or cunt or all other stuff.  Then he complains that “you have no idea how hard it is not having your own money and having to depend on someone else”
My mom puta up with it because she says she loves him and shes scared because of how depressed he is that he would kill himself otherwise, when the going gets tough he always plays the “ill just go find somewhere to die/maybe ill just kill myself” card and it works every time.  By now i think he knows it. 
My mom is also scared she would have to pay him alimony and that would break her financially , but my understanding of it is that if he hasnt done anything to support himself and wont even make the most basic effort, most judges wont just let him get another free ride out of her.  

The other day he said HE wanted the divorce because hes tired of being yelled at and never wants to hear her voice again (and all things considered is it surprising she yell? She does.   She yells when shes had enough of his shit.  Ive hear enough to know shes well within reason with how she reacts in these situations. He tries in front of all of us to spin the most obviously untrue things).  

Theres so....so much more....and hes  packed his shit left before and showed back up the *same day* saying he cant make it on his own without her, and shes taken him back.
How do i convince her enough his enough and that his actions are not her responsibility?
Hes abusing her.  Hes fucking with her head and i need to make her stand up for herself.   

Hes been in bed doing nothing for days and my mom said to me “well this is my life now” 

How do i show her and tell her it needs to end? She needs to take her life back....",11Jul2020,1
522,"this won’t be very thorough or anything but is there anything i could possibly do to get some kind of financial support from me dad though legally he doesn’t have to pay anything-fault to my mom. I turned 17 in march and he hasn’t been paying for majority of my life and has easily avoided all contact with me because he lived in different places because of the military. now he’s stationed in japan-which he moved to w/o telling me-and he lived there with his wife and 2 kids. i recently found her Instagram and she posts so much designer bags and name brand make up and clothes and she even show my siblings with those things and it made me so sad... in the 6th grade i only had one pair of jeans bc my mom had my other sisters who were just born at the time and most money went towards them. it sucks seeing he has the money jus refuses to put it towards me and my well being... also me and him have no type of contact he changed his number a few years back and i don’t bring him up much with my grandma (his mom) because she already gives me money every month and i don’t want to seem greedy for money and go and ask her when it’s not her issue. also my step mom doesn’t have a job so the money she uses is his, and every month they send me a package instead of child support. in these packages are various things but it’s always something of hers that is either A)a free sample in the mail or B) used. she sends her old dresses, shirts, earrings, necklaces, and even makeup she doesn’t use anymore, and those free sample things in the mail as well. it kinda hurts more knowing she knows i exist and that i’m a person, but not acknowledging that im a child who needs actual money to survive. i can tell it’s her sending the packages bc her handwriting on the box so maybe she does it so he keeps me out of mind? jus an observation and assumption so who knows. also to add on-yes i’m sorry this is very messy i didn’t plan to have this all out and be in essay format-in the 6th grade he started sending gift cards as his way of child support and when i had asked them for just money that my mom could use to buy me the stuff i needed-because he was sending me $100 gift cards for hot topic or just visa-my step mom told me that the child support was supposed to be used for specifically on me and my wants such as going to the movie w friends. her exact example. being 12 @ the time i couldn’t form a valid argument back but honestly i should’ve. last time i spoke with her ever. from what ik of the situation, she controls the money and buys whatever she wants w it but me now seeing my siblings being bought name brand stuff while i had to suffer wearing my moms old clothes rlly hurt bc i feel like my dad is obligated to care for his kid i don’t think that’s too much to ask. ik i seem like this is all ab money but in the end, yea. he made the choice to not be in my life but not contacting me or making an attempt to see me, so he needs to be here for me in sum type of way. idek if there is anything i can do tbh i just wanted to put this out here to attempt to try and see because y not it doesn’t hurt. i probably worded all of this horribly so thank u if u actually read it all.",11Jul2020,1
523,"   Today, I had to cover a shift from 11 AM to 4 PM so my daughter was left home alone for at least 5 hours. However, when I came home, she wasn't here. I called her and she said that she was at her friend's house. I knew some of her friends and assume that she was hanging out with them. However, when she came home, I saw her come out of a car that I had never even seen before. I thought their parents just got a new car until a the driver popped out of his window and yelled out ""stay safe, kid"" and went back in. I was stunned. He looked like he was barely an adult but he had tattoos and his hair was bleached. When I asked her about it, she just said that he was friend. 












Apparently, when she was still in school last year and was walking home, she accidentally took a wrong turn so she ended up a little lost. When she tried to get back, a man was trying to harass her and kept getting close to her. This new ""friend"" had stepped in and stopped anymore advances from the other man. After that, they kept in touch which I just don't feel comfortable with. She also said that he would sometimes take her out for food after school or hangout with her at his house and then drop her off at home. With just one look, I could already tell that he was a stoner. His eyes was reddish as well.













I talked to her and kept asking about how she could possibly see that this was okay and safe for her to do. She kept saying that it was fine and that he was a good person. Eventually it turned into big fight with the both of us yelling. She started crying before she ran to her room. I honestly have no idea what to do. I know I should ground her but I just don't know what the hell I can do to stop this behaviour. I don't want her to start thinking that it is okay to go out with grown ass men when she hasn't even gotten a driver's license yet. I don't know where I could have gone wrong. We have always been close. She would tell me everything and always relied on me whenever she felt upset. To hear that she has been hiding something so big like this from me just hurts.",11Jul2020,1

529,"Hi, I honestly don't know which subreddit is the correct one for this. Sorry in advance because my English is bad. I just don't know what to do. 

All my childhood years, I had an intense fear for my father. Growing up, he always physically abused my mother, and my mother always protected me. During my elementary school years, ive always had instances where he almost hit me, but never did. But it still provoked intense fear inside my mind. Anyways, I've always had dreams of him choking me and squeezing my body so hard, I can breathe.

Well I am 21 years old now. And my mother came across my late grandfather's diary from years ago when I was younger. My mom was shocked from what she read and told me immediately. My grandpa's journal wrote days and days of notes, about how my cousins who were little at the time, were telling him how they saw my father hit me, as if he was trying to kill me. Today, I dont fully remember the physical abuse he inflicted upon me, but I have dreams of it. I always shake it away as it just being a dream. 

There is one incident where 5 year old me went into his room and pissed him off somehow. He grabbed me and squeezed my body so hard I cried. I can't tell if it was real or not. That is one incident that i remember and dream about occasionally. Anyways, I started telling my mom I can't tell if it was real, but grandpa's journal might be confirming it? My mom told me she has always been abused like this, and that was the reason why she protected me when I was little. But she said she was always scared of him holding me as a child because of the way he gripped my body really hard when he was angry. She told me ever since she saw how he treated me when I was a newborn, she was very protective of me. 

My dad was extremely abusive and still has episodes of abuse today if you piss him off. But when I started college(4years ago), my older brother fell into a deep depression. That was when my father made an effort to stop being abusive. Ever since then, he rarely explodes into a rage but he becomes scary when he does. Yet parts of me kinda forgot how abusive he once was. 

After my mom showed me Grandpa's journal, I am in a state of shock and anxiety all over again. I can't believe I forgot I was physically abused as a child, before my mom started protecting me. I just don't know how to process this. Anyways, I don't know. Looking for advice on what to do. I don't know really.",11Jul2020,1

I am worried about surviving until the next month. I am grieving over the money that was stolen. To survive we will have to use all of our (small) savings and probably beg my (abusive) parents for help.

I am supportive while talking to my bf but inside I can't help but blame him for not even hiding the money. For keeping it all in the most obvious place possible when he knew things were already disappearing in the place he is staying at. 

The police refused to even take a statement from my boyfriend. They said that since there is no proof then it is ""as if he lost it"" and they won't take any action.

534,"I go through this cycle of reading a few books in a month or two then having to rest for a couple weeks/months before I can start reading again. These cycles will start because I'll realize I haven't read something recently so I'll find a book that interests me. Then I'll wonder why I don't read constantly throughout the year, and buy more books to read after finishing the first one. I get through a few books, but by the time I get to the third or fourth book my thoughts feel muddy, and I'll have to read sentences over and over again for them to stick. I've never tried to read quickly because I love taking in every detail or the authors unique writing style. My comprehension and imagination feel crystal clear at the beginning of these cycles, but severely decline after a few books. It's very frustrating and discouraging because reading tremendously helps my anxiety. I feel more in tune with my life if I'm reading a little bit everyday, but only if I'm not in the later part of the cycle where I'm struggling. I'm in the middle of a book right now that I'm really enjoying, but I'm really struggling to get through it. I always thought when I was a kid that if I read more I'd be able to read books faster and with better comprehension, but it feels like the opposite from my experience. Another strange detail is a feeling I get in my stomach when my mind gets muddier. It's not quite like feeling sick, but it is a sensation I feel almost like anxiety, but still different. I'd also like to clarify that I'm not reading hundreds of pages a day. I keep a steady pace of about 50 a day. Does anyone else have this issue with comprehension from reading everyday?

535,"Yep, title kind of explains itself but let me give you more backstory

Basically, our government is confusing and very very frustrating, we have about 40k+ cases and still rising, they don't really take the whole mass testing seriously and now they're opening schools in august

I'm in college now and I'll be going to a school where there's a lot of covid cases, the campus is huge so I have to use the public transport if I want to get to my classes in time since they seem to be in different buildings, for those people who would say that I should just run, I physically can't and it can go up to 38 degrees here (Celcius) so I don't think I'll be running anytime soon :)

Idk if I'm just overthinking this but I believe that less contact, the better, if I'm riding an e-scooter, I can decide how much space I can put between me and other people, they would also naturally avoid me and I won't get infected easily because I won't be using public transport that much which is my main concern

I imagine I'd be using it a lot to get me to places and would save me the money that I'd use for public transport

My only concern is the maintenance? If the maintenance costs more than if I use the public transport then maybe I can just use a kickback scooter and not an electronic one?

I don't know, I may be overthinking this, I'm also somewhat of a germaphobe and the thought of sharing a space with people who might have covid freaks me out, especially since I have lots of vulnerable people home who might get infected from me (little cousins and my grandparents)",11Jul2020,1

537,"A really long backstory on this one that I unfortunately can't give a lot of detail on, the situation goes back over ten years and is currently causing me unbearable suffering and hopelessness. Please just try to take my word on the summary below, even if you don't believe me or it doesn't make sense to you, as it's a very unusual predicament. Sorry, I won't be elaborating on specifics for privacy reasons, so please don't pry for answers i'm not comfortable giving.

^^^^^

The basic outline of a situation is, years ago I harmed a best friend through a negligent act, of which I was unaware of the potential outcome that came to be, and I would do anything to go back in time and undo it. Because we continued our friendship for almost a decade I thought the situation was well behind us forever, but, I recently learned it isn't and it still bothers them, to the point where they have called in to question whether we can continue building on this friendship. This has caused a great deal of strain on our relationship, and if it ends now, there will be serious collateral damage inflicted on our relatives and circle of friends as we have countless traditions and shared projects woven in to our lives, so this stretch has been the worst time of my life by far and there is virtually nothing I can do to about it, because the problem is that I remind this person of specific bad memories we both wish we could erase.

^^^^^

There is however one morally controversial card that can be played, and that is a specific lie. A simple fabrication that can not be disproven, except for maybe a forced lie detector test, so not really a realistic scenario for us.


The lie is only a few words and doesn't require future upkeep, it does not try to change the facts of the past per-se, nor is it a lie that unjustly shifts blame to somebody else or can come back to bite anyone down the line, there is no measurable bad karma other than the act of lying. The only effect of this lie is to drastically change my friend's perspective, and almost certainly make them feel better about themselves, and myself, and doesn't really have any way of making the situation worse (in a nothing to lose situation, even a therapist agreed that I am basically painted in to a corner).

^^^^^

The only downside to this lie is the fact that it would be lying to someone I care for deeply, and that would suck, but I can't come up with any reasons not to go through with it after sleeping on it for almost six months now. 

^^^^^

I read some articles on the morality of lying, and it does say that lying for your own gain is bad, but lying to make someone else feel better isn't morally wrong. Doing this may be for my own gain to an extent, but it would be a much smaller piece of the pie in terms of who benefits, and the person who was hurt would benefit the most, followed by friends and family that may be devastated otherwise.

^^^^^

I just want to hear your opinions on the big picture here, I know it's hard without the facts, but that is a summary of where we are at and I may be running out of time. Thank you.",11Jul2020,1
538,"So I used to have 2 accounts that I deleted because I realized how much using Instagram affected my mental health. I used one of them to post my poetry on and over time I stopped losing interest in writing but later realized it was because I was writing just so I could have something to post. I've been doing great mentally ever since I got rid of that baggage but I've realized I really wanted to post my poetry on somewhere so yesterday I made a new account. I can now limit the time I spend on social media and take a break when I feel like it, but I'm still scared I might develop an addiction to it again.

How do I not do that while still being on there because I really want to get my work out there and I don't really have any other option?",11Jul2020,1

543,"So, I am in high school and I dislike the protective measures my school is taking. We won’t be having classes and will be forced to be in one class room. I know a bit of people who know even more people that dislike these measures. I said “hey why don’t we just walk out of class one day everyone.” I am hyped to do this when I realized that most of our rights are gone when we enter school grounds. I have spent the last 10 hours going through policies and educational codes. I have found that the first amendment still stand with it the right to protest. Next I also found that it can’t be a disruption to instruction. With this new system the entire 8 hour day will be instruction. Looking further into the policy book of my district I have found that and party involved will be immediately removed from the campus without notification to the parent or guardian of the child. Then a 10 day suspension will ensue while they get a hearing date for the expulsion. Since any enumerated acts are exempted except for anything to do with attendance and disruption. What should I do? Get a good amount of people to do this and stand up for our beliefs or submit to the order of our district.  Note this is a district decision not state.",11Jul2020,1

545,"hi reddit, i’m posting here on the advice sub because I don’t know specifically where this should go. I’ve been talking to a guy on hinge for many months, he is currently in a different province but coming back next month and we have planned to go on multiple dates pending his return. He says that I am funny and cute and he can’t wait to see me etc. etc., but I’m worried that once he sees that I am chubby that he will ghost me like everyone else does when they see. I’m not even hiding my body, I do have a photo of me all dressed up for prom on my profile, but the dress was very flattering and I find that what’s under the clothes is usually what turns people off. I used to weigh 220 pounds but I lost 70 of that, so I am now an average weight according to my BMI but I have a lot of loose skin that makes me look like I’m still fat. I can’t guarantee that the reason I have had bad luck in the past is because of this, but I will say that boys are interested in me as long as I have clothes on, and as soon as I take them off I never hear from them again. There’s only been one guy in my life that hasn’t done this and he was emotionally abusive and manipulative so I don’t really count him. The guy from hinge has expressed that he’s open to receiving nudes from me, and in another world I would happily take them and send them, but I am really afraid of him seeing the bad angles and deciding not to talk to me before we even get to meet in person. he seems generally respectful of when I do and don’t want to send nudes, but he has asked on multiple occasions so I know he’s only not demanding them to be polite. also I don’t want this to sound like he is pressuring me because he’s an amazing guy and I’m really excited to meet him assuming he doesn’t hate what he sees immediately. 

I guess my main question is, should I warn him that he’s not gonna like me once he sees me in person? Or on the other hand, should I be a catfish and not show him what I really look like and be a fraud? or, third option, should I just send him a nude and get it over with so that I never have to meet him in person because he will block me on everything once he sees my disgusting body?

547,"Greetings

[18M] from Sweden here. I recently finished a 4 week job and will most likely be unemployed until the middle of September when I join the navy to become a technician.

Until then I will live with my mother and brother. While I can't do it for free I have enough money to get by.

For me the question is time, and how I should spend it. Two months is quite a long time for doing nothing. 

I will hopefully be getting my driver's license soon but there isn't much else for me to accomplish, other than that. So my question to you with more life experience is, how would you spend this time if you were in my shoes?

I have access to a gym and I go running from time to time, as well as practice MMA once a week. But there really only is so much time you can spend each day on exercising, which is why I need to find other productive things to fill my schedule with.",11Jul2020,1

My friend asked me and the other roommate if it would be fine if his girlfriend also lived in the apartment as she has all online classes for a semester. 

This makes me a little nervous. In the moment, I said I was fine with it but how on earth am i going to say no to a question like that? I’m really just thinking out scenarios that could go down but I keep leading back to “if she is going to live with us, I’m not going to be different around my homie just because she’s there” kind of mentality. 

Anyway, I just wanted to get your guys whole opinion on the matter. 

Just a few questions if you could answer them that would be great!

Questions: 

Should I act different since she’ll be around?

What if I can hear them smashing in the room next to me (thin walls or some sht)?

Should she need to contribute anything financially?

Will there be a disconnect with my friend since she’ll be there? (Are they going to just be like ghosts to us?) 

How would I go about telling him I don’t think it’s a good idea to have her live with us without offending him?

1) How strict are they with hiring people? Do I have to seem like an amazing person to have a chance at getting the job? Do I have to seem like a bad person to NOT got the job, or can it simply just be the fact that I’m not good enough?

2) Do I dress professionally or casually? Will wearing a tie and a suit make me more likely to get the job, or is that unnecessary in a fast food interview? Is a clean plain shirt, pants and shoes fine?

552,"I’m a 24 years old man who is straight

A bit more than month ago my friend came to my house to take a beer and catch up but decided to bring his cousin because they were going to a family thing afterwards

His cousin his a gay guy who’s really feminine, he wears makeup and does drag and has the whole personality to go with it (really looks like the young makeup guy who had a big YouTube scandal last year)

He didn’t have makeup at that time but we talked a lot about our passion for music, we can both play guitar

I added him on Facebook and we talked a bit and we ended wanting to have a little guitar jam session.. So he came but with full on makeup and with like a short top and jeans but no wig, his hair still short and I don’t why but my brain kind of mixed up that he was not a lady and I got turned on

We played but ended up getting closer and he spent the night.. I felt bad and ashamed the day after but he saw it and he stayed so we could talk about it.. one thing leading to another we spent the day and the night together again

It just got like this, super fast we ended spending like 5 evenings a week for the last month together.. We cook together, watch a movie or play music and go sleep together

Of course with all that time I was going to end up developing feelings, that’s what proximity does, I think about him all the time and gives me the warmest of feelings and the biggest butterflies

But it has to stop and I don’t know what to do, I know it’s gonna hurt so I’m scared of ending it because I know I’m gonna feel sad and I hate it.. But also about him, it’s all my fault because I’m the one who invited him and he never asked for anything but he’s getting played and is going to be hurt because of me

554,"*throwaway to anonymise us and to delete later

I've been with my gf for five months and she's been struggling with bulimia and disordered eating in respect to that, and I'm always there for her for whatever support she needs (her family are iffy with that and don't believe that she struggles with that). However, it gets a little iffy from here more from my side.

My ex also struggled with that and used it to manipulate me so I do have a hard time trusting people and their behaviours if that makes sense. About two months ago, I discovered that my current gf ran an ed account in Twitter and was talking about me and showed a few of our texts. She doesn't run that anymore as I was pretty mortified when I saw the content bc it what was on there was not how we are in real life.

It was mainly that event that led to this for me; I am naturally slim and I do feel guilty, I do slightly dislike my body bc of that and I feel like she dislikes me a little bc of that. I, myself, don't struggle with an ed/body image issues and whilst I can't imagine that, I do try to empathise. I feel bad within myself that I have this body when others hate theirs. I love my gf so much and she's worried that I won't find her attractive even tho I don't and never will think that. I am quite a sensitive person and tend to take in people's worries and try and support them, but I never want to be intrusive. I'm not too sure where I'm going with this, but I understand how difficult it is dealing with that and don't want to come across as self centered. I also understand this lies within myself, I have my own issues which I try not to let affect us as well, and only I can sort that out, but just wanted to know if I'm being self centered. To clarify, we've both talked about this and have been open and honest

556,"So I’m 19 years old, I live in the Caribbean and currently employed on a two year contract. I took a gap year last year because I was uncertain on what I wanted to study but now I’m sure that I want to pursue Architecture. No universities in my country or region (except Jamaica) offers this.

Back story:
Last year I planned and I applied to some schools in the US. However my dad was not of any help as he’d brush me off and forget about me, so I went ahead and did my thing (sending it documents via email to the schools- I was about to get a fee waiver) Last minutes after I sent in everything except the financial forms, my dad tells me I can’t apply because he isn’t financially stable rn. I understood and agreed with him 100% but I was pissed because he never took the time to sit with me and discuss the scholarships that were offered.

Now:
I deferred my applications for this year and soon I will cancel them as Covid has ruined all plans. My mom does not (did not) want me studying abroad and told me to look for something locally. There are no courses that interest me here yet I want to go back to school, still I don’t want my dad to waste his money on something I don’t like (even though he doesn’t seem to care tbh)

What I need advice with is if I should give up on university and just continuing working for my two years then find another job and continue that cycle. I’m really stuck rn and any advice would be appreciated. 
If any more info is needed (once not too personal) I’d give it.

THANKS.",11Jul2020,1
557,"So this is relating to the BLM movement. If you’re from Indiana, I’m pretty sure you most definitely heard of a black man who was a victim of lynching, which happened at lake Monroe during the Fourth of July weekend. Police were notified but they transferred the situation over to DNR. DNR was notified, but did not do anything about this situation bc there was no need to arrest anyone. But if you don’t know about this, that’s fine, this is just some background info. 

So the victim’s Facebook post went viral as he posted videos from multiple witnesses. My 17 year old sister cares about this movement and shared the post. Then another post went viral that listed the names of the white supremacists involved  in the lynching. It also listed their phone numbers as well as the business they work for. And also the city they live in. It also listed the contact info of the prosecutor. My sister shared the post and encouraged her friends/followers to call or email and bring justice to the man who was a victim of lynching and racism. 

My mom actually forced her to remove those posts she shared. My mom did not think it was okay for my sister to share such a thing, especially the one that exposed the racists because “this could have been staged” or this is “defaming” people (the white supremacists). Is my mom racist for saying these things? And for just sitting back and not taking action? My mom told my sister that what she did, by sharing the post with the exposed names, that this could get her kicked out of college or she could lose her scholarships (my sister is an incoming freshman starting this fall). My mom told her that all she should have done was just “sad face react to the video and move on.” What’s wrong with exposing the names of racists all over social media?

These white supremacists were grown men, in their 30s-40s. I think they deserve to be punished and exposed. I think they all work for the same business which is one of the guys’ personal business. But still, I personally wouldn’t want to support their business and if they lose their business due to lack of support, they’ll have to work for someone else. But they probably won’t get hired because of their racist acts, but who would even want to hire racists like them?",11Jul2020,1
559,"So I’ve known that my dad has been cheating for a really long time - 9 years actually, but I’ve only known about it for maybe the past 2. He’s not that smart when it comes it hiding it, or maybe I’m just observant, but I can see what he’s doing in the reflection of his glasses, a turned off TV, windows, or even his eyes if I’m close enough (sounds creepy, but I can see the basic concept of what he’s doing). He’s a right asshole when it comes to being a nice person or considering anyone’s feelings, and doesn’t accept constructive criticism or anyone’s opinions. He’s so hard to approach and I am genuinely scared that Im going to get yelled at if I ever express even the smallest opinion of my own that he doesn’t agree with. It sounds pathetic, but I am actually scared of my father even though he doesn’t physically abuse me or anything. Just scared of being put in a psychologically crippling place like he’s put me in before with the silent treatment and dismissal behaviour. I honestly considered committing that week it messed me up so bad, I’ve never felt so hated and alone.

I have solid proof that he’s cheating: pictures of Kik messages, dating accounts that he has multiple payed subscriptions to, the passcode to his iPad which is the beholder of all proof, I’ve got it all. I’ve also asked him why he’s been out so long sometimes because he “went to go get groceries and do a bit of running around”. Bullshit. That doesn’t take you over 5 hours. So when I do bring that up, he gets all exasperated and annoyed with me and brushes me off with a “I was busy”. Sometimes, I even know when he’s going to have his outings - I’d lurk through his messages to see his arrangements and what would you know, he says he’s going out that night. Sounds awful, but when he’d come back, I’d greet him with the whole big smile I missed you shit, and say something like “did you have to deal with any Karen’s?” but change it to the woman’s name he was meeting up with. I can hear his heartbeat stop and see his goosebumps rise as soon as I say her name. It makes me feel so powerful and have the upper hand, but I can never go any further than that. I wish I could, but my mum has no idea and I don’t have the heart to tell her - or anyone actually. She deserves so much better and I really really really don’t want them to get divorced. It sounds so selfish of me but fuck, I don’t want to be another kid that has a split family with two rooms, two Christmas’s, two fuckin personalities. 

I just want him to stop but I am so stuck with what to do. I’ve thought about so many different approaches, do I yell and scream? Do I be calm and sob? Do I email his email address that he uses for all his accounts from my own saying something like “can you pick me up from ___” so he shits himself? Do I catfish him as one of these middle aged women and get even more proof????

562,"TL;DR - Our dad has verbally abusive behaviour and it’s taken a really big toll on our family and we don’t know how to navigate it. 


Sorry for the really long post and the format, I’m on mobile.

Before I go into detail, I’m really just looking for some advice on how to approach my dad and speak to him about his behaviour and get an outsiders perspective on this. 

Myself (24f) and my sister (23f) live at home with our parents and we come from a middle eastern background so there are definitely cultural differences that is evident in our upbringing and our parents behaviours/outlook in life.

Growing up, our dad was basically the ‘favourite’ parent and took us to parks every weekend, fast food restaurants when our mum wouldn’t let us, get us presents etc. But as soon as we hit about 14/15 and he retired from work things got a bit difficult. He spent a lot of time (almost everyday) helping my sister and i with certain subjects for our exams which must’ve stressed him out as he started shouting a lot. Nothing specific, just small things he would lash out about if we weren’t concentrating or if we got an answer wrong he would get really angry with us.


After we left school completely and started working/going university in the last four years, things have gotten really hard. His mum passed away in September 2016 and his behaviour changed and got really strict. At this time I was 20, living at home and working and my younger sister was at university and my older sister who was living at home with me at the time was 27. He wouldn’t allow us to be home late when seeing friends and would text us around 4pm telling us to come home because it was getting too late. He would completely flip at the smallest things, like if we didn’t clean the house or wash the dishes. He tried to make me quit work at one point because I had to get a 6am train to get to a location for it and he didn’t like that I had to leave so early and be alone on a train. He was so paranoid that if we left the house we’d get a lecture on being kidnapped or raped and that anything could happen to us and this happened every single time. He didn’t want us going to bars because he once read that a car went into a nightclub and was worried that it would happen to us. We just put it down to his way of grieving and hoped this behaviour would calm down. This went on for about 4-5 months before it calmed down. 

His anger didn’t stop though, it’s just gotten so much worse. Now my older sister (now 31) has moved out for about 3/4 years now so it’s just me, my younger sister and my parents so she doesn’t really see a lot of it. Everyday we wake up, we’ll check with each other what kind of mood he’s in so that we’re aware of how to behave that day, how jokey/serious we can be or if we should just stay in our room for the rest of the day to avoid a shouting match. If we take too long to have breakfast, he’ll shout at us about how we’re wasting time and how lazy we are and how we achieve nothing. If we take too long to have lunch, he’ll shout again the same things and maybe tell us how if he leaves us we’ll never be able to survive without him because we can’t do anything without his help. If we take too long to have dinner, it’s all a repeat with the added we’ve done nothing with our day and that we’re failing in life etc etc. If we even mention wanting to eat because it’s been about 4-6 hours since the last time we ate or even just sat down for a drink he gets really frustrated and starts shouting. If we stay up too late, he’ll threaten to cut the internet off if we don’t wake up early. If we’re literally just sitting down minding our own business, he’ll find something to shout about like a bit of water on the kitchen table, or a chair that’s out of place. He’ll scream at us and tell us how much he hates us and how he wants to leave us all and see how we’ll live without him. He screams at my mum about literally everything. My mum has no self confidence whatsoever and this really doesn’t help the situation because she’s just accepted it and just takes it. She doesn’t understand why its wrong or that it’s wrong at all. He’ll tell us we’re stupid, we’re lazy, if my mum has a lot of things in a drawer or a cupboard, he’ll tell us she’s sick in the head, she’s got a sickness. 
If dinner isn’t done on time or someone doesn’t make him a cup of tea, he starts screaming about how women have their roles in life and men have theirs. That our aunts/cousins (women) back in their home countries do everything for their fathers and clean all day and night and cook too and that we should be doing the same.
Sometimes he’ll threaten to financially cut us off or cut our phone bill off if we’re just sat having breakfast and taking a bit too long to do what he wants us to do. (My younger sister and I are disabled so my parents have unfortunately spent our whole lives coddling us and making sure we’re dependent on them especially financially but we’ve been breaking out of hold for a couple years now but it’s been hard because we still don’t know a lot and they have all our papers etc and it’s still a journey tbh) 


It’s like this every single day. There isn’t a day that goes by where he hasn’t made a comment or shouted at us or screamed at us for something that could be solved so easily by talking sensibly and appropriately and we dread waking up to find he’s in a bad mood because that sets the tone for the entire day and we have to secretly pull each other aside and whisper to each other to not give any attitude or moan about anything and just do whatever he says just to keep him in a good mood but something somehow will always set him off. 

My sisters and I have spoken a lot about his behaviour (not to him) and we’re really unsure about how to approach him and talk to him about it. If we tell him to stop shouting or that he’s so miserable all the time it’s had a bad effect on all of us, he instantly tells us we’re the reason for why he shouts or for why he’s so miserable. There is absolutely no apology, no responsibility taken nothing. I don’t think I’ve ever heard him apologise for anything in my life or taken responsibility for his behaviour because it’s always our fault and we know he’s going to get really defensive about this. 


The problem is, we’re completely aware that his behaviour isn’t okay but when he’s in a good mood it can be SUCH a good day and he’s an amazing dad, he provides for us and always makes sure that we’re okay and don’t struggle for money and supports us. He’s actually a really good dad and will do anything for us. And we can have so many laughs and everything’s good in the world. But then it changes within a split second and that’s it. It’s over. But because of this, we’re always doubting ourselves and we blame ourselves for giving him attitude or rolling our eyes which has caused him to ignore us for up to 3 days (or even a week!) at a time if we do it or if we don’t wake up when he wants us to or anything. 

There’s so much more but this is so long already.

The three of us just really need an outsiders perspective on this behaviour and what we can do to navigate it and speak to him about it because despite knowing its wrong we’re always making excuses for his behaviour (especially my older sister and I), because we love him but honestly it’s made the last 4 months of lockdown so so stressful and my twin and I have a lot of anxiety due to it and it’s put a massive strain on our relationship with our parents and we’re so worried about resenting our older sister for being lucky enough to not see any of it or go through it the way we have. On top of this, earlier this year our dad was diagnosed with cancer and he gets tested every few months to check that it hasn’t spread but if it gets worse, we want to remember the dad we grew up with, the dad we have all the amazing memories with but now this is all being clouded by the way we’ve been treated in the last 4 years and it’s really affected our relationship with him.",11Jul2020,1

567,"Hi all thank you for taking the time to read this. 

So my gf has this thing she does where she like talks to everyone she sees on social media. I have no issue with it bc I trust her completely. For example at one point in our talking stage her best friends list on snapchat was like 50+% males who she admitted were into her. I was uneasy about it and the next day she cut told them that she wasn’t interested and they were all off her best friends list. 

Today she popped up to my friend over an insta story and a group of my friends are telling me to ‘pattern’ her which in crude terms is like saying fix her up she shouldn’t be popping up to a guy out of nowhere. 

At this point I’m confused because I just see it as her making friends. I trust her completely but all this questioning has got me thinking maybe I should be more cautious and express my concern about it. 

Any advice?

However she's sick and although tbh I hate her sometimes I still love her. Sometimes I think it's better she passed away than suffer the pain from her disease. I feel like a bad and ungrateful daughter writing this and deep inside no matter how much she hasn't been much of my childhood I still don't want her to go. I feel like an evil person thinking about this.


Besides, realizing my dad cheated on my mum when I was 14. When recently I found out my dad was still sexting two women I feel disgusting. I feel disgusting because I'm his daughter that his genes run in me. I feel disgusting because not only is my dad cheating but I found a lot of porn sharing between his friends that consists big butts, legal teens and etc. They're all crazy and dirty minded. I know everyone has lust but these people...I don't know what to say. To think that I know them in real life. Who knows what they might have thought of when they hugged me? And it makes  sense rn when Everytime they try to pat me they aim my braline. I have someone even rub my knees. And this makes me feel disgusting. Like I'm worthless and to know that even my dad's friends are that way, then what about him.


The main reason why I feel disgusting is because I've been purging. Purging meaning I puked out everything I ate. I don't do it for all my meals just lunch or dinner. I've tried a thousand times to control myself from eating and it's so hard. Ive cried opening the fridge door and when I eat I feel guilty about as time goes on I know the fat is being absorbed and I'm getting fat. I hate puking seriously it doesn't taste good and I know I'm harming myself. The toilet stinks after I puke and it's disgusting that I can't brush my teeth but I've got to wait with the sourness in my tastebuds. I don't know what damage I've done to my oesophagus but my teeth are yellow.

I hate all this bullshit and I want to go back to my child self again. If I could erase time I'll definitely go back and tell my 7 year old self to stop munching on all the disgusting food. My fatness has lead to most of the stuff in my life. And I can only dream about getting thin but I'm not getting thin. Am I really evil?
Am I disgusting? I don't know what to ask. I just typed here because I have no one irl to tell this stuff too. You guys are my only true best friends coz I can share stuff and not get judged or risk my secret to be used as blackmail.

Any thoughts, comments or advice would be helpful. I just desperately want someone to say something after knowing the secrets I carry.

569,"Okay so long story short, my mother is extremely toxic and thought she isn't physically abusive anymore she's still verbally abusive and VERY controlling, I got a job at Hy-Vee yesterday (a grocery store) and now she's trying to say that she's taking my paycheck that I earned and putting it into her account to do a ""savings account"" type of thing and I'm putting my foot down. I turn 18 on the 30th and I told her she isn't taking any of my money and if she tries then I'll drop out of school to work more hours and accept being homeless until I can save up enough money for a blanket and a cheap ass apartment, SHE said that if I try something like that she'll tell my employer and the cops that I'm ""crazy"" and that I'll ""be sent back to the nut house.
Just a side note but I went to the recovery clinic in Iowa City for a week trying to escape her when I was 16.
Life has been incredibly hard but I thought it would be easier now that I'm almost an adult, she keeps saying ""you are not leaving this house"" and ""you are not moving out at 18"" and demanding me to do what she wants with my life and my money.
I made this post so I can ask if ANYONE had any ideas on what I can do to leave asap?

573,"For reference she turned 17 a week ago, and I’m 17 too. 

She likes this band from the 80s and she’s in a Facebook group for it. She has an unhealthy obsession with this band, so she spends most of her time doing stuff relating to them. As expected, most of the fans are older, majority are in their 40s/50s, and so are the band members. 

The problem comes in when she is romantically involved with a 20 year old who has a past of liking younger girls. When he was 18 he was in love with a 14 year old, who turned him down and has now been blamed for the whole situation. He’s 20 years old and has a mentally ill 12 year old emotionally dependent on him. He constantly flirts with my other friend. She will excuse his behaviour at all costs even though I’ve said it’s weird countless times

She was recently invited to a 30 year old woman’s wedding, who she’s never met, and the 20 year old is going to be there. She sees nothing wrong with this, and she’s really stubborn when I try to tell her it’s wrong

She has 50 year olds commenting on her Instagram posts and I’m pretty sure she talks to some of them sometimes. Kinda gross as well but she has admitted she likes men as old as 60. 

All the rest of my friends have given up trying to tell her it’s all wrong, apart from one who’s tempted to tell her mum that she is involved with this 20 year old. 

Does anyone know what I can do to convince her it’s wrong? I don’t really get on with this girl as she defends pedophilia and racism, but I still don’t want to see her get hurt.

576,"Hey,

So about a year ago I moved from a southern state to a northern state for work. Now that time for elections are coming up, I want to vote, but am unsure how to proceed.

I still have my drivers license in the southern state, this is because my car is under my families insurance (much cheaper than getting my own). If I get a drivers license in this state, I would need to get my own car insurance, so I decided to keep it under my families while I still can. I am also still registered to vote in the southern state. But when I submitted taxes this year, I submitted them in the state I am in now (since that's where I worked).

How should I vote? My plan was to vote by mail in the southern state, but thinking through this, it seems odd as I haven't lived there in a year and don't intend to live there anytime soon. But I can't vote in my current state because other than taxes, I don't have any paperwork saying I am a resident here.

What should I do? I am trying to do the right thing and vote in the correct state.",11Jul2020,1

582,"I’m (F) turning 20 this year and in my lifetime I’ve faced a lot of trauma and abuse. From my family my friends, and ex boyfriends. It’s so hard for me to trust people and honestly I don’t know what to do.

I love myself. I’m confident. I love my appearance and my personality. I know that I’m worthy. I’ve gone to weekly therapy for a long time. My therapist told me in our last session, “So what do you think we should work on at this point? You seem to be doing very good with managing your past traumas and you carry yourself well.” She doesn’t think I need therapy every week now and maybe just biweekly.

Although I’m doing so well... I still don’t trust people. Do I still have issues within myself and I do what should I do about it? I don’t understand why I can’t just trust people.

584,"I (22F) recently graduated with an undergraduate degree in biology and I’ve had terrible luck finding a job amongst everything going on. However, a few weeks ago I got an offer to pursue a Masters degree at a great school in South Dakota from a professor I know. I love the research I would be doing and am even receiving full 12 month funding. 

The problem is that my parents are vehemently against me going. Since graduating and everything with Covid starting, I’ve moved back home with them in rural South Carolina. I don’t have the best relationship with them, but I know that they want what’s best for me. 

Their argument is that with a pandemic going on, I shouldn’t be so far away. They would never sleep at night waiting until they get a call that I was in the hospital because of covid, where I would then die alone. And I’d never see my elderly grandparents again who live in SC, who most likely won’t survive if they contract it. My father also has an autoimmune disease, and they aren’t sure how bad it would affect him if he got it. Their second big point is about my sisters wedding in February, which I am maid of honor. They say I should put being here to plan her wedding and help her above moving away (even though I’ve already helped her pick a venue and dress, and she already lives 2 hours from where I am currently). Their job solution is that I should take a secretary job at my dads workplace for now, which has absolutely nothing to do with my degree or career path, but would be a nice paying job. I’ve tried to make them see my way, but arguing with them is pointless because they won’t listen/understand me. 

I put a lot of thought into going (I literally made a pros/cons list) and decided that if I want a career in research, that I need to start being an adult and pursuing the avenues that will get me where I want to go. I wouldn’t know anyone in SD, but I’m not very concerned about that, as I’ve been keeping to myself during the pandemic anyways, and I have my dog and work to keep me company. I don’t want to be stuck at a desk doing someone else’s paperwork, but working towards and doing something that I want. The program is only two years, so even if I hated it, I can go anywhere else after for a phd. The SD program has really good protocols in place for covid, so I also feel safe working with them. As for my sisters wedding, the only two things I can’t do virtually would be the bachelorette party and the wedding itself. Both of which if worse comes to worse, I can drive the 20 hours down for. 

I’m just not sure if I’m thinking correctly. There IS a world pandemic happening that is getting out of control now. Is it right to put my plans on pause for at least a year in order to deal with once-in-100-years pandemic and my sisters wedding? Or will there always just be another thing, and I need to begin working on my future now, even if it’s against what my parents want?


TL;DR: Parents don’t want me to move cross country bc of the pandemic and sister’s wedding; I think I need to start pursuing my future.",11Jul2020,1
585,"I'll skip the very long story and the story of why we live at home for now. Short version is my mom had a very abusive dad (emotionally, physically, sexually) and growing up she learned his emotional rage. She always drinks one to two bottle of wine a night and becomes super drunk. To the point of slurred speech, staggering around..etc.  


When drunk she goes bonkers and screams at my dad, myself and my wife (yes we are moving). She brings up everything she can. And she repeats it every ten minute since she can't recall doing it before. She's caused my dad to cry, which is a new thing for me to see. 

The next day 95% of the time she doesn't even remember anything. Despite her rage lasting hours. Obviously its very hard on all of us to the point of we feel nervous when she starts drinking, when she starts yelling we see white flashes, feel nauseous...etc. Thing is, as drunks do, we can't confront her when drunk because she blames everyone and everything. The times we brought it up while she's sober, she kind of makes excuses.   


So I'm here to see if anyone has some good links for raging drunks for them to read and realize all the damage they do and that they have an issue. Something that really makes them go ""OMG, is that me?!?"". Something might make them admit to having an issue. Anything like that out there?

588,"15F first post on reddit. Dads' a cheapskate and a former doctor of some kind, every time I ask to be taken somewhere I get offered some home remedy instead, they'd never take me anywhere. Most of the time it turns out ok but now I'm paranoid as hell all the time. I have poor health, bad oral hygiene, bad diet. Whenever I try and bring it up my parents pick on me about my eating habits. Usually I love to kid and joke around with my dad, I know he really cares about me and he's my best and only friend but their joking really hits me hard. Im scared of talking to my parents anyways. I'm pretty sure my mom has some kind of disdain or misunderstanding for gay people. Dad is a super political trump supporter. Big truck, hat, car stickers. Every time we have some serious conversation and they talk to me at the same time it just flips some switch in my head that wants to ball up n' cry. 

I'm constantly skipping meals, been doing that all my life. Just easier to not eat anything or sleep instead of making food. Now my parents depend on me to cook my own meals. I constantly feel like some burden so I never say anything. Extremely picky eater too. I eat enough to not be super skinny. Have a normal looking stomach, which I like, but my wrists are super thin and my pelvis bone sticks out. My legs are giving out. I constantly feel weaker and weaker every month. At this point I can't walk around, use a mouse, draw, or play anything for and hour or so before my hands or legs start hurting. And I'm constantly hungry. Sometimes my older brother brings something for me to eat or we order food. I totally understand my parents cant displace any income on anything that isn't food or bills, I'd never think of asking for computer parts or a console but MAN would I love to get into gaming someday. Right now I just play whatever my friends gift me like hk or stardew so we can play together. I'm happy with that.

They don't even know I'm a girl and I prefer it that way. They're not dickbags or anything, they're great friends and real actual people my age. Super nice and down to earth. I appreciate them more than anything but I'm scared they'd treat me differently. Not bad just differently. My entire online personality is just the better me. And the better me isn't a girl. We have a few female friends but they're far and inbetween and they never vc. I learned pretty early on in online games that you shouldn't even consider getting on mic ever. Or vc in basically any gaming community and that's just how it is and is gonna be forever. 

I'd switch to be a dude in a heartbeat. I understand how teenagers can be about sexuality and these kinds of things. I might think differently later but I don't want to do this anymore. Obviously I take my health and well-being over my sexuality issues right now.

I don't want to be weak and skinny, there's some part of me that wants to get buff and lift weights and be super strong B\^) I just wanna be able to tackle someone and be able to run and bike again. No matter what my mother thinks about how people should be. Men can't wear earrings, women can't have strong builds, calls lesbians dykes. Bla-bla, mom stuff. My older brother really gets me. He plays videogames too and he said he'd help me get a nice pc setup once we had enough money. I  dont even have a tower right now. Its just some all-in-one monitor, slowing as it ages. That's back of the list though, I'm good with what I have right now. Even though he's my best bet Im scared of talking about all this.

She NEVER acknowledges the person who just texted. Instead immediately replies her own text/image that is unrelated. LOL
It is insane! She’ll also say things that sometimes have zero common sense and have fantastical stories that would lead to receiving praise.

Me: How did that happen?

Sis: At work this girl was having her first baby didn’t know what was going on because she didn’t seem to be in pain but her baby was coming out. So I got her to relax I told her she was doing great then I got the EMT to come help

Me: I’m glad they came on time nice.

Sis: Yea but I was ok I was ready to deliver lol I had it all under control

Me:A lot of things could’ve gone wrong, good thing you didn’t have to.

I've told her there is no point of self harming, you're just ruining your skin not solving the issue.She isn't that fashionably stylish as she tends to look frumpy due to her being uncomfortable in her body, so I don't let her wear certain stuff due to her weight. I've also encouraged her to get some botox injections and nose surgery but she couldn't handle the pain. I made her get whitening injections but she wasn't able to take the treatment as the pain was too much for her.

I have intense suicidal thoughts but have never made any attempt on my life. I have always had problems keeping friends and I think it might be because I’m not a good person. 

The reason I’m asking for advice is mainly two things. Firstly, my friends had made plans without me and posted many, many pictures which was very upsetting but also like, perspective, right? I knew they didn’t want me around during college but it was kind of proof. I kept thinking how much better the group photos looked without me. And worse, earlier this morning a friend messaged me to tell me a few instances in which I had offended and upset her. I’m torn. I remember the situations differently than she does but I would never insinuate that she’s blowing it out of proportion or anything like that, I don’t want to gaslight her. I apologized and she accepted. It really hurts me knowing I hurt her. 

Although I was having a pretty terrible week having relapsed again for the billionth time, the situation has propelled me into a terrible numbness - I truly think that the best thing for me would be to end my life but I’m not sure I want to. Are there ways to improve my mental health when each time I bring it up with family it’s ignored and minimized? I’ve been bounced between doctors and counselors with no real attention to my problems.

I’m just not sure what to do. I hope this was the appropriate place to post this and that it’s not too graphic. Thank you.",11Jul2020,1
598,"I've been through really bad things which led me to not trusting anybody,
Every time i meet someone i start thinking ""yeah they have bad intentions"" especially when it comes to relationships.

I've been having this issue for some time now and it's making me lose a lot of friends and people i love

I don't know how to fix this, any advice?",11Jul2020,1
599,"Okay so I’ve never made one of these before so this is a mess sorry! Also this is quite long and has happened over the last 7 months so certain things are paraphrased and we are all (f16) if that has any relevance. 


Anyways for some background info I just moved schools this year to a new city and I didn’t know anyone so I joined the same group as a girl, I’ll call her twin 1, in my homeroom because she was really nice and we got on well. The issue is there is this girl, I’ll call her Brittany, and she didn’t like that I came and joined the group. (From what i’ve been told by the twins about Brittany was the stereotypical weird kid back in grade 7 but she started sitting with this group even tho none of them really liked her and after a couple years was just accepted into the group, and are now friendsish.) (I say friendsish because on my first day the twins warned me about her and I honestly thought they really didn’t like her until I realised they were friends.) 

Anyways 5 weeks in to term 1 she messages me on snap and she was all niceish in a fake sort of way and said something along the lines of: “hey I was just wondering if ur gonna go join some other groups because I thinks it’s really important to see if u might suit other groups better xx” I just kinda was like “uhh I haven’t really thought of it because it’s still pretty early in the term and I don’t really know anyone enough to move to their group” after she was just like okay and the conversation ended. By this time I have had around two conversations with Brittany just between us two so she didn’t even know me that well. I was a bit confused and wanted to know if the whole group wanted me to leave or something. Anyways I asked twin 1 and was like: “please just be honest with me if u would like me to move groups I’ll understand it. I really am not interested in causing drama, I have two years left of school I don’t feel like dealing with that.” Twin 1 was super upset she said none of the group even knew Brittany said that to me and later I heard that both twins got into a giant fight with Brittany about sending that to me. 

After that it was fine and never mentioned again then we had holidays near the end of the holidays she snaps me again and said: “oh I was wondering if u we’re going to go sit with another group during term 2 because I think it would be great to sit with others and I know you’ve been talking to.... and that you two were friends so I think you should sit with her for a bit to see if you fit in there more xx” Anyways I was a bit upset that she would text me again even tho we still didn’t know each other well so I texted back a bit curtly “I dunno maybe probs not it’s been hard with iso” after this she texted back “oh okay so anyways I just wanted to let you know with schoolies if you wnat to change groups (yes I had already payed my deposit to go to schoolies with this group) you can because...”(she then talked about the rules of changing the deposit for the room etc) I got mad I texted back something like “what teh fuck is your problem with me” from there it just was long paragraphs or her saying how she just wanted me to see other groups and feel comfortable and I said that her saying this what she was saying did kinda hurt and I was still pretty new and because of isolation it’s been a lot harder getting to know poeple. The conversation ended. Throughout I had texted a girl in my group, let’s call her Kaitlyn, specifically because she was in the schoolies room I was going to be in. I asked if she would prefer I move schoolies groups and would feel more comfortable she was a bit confused where this was coming from so I told her about brittanys messages and she went into peacekeeper mode and said that brittany could just come off a bit rude and that she didn’t mean it like that etc etc anyways at the end of term 2 the group had a little gatho and I thought me and Brittany were okay because she said shit like how she repescted me for not leaving even tho she messaged me etc etc and others kept saying how I was apart of the group and no one brang it up again.

Then we get to these holidays and now a couple days before term 3 starts she messages me again and said “hey I heard that, let’s call her bailey, has invited you to her group and I was wondering if you’re going to sit with her in term 3 because we all are a really close group of 8 and it’s been a few terms now?” I was honestly really hurt so I texted her back and was like look we need to talk on Monday when school starts” she got mad and started saying things like she was sick of taking about it and how I had forced my way into the group and she wants a good last two years and there group had been nice and welcoming but there were so many other groups. I just answered look I don’t wnat to talk to u about this today (it was actually a really bad day some very very personal stuff was happening and it was a very important day for the people from my old school and they were texting me and crying to me having emotional breakdowns and I just didn’t have the time or energy for Brittany.) she never replied. 

After this the next day I texted bailey and was like heads up and sent a screenshot because I didn’t know what to even say anyways turns out she had texted bailey and asked bailey if I was going to be moving to her group two weeks earlier after I had posted on snap saying I was hanging out with her one day during the holidays! I was honestly hurt and I felt so exhausted I couldn’t be bothered fighting Brittany so I just texted bailey like “hey can I sit with your group please?” She said yes and she was so sweet and girls from her group I had never talked to messaged me saying how welcomed I was. After that bailey let me know that she had texted the twins cause she was also friends with them saying hey did you know Brittany was sent that. I then got apology messages from ally he other  7 members of the group saying how I didn’t desrve that how I was absolutely still welcomed in there group, how they didn’t know Brittany had sent that and that they liked me etc etc. I made it clear taht none of them needed to apologise and I don’t hold the other girls accountable for brittanys actions and I honestly don’t think they had anything to do with it but I was most definitely moving to baileys group. 


My question would be should I go to teachers or my parents because I honestly think the situation is over in terms of me leaving the group and Brittany getting her way but on another hand I don’t think Brittany even understands the situation she put me and others in and how she made me felt. (it was mostly easy to brush off because I ahve a very good support system with my friends from my old school and I’m old enough to feel secure and know that my personality wasn’t the issue here (also the issue with my personality was because I was shy and quieter not because I was mean or something like ??) but all I could imagine was if I had gotten that message maybe two three years prior what that would have done to me mentally. There’s also the issue of me only having screenshot of the last conversation really, I know she has creenshot of the second unless she deleted and obvs July the words of the girls who were involved (brittanys entire group and bailey) if I talked I think the twins and bailey for sure would tell the truth but I’m not sure about the other girls and just how loyal they are to Brittany.


TLDR: (I think this is where I sum up everything so if it isn’t sorry) So a girl from my group sent three different messages on Snapchat telling me to leave the group making it sound like a suggestion at first to here telling me straight out she doesn’t want me in the group, behind the rest of the girls in the groups back. I have now decided to leave the group but should I bother to go to an adult about the situation now that it has been resolved (with her getting her way and me leaving the group) especially since I have limited proof just my word against hers and like two screenshots?


(Also I’m really sorry for the lack of punctuation and grammar but as I was typing I’m now just realising how emotionally draining this entire situation has been and how tired I am so I hope it makes sense because I really don’t wnat to read through it again sorry) 

(Also please don’t repost this somewhere I’m scared she’ll see it and realise it’s me talking about her)",11Jul2020,1
600,"My bf is mixed Asian (Korean/27M), and has a hard time showing in my personal opinion compassion and understanding. I (20F) suffer from Anxiety and as a result can have low self esteem, anxiety attacks, etc., He often tells me to ""get over it"" and doesn't get that anxiety is something that affects me on a daily basis and is difficult to deal with. I've sent him numerous articles to help inform him about my anxiety and he has gotten a little better about comforting me when I feel anxious (not great though imo). He is also against me seeing  psychiatrist for the simple fact that medication might ""'Change my personality"" and it's bad for me. I think medication might help me a lot honestly, but he also said it's fine if I just see a therapist even though he told me that's not something people in his family usually do (Like Asian families keep all their issues behind closed doors which I think is stupid but hey, whatever, + his family doesn't believe in mental illness lmao). Anyway, I want to talk to him more about seeing a psychiatrist or getting help without seeming like I'm trying to purposefully ""Change myself"" or without him getting defensive. And I also want to tell him he needs to offer me more comfort and support because it feels very one-sided. I'm very caring, motherly/ nurturing, and I've helped him through/overcome so much stuff but whenever I bring up stuff about myself he brushes it off and speaks in a very monotone voice. I just want him to show more emotion and act like he cares about me more. Does anyone have any advice for this? It would be much appreciated.",11Jul2020,1
602,"It’s kind of a long story, so you have my immense gratitude if you read the whole thing. Basically, I came out to my two best friends (the one that I want to ask out is one of them) three years ago. I was so close with them that I basically said that I was suspecting that I was gay, and that I wanted them to help me figure it out, so it wasn’t even like I had to ‘come out’ at all. The friend in question, let’s call him B, Was a big reason in me discovering my sexuality, and at the time I was absolutely certain (and our very private conversations “confirmed”) that he was straight. After a while, I got over my feelings for him, and we were just friends. 

At the beginning of last year, my other best friend, and who I would soon discover was the glue that held the three of us together, moved to a boarding school. We’ve kept in contact, and we’re actually closer as a result, but B and I ended up spending most time at school with our other friend groups, and over the last year and a half have drifted slightly apart. We are still close enough that I call us close friends, but it is not like before. I feel like we have been getting closer again in recent months, but quarantine has really messed up that process.

Now, here’s where things get interesting. Before school started this year, B told me that he was bi. This came as a HUGE shock to me, and I was over my feelings for him enough that I was just happy to have a friend to talk about these things with, without even realising how this meant that I now have a chance at a relationship with him. My feelings rushed back, and I have a very big crush on him again, but I worry about the ramifications that asking him out will have to our friendship. I don’t want things to be awkward, and I honestly don’t think he will say yes. We have many mutual friends who tend to gossip, and I am worried about making things weird for our common friend group by admitting my feelings for him as I am certain that everyone would find out. I wouldn’t be embarrassed if only that group knew, but I don’t really want it to leak to everyone else.

I’d give more details, but I don’t think they’d be necessary. My main question is, should I go for it? And how can I test the waters beforehand?",11Jul2020,1
603,"Why can’t I keep a conversation going?

Hi all, I’m going to keep this relatively short but it has to do with conversational lengths.

I (16m) have a long way to go in life with work (pursuing my firefighting career. If any of you have any tips of becoming one, feel free to help a brother out!), relationships and really anything. 

Whenever I’m talking to a friend or relative, we usually come onto the topic of speaking to girls/guys. Teenagers around my age are really conscious about finding someone to talk to and date. I personally feel that there’s no need as I feel I’m going to date someone where I can see myself marrying them, which will happen later on in my life. I know not everyone is like that and that’s completely fine, but that’s not the point. As I said before, whenever I’m talking to a friend or relative, we come onto the topic of speaking to girls/guys. They go on about how they are talking to this girl or this guy and how they spoke for many hours the night before. This really makes me feel insecure as I can’t keep a conversation flowing when it’s one on one. I have a group of friends (16f 16f 15f 15f) and we could talk for hours but whenever I try to talk to someone via Instagram or Snapchat (in a friendly way, not ‘dating’) I can never seem to keep the conversation flowing and it gets really awkward. I most of the time end up saying some bs like ‘I’ve got to head out somewhere’.

609,"I'm an 18 year old male who normally keeps to himself. The other weekend when I was the only one there for a night I invited a girl over. At this point I have only slept with a girl once, which was this girl more than 12 months ago, where nothing really happened. I had planned to sleep in separate beds but in the same room, to remain friends as neither of us really had many friends in the area. But this didn't happen not long after she got there she was already under the covers of my bed and snuggling up to me while talking to people on her phone. After a few hours we left to go into town to get some food and drink to bring back to my house. After getting back and having some food we once again went back into my room and she went back under the covers again, after a short while I decided to pull the covers over my legs and torso as it was slightly chilly in the room things then started to heat up a bit between us as and we ended up having sex for about 30 seconds then after cleaning up we went back to sitting on our phones under the covers. I fell asleep a every hour for short bursts at a time as I couldn't really sleep with someone else in the bed. During this time she was on her phone and then was messing about with a guitar. We soon went to bed at around midnight. During the night I was kept waking up and at points putting my arm around her which she kept moving. During the time around 0530/0600 just before she needed to get up for work I moved closer to her and was hugging her but at points I had moved my hand down to her private area and had been touching her butt. When she told me to stop I did and I rolled away to the other side of the bed and we didn't have any communication until she said by when she went to work. 

I knew I had done wrong and had broke down for allowing myself to do anything like that.

Is there anything I can do in this situation?

Over a week later she decided to not talk to me after talking everyday since, after her not telling me why she wasn't talking to me for 4 days, she finally tells me that it is due to this and I feel really guilty for it and the fact that it happened. I apologise to her for it and except that she will probably not want to be around me for doing it.

I’m only 23 I have so much I want to do with my life. So much ambition and I work hard but when I’m not working I find it hard to fill the void of emptiness. I feel as if when you are alone, there is too much time in the day but when you are with someone you care about there is not enough.

-He invited me to workout with him

-He tries to hold in every burp around me 

-He invited me to his hotel room so we could spend time together (he is in the national guard and that is where is staying for now) 

-He used to cuddle with me every night as we fell asleep. He doesn't do that anymore 

-He's not as flirty as he was in the beginning 

-In the early phases of our talking together, he told me planned to be with me for a long time.

He said let's take it one day at a time. I asked what that meant and that kind of answer made me a little hurt after I was so open with him. He apologized for hurting and then he said he just doesn't like making plans that far in advance because he is in the national guard and everything is always up in the air with him.

-Shortly after the incident mentioned above I went to his hotel. He then offered me money for an uber because he would not be able to take me back the next day.

-Yesterday he said he loves taking showers together.

627,"I'll try not to waste too much of your time if you're reading this. 

I'm M(21) and I've been experiencing really uncomfortable thoughts/feelings for the past 6 months or so. I'll just make a list to speed this up, I'm just looking for some basic advice.

\- At night, I panic very easily. Once a little feeling of fear crosses my mind, I instantly see and hear things that terrify me (people staring at me across the room, faces, sudden screaming, flashing lights, etc). Though I can't physically see or hear these things, I can describe them. But I would never get them mixed up with reality if that makes sense.

\- I often feel extremely disconnected from reality in a dizzying way. A feeling of desperately wanting to wake up. None of this is real sort of thing. Even as I'm writing this, I have such a strong feeling of disconnection.  

\- \^\^\^This makes me think about death in a very dangerous way. Though I would NEVER do anything to harm myself. I just don't fear death. Because my life feels so faded/dreamy, my brain automatically sees death as an interesting concept. Perhaps it provides more clarity? A new life?

\- I feel like I'm sitting still and things are flying past me at light speed and I'm on autopilot. This happened today, this happened, okay new week, new month, new year, this happened, that happened, just nod and agree, do this do that, socialise, laugh, agree, go home. A feeling of 'oh hey, my life is passing by'.

\- My mood changes noticeably. Comes in cycles of about 3-4 days I think. Very sad/scared/on edge then very happy/excited/enthusiastic. Though I don't think its that extreme, maybe nothing to worry about.

\- The main thing is, I'm '''okay'''. Which I don't understand. I have heaps of friends. I'm studying at uni. I have great savings. I'm socially capable. I have a girlfriend. I have good hobbies. But the issue is, these things are just a cover up for how I'm kind of freaking out on the inside and try to ignore it all the time. 

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks for reading this far.",11Jul2020,1

630,"Hi, 

I have been suffering a brutal sinus infection for 2 years, that's been so bad I have been bed bound wasting away until recently, when I got a, I would say semi-diagnosis. 

I am too exhausted to even go into the details, but I've been through a lot with antibiotic roulette, which gave me some dangerous and horrendous side effects, ontop of not curing my infection, leaving me even more in chronic pain agony and fatigue. 

Recently they got some antibiotics and tested on staph A in my nose, which the bacteria is sensitive to, and after doing CT scans and heart traces, they think this is it. 

I am currently trapped in a nightmare of being chronically sick and burnt out but with a paralysing fear of meds.

I tried counsellors, but not having much luck with them atm, as I find them quite unqualified to be brutally honest. They just go over the same ""fight or flight"" mechanism etc, spouting off irrelevant shite imo without really listening to me

Any advice, please, I am desperate, and feel like I'm spiralling out of control",11Jul2020,1

It has been a few years since I was last on the hunt for a job (so now I guess I even have some experience) and I can’t even get a hello from companies that require well below my educational background. 

Am I doing something wrong? I have been finding postings on indeed and then going to the company site, locating the same open position and applying from there own website. I don’t know if this is better, I just think taking the extra effort to not simply easy apply on indeed would give me a leg up. My resume is good, my work history is meh (a lot of kitchen gigs until my current job in an office setting for the last 2 years) and my references and past employers have only good things to say. 

But still, I get passed up again and again for positions that I think are slightly below my educational background but in line with my work experience. 

Is there something I could be doing differently? Is the job market just that tight atm? Any tips or helpful advice would be greatly appreciated.",11Jul2020,1

635,"I need help, I honestly can’t stand being around her much of the time, for multiple reasons. She’s passive aggressive, whenever I or my brother get into an argument or political debate with her she only thinks black and white and resorts to tons of fallacies, she pretends we’ve said things we haven’t or assumes what we would say in a given situation (and most times it’s absolutely ridiculous and inaccurate). She is very conservative and I’m gay and fairly left-leaning, so she tends to disagree with me even on things like basic human rights. She also doesn’t take me or my problems seriously at all and brushes them off/ acts like it’s my fault that I have mental health issues. I just cannot stand her. There are even more reasons than that, but I’d rather not get into it.

I feel bad for feeling this way towards her, and I don’t know what to do. I guess I want to know how to be more tolerant towards her, or hate her less lol. Or if there’s something else I should do what is it? Thanks.",11Jul2020,1

638,"I'm sorry, this'll be all over the place and really unorganized, but I'm crying really hard and I don't know how to phrase my thoughts properly. 

I've been feeling like I'm losing my grip on sanity. Like I'm regressing mentally. I'm sorry, but I'm starting to feel like I'm re***ded.

I don't trust anyone, I get upset and lash out very easily, I cry a lot and feel so lonely. 

I'm in my mid teens and didn't have a very good childhood, but I don't want to get into that.

I've been to lots of therapists and tried many different medications but nothing helps at all. 

Starting last year, I was in a very manipulative and hurtful ""relationship"" with a man who was 25 at the time -- 10 years older than me. He made me believe that I'm abusive and went on to emotionally abuse me and play with my feelings and I took all of it because I felt guilty and like I deserve it (because he made me think that I am the abusive one). He dumped and ghosted me in February, and the whole experience messed me up really badly. 

I secretly despise my best friend. I guess she loves me and cares about me, but I don't feel it and I constantly doubt that she truly cares. It feels like she wouldn't care if I killed myself or stopped existing, because I'm a burden to her already. I don't think she really likes talking to me, I'm pretty sure she hates me secretly and doesn't care about me. 

I feel needy and vulnerable and like no one wants to talk to me because I'm so pathetic. That's what I am, I'm pathetic. 

I know my mother loves me but for some reason I don't really trust her, and I doubt her intentions very quickly. 

I was craving cheesecake last week so she made me some, and I loved it. She made more two days ago, but it was too sweet and I was extremely disappointed and started to cry. I know it was so unreasonable and childish, but I just couldn't stop crying and I'd been waiting  excitedly the whole day to eat it. I apologized profusely later. 

Today she said she'll make more, but instead of cream cheese it was literally just yoghurt and I had another melt down, I screamed and cried and went to my room and that's where I am now. 

I  feel so embarrassed even writing this,  I'm so pathetic and I should end my life.

I don't know what to do. I'm sure she didn't have any bad intentions and she doesn't think I'm stupid, but I increasingly feel like she doesn't take me seriously/thinks I'm really stupid and dumb/thinks I'm nothing. I don't feel like I can really trust her. 

I can't trust anyone. I doubt that anyone truly had any good intentions for me, everyone secretly hates me or is out to get me. I'm going insane.

I feel so embarrassed. 

A lot of things have happened to me in the past but I don't really know where to begin. 

I just want to kill myself.",11Jul2020,1
639,"I've always been a grade A procrastinator and have gotten thorugh most of my education by sheer dumb luck and last minute efforts. 

This lockdown made it extra hard to prioritize my studies because it made it extra easy to push it away in my mind. 
What's worse is that no one else knows this. I don't feel like I can ask anyone for help because everyone else involved believes that I've got everything under control, and I fear that coming clean will make everyone involved with my work cut ties with me.

The single saving grace is that I already have most of my data (questionare answers) since it was collected and lent to me by an external source, but the data is far from optimal.

I have about 50 days before shit hits that fan and I will have wasted half a decade of my life, but the stress and anexiety of it all makes it hard to just start and I have no idea how im supposed to do this or where to start.

641,"Background:
I've been dating this guy for like a month
I told him from the beginning I wanted to take things slow
He went in for a kiss early on the first date but I told him I wasn't there yet and he said ok and stopped
He kissed me first thing on the second date
We went out again to the park and played boardgames and chatted for hours
I like him he is very sweet
Says kind things listens seems pretty patient talks about how much he likes me
He told me during his first time he didn't really want to but after 2 hours of saying no he said yes.

The thing that happened:
So he came over to my place I put on a movie made popcorn and sat next to him
We talked and snuggled and started kissing
As things escalated he said we should go to my room
I said I didn't want to go that far and I'm sorry if I was sending mixed signals.
He said ""oh no no dont worry thats ok"" and continued kissing me.
We made out for a while then suddenly he put himself at my entryway looked me in the eyes and said ""are you ok?"" 
I couldn't speak and took a deep breath.
He pushed himself in.
I immediately felt a tearing pain and said ow.
He stopped pulled out and said ""oh my gosh are you ok?"" And hugged me.
Eventually he was on me again and I was in the same situation.
I didn't want it to hurt so I whispered ""don't move"" and slowly put him in me.
It was over quickly and he held me. We held each other for a long time I told him I didn't know how I felt about what happened.
I cried a couple unwanted tears
He noticed and comforted me
We discussed what happened a bit
I told him about the pain and me not being emotionally ready for this. And he comforted me.
We watched another movie like for real this time. 
And when it was over, it happened again but this time he was careful to go slower it still hurt but I had an orgasm He came inside me this time.
We held each other again talked about other things and had pizza and he left.

He is texting me sweet things this morning.

My point:
I don't know how to feel
I wasn't ready but I didn't exactly stop it. Why did it hurt (not my first time, was aroused). 
I don't think I feel negatively about him
I don't think I feel good about what happened
I don't know. Please help me process

TL;DR: we had sex, I wasn't ready.",11Jul2020,1
642,"This just happened a little while ago and I’m typing this on my phone, so sorry if this comes out like a jumbled mess.

So I had decided to make a new twitter account that would be less cluttered than the one I originally had. When I finished setting it up I connected my contacts list and looked at the accounts of my friends and family and that’s when I saw an account way different than the rest. The bio read out “18 findom goddess tributes $” etc. and I was confused as to who this person was so I tapped on the account, worst mistake possible. Immediately there was a photo of my cousin in a sexual positions, not naked or anything but obviously sexual and I’m at a loss.

She just turned 17 and I’m not sure what to do in this situation, me and her used to be super close and now I’m not sure if I could look at her the same way. Do I just take this secret to the grave and pretend this didn’t happen? Should I talk to her and what do I even say if I do talk to her?

643,"My ex is 23. Two years ago, they failed out of our university due to poor grades. They are NOT incapable of handing the load but they would spend 12+ hours a day behind video games, cartoons, and pornography. When I first met them, they lied about being enrolled in our university. I only figured out they weren't a member of the university anymore when their school email didn't autopopup when using my school portal email system. I did wrong things and looked into their computer, to find tens of thousands of porn media in folders. (One folder had 11,000+ images of hentai lolita characters...). Another had what looked like veyr young women/teens. The only real people porn he looks at must have the keyword of ""teen "". He explicitly looks up stuff like ""young teen porn pics"" for reference. There's always ""teen"" or ""cute teen"" there. His laptop is filled with so much porn that Windows doesn't have the disk space to update. I think he stopped doing well in school when he began being unable to do work on his computer (like coding) and being able to save it to his machine; otherwise, he'd have to remove porn from his collections. 

Furthermore, their porn addiction led to us having intimacy problems. They wouldn't get aroused by me without watching cartoon porn or mind control real porn. For our entire relationship, they couldn't ejaculate, despite having penetration and oral sessions literally for hours. I am also disgusted that they have looked up porn of characters in movies we watched after spending time together. Like when we watched The Little Mermaid and Moana. I can't watch cartoons anymore, namely with young female characters, without the image of him getting off to them. His parents paid for 2 years for him to live by the university and gave him additional money for school expenditure, but he never went to school. He just wanted their money, their efforts, and lied to them, and now he's back home because we broke up (he was masturbating to lilo and stich porn right next to me in bed and I lashed) and because of COVID.

For reference, my ex is high level autistic (aka has Asperger’s). When I needed help with hw, they were prompt, swift, correct, and extremely intellectual. They used to do really well in school when they lived on campus the first 1.5 years but they lived off campus afterwards, which seems to be when the porn addiction and lack of class attendance began taking place.


One of the last things my partner had said was that he wants to escape to the Netherlands (his dad is from there) to be away from everyone and eventually avoid everyone and start new. I fear he will persuade his dad to pay for his endeavors in the Netherlands under false premises. I think he will eventually be, or is, an online predator... But it's also illegal to go thru a spouse's/partner's electronic devices so what I did was illegal and I don't want to get in trouble for that because I didn't know at the time. I think his parents, or at least a parent, needs notice. Do they? Do I just forget about this? How do I go about notifying their parents that they should not be be wary of his online activity? It would be different if all of this were intermittent but it's everyday. He can't do more than a day without porn. We tried it to see if it would help him cum but he couldn't last a day without viewing porn by himself. Sometimes he would have nights of no sleep and literally all night would be hentai and masturbating to the point his penis is raw. (Many times we couldn't be intimate because his penis was raw). What do I do? I want to let his parents know. He failed out of school and doesn't do anything but video games, cartoons, and porn. And I feel the cartoons and video games are just ways for him to get sexual media, if that makes sense. It let's him get attracted to numerous characters and look at porn of them.",11Jul2020,1

Actually I'm on my final year of college and since covid-19 is around, my University offers online classes. It's just that I've been in college for about 6 years and about to go through my 7th. Have a hard time paying through my college bills too. It's a private University so when i can't pay for my tuition, i can't take the final exams, consequently flunking a subject. I'm from the Philippines by the way and our student loan programs aren't good at all. When i encounter gracious professors, i get amazing grades though.

For context he's on a great salary, has a gorgeous girlfriend, has a loving family so it just annoys me how ungrateful he is.

Also It only seems to feel ok when I’m using my clit but i can’t get wet enough to actually use my finger for penetration and it’s kind of awkward to reach. I’ve tried doing research and I found that most people start when they’re 12 and can do it many times a week. Is there something wrong with me?

660,"Before I begin this is quit a complicated one and hard to explain so I apologise if things are confusing. I’ll begin with a bit of background information 

My sister (16) and I (19) are very close and always have been. We always have each other’s back and will always lie to our parents for each other. This worked well because although I know our parents love us and are good people, they are terrible parents. They are very controlling and don’t let us have much privacy ( e.g go though our phones ). I also feel as if they have forgotten what it’s like to be a teenager. 

This doesn’t effect me as much anymore given I am over 18 but still heavily affects my sister. I should probably add that I believe my parents being so controlling of me sister is somewhat reasonable and although I love her she is does some very stupid things. She has snuck out, gotten drunk, smoked weed at one point to. Despite her doing all this I still believe then main reason she does this is because she is so easily influenced by other people because she wants to be “cool”. She is very immature and has very poor decision making skills. 

Recently she has been having weekly gatherings and our house where around 15 people come over and drink. At first I was trying to be reasonable and be ok with it because I would much rather she do it and tell me about it then do it and lie to me.  These have being happen pretty much every week for they past 2 months 

As they happen more often I’m getting more and more concerned. I’ll explain why below. 

Firstly I originally believed she was quite close with the people coming into our house. I have learnt this is not the case. She is very close with and least 4 of the people and around 6 others are friends just part of that group and that’s fine. However around 5 people that turn up are just friends of friends and she has actually never met them before. Every week it is a different ground of people and more strangers. One week 3 guys who were defiantly over 20 turned up because her “friend” invited them without actually ever checking with her (btw I made sure they never enter the house). 

Secondly, I only thought there were a few drinks being passed around and nothing “party-like” was happening. I was wrong again. One night a girl got so drunk and could barely walk. That’s fine to do we’ve all done it but I did not believe this was the type of even where people were drinking that much. I also learnt that some people coming in the house were high and someone had caps in there pocket. There is also a group of people that turn up and smoke cigarettes for half the night. Everyone is underage 

I should also add that my parents are always home for these events but have no idea what’s going on. They always just stay in there room and might say hi at the very beginning of the night. (I know this sounds strange considering how I mentioned they were very controlling but the family dynamics are complicated to say the least). 

During there events I always run around making sure no alcohol bottles are out, telling them to quiet down a little bit, mentioning to the smokers that they should stop so it doesn’t smell of cigarettes. I suffer from anxiety and this events cause it to be so intense and I’m so scared my parents will catch her. I do not even want to think about what will happen if she gets caught. It literally terrifies me. 

If you read this far thanks. 

Anyway what I’m trying to say is I can’t handle these events anymore. They are getting out of control and cause me so much stress but I Don’t know how to stop them. I can’t just tell my sister to stop because she will just get pissed off at me for ruining her fun and I can’t tell me parents because it will destroy our  family and destroy my relationship with my sister. I have mentioned to my sister that she should stop them or at least make them more chilled and every time I do she sounds very understanding and says yes she will have less people and make sure nothing happens. She never follows though with this though

I have no idea what to do any advice is good at this point. Thank you  for reading my rant 

TL;DR: underage sister has parties at my house weekly without my parents knowledge . They are getting out of control and I don’t know how to stop them",11Jul2020,1
661,I am F(19) I have a job at a grocery store. This past I have been extremely exhausted. Like to the point where I don’t feel like i’m in reality. Very difficult for me to concentrate or listen to people I zone out and don’t mean to. I fall asleep quite quickly. Coffee at this point hasn’t done much for me,11Jul2020,1
662,"I am now 21 and I am now old enough to look for a job and have my own money, at the same time I love doing my passion 3D modeling works. The problem is I am still not that good at it to be called a professional, I am still learning and practicing. I am getting pressured since most of my friends already have jobs. 

  
I have thought on two solutions/strategies on this.   
1. I am gonna pursue on investing my time on studying things (cloud computing to be specific) to get a good paying job and maybe after i am already financially stable, it is then where i would continue my passion.   
2. I am gonna look for any jobs, good paying or not. While continue on doing my passion until i am good enough to be called a professional and have a good portfolio and apply for a work related to it.  


I don't normally do this but i don't have anyone to ask some advice regarding on this. The thought of giving up my passion really hurts.",11Jul2020,1
664,"For the last couple of months, for whatever reason, I have been almost obsessed with the idea of adopting a new cat or cats. Every day I check PetFinder to see what cats are up for adoption in my area, I watch a ton of cat videos on youtube, I subscribed to many cat-related subreddits, and started volunteering with a local rescue so I can help with adoptions and generally take care of cats at local pet stores (this started last year, long before COVID started). I even plan to take some TNR classes to help capture feral cats off the streets and get them neutered or adopted.

Now while some of these things a definitely a positive; the problem is that I cannot adopt a new cat for the foreseeable future, not until my current cat passes away. I am definitely not looking forward to this happening any time soon as I love my baby boy but he is pretty old at this point (16) and minor health issues that neither I or a vet can seem to figure out what to do about (he says my cat is very healthy for his age, but I don't see that).

tl;dr how do I stop obsessing over the idea of adopting another cat an learn to cherish whatever time I have left with my current cat?",11Jul2020,1
665,"Ever since quarantine started my uncle started to believe that: Covid-19 isn't real ,that it is made by a worldwide association that controls the world,he explains it as if it's the illuminati , he thinks that vaccines don't work and they have mind controlling microchips in them.",11Jul2020,1
666,"I have known him for about 3 years now. In the beginning he was super nice, but then as time pasted he became much more aggressive. He sometimes joke around and calls me name (not really the problem but yeah). He calls me an idiot, slow, and etc. Once he even told me if I fixed my hair and dress nicer then I would probably get a guy or at least the guy I like(that he was serious about). He is still offended that I rated him a 1 over 6 months ago.

Anyways, I feel these last few months have been the worse. The thing is, he told me he has bipolar a little over a year ago. It totally made sense to me and thankfully I knew if not my reaction would be different. So because I’m aware of that I make rational decisions on how I should react because I’m not sure if he’s aware of what’s he’s going.

A while ago I remember I was at his place and then he thought it would be funny to try and make me angry. I was opening the door to go to the backyard and hang with the roommates. He smacks my butt and then runs away. Also, he thought it would be funny to add my crush on Facebook and try and message him. I grabbed his phone and canceled the friend request. He got super pissed off and was yelling at me. I threw his phone away on the couch. Then he got really mad at me and kicked me in my pelvis/hip area.

Later on that day, I took a nap and he kept bugging me, farted in my face, and etc. At one point my friend calls me to head over (I offered to give them a ride from work) and this guy was being annoying. I said out loud “he’s just mad because I rated him a 1” and honestly I thought he was going to attack me. He got up and came off and shoved me and pushed me around. My friend was on the phone yelling to “get out of that abusive household”.

As of two days ago, I got a phone call from one of his neighbors I’m cool with and explained a situation that had just happened. Apparently, he got in an argument with him friend on the phone and said somethings that could be considered racist. The neighbor has nothing to do with him and has removed him from their life. They also sent me some screenshot about how this guy basically said he hopes his friend gets hurt. They told me “I have known him for 3 weeks and all my friends hate him and I’ve remove him from my life. I’m not sure how you did it for 3 years.” He also informed me about what the guy says about me when I’m not around. He told the neighbor how he’s only friends with me because I owe him money, I’m annoying (ironically), and some other stuff. The neighbor was like “I don’t know you that well so how would I know all of this if he didn’t tell me? I’m not a mind reader.”

After the situation with the neighbor I called and talked to him about it and he said what he said and explained himself. He said how the guy was being annoying and mean so he “let him have it”. I told him “just because you have bipolar doesn’t give you the right to be a jerk.” There was also was an incident with some apparent threatening text messages the other neighbor showed me. I can’t deny it nor accept it since I don’t have his number me memorized as well as this particular other neighbor is a womanizer (so could have been another guy).

I tried calling his parents and they were useless. It was as if they didn’t care what their son did. The guy called me after and yelled at me about calling his parents. He accused me of starting drama then told me to delete their number and the screenshots the neighbor (the main one I talked about earlier) and how that wasn’t for me and it was private.

I went to pick up my computer the day after I called the parents (about 2 days ago). I come inside and he doesn’t greet me, nor ask how I am or anything. Instead he is still laying down gaming like always. His roommate pulled me outside to talk to me and basically told me he understands if I don’t want to come here anymore. That it totally makes sense and he understands. He was absolutely mortified about what he heard happened.

Later on I finally was checking my computer and then the guy gets mad because the brightness is interfering with his game. He changed the background. I went back and changed it and he got mad about it again. He then shoved me in the chair and rolls me back and forth so aggressively that I almost fell out and hit my head or could have fallen on my face.

I was so angry that I got up and left to chill out at the neighbors.  He said sorry and I told him to leave me alone. He rolls his eyes and say how I was being over dramatic. I was crying at the neighbors hours but finally went back later. I finally picked up my computer and went home. He tried to ask for a hug and I told him no and not to touch me. He was still annoyed about everything. He walks back home and then I drove off.

A lot of my friends who know about the other incidents where he kicked me and shoved me asked me why I didn’t call the cops (long story as to why I didn’t). I owe him some money he leant me and my friends say I shouldn’t even pay him back (morally I know it would be wrong so I’ll pay him back). As well as another factor besides that.

I know he can be nice but honestly I don’t think I can handle the abuse (if not then assault) anymore. By the way I’m 24 and he’s like 32. Only recently did he move out of his parents and he doesn’t know how to cook. Only how to microwave food. His roommate says he doesn’t see him changing especially since all of this is going on at his age.

I considered blocking him on my phone today. I don’t want to give up on him and hope he can possibly change. I worry his behavior is going to get him in trouble one day. We are patient enough to where we haven’t done anything, however some might not be as patient and hurt him (I told him that and he said then he would just call the cops). I want to leave and remove him out of my life but I also don’t want to feel like I’m being a bad person.

What should I do? I have never been in a situation like this before. Should I leave or stay? What about cops? Should I block him? What if he comes for me? Anything will help! Thank you!",11Jul2020,1
667,"I’m an 18-year old girl and sometimes I feel left out from everyone else because they all have something they’re good at while I’m just mediocre at everything. I’ve never really thought about developing a skill because I was bullied in middle school and as a result I have a low perception of my own abilities. It seems as if everyone I know is  good at singing, drawing, sports, acting, or playing an instrument while I have no talent in any of those fields. Classmates from high school made friends from sharing similar interests and I feel like I didn’t have as many friends in high school because they all thought I was uninteresting and had nothing to offer. For a short period, I was kind of interested in drawing but then my ‘friend’ told me “you’re not that good at it” and now I feel embarrassed even lifting a pencil to attempt to draw because I can only remember her words. Why should I even bother trying to draw when I’m not even that good at it? I know practice is what makes someone better at something but her words of criticism prevent me from attempting to improve myself.",11Jul2020,1
668,"So I have this problem where whenever it’s silences and I’m alone with my thought, I end up thinking about scary, gross, embarrassing or sad things. It really makes me uncomfortable. I can’t be alone with my thoughts anymore. So I turn on podcasts or tv shows in the background ALL the time. When I’m sleeping, working out, sleeping etc. It drowns out thoughts that way. But I noticed that it has affected my ability to do work because I can’t concentrate as much. Would it be worth booking a therapist over this?",11Jul2020,1
669,"Because it's pandemic, we have online classes. It's almost half of the class got 100 on the test. I just have a sense that they're having their own tricks to get good grades on the test. Because usually, only a few people pass, and their grades were not even close to 100. I [17] study for hours everyday, and sometimes my grades are not as good as theirs. Sometimes, it makes me jealous because they can get good results without the efforts. It's not like I want to join them cheating though, I just think that it's kinda unfair and I really want everyone to do the test their own. But, of course I can't haha. Also can anyone tell me the good thing and sweet words about studying on my own? Because sometimes I'm lack of motivation because of this. Thanks!",11Jul2020,1
671,"Long story because I'm trying to give a full view on this issue I have, thanks for taking the time to read it!

I have 2 sisters whom are both older than me, I'm 17 years old, the youngest, my older sister is 18 and my oldest sister is 21. I don't have much of a problem with my oldest sister because frankly, she has her own stuff to care about, but my older sister (not the oldest) is just incredibly annoying, I'm not sure if ""annoying"" is the right word to use. 

For example during dinner, my family always dines together, her seat is right in front of me and whilst I'm just trying to eat, I notice her staring at me and when I look back and say ""why you looking at me?"", she aggressively defends herself saying she wasn't looking. Or during a conversation, more like an argument honestly, I deny some statement she has and give proper reasons why and then she just starts shouting lightly and tries to ignore me and this upsets me a lot. 

Her being ""annoying"" towards me might be because I usually tell her things like ""stop being stupid"" after she makes a mistake or I call her dumb sometimes for being dumb and I'm not going to lie, I can be a bitch sometimes. But she would still be weirdly attentive towards me, like putting her nose in my business or giving unasked opinions, when I tell her I didn't ask her opinion she aggressively starts defending herself again. 

She doesn't have a lot of friends and what I notice is she always texts huge amount of texts to those couple of friends she does have while they reply with something short so this tells me she is a little obsessed with people. Since we were little, me and oldest sister were always good together and sometimes made the middle sibling, the one with whom I have a problem, a third wheel, but nowadays both of my sisters are better connected with each other than they are with me so this confuses me a lot. What I also notice is that she is insecure, like most girls I think but I'm not sure, I feel like she hates her own personality, like she hates her own voice, tries to not be herself, doesn't have many hobbies aside from watching drama's (I don't think watching dramas is a hobby but I could be wrong) and finds her life incredibly boring and always is talking about how cool other people are.

She had friends when she was younger who kind of miss used, her and this could be a reason for her problems right now and is often neglected or even lightly bullied by other classmates.

I don't hate her, in fact I care a lot about her and I want her to be happy but she is very 'annoying"" which makes it kind of hard to pity her and she always claims she isn't sad, she is always angry when I try to give her advice or my parents or even my oldest sister.

  
Once again thank you for taking the time to read this and I could really have some useful advice on this situation.",11Jul2020,1
672,"To sum it up a little: I (21F) came back to my home country 3 years ago after being abroad for a little over a year, and I still haven't made any friends. 

First of all, English is not my first language, so I apologise before-hand.

I had... very cuestionable friends before I went abroad for a year 4 years ago. My best friend stopped talking to me a few months after I moved, and the other two friends I had soon followed her. I had wanted to cut ties with them anyways, I just didn't realize how lonely my life would get.

When I came back, I met my boyfriend less than a year later, and he has been my rock. But I feel like I need to be less dependent on him for everything. He says that he feels fine about me being dependent on him, but it probably takes a toll on him, and he doesn't tell me. 

I have been defined as shy and quiet my whole life, but when it comes to meeting people, I like to think that I try to leave my shell and I try to socialize. But after trying and trying, and not succeeding at making friends, it makes me wonder... is there anything wrong with me?

It's not like I haven't tried. I think I even try too hard sometimes, and maybe that's why some people have stopped talking to me. But I'm always the one who texts first, who calls first, who asks to hang out first... And they eventually stop talking to me...

I started college in September (a bit late, because I had to save up a little and work for a few years...), and most of my class is very young. But I managed to get to know three girls in that class, and I've tried my best to be friends with them. But they already have their friend groups, and find it weird to hang out with me. Every time I ask them to hang out they never have time. Yet, I see how they meet with other people in social media. Again, reiterating the fact that they don't want to hang out with me and already have their friends. 

I just need some advice... I feel foolish to go to one of those ""meetup""s or similar events alone... But should I go?

I just feel so lonely, and more so given the situation the world is in now.",11Jul2020,1
673,"A little back story, so I have known this girl for a couple years, but really had the balls to talk to her much. A couple months ago I started to have small conversations with her over snap. My end goal was to ask her to FaceTime so I could get to know her better, but when I asked her she said that she had to eat dinner and then she could FaceTime. Next I said okay and she didn’t open it for 24 hours and once she did open it she just pretended like it never happened. A couple days ago I had the opportunity to hangout with her through some mutual friends, it just makes me sad to know that I failed to make a good move.

Is there anything I can do to have a chance with her?",11Jul2020,1
674,So I work at a salon and I waited a good 10 minutes pst the appointment time for one of my clients today and I didn’t hear from her.

But she didn’t bother to tell me when it was already pat her appointment time or when she knew she wouldn’t make it on time. Anyone else have clients like that who don’t call if their going to be late and just think they can still show up when they get here?

676,"(I'm not sure if I should put this here or not, but just in case, trigger warning)

Hello, I'm posting this on a temp account since I'm not sure if this friend uses Reddit or not. Also, I am a 15 year old male, and this friend is a 15 year old (trans) girl. I'm not sure how relevant that information is, but it might be. 

I met this friend in school (I'll call her C for simplicity) and mostly I thought she was just a cool friend for a while. I also met this other friend (M) through her, since they've been best friends for ten years, who will come into the story later. It became very clear when I talked to her through messaging that she was going through lots of mental health issues, mostly with depression and anxiety (she claims she hasn't been happy for years, absolutely hates her parents, feels worthless, has nonexistent self-esteem, can be suicidal, etc.) I tried my best to help but I have not once been successful in making her feel better. I have even called Safe2Tell (an anonymous reporting service) or told our school multiple times when I was worrying about her safety. She also, and this is very important, refuses to even try get a therapist or any kind of help.

However, there was also one point in... around November or October of last year? I'm not too sure when, but quite late into last year, me and C were in a Discord call late at night when she told me that she was a lolicon. I didn't know what it was, she described it to me, and I was quite disturbed. I also figured out over time she was attracted to *actual* children and animals, and even has a crush on a 9 year old girl. This disgusted me, and very much still does. What weirded me out more is that M knew about this for a long time. I think the reason I didn't care about it as much at the time is because I was much more dedicated to thinking about her mental health than those other issues. 

Over time, I just cared less and less which was wrong on my part. However, after becoming a much more active user of Twitter in June, the topic was brought up by multiple people in my feed and showed quite intolerant ideas of pedophiles, which forced me to think about C. The thing is, there were periods of time where I became quite anxious about the fact she's attracted to animals and children (a few days to a week at a time, once or twice per month), and then it goes away. But this time, I didn't let it go. I talked to M about it (and by that I mean we essentially got into a spat about it because we're both quite defensive). I understood the idea M was telling me, that ""they can't control what they're attracted to and if they have it under control then it should be fine,"" which I was leaning towards thinking a little more with time. 

However, as I was still mad about it, I decided to ask C a few questions to see if, despite she's attracted to animals and children, she knows it's wrong. So I asked her ""Do you think animals and children can consent?"" Both of them she said yes to. This pissed me the fuck off in the moment and I sent M screenshots of what she said. To my dismay, he said that this definitely bothered him, but he didn't want to judge because ""she won't do anything, so why should her believing this matter?"" I was absolutely furious with both of them, but I had a little doubt because M knows C too well and I wasn't sure if what he said to defend her was valid or not.

I got into arguments about this with M over the next few days until I was put on the spot to say whether or not I was going to continue being friends with her. In a few messages prior, I learned that another one of my friends said (paraphrased), ""honestly, that is disgusting, but she's still one of the kindest people I know."" I also knew that other people in the friend group were still mad that I was going after C. This influenced my thinking at the time. So I answered to M's question with ""I will not forgive her for what she said... but she still is a kind friend."" He was quite happy with that answer and the ""drama"" was over, at least for now.

The thing that I hate to admit is... C is a kind person and does deeply care about everyone. I wish this situation was much more simple so the answer could be much more clear. I'm not sure what's morally right, or just right in general. If I'm in the wrong here, please tell me. Otherwise, I'm just lost and don't know what to do about the whole situation. Any help is greatly appreciated, and thank you so much for listening. I'm also open to answering questions that you might have.",11Jul2020,1

678,"So, I have my drivers test today. This is my second time taking it, I failed the last time because I got extremely nervous. The test has been adapted for COVID-19 reasons, so the main part of the test is parallel parking. I’ve been practicing a ton for it, but when I’m actually under pressure in that situation, I crack. I always end up hitting the curb or being outside of the lines in some way. But when I’m not nervous, I’m totally fine. When I took the test the first time, I was so ready. I had gone to practice the night before and did it correctly a bunch of times. The next morning, I made a mistake that I had NEVER made when practicing. I failed and my heart was broken. As a 16 year old, getting my drivers license is such a big deal to me because all of my friends are getting it. I just want to have some freedom.

Anyways, I’m so anxious about what’s going to happen today. Thinking about the fact that I might fail makes my stomach churn. I don’t want to have to wait anymore. I know this is a pretty dumb FWP, but I worked so hard for so many months to get this. 

My confidence is so lacking, especially when I go to take the test. I get it in my head that I can’t do it... then I fail. This happens in every part of my life. I am a perfectionist and get incredibly upset with myself even at the littlest things. I’m salutatorian of my graduating class right now, so I put a lot of pressure on myself to do well. I think that may have something to do with it.

So PLEASE, if anyone has any ideas of how to get me to be confident before I start the test, let me know. It’s at 3:45 PM EST today just fyi.

Any suggestions for me? Thanks!",11Jul2020,1
679,"Here’s the thing - I adopted a dog a few weeks ago, and I didn’t meet him before (these dogs are from another country, often strays.) and so far, he and I get along great, he’s an amazing dog. He’s 10 years old, and surprisingly well behaved considering what his background probably entails. 

The problem is with my other dogs. I have two smaller dogs, and a larger one (about the same size as the one I adopted.) and he doesn’t get along with any of them. Before adopting this dog, I was told that he would be perfectly fine with all kinds of other dogs (of course I was clear with the fact that he would be living with smaller dogs). He hasn’t done anything horrendous, but he has nipped at the other dogs, completely unprovoked. When the smaller dogs growl at him, he doesn’t back off, and the larger dog is often very nervous around this new dog, which isn’t really like him. 

I’m not getting too much support from the adoption company, as they tend to kind of roll their eyes and blame me, as if I shouldn’t have adopted a dog if I couldn’t handle it. I’m not blaming the dog, or them - but I’m scared for my other dogs. I’m told to wait a few weeks, and I will, but it seems risky when other dogs are possibly in danger. 

It’s also such a difficult decision because this new dog and I have a great relationship so far. I just don’t know what to do. A part of me also doesn’t want to wait two months, let him settle in, then realize it’s not working, and then turn his life upside down all over again. 

Any advice?",11Jul2020,1

686,"Yesterday I found out my GF was cheating on me, this is not the first time she has done something like this ( 4th time) I tried to trust her but she breaks my trust all the time.

I suffer from IED and shit ton of anger issues and this thing makes me wanna kill her, she lives 20 mins away from me but she is lucky that due to lockdown I can't go. I don't wanna kill anyone, I'm a nice person by this urge is killing me, I am just Soo mad at her. I want her to suffer.
I have her nudes and I can even leak them and ruin her life but I don't want to do that either, it's like a fight in my head about what should I do, I was raised right but this anger will be the end of me. I don't wanna be a bad person but I'm just Soo hurt rn. I cant control myself I don't wanna hurt her I just wanna be left alone. I feel so disrespected and all I did was love her to death and this is what I get. 
Pls I need help, there are no mental health services ATM.",11Jul2020,1
687,"Due to the current situation things have been difficult as it is. Just before this i had received an admit to a good foreign University. I quit my good ol job to study there. Now when the lockdown due to the virus, the Embassy is closed and now I'm jobless. I now have quite a debt to repay.

 I don't know what can be done. I am not able to find work again. I think of killing myself but can't do it since the debt will probably be put on my parents which i would never want.. Just lost with no sign of hope.",11Jul2020,2
688,"I'm always bitched around, patronized, and provoked,  by the current ""friends"" I have.  This caused me to sometimes have minor beef with a few of them (I'm defensive and sensitive, I don't want to be clowned around) , and when that happens, I'm immediately excluded from any meetups that are planned (even in front of my face). For eg, if I know they are out in the city or something and I were to message them if I can come, they would just troll me and laugh while flaunting  the fun they are having. So obviously, I usually try to avoid getting all defensive and try to be calm so I don't cause any trouble. But there really is a limit to how much I can hold back. 

Joining other groups isn't really possible (it's hard to just be accepted into other groups if you're not og), plus I have some beef with people from other groups (it's really petty and old so I could possibly make amends) . I'm currently one year from completing high school so moving to another would be an inconvenience, I have no clue who I'm gonna sit with at my graduation ceremony ball. Will I just have to endure this, and wait till University to make new friends?",11Jul2020,1
689,"Long time lurker, first time poster so cheers. Imma get straight to the point here because this is a “long” one. 

So here’s some context, I have an ex boyfriend that I’ve known since I was in first grade. Through him I met the guy who is being highlighted in this story.  Let’s call this guy “cup”. Now cup and I have known each other since I was 15 (now I’m 21) and he was 14 (now 20).  Now imma emphasize something here, I’m a fairly attractive woman who’s friend group is primarily male. So with that being a factor, it’s literally nothing new to me when one of those male friends admits their feelings for me. I know how to handle it and we talk about it to settle where we lie. Now ,I literally cannot stress enough ,ALL of my friends know they can approach me about anything. Whether it be feelings, our relationship, or just need to get something off of their chest; especially when it involves something I did. And yes, even Cup knows this because we’ve had these talks before. Cup knows me VERY well and has seen me become the person i am today. 

Now onto the story.

For a year and some change now I’ve noticed my messages weren’t delivering (iPhone) to Cup. I had a fairly old model of the iPhone last year ,so I figured It was Steve Jobs trying to get another money grab beyond the grave. I ignored it and never approached him about it because my phone was also doing weird things anyway. Fast forward to January of this year. I had a really bad point in my life and once I got back on my feet, I decided to treat myself to the latest iPhone. I noticed after a few weeks of owning this brand new iPhone 11 my messages weren’t delivering still to him. I noticed also that I’d only get my messages to deliver only if he texted me first. This was weird to me and I started getting suspicious. I talked to my ex and it goes as follows:

Me: “hey, do your messages deliver to cup?”

Ex: “yea?”

Me:” do they deliver every time?”

Ex: “yea?”

Me: “and do your phone calls go through every time?”

Ex:”.....yes, why?”

Me: “my messages nor calls never deliver to him unless he hits me up first”

I sh-t you not what he said next aggravated my soul.


Ex: “oh yea, he blocks you all the time because he doesn’t want you talking to him around his girlfriend “

When I learned this I was furious. Not only because he chose his gf of 2 years over me, but also the fact that he ALWAYS comes to my apartment crying to me about how he can’t stand being with her and he wants to leave. When I tell you this man will come over, sit on my couch, and rant for an hour about how much he hates his girlfriend. Just to then get up, leave, then post about how she’s the love of his life all over Instagram. It IRRITATED my whole being because you’re wasting my time and I’ve given you all the advice I could give. 

I’m a very emotional person. Not the “sensitive and shy” kind but the “this is how I’m feeling and imma let to know” kind. I’ve never had an issue with speaking my mind nor telling someone how I feel. When I approached cup about this he laughed in my face and told me “you’re trippin OP relax”. This infuriated me beyond comprehension, but I kept it pushing and thought maybe my ex was messing with me and I took it to heart. 


He was not messing with me and I had an absolute right to take it to heart. I woke up a few weeks ago to a text from cup saying “sneaky link? 😛”  mind you I haven’t talked to this man in like 3 weeks. I at the time was “talking” to someone so of course I said “no”. The text conversation goes as follows. 

Cup: “it’s sad you don’t fwm like that anymore 😔”

Me: “what? Say sike right now, cup. Because I’m deadass not in the mood”

Cup: “you’re never in the mood. What’s wrong with you?”

At this point I’m even more annoyed. 

Me:” I’m on my f*cking period and in pain and you questioned my loyalty.”

Cup: “🙄🙄”

Cup: “I’m sorry, I didn’t it was basically a way of me saying I miss you”

Me:” then say I miss you. Plus on top of that my messages never deliver to you unless YOU feel like talking to me”
“And you’re right I’m never in the mood because I don’t have time for dumb sh*t”

Cup: “you don’t text me anyways 🙄”

Me: “BULLF*CKING SHIT YOU CAN ASK EX ABOUT THAT SHIT”

Cup: “I’m dumb shit to you? Ouch that’s tough”

Me:”bye cup you’re pissing me off”

Cup:” that’s basically what you said reread it”


Me: “no the fuck it wasn’t, no the entire fuck it wasn’t.”

Cup: “just forget it.”


A few hours goes by and he asks if he can come over. I say yes because I’m thinking he was going to apologize. He didn’t apologize. Instead he made me even more mad.  We joked around a little bit then we got back on the topic. I told him I know he’s blocking me because ex told me he was. I told him I’ve been bringing this up to him for months and that I’m sick of it. He , once again, laughed in my face and said “you’re trippin OP relax”. I was visibly getting angry and he told me to calm down. Which made me even more mad. I brought up to him how dismissive he’s being. He told me he’s never been dismissive towards me and that I’m acting weird.  I reminded him of the time he brought someone ,who I have vocally stated I strongly disliked and made me uncomfortable, into my home without my permission nor knowledge. He told me to get over that since it happened over 2 months ago. I was heated. I was so damn pissed. I told him to get out. He looked at me and laughed and told me I’m making myself mad. I told him again to get out. He laughed some more. I went baxk into my apartment (we were on my balcony) and slammed my door. He came in and tried to hug me. I told him to get the hell away from me .


He looked at me blinked, then laughed yet again in my face. He then said “do you want me to forreal leave?” I told him yes and when he walked out I slammed my front door on his foot. He then texted me and the conversation went as follows:
 
Cup: “you’re crazy, all of that was too extra” 

Me: “I’m crazy? You weren’t Fucking listening. I’m tired of you hitting me up when it’s convenient for you.”

Cup:”how do you expect me to talk to you and listen when you act like that? That ain’t coo that’s not how we are.”

Me:”Every fucking time I try to tell you my messages don’t go through and my calls you laugh at me and say I’m capping? The fuck ever”


Cup: “bet” 


Me:”I’m fucking trying to tell yo ass this shit and it’s not the first time I’ve told yo ass this shit I’m mad.”

Cup:”OP leave me be, calm down then come talk to me “

Me:”nah fuck that I’m pissed pissed and you’re gonna hear what the fuck I gotta say. I’m tired of this.”

Cup: “I blocked you because I love you.”

Me:”what?”

Cup: “I wanna be with you. I hate being friends sometimes but ik that’s how it is “

Me: “that’s so ducked up you blocked me because you have feelings for me? That’s so immature “

Cup: “it is I agree”

Me:”And what’s even more fucked up is that you just admitting to doing the shit even after months and yes MONTHS of me trying to tell you what was going on and you making it seem like I was fucking psycho. Stop talking to me”

Cup: “I didn’t know how to tell you”

That’s a lie because we’ve had this discussion before. 

Me:”And if you were really my friend youd know you could talk to me about what the fuck was going on and we could’ve actually settled everything stop talking to me”


After that I blocked him on everything. I was furious. Now it’s a few weeks later and I’m wondering if I overreacted to the scenario. So that brings me here, am I wrong? Should I apologize? Or should I cut him off for good? I’m sorry for the long post again. Thank you to any advice that is given.",11Jul2020,1

691,"I've been friends with these two girls for about 5 years now and since we usually hang out as a group I was going to talk to them about it over dinner/drinks tonight but I don't know how to go about it. 

We've actually never really had a lot in common, in hindsight it has always been very one sided. I've tried to distance myself but there still around after 2 years, that's not to say that they've been trying that hard. I think I'm sort of being used honestly, they hang out individually but when they get bored they call me to join. I don't think they're personalities mesh well unless there is a third party to draw their negativity. They've always been FAIRWEATHER FRIENDS but I'm so much more than a whether man. 

How should I go about this?

Knowing them they'll either just say oKAy and I'll leave so they can gossip (not to mention a long text message afterwards) OR more likley they wont understand and try to pry out my really negative thoughts but I don't want to get so emotional when they don't care.",11Jul2020,1
692,"Hello,
My parents have recently decided that now COVID isn't a thing anymore. Before COVID, there was an expectation of me to go visit them once a week since I moved out. It stopped in March with the quarantine. Now, they have started to feel offended that I still don't feel safe to come. I have heard my mom and my aunt talking about the virus and it is clear they are a part of the people who believe it is a hoax. My sister still lives at home and she tends to believe whatever my mom does. My father is more apprehensive but they both ignore whatever opinion he has. On Sunday, they are expecting me to come over and if I ask them to wear a mask they will get angry at me. I don't want to go there. I am scared of getting the virus. I don't know what I am supposed to do in this situation. Does anybody have any ideas? I would really appreciate it.",11Jul2020,1

694,"This has been going on for a long time now.. yesterday I kind of had enough, but now I'm wondering if I did something wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom and I had been on bad terms for a few years now. She has always treated me more harshly than my brother. If he did something wrong it was always met with a ""that's just how he is. He has Autism you know"" (I do too). However, with me, it was a different story.

&amp;#x200B;

I was always expected to do more and to do much better than him, despite being much younger since she thought I was just copying my brother/acting autistic. Eventually, this made me question my self-worth and spiral into a deep depression. I had thoughts of running away, but I stayed and helped her. I was the only one there when she was going through cancer treatment. My brother disappeared and left me to do everything.

&amp;#x200B;

Every day I got yelled at. my dreams were criticized and destroyed to no end by her. I've never been so down in my life but I tried to stay strong for her. I was scared of losing her, despite how horrible she had been to me. I knew this was like a rough patch that we needed to get through and I would be there for her, unlike the rest of our family.

&amp;#x200B;

A few years, and a thousand more fights later, I was looking for an apartment. During this time I also had a therapist that she would regularly drive me to. I didn't like being in her car when she was upset. She would drive so fast that it would scare me. One day my mom actually confessed to wanting to ram the car into something when she was speeding. I was afraid and furious at the same time, but I was still there for her. Knowing how close I was to THAT was extremely scary...

&amp;#x200B;

I do forgive a lot. Maybe too much. When I moved into my apartment I tried to mend things slowly over time. However, when she would come over she would tell me what I had to change and what she hated about my apartment. I absolutely loved that place. She would start to ""clean up"", which basically meant bringing more chaos into my place so I can't find my stuff anymore. I do have stuff lying around but at least I know where it is. I've always been like that.

&amp;#x200B;

She would chat it up with my neighbors and talk about me and things I did not want her to share at all. I  know some might say ""that's how mothers are"" but it's still no excuse to embarrass me like that to people I barely know. I'm very introverted and have social anxiety. I only share things with my close circle of friends normally. My mother always mocks me and makes me feel bad if I ask her to stop, calling me oversensitive and rude.

&amp;#x200B;

Over time I would slowly stop responding to certain texts on Whatsapp, like when she would forward a bad joke from someone else. I don't find it funny and she always gets mad at me that I don't like the same stuff that she does. There are 40+ years between us, I don't enjoy her boomer humor and what's wrong with that. No, seriously. I stopped laughing at some jokes and she gets furious with me and calls me names.

&amp;#x200B;

While living here I finally got some confidence. I have my first healthy relationship since - ever. I found better friends. All in all my life is pretty good since I moved. Every time my mom wants to meet up I panic and get anxiety attacks. One thing that infuriates me is that she never lets me finish my sentences. I used to do that unconsciously and I always apologized. A few years ago she started doing it to me for no reason other than: ""you do it so I will do it too"".

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday we were talking on the phone. I was feeling pretty bad because my bf had just left the day prior and I missed him. I didn't have a lot of sleep. On the other side, my mom is in the middle of selling her house and moving, so she is extremely stressed as well.

I have someone that checks up on me twice a week and goes grocery shopping with me and so on (paid by gov). My mom forgot she was on holiday so I reminded her and said my standard:

""I think I told you, but- (that doesn't matter. I know you can't remember everything)"" (because of chemo-Alzheimer).

I couldn't even finish my sentence when she yelled at me:

""don't you think I have better things to do than to remember every little thing about you-""

I don't remember more about it right now. I wasn't shocked that she would go off on me about something like that because she's always been this way since she got her cancer treatment. I kind of just hung up on her. Immediately I got scared. I've never hung up on her.. but then I remembered when she just hung up on me in the middle of an argument and what A crying mess I was. She never apologized, for anything she said. It was always my fault anyway and she was right. She also never even once thanked me for anything I've done for her or acknowledged it.

&amp;#x200B;

Everything was always about my brother and how amazing he is and what he does. Every phone call was about what he did and how amazing he is. I admit that I got jealous. I don't ask for a ""thank you"" .. but not being called lazy for taking a 5-minute break on my computer when I had been cleaning the whole house (basement to attic) would be enough. I was called a spoiled brat so often because her therapist brainwashed her into believing these things about me. She told me I have no reason to be depressed and other wonderful things...

&amp;#x200B;

It felt good to hang up, but also wrong. Friends have told me that I should take a backseat and stop trying to mend our relationship. That I've been doing too much. I'm emotionally burned out from years of this. My life is a rollercoaster with her. I never know what side I will get from her.

&amp;#x200B;

I messaged her later but she didn't answer (left me on read). we were supposed to meet up today but I wrote her again to tell her that I didn't feel well (not a lie) and that I had to cancel. Still no answer (left on read again)... I feel like an asshole right now and she probably thinks of me as a bad daughter. I don't want to ruin my relationship with her but I also don't want to become a servant/doormat like before when I swallowed my feelings.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to have my own life and not get told that I ""act autistic"" because I ""hate her"" or similar.  She either says I'm a bad daughter or the sunshine of her life. I don't know what to believe anymore. She's also screamed at me when I told her that I want to change my name asking me ""what did I do wrong now!?"". 

&amp;#x200B;

I really need some advice because I don't know what to do anymore. I love my mom but I don't want her to ruin my life any more than she already has. I've been thinking of limiting or cutting contact because it's becoming too much for me.

698,"I rescued my at the time kitten about 11 months ago. Because of rising rent I moved in with my mom with my cat about maybe 9? months ago. My mom is not someone I want to be physically close to. The plan was to move away with my cat to a city with cheaper rent. Things worked mostly according to my plan (except for COVID-19 and lockdown). I'm now in a new city, but I didn't bring my cat when I came here. The plan was that my mom would find someone to drive with her and send my cat to me once I'm settled. It's now delayed due to new COVID cases.

 I miss my cat a lot, to the point of sometimes crying when I see his photos and videos. But I feel like he is doing great without me... Personally I really want to be with him, but I'm seeing a lot of reasons why my cat might be happier living with my mom.

\- She lives in a much bigger apartment with different rooms and a lot of furniture (cat's adventure park) and stuff (toys for cat). I live in a one-room apartment with very few furniture and not much belongings. My cat is a very active boy, he can get bored in my apartment.

\- My cat has a daily routine that includes going out to play in the hallway several times a day. If he comes here his whole routine will be disturbed.

\-  I plan on living in different parts of the world throughout my life, and each time I move I will have to force my cat adapt to a new environment.

\- I work over 50 hours a week. My mom has much more free time than me, so my cat can enjoy someone's company longer.

My only concern is whether my cat will be happy without me. My mom is not a verbally supportive person. She says a lot of mean things, most of time jokingly, without knowing it can hurt other people. I'm not sure whether it can affect a cat the same way it affects people. My cat was more affectionate to me than to her when we lived together, now he is very affectionate to my mom, even more affectionate than he was towards me. He puts his arms around my mom's arm when he takes a nap in the afternoon, which he doesn't do with me. I don't know if it's affection or separation anxiety, like maybe he wants to hold my mom so she doesn't leave him like I did :(

Truth be told, when I was rescuing my cat with other neighbors, I didn't think anything through. I just saw his little face and wanted to be his mom. At the time, when I thought about my plan of moving cities, I just thought I would take my cat with me wherever I go and everything would be perfect.

I guess the only way to find out is to see how my cat feels once he moves in with me. But he is easily scared. Putting him in a cage (so that he doesn't interfere with driving, and it's pretty much impossible to put a leash on him, he also hates leashes with passion) for a 13-hour long travel (and then possibly backwards) can be very traumatic to him. How can I know if he wants to live with me or my mom? Any advice would be appreciated.",11Jul2020,1

704,"I (28F) am a data scientist, relatively fresh out of grad school (been working for a year). I've been very unhappy at my current company and decided to apply for a new job. Ended up with offers from two companies, one in Germany (company 1) and one in the US (company 2). Either would be a significant improvement over my current job, but I only have 4 days to decide. Due to the pandemic I haven't visited either one, and I'm having the hardest time making up my mind.

The salaries both seem competitive by local standards. I've been dreaming of living in Europe since I was a child. I love singing opera in my spare time and traveling, and Europe is perfect for that. I'll even get 30 days of paid leave every year. I did an internship in Switzerland a few years ago and had a blast there. After everything that's been going on the US these past few years, Europe seems particularly attractive right now. 

But there are things I don't like about company 1. It's an old-school car manufacturer near Munich. They are quite rigid and track employees' hours with ID swipes. I need to be at work for 9 hours a day on average. This seems to penalize people like me who work efficiently and get things done in less time. My desk is right next to my boss, who, I've been told, is a bit workaholic. I like what the team does and so far I like the people very much, but I won't be able to switch teams easily if it doesn't work out. The company also offers very few perks/benefits. There's no signing bonus. I had to handle my visa application and apartment search myself, without knowing any German (to be fair, my future boss tried to help, which was nice of him, but it's not his job). There's not even free coffee at the office. Moreover, I don't know anyone in Munich, so I'll be alone.

Company 2, on the other hand, is one of the biggest tech companies in the Bay Area and very prestigious. I have friends there who are very happy there, mainly because the benefits and perks are incredible (free meals, gym, spas, etc). Even though I'll only get 15 vacation days, the hours are more flexible and I've heard there's unpaid leave available. There are plenty of activities on campus. I don't care much for the work they do, but it will be easy to switch teams. I may be able to transfer to a different office overseas, but I wouldn't bet on it. One of my best friends works there and I know the area. It will be an easy transition.

Overall I think company 2 is a better company, and a safer option that doesn't take me out of my comfort zone, but one can argue that I should be getting out of my comfort zone while I'm still young. Jobs in the EU are hard to come by these days, so this could be my only chance to move to Europe. But should I bet on being sufficiently happy at company 2 to make up for the regret of not going to Germany? What should I choose, a great company or a great country to live in?",11Jul2020,1

4- training school for this might get me started in 3 weeks, or 2 years. Until I get my ASVAB scores back, the recruiter won't tell me when A school (navy MOS training) leaves. 

5- here's the problem. Either A, I have to wait 2 years to go to training for the military, and spend more time lounging around doing fuck all, or B- I get in and situated in a life I'm not happy with.

I was so excited to go to college. It was the only thing I looked forward to our of this year, and I know I need to do something but I'm just so mad that this is what I've got left. I know I should be more grateful that I still have options, but I'm just not happy with this, and I don't know if this feeling will go away when I get in or not. Either way, I'm backed into a corner, and this doesn't feel like a choice to me anymore. 


I'm not sure if the problem I'm having is because of me not being grateful that I still have options, or if I really have a good reason to feel the way I do. I'm so anxious I can't sleep, I just need some advice, any suggestions?",11Jul2020,1
706,"Hello, this is in New York state. My grandmother recently passed a kidney stone at a hospital near Albany. Afterward, she was aparently placed in some sort of rehabilitation facility nearby. (Not for addiction, she walks with a Walker and cannot clean herself in the bath/shower.)  I'm trying to contact her, but I'm having no luck. My mom gave me a number to call and her room number, but the number just rings indefinitely. No one seems to know the name of this rehabilitation facility. I'm also told she can't call out of this facility with the phone. I feel obligated to talk to her, but I have no idea how. Yes, obligated. She's not a kind or empathetic person by any measure. We are not blood related and she makes it very clear... insists on paying me gas money every time I visit so she can tell her neighbors/my family that the only reason I visit her is to get money from her. Yeah. But Mom asked me to be nice, so I am. My family knows better than to listen to her. Anyway... does anyone have advice on how I can locate or contact her?",11Jul2020,1

708,"My brother has pretty severe adhd and is slightly autistic (like myself). I hated school, and was quiet and angsty when I was his age, all the way til my 16th birthday, where I began to make more and more friends, graduated university, went travelling, got a girlfriend, and have got a job working for a movie studio (my dream job). Id am now the happiest I've ever been (22). 

My brother on the other hand, is perhaps the polar opposite to how I was. He's always very excited, can say some kind of wierd things and can be a Massive pain in the ass when he wants to be, and just doesn't really fit in too well But I think this all comes down to his ADHD. Because of this, he has very few friends. He's recently told my mum how upset he is at school. Knowing how much I used to hate school at his age, I want to try and help him. I'm terrified he won't grow up and mature, and conversely I don't want him to be upset as I do care for him greatly. Its nice being home being able to spend time with him, and he's a talented and kind person. But I'd be lying if I said I haven't shouted at him when I lose my patience and when he annoys my other siblings.

One of my closest friends committed suicide a little bit over a year ago. We were in the same class- he was supposed to graduate this year. Though we didn’t end up going to the same high school, we stayed good friends. After his suicide his family and a friend and I helped each other grieve. His parents ended up offering their place to us whenever we would need it. You know- stuff like that. They really did help us a lot, and vice versa. 

I want to invite his parents to my graduation tomorrow. I would invite his whole family, but I only have a limited amount of tickets.

Would that be acceptable? I don’t want to cause them any pain, or at least any more than what they are already experiencing, but I also want to thank them for everything they’ve done for me. I just don’t want to cause them any pain.

712,"It is a long story.
Back where I was born from(South America) my mom and dad separate she try to bring us to the US when we were kids. My dad didn’t want to because he was greedy and liked the money my mom send to him. 
She try to bring us again in the future and one of my mom’ cousin convince him. He didn’t try contacting us over all the years we were here, so he starting contacting us until we became 18 and ask us about money. Now he is even adding us on Facebook. 

As for my mom since the day we got here she became so toxic. Always yelling at us and if she had a bad day at work, she took all her problems on us and blaming us. She even said that she preferred for our aunt to take care of us because  we were too much responsibility mind you I was 14 at that time. Then if she bought us clothes, she always shove up to the face for the next couple of years. Like she bought me a sweater and always complained about it for years. That’s why I never took anything from her when I became 18 even if they were socks. I bought all my stuff.
When i became 18, she came at me on my own birthday telling me that now I have to work full time even thought I was on high school on my last year or that she will kick me out of the house. It was her doing her usual rant because she had a bad day at work. She always blamed us for stuff.
When I started going to college, so she kept saying she knew kids who were having 2 works full time and attending college full time. She exaggerated stuff because to her eyes I was a failure. I’m my whole college life, I never got a cent from her to pay for my classes as I know asking for her isn’t convenient as she just want us to kiss her up to get something. I remember 2 years ago, she took the car I was leasing away since it was on her name because I payed a week lat, she got upset and took it away. I almost missed 2 months of school at my university, but the husband of my sister helped me get a car. My mom got pissed that I got a car. I knew at that moment she never care about me going to college. But she bragged to her friends and our family that I was attending the university. Now that I graduate the Ceremony got delayed for December and depending on the Covid situation it might delay for spring 2021. But I did got my diploma months ago and the first thing she did was take a picture of it and I bet she bragged on social media. As for me I haven’t post anything about the degree. 
At this moment I don’t think I want to invite them for the ceremony of my graduation. 
The thing is my mom always had treated me and my sister the one after me the worst. My sister had it worst thought. 
Then my brother who had spend a lot of time in jail for driving drunk, beating up his gf and stuff. Had been spoiled the most and got most of the support from her.
My little sister who is about to be 16, the car that I was paying and they took from me is being giving to her as a gift for her 15 years birthday, but they haven’t gave her the key until she is 16 thought. My little sister is the most spoiled of all of us and she had been traveling to so many places and I never got to travel when I was her age, I didn’t even go to Chuckit cheese when I was 15 and I always wanted to go. My little sister had been going out a lot. They even gave her a new iPhone and us 3 never got a phone. My brother got a car from my mom she sold it to him for $200.
My sister got kicked out when as soon as my mom found she got pregnant.
My family had complained about how my mom does things as she had never gave the same treatment to all of us. 

My little sister has even brought her boyfriend here at home and into her room. I caught her once(no sex) but you know it will get close to the stage since the dude was with no shirt at that moment lol, but I haven’t told my mom and my step dad as they think they had raised her the right way and since they are so proud of the way they raising her and assume she is so innocent. I won’t try to spoil their surprise mostly now that she will have a car. She will be more free to do stuff she wants to do. 
Anyways, back on topic I was once kicked out of the house because I had an argument with one of my cousin who is basically hated by all my family because of how much gossiping she had made and even included me on that gossiping when my family knows that I’m distant because when I’m home I’m in my room the whole time as coming out of my room is having an argument with my mom for no reason and I mean no reason at all. She just try to find anyone to argue with and she love the company of my cousin because they get to gossip a lot lol. 
So what do you guys think? Should I invite my mom and my step dad to my graduation ceremony? 

Sorry I’m just venting here and I can’t stand that my mom and dad just want to be there when I get to succeed in something. Also, I’m the first member of my family that had ever attended the university and got a degree while at it.",11Jul2020,1

We slept together on the second, she was really into me, on the third she wanted to be official bf and gf I said let me take you out on a nice date next week and then sure as I wanted it to be more romantic. 2 days later, she texts me saying never to talk to her again and she doesn't fancy me and blocks me on everything. My behaviour hadn't changed and I'm what I'd consider to be a very nice guy genuinely looking to settle down.

Fast forward a few days, confidence has taken a hit so I download tinder. I get a bunch of matches. I speak to two girls who seem cool. I set a day with one today, she cancels 20mins before hand and then blocks me on everything. The other girl I was talking to then also blocks me on everything out of the blue.

I was not official with any of these girls. The one I was dating whilst dating her I was talking to nobody else. When I date someone I generally cut contact amicably with anyone else I'm talking to. I'm relatively attractive and was by no means ""punching"" for want of a better way to put it.

 Now I would like to just say I have no problem with drugs. If you want to take em, take em, however what I do have a problem with is shouting down the street to your mate at 4 in the morning, fights in the middle of the street, a constant barrage of loud and fast cars up and down a narrow street all night, there's more they do but the worst of it is they are hiding the bulk of the drugs they have in everyone's gardens, to which I found someone in my garden today. They don't try to hide what they are doing. 

The police come every so often to try and get them and if they do they are just replaced as soon as half an hour later, and carry on as if nothing has happened. 

So because of all of that we are wanting to sell. We kind of know no one is going to buy the house to live in themselves and it will probably be bought to let, and we'll probably not get what we want to for the house. 

So is there anything you could think of that may make the situation better? Also anyone who knows much about housing prices? What kind of an effect will it have when it comes to selling to a landlord?",11Jul2020,1

Last time she said that I could just move out if I didn’t like it at home. And I don’t really like it at home. It’s really loud, everyone is very noisy, they don’t respect me or my feelings and don’t take me serious when In feeling very depressed. They also are very toxic. And when I try to talk to my mum about feeling depressed or her being rude to me she just talks about herself and that I should stop acting like my life sucks. She also says that I have no reasons to feel that way and she always makes comments about my appearance which make me feel insecure. But then she also has moments where she acts extremely nice and understanding and if we had a fight she just smokes a cigarette and acts like nothing happened after. And that every time and if I even try bringing it up again she gets mad. She never tried to physically hurt me except for when she threw a yoghurt at me once (kinda funny she missed).
So now I’m seriously thinking about moving out. I have around 3000$ saved up. And I would have around 600-700$ monthly because of the money my dad has to pay. I’m also looking for a job rn.

TRIGGER WARNING: eating disorders (tried to post there but wouldn't allow me to)

I've (f18) been with my gf (f17) for five months and she's been struggling with bulimia and disordered eating in respect to that, and I'm always there for her for whatever support she needs (her family are iffy with that and don't believe that she struggles with that). However, it gets a little iffy from here more from my side.

My ex also struggled with that and used it to manipulate me so I do have a hard time trusting people and their behaviours if that makes sense. About two months ago, I discovered that my current gf ran an ed account in Twitter and was talking about me and showed a few of our texts. She doesn't run that anymore as I was pretty mortified when I saw the content bc it what was on there was not how we are in real life.

It was mainly that event that led to this for me; I am naturally slim and I do feel guilty, I do slightly dislike my body bc of that and I feel like she dislikes me a little bc of that. I, myself, don't struggle with an ed/body image issues and whilst I can't imagine that, I do try to empathise. I feel bad within myself that I have this body when others hate theirs. I love my gf so much and she's worried that I won't find her attractive even tho I don't and never will think that. I am quite a sensitive person and tend to take in people's worries and try and support them, but I never want to be intrusive. I'm not too sure where I'm going with this, but I understand how difficult it is dealing with that and don't want to come across as self centered. I also understand this lies within myself, I have my own issues which I try not to let affect us as well, and only I can sort that out, but just wanted to know if I'm being self centered. To clarify, we've both talked about this and have been open and honest

After all was said and done (it was an in home operation by a friend of theirs who is a vet), we hung out and reminisced about my childhood dog Charlie. My mom was visibly grateful we were staying later than normal, but my dad has been quiet the whole time. Finally he got up and politely asked us to leave. We moved to go, but then my mom started playing with him on a rocking horse. After a few minutes of this, my dad said “Okay, goodnight guys!”, roughly grabbed my boy, kissed his forehead, and shoved him at my wife. 

Then the last couple times we’ve been over (we go over every Friday for dinner) my moms parents have been in town. They made a comment three weeks ago how my boy doesn’t seem to like my dad, because he keeps scaring him (which is true, he’s never sweet with him). The last two weeks, my dad has greeted us at the door and asked to hold him immediately. He kind of waltz’s into the dining room where everyone else is. This week he did that and said “I have a grandson!” in a kind of sing-song “neener-neener-neener” tone. Then Dad passed him off and didn’t touch him again.

I bought about 5 Udemy classes over the past few years but none of them I really stuck with. A few months ago, I decided that I really wanted to learn more about artificial intelligence. I bought a Udemy course and told myself that this course would be the course that I'd actually follow through on. I did complete the course, taking notes along the way and building/training an AI on how to walk. The problem was that I didn't feel like I learned very much. The theory of the class I was able to comprehend and understand very concisely. However, when it came to the actual coding section I realized that very little in the class was explained. I also found out that the creators of the class were a bit misleading in their praise of the type of AI that I was learning about. I only later found out that the type of AI I had learned about was a very new type that didn't really have many known practical uses. So, I chalked this class up to a failure. 

It took a lot of forcing myself to finish this class. I enjoy the topic and it's something I want to learn about. I've found that I feel this way about other things I want to learn about as well. I wanted to learn hacking/cybersecurity at one point. I was infatuated with it, but just couldn't force myself to try to learn.

734,"I'm an 18 y/on male student from Greece who just got results from exams. Basically how the system works in Greece is that you gather points in exams and each university has a certain threshold/minimum you need to be above to make it in. You make an application listing universities in order based on preference, and if you have enough points for choice 1 you get it, if not you move to choice 2 and then 3. But you'll have to enter the first school higher up the list so if say you want to go to choice 2 but already have enough points for choice 1 you are OBLIGED to go to that uni. I was planning on putting Physics department in town A and then physics department in town B, but after getting my results I realized there are slim chances to pass in town A. This made me seetke with the idea of town B. I'll list pros of them:

-Town A: 
My cousin is doing her PhD there, and I know the professor who teaches General relativity, thus adapting will be easier. It's also a bit more organized since the department collaborates with CERN something great because high energy physics and stuff CERN deals with is what my path will be later on after the basic degree.


-Town B:
This town is wayyy closer to my hometown and really affordable. Compared to town A uni life is safer with less violent and criminal incidents around, and a town I'm familiar with. Also, my long distance girlfriend will be very close to me, should I find myself studying there, and staying with me from time to time will be way easier. My best friend is from that town and I'll also be seeing him more often. As far as the department there is concerned, it's a bit less organized than the one in town A, but it's still one of the decent good schools. After I finish the main degree I could always jump over to town A for expanding thus making the benefits of a better career future seem virtual, and I know a physicist who landed a very good PhD in the UK after that who was studying in that same department.

To sum up, I'm really concerned that if I go with my original plan of choosing town A as the first option, some miracle happens and I actually get it. Before I thought it was impossible and I had my mind free of worries and dilemmas but given predictions for this year's points required I may land town A. I'm afraid the strain it will put in my relationship isn't worth some virtual extra benefits since a good career path can be achieved through option B too. To clarify, I'm in a serious relationship and I have a long future ahead. We love each other very much and the way we make those conclusions are irrelevant. Just so I don't receive the ""You may choose B then break up in 2 months and regret it"" type of reply. Thank you.",11Jul2020,1

I've had so many of my friends tell me about their own encounter with this guy and how they're now too scared to walk in the hallways or be in a class with him. I've personally never had to deal with this guy before (despite being Asian), which I'm really thankful for. However, it makes me really angry that they have to deal with these things and I've asked them if they've brought it up to our administration. Some people say they're too scared to report it because they don't want him finding out or coming after them, while others claim that they've tried telling the admin multiple times but they never listened to and the admin never took it seriously. 

So I got the idea of opening up a private google form for people to write up their concerns in; they can choose to be anonymous if they want to, but they can write anything this guy has done to him under this form and pass it around to other friends discreetly, so this guy doesn't get word of it. However, I was talking to a friend (Asian M) and he told me this was a bad idea for me to do. 

He said that I was ""moving too fast"" into the problem and that it doesn't seem right to him to get other classmates to ""team up against someone else"" for the sake of taking him down. He thinks I'm taking this too seriously when I don't have to (also since I'm personally not involved). He also worried about the safety of the students and the form, because it's true - if the pervert or his friends find out, we don't know what they would do to it. What made me angry was when he suggested that maybe ""he'll change this school year"" and that maybe ""I should wait until school starts again so we have fresh evidence."" (that was by far the stupidest of excuses IMO).

But he did plant a seed of doubt in my mind. Is it really right of me to make a form like this, when I myself am not personally involved in the issue? Can I even take a stand like this when I've only ever seen this guy only once? I just want to help out friends, but I don't want to overstep either. I'll be more than glad if someone else took over and started or spread a form like this around instead of me - I'm starting to wonder if it's wrong of me to be the one to initiate it. Are people going to get mad if I send them the form to them? Should I just take the backseat and continue trying to encourage people to speak out by themselves and hope that the problem resolves on its own?",11Jul2020,1

742,"So I’m 20f, I had a very big falling out with my best friend also 20f. She had this boyfriend (22) who was getting increasingly physically violent with me when I would go over. I y’all started at my 19th bday party where he punched my friend in the jaw and he hit my nose p hard. I had initially tried to tell her about how uncomfortable it made me. But she told me I was lying and that he never gets like that. So I just kept on pretending bc I really wanted to be her friend. It felt like in the 2 years we were friends she made me drop friends she didn’t like by convincing me that they were all out to get me secretly. So it was basically at the point where I would only ever hang out with her, her bf, and her roommate. And that’s all. I would go to parties with them and while I was drunk her bf would go off on me. He would accuse me of trying to steal her from him. Once I dropped my phone on the floor while I was sitting and I bent to pick it up and he grabbed the back on my hair with his fist and pulled me up by it, with extreme force. And since I was drunk everyone at the party deemed me to be crazy and exaggerating. I was so freaked out bc nobody would even listen. I would avoid him. Then it was like the roommate had just fully changed, he would just start touching me and kissing me when he got drunk despite the amount of times I had pushed him off of me. My friend again told me these were lies and I was just trying to get her to leave him bc I’m jealous. Then finally the last day we ever saw each other, we went to her house. She went to the bathroom and while she was in there her bf was going off telling me I was fake and awful and he hates seeing me at his house all the time and he hates how fake I am when I’m around them. It freaked me out and when she came out he stopped talking. Then she and I were trying to leave and he was getting drunk and it was really fast. He and her fought and then got over it in a few min and then finally I was going to walk out the door and he closed it on me and grabbed my arm so hard and dug his nails into it and it hurt so bad. I slapped his hand and ran out as fast as I could. She ended up coming out after me. We hung out. She told me she knows he’s not well liked but she ignores it so she can continue to love him. I knew I needed to get away. It was getting scary for me. So I told her I needed time bc he was going to hard every time and it was too much for me to handle. She proceeded to text me massive texts until 6 am about how she needs me and I’m awful for walking out on her and she would never do the same for me and that I’ve never been willing to do as much for her as she did for me. I told her I care about her I just need time and I’m still only a call or text away. Things seemed okay but there were more issues bc her bf and my brother had also had a falling out. So I finally texted her a month later and told her that I wanted to talk about stuff and she told me the only way that would happen was if I essentially dropped my brother. I told her I value his feelings more than that. She fought with me, had her other friend fight me and text all my other friends to tell them how crazy I am. She came to my house to pick up her stuff even though I wasn’t home. I told her I would put it all out once I got back but I hadn’t gotten back yet and hadn’t texted her. Then I get a call from one of my long time friends (we’ve known each other since we were 12) and he was fully on her side and he told me I was toxic and awful for not putting the stuff outside. I freaked out. He and I seemed to make up. But he doesn’t talk to me anymore. Then it seemed like everyone I have been friends with that she has also been friends with stopped talking to me. Everyone I’ve know since I was a kid. All over me setting personal boundaries. Basically she accused me of being in love with her. Told me I was toxic and all I do is burn bridges. And I was just ignoring it and blocking her on everything bc now she had all her stuff there was no need. I had blocked her, her bf, her roommate, all of her friends on everything. And I thought that was that and all of this was around April-may. Then last night I was talking to an old friend and she was acting kinda weird so I asked her what was up and she said all I’ve ever done is talk shit about her AND that my old best friend had told her all of this. I tried to explain everything. Then she told me she has been friends with my other friend for months secretly. She was watching all of my stuff and reporting back. It was so freaky. I don’t interact with any of them. I actually do as much as I can to avoid them all together. The second she told me they were really good friends, I just blocked her. I couldn’t do it anymore. It freaked me out. So I guess my thing is at this point I don’t even know who to trust or what to do. I’ve been so paranoid and everything has been bad enough as it is these days. I just want them to leave me alone. I just want this to be over. I want to move on from it. I feel like I can’t do anything right. I feel like everyday gets worse and worse and I don’t even know what to do. Any advice helps. 

TLDR: Ended friendship with my friend bc her bf hurt me physically multiple times, have all my old friends turning on me.",11Jul2020,2
743,"Hey everyone,

I’m writing in here today because I have a bit of an anxiety problem over some stupid things. I read online that one way of getting closure with something is to write all your worries out and move on, so that’s what I’m doing, or at least trying to.

Basically, in a very long story cut short, about three years ago, my family’s business (a drama school) collapsed badly in the town I was living in. I was 13 at the time and very much involved in the business as all my friends were there. When the business collapsed, a LOT of people were very unhappy. As a result of this, my family had to move away to a different town. 

It was pretty bad. My brother was called “Satan” and I was called an “advocate of Satan“ publicly on Twitter, and God only knows what they said about us outside of social media. My brother had a baby two years ago, and they found out about it and put up pictures on their Twitter accounts. They didn’t say anything rude or anything, but it still scared the crap out of me that after all this time, they are still interested in my family and I.

For the last three years, I’ve been trying to separate myself from all the bad things that happened in that time period, but I can’t seem to move on when my whole family seems to have moved on. 

For example, I’m joining a new club soon, and decided to set up an Instagram so that when I meet new people, they can follow me and see my interests. I set up the account, put it on private, and went to set a profile picture of myself. The picture I wanted to use doesn’t show that it’s me, doesn’t show my face or anything like that, but I couldn’t set the picture as my profile picture at the risk of being “found” by my peers back in the town I left. My whole world stopped and I physically couldn’t click the ‘Save’ button. Even the name of my account I couldn’t set as my actual name. I eventually settled on some random string of letters and numbers, but I hate that i had to reduce it to that.

In regards to the new club, I’m even debating using a fake name just so that my new friends won’t make the connecting in the event they know my old friends.

Up until about a year ago, I had a YouTube channel under a pseudonym. One day, I got a comment on one of my videos that simply said “Why did you leave \[name of the school I attended in my old town\]. The username was the exact same name as the comment. I panicked, deleted the comment, and tried not the think about it again. 

Alongside this, about two months later, I got another comment from a name I did recognise that said “Congratulations on becoming an Uncle”. Again, I deleted the comment and just tried to forget about it. Obviously, it’s still playing on my mind.s

Around a similar time, I got a message from a random person on my twitter account. The account that sent me the message had been setup that day and only had a profile picture of someone I didn’t recognise. They messaged me telling that they loved watching my videos, in addition to sending screenshots of their youtube watch history showing all my videos. I knew by the language of the message that it was someone I knew. I couldn’t place who it was, but it really got to me. I figured at that point I needed to delete myself from Twitter and YouTube, which is exactly what I did.

Like I know this stuff is small, and it shouldn’t affect me as much as this, but I find it super difficult to move on. According to the internet, I have a few symptoms of PTSD, but I’m really not sure. 

It just feels like any time I show my face, I get cornered by them and have to hide again. I don’t want to hide anymore, but I can’t bring myself to get over it. Like, it’s really affected me and I can’t seem to move on from what they did/said to me. It feels like I’m being stalked by all of them.

A part of me thinks that I should just go head first and show my face, set my name, as my actual name on Instagram etc. in order to get over it, but I just find it super difficult. If anyone has any advice on what should do or if anyone has experience with this kind of problem, I would be very happy to hear.",11Jul2020,1

I can sympathize and understand if the person just wants to forget their troubles. But other than that, I don't think it's cool or a good thing and I don't like how normalized it is nowadays.

It took me a year of conscious overeating to finally reach 150, and I was happy about my body and decided to stop. I was surprised that just two months later, I was up to 160 lbs.

747,"I was thinking about the common interview statement: “Describe a time when you went above and beyond for a client.” 

I haven’t worked in customer service for many years, so I can’t say that I have an exact experience with that. However, there was a time when I went above and beyond to get my work done. 

At my previous job, I was a secretary and I had a very toxic and micromanaging boss who antagonized me and did little things to make my job more difficult. 

One of my (previous) job responsibilities was filing documents in records. The file cabinets used to be available to every worker in the office, until the boss decided to get rid of that by locking all of the file cabinets and keeping the only keys between herself and her best friend (the senior secretary). 

Whenever I’d approach my boss to ask her to unlock the cabinets so that I could file, she’d always either lash out at me or give me an attitude. It was obvious that she really wanted to fire me, and that’s why she kept trying to make my job more difficult. So one day I got tired of her crap, and broke into the senior secretary’s cubicle to borrow her key, so that I wouldn’t have to go to my boss for it. The senior secretary was absent at the time. I didn’t touch any of her other stuff— I only borrowed the key and put it back when I was finished. The senior secretary lectured me for going through her stuff without permission, but I didn’t even have her personal cell number, so I’m not sure how I could’ve asked for her permission.

Regardless of my questionable means, I still got my work done in spite of how hard my boss was trying to make my job more difficult. Would this be appropriate to share at an interview, or would I be better off fabricating a story?",11Jul2020,1

Now, I've finally started working but I'm so behind that my school is kicking me out.

I recently saw an electronic item on eBay for sale for $160 free shipping.

Snatched it up. I have a much older one that is an heirloom that I dont wanna get repaired to keep its value.

Received the eBay item, repackaged it and sent it off to be repaired. Spoke to the REPUTABLE company once they received it, discussed the repair and authorized it. The repairs were $340

This company repairs numerous models of the same item as well as fabricating BRAND NEW items for sale for roughly the same price as a repair.

It came yesterday.  This appears to be a NEW item and not my repaired one.

My dilemma is Im now out $160 for the antique item, if I wanted a brand new one, Id have bought one, I wanted an old repaired item which maintained character. 

The brand new one is GORGEOUS though.

Im not a tactful person, Im from Philly, Im blunt.

753,"Hello all,

So I have a 4year-old daughter and almost twenty month-old son.  For a bit of context, my wife and I are both therapists, so we are familiar with appropriate parenting skills (though I’m the one who handles discipline typically as my wife finds it too stressful or feels to sad doing it, whereas I have no problem being stern when it is called for).  Anyway, my son’s tantrums and meltdowns are completely out of control and we feel like they are ruining our life.  He has an issue in his ankles with overpronation, which resulted in him being late to crawl and now late to walk.  He started taking a few steps on his own about two weeks ago but just started wearing his specialized orthotics (SMAFOs) about two days ago and we haven’t seen him try to stand up or walk in them.  If my wife is anywhere in the vicinity he just completely melts down until she picks him up or holds him.  As a result, o frequently remove him from the situation and take him to our finished basement to hang out instead (we obviously can’t really go out much because of COVID, and if we could he still can’t walk, which limits his activity).  The meltdowns are out of co from and we do t know how to get them to stop.  The thing is, he doesn’t really meltdown with me, or if he does it stops fairly quickly.  I know he’s not in pain or anything because once I remove him from the room he stops crying and then looks at me and says “Hi!”  But one top of this fussiness it feels impossible to get him to try and learn to walk.  He just sits there and sucks his thumb when he’s upset, or lays on the floor doing nothing.  He’s not motivated by toys.  If he wants one and then you lift it up he just stops trying.  Prior to the orthotics he was getting up more and had managed up to ten steps (but he shouldn’t be learning to walk without the braces as he could develop gait problems and it’s just really unsteady - the PT said it’s like he’s trying to walk on a waterbed).  We are at our wit’s end with this kid.  My daughter was clingy to my wife too and has a more anxious disposition but she’s fine now and has become much more independent, and it was never like it is with my son.  Has anyone experienced anything like this?  He ruins every attempt we make at an outing and honestly ruins most of our days at home too with this behavior.  HELP PLEASE!",11Jul2020,1

When I do try to share with them something I’m interested about either They don’t care , or I feel like I might get mocked.

757,"I moved into a new house in February and have been living with my partner, and three roommates who are men. My best friend/roommate recently got a new girlfriend and has her over constantly which in normal situations is fine, but she likes to push the boundaries of everyone in the house making everyone uncomfortable. My name and my partner's name are on the lease, but I am the main person on the lease with seven months left on it.

On their second date during the stay at home orders, we were all hanging out and enjoying a few adult beverages. I got very drunk as it was my best friend's night off and I was comfortable in my own home at that time. We all started playing truth or dare and it was really fun, but I noticed that all of his girlfriend who I will call B, was making very sexual dares and truths to me but not to anyone else. I am bisexual and since I was drunk I thought it was to make my best friend turned on by two girls kissing or something. It was everything from licking her neck to quick kisses, to her twerking on me. I was joking around with everyone saying I was gonna steal your girl. Later on, my best friend J goes into another room, while my partner isn't looking B pulls me into my other roommates' room (he is gone for the night) pushes me on his bed and starts ferociously making out with me. I was so drunk that I wasn't even moving my lips and kept ""waking up"" to her making out with me. After that, she just pretended like everything was normal and went to sleep in J's room. I was really upset about everything that happened and cried on the floor for four hours about how I ruined my friendship with J. The next day I asked if she remembered what happened last night and she said that she blacked out and couldn't remember. Because of everything I know now I think she did remember. 

I decided to keep it to myself what happened from J, but a few weeks later I felt so guilty that I told him what happened and all the other weird things like her touching me in odd places, make comments to me while ""drunk"", etc. She told him I was ""making it up because I had a crush on him"" which wasn't true, and J finally got her to admit that something happened. She got mad and said that where she was from in Ohio things like that were normal.

I tried talking to her about my boundaries and saying that stuff made me uncomfortable but she just kept doing it. On another day when she had had like one sip of a drink, she made sure J wasn't looking and then kissed me on the mouth. Other times she grabbed my butt or boobs, pulled out my breast from my bra. It was super uncomfortable and every time I would talk to her about it she would just say it was normal in Ohio. I even tried telling her about how I was sexually assaulted before and molested by my parent as a kid and how what she was doing was making me uncomfortable because of that. 

I was thinking maybe it was normal for girls who are ""straight"" to do things like that to other straight girls, so when one day she suggested strip poker I just agreed. My motives were thinking she could see me naked and then finally stop making me feel weird, and also maybe embarrass her the way she embarrassed me. I'm not very good at poker so I was naked first, and J and my partner kept looking at my body which is fine because I'm a very open person, and like to show it off sometimes. B was looking really embarrassed to be without pants and also jealous, which was kinda funny. 

But after that, she would touch me and make an excuse that she was just doing it because she had small boobs and I had big ones, and she wished she had big ones. One time while the guys were in the kitchen she went into the hallway and made sure that I was looking at her, pulled up her shirt, and showed me her boobs with her tongue out. She hadn't been drinking or anything, but later when I confronted her about it she just said it was normal, and after strip poker, she thought I wouldn't be a prude anymore. 

I told J again and he said he would make her stop, and for a little while, she did stop and just revert to being secretive about her comments and touches. A couple of weeks ago we all went out to a local dive bar and I was dressed in a slim-fitting dress, with cleavage poking out because I was hoping guys would buy me drinks, or there would be a cute girl who was lesbian or bisexual there.  (I'm in an open relationship). When B and I were sitting at the bar and J was in the bathroom she said, ""You're a sneaky snake, trying to tempt me to touch you."" I just laughed nervously and awkwardly to make the situation seem like a joke. I asked my roommate who was there with us H if he could make sure B isn't alone with me. Later on, when she had had a couple of drinks she started coming onto me in front of J, touching my breasts, and making comments about them. I was really embarrassed and anxious and said some jokes to diffuse the situation. J got mad at her, and we all went home, in the car, I burst out crying (was pretty drunk) and was talking about how I hated myself and wished I could run away, or die, or go to sleep forever. At home, I just laid down in the living room and cried until two of my friends helped me to bed. 

The most recent things that happened have been flashing me, touching me, making comments, and in the car, while we were all at Cookout she touched my boob and I said ""don't touch me"" very loudly and B tried to tell me in front of everyone that it was normal. J told her I had a point and H also agreed with me, which I think embarrassed her. Other things she will do is try to hump J when a lot of people including me are around and have given him a handjob while I was sitting across the table from them during strip poker. She also does a lot of suspicious things to H and has grabbed my partner's butt multiple times before. Sometimes it can be normal with B and we can hang out and have a nice time but so much of this stuff has happened that I am scared around her. 

So when J talked last night about having her move into the house I told my partner I was not under any circumstances ok with that, and he said he would talk to J alone if he had to. But I also said that maybe I should just move somewhere alone and then I wouldn't have to be in the way of them. I have been super on edge lately which I think is caused by all this, I have gotten in big fights with my partner where we haven't before, and I moved my desk into my walk-in closet with a mattress for when I feel like I need extra security and to be alone. When I'm at work I don't want to come home and have put a nap mat there in my office so I can take a nap after I clock out so I don't have to go home right away. I'm upset about this and I hate that I am because I guess I can see how it would be normal, and maybe I am just a prude. I also haven't liked having sex lately or being touched by anyone including my partner. Almost every night I have a nightmare about B or about my parent who molested me as a kid, B reminds me of a lot of my parents which makes it even worse. Am I wrong to think that if she moves in something bad will happen to me? 

This house is supposed to be my dream home but it feels so uncomfortable here, I am constantly on edge. I am starting to fantasize about moving into my own place even without my partner, living in my closet and never coming out, and even wishing I could live in my car (I don't have one). I used to be homeless and live in my car which I thought was the worst time in my life, but now I am envious of the past me. I don't want to lose J as a friend and don't want to get in the way of their relationship, but I don't want J to move out because I will miss him. I wish B would just do something to me already so I can have firm evidence something weird is happening, but it also may be the thing that drives me over the edge. I just feel like I'm in the way here and if I was gone everything would be better for everyone.

758,"A few days ago I was in a scary accident and got off with a few bumps to the head. It screwed me up physically and mentally, but now I'm feeling like maybe I should've just gone to work ASAP. Is it normal to be this stressed about your job? 

The doc gave me a few days to heal up, I relayed that info to my boss and gave her an ETA of my release form and follow up appointment. I've gotten nothing back. She requested I kept her in the loop, but doing so has potentially removed myself from the loop. I got a call about the other managers expecting me to be there today and tomorrow, so is she deliberately keeping them in the dark? I dont want to tell them why I'm not there, it isn't their business, but they shouldn't be expecting me back if my boss is doing her job and covering my shifts. 

I'm so worried about my paycheck. Would my boss look down on me when I come back? What if she treats me differently because she believes the accident is going to effect my performance? I don't even know if the person responsible for my accident is being held accountable. You would think that's a need to know basis thing but I absolutely need to know. I could just be freaking out, but when no one will call or text back, that's not a good sign. It's making things worse. I feel alienated and stressed. All I do is worry about my dumb job.

761,"I'll try and keep this as concise as I can...

I (23M) have always been terrified of losing people I care about. My Dad basically yeeted himself from our lives when my brothers and I were young, but even when he was around he basically wasn't there anyway. I've also lost some friends over the years due to acting out on my own insecurities and pushing people away to the point they had no choice but to leave.

I've very recently begun a new (my first, actually) relationship with this girl and she's absolutely amazing. She's very sweet and understanding, and accepting of my baggage. However, I still deal daily with the fear that I'm going to lose her, or she'll leave me, or some other guy will enter the picture when I'm not around and sweep her off her feet (we live 3h away). I absolutely do trust her, and I know she cares about me a lot. This is relationship is the best thing that's happened to me, but I can already feel myself fearing abandonment and have to make a conscious effort to suppress myself from acting on irrational fears. 

I do this with friends too, and it sucks. There are times I've made up things to cancel plans with friends before because I know I can be really awkward and figure they'd have more fun if I weren't involved. I hate that I'm like this. I went to three different therapists growing up, and it *kind of* helped, but I don't think that's the end-all be-all here. I just don't want to screw up my relationship or any friendships over these insecurities and feelings of being unwanted and awkward.",11Jul2020,1
762,"So this is for the person who just turned 20 or is in their early twenties, maybe you spent your early 20s not doing much, being a bit too lazy, and now the realisation hit you “I have to do something with my life” but you’re not exactly sure in which direction to head. Some people tell you to attend University and get yourself a degree and others tell you travel, go live in another country, get away for a while. Well my perspective is a bit different. I say don’t do any of these.

What do you mean?

Well first let's look at the perspective of the traveler.

He finishes Highschool, and maybe he already finished a while ago and now he has all the time and freedom in the world. The doors of the world are open to him and he wants to travel. So he sets off, maybe with a bit of money and travels to a few countries, does a few work and travel programs, and it's all good. A few pass by, his money gets a bit low because he has to spend here and spend there, and he's getting a bit stressed now, travel is not as fun as it used to be. Maybe he borrows a bit of money from his parents or friends, maybe he spends a bit too much on his credit card and he has no choice but to go back home. Well he gets back home, and where is he to stay but with his parents. Same old room, same family drama, same influences. He doesn't have money, he doesn't have his own place, he doesn't even have any skills. Although his travels might have given him life experience, he can't really do anything with that, or make any money with that. His parents are a bit upset at him because he isn't working, he can't pitch in for rent, and the stress gets to him...

Now the other side.

Here is the studious University student. He decides that instead of travel he's going to go straight to Uni, he didn't really give himself any time to try out different trades, he goes for the one that his peers say will make him the most money. Accounting it is. Four years pass, he studied hard, got good marks, and now ends up with a Degree. He's excited because now he can go into the real world and put his skills to use. He might find a job at some accounting firm, where he gets paid a decent income. But he loses his freedom. Months pass, he's still working at the firm so that he can pay all his student loans, all of his credit card bills, and maybe pay of that nice car he got a few months ago. He might meet a woman, it's 'true love' he tells himself. Now he gets more responsibilities, he's got to work more hours, and to let go of all the stress he goes out with his friends and drinks it all out. He's 26 now, ""oh how time passes"", he totally forgets about how he wanted to travel the world because the responsibilities occupy all his attention. He gets fired, goes back to living with his mother, the end.

Maybe this is a bit dramatic, but these are two pretty common scenarios, you either go one way or the other. But what I think is that you should avoid both of these if possible, because these will lead you to an unhappy place, or back at your mother's house - and maybe living with you mother is nice for some, so IDK.

And now let’s get into my perspective

You finish Highschool, maybe do a bit of travel and f*** around for a year or two because that's just what young people do. You hit your 20s and the realisation of ""now I'm an adult?"" arrives, ""I should do something with my life"", you're given the two paths above and most likely are influences into either of the two by your peers or Youtube gurus. Instead what you should do is…

Build a passive income business on the weekdays and travel on the weekends.

Why build a passive income business?

Be your own boss
Later on in life you don’t want someone to boss you around and tell you what to do - it’s the worse thing when you have someone else controlling your life and decisions.

Travel later on - no work responsibility
If you want to travel later on in life you job isn’t going to stop you from doing so, nor any job responsibilities, you can run a passive income business online and can work in anywhere in the world - no matter the language barrier.

Decide how much you get paid
You decide how much you make by how much work you put in

Learn about business and money
These are probably the two most important things you need to learn about if you want to gain full freedom over your life. Money rules the world, so you need to learn how to rule money. And without a business you’re gonna work pay-check to pay-check.

Why travel on the Weekends?

First off, lots of people don’t travel, they rather go to a bar, or go to the club, waste their money on alcohol hoping to get laid. Well when you travel you escape this trap, instead you get to see the world, and experience the world. You don’t even have to travel that far, maybe even to nearby cities and see how people live there - but this will give you perspective and new experiences. And when you travel you meet other people, and sometimes those people are pretty girls that are looking for a bit of an adventure.

But how can I travel for only two days?

This is just my schedule, but you can design your own and even take a week off every 4th week, make it your own way, but just make sure you work 70% of the time and travel 30% of the time.

Why all of this is important?

It’s important because years will pass you, you’ll grow older and older and eventually you’ll get tired of dealing with other people’s bullshit and rules and you’ll want to get your own place, maybe move to a different city, try something different, but you won’t be able to because first you’ll be working for someone else, second you will have bills to pay, and you’ll be trapped by responsibilities and expectations. That’s why set yourself up early on in life so that way you can do whatever the f*** you want later on.

I'm 24 and I didn't really do this. I went the traveler's route. I traveller to different places, did a few work and travel programs, made a bit here and there, got a few experiences under my belt, but I never really took business, or setting myself up for the future seriously. I bumbled around from place to place, working for people in exchange for accommodation, and trying to keep peace with all of my host - as they all had their own rules for work, food, curfew, and once I was done with helping them I didn't have a place to go back to, well I did, but I didn't want to go back to my mother's house - and it's not a good feeling if that is the last option. But lucky enough that I started doing freelance work, moved to Europe, traveller a lot and had my Grandma’s house as a safe-heaven. And this is where I begin what I should have done for the past 4 years.

Consider this advice, and see if it can apply to you, because now we live in the internet Era, and we should take advantage of the opportunities we have.

Long story short my sister did a very stupid thing last year and lost all of our savings. We don't have much money now. Our finances are really limited so I need to get a job.
I get along with my mother and sister but my dad is a total asshole. He has always been one  and he used to be physically abusive. He also does not financially support the family.

I live in a small town from a country from Eastern Europe and trust me, there are barely any jobs here and most of them require work experience which I do not have. This is why most of the youth here is leaving for bigger cities, everyone is complaining of not finding a job. So, I can't leave the town because I can't afford it financially. The chances of finding a job here are very slim.

My health is not the greatest. I have a heart condition which makes me tired very easily, makes me sick and like fainting very often. I take medication for it but I still get tired easily, just not as much. I get lots of headaches. I get migraines too, I can barely function with them.

Most of my friends left this place. My closest friend only asks me out when her boyfriend isn't around..she isn't here for me anymore. I am very lonely here. 

It's been 5-6 months since my ex left me for his ex gf and I am finally getting over it. Tried dating this guy which really seemed to like me! I was excited! But guess what, he ghosted me.

I get dark thoughts about killing myself because of all of the above. It can be REALLY draining sometimes and I feel like there is no way out. I've been crying my heart out lately, the pain is too much..I feel stuck and left out and hopeless. 

What would you do if you were me? How would you feel and what action would you take? 

Thanks a lot for reading.",11Jul2020,1
770,"Hi, so I'm going to be talking about my past because it definitely a factor as to why I'm acting up. It's a **long read** so bear with me.

In middle school, I had two friends..we always hang out, supported each other, and had a lot of fun together. Unfortunately, we were victims of bullying. We were bullied by these huge groups of people. These are the people who found humor in beating up or making fun of people. They knew exactly what they were doing to us.

My two friends eventually got used to those run-ins, but not me. I always got frustrated and angry with how we were treated. I built up a ton of resentment towards these guys, so I tried standing up for myself, fighting back...but it never worked out, and because I stood up to them, I became their primary target of bullying.

Everyday became the same painful grind. Go to school, get bullied, and come home to cry. I try talking to the teachers about it, but all it only made it worse. My classmates make fun of me for it. I didn't want to tell my parents because I didn't want to seem like a loser to them, it was dumb I know.

I started questioning, why do me and my friends have to deal with all these bullshit, just because they were a little bigger and stronger...they think they can treat people like trash? My friends tried to convince me that there's nothing we can do about it other than to avoid them.

The day finally came when I opened up to my parents on what I was going through. I was really prideful as a kid, so opening up to them about me getting bullied was hard, I lied about the severity of the bullying. I managed to convince them to enroll me in martial arts classes and they agreed. I was given a chance to have a fighting chance. The problem was that I didn't want to just defend myself from them, I wanted to humiliate them, give them the pain they gave me because I thought to finally be able to beat down my bullies, would be satisfying.

Martial arts came to me naturally, and not to mention my motivation to beat up my bullies helped alot. So as months passed, it was rusty in how defend myself but It was improvement nontheless. The more I trained the better I got, and pretty soon I was able to defend myself, and I managed to beat up one of my bullies.

My friends and I didn't have to hide anymore. I had their backs. I was good in martial arts enough to beat most of the kids at school. The thing was that I was becoming just like them. The better I became in martial arts, the more boastful I became and the more violent I became.

I would do things preemptively to stop people from picking on me. If someone would talk bad about me behind my back,I would immediately make it physical. If I thought someone was looking at me funny, I would go fight them or sometimes instill fear in someone. In my head it was all defense. I tried justifying it thinking that these people deserved to be treated that way by me. It was a flawed logic.

The bullied had become the bully.

Soon I was the kid the class hated. I got suspended many times for fighting.

My two friends told me I was taking it too far, and I told them If I didn't beat those kids up, then they will beat me up. I was convinced that was how it worked. My own friends started distancing themselves from me. The day came when I got expelled from my school for excessive violence. My parents enrolled me into anger management classes, and I was homeschooled for the final year of middle school and I stopped going for martial arts training. I spent a year reflecting over my actions, full of regrets, of the person I became. I saw myself as someone who's worthless, just like those who bullied me. I can never forgive myself for what I had done, I stooped down to their level. Middle school was that memory you'd hate so much. So try to bury it in my past and vowed to never bring it up to anyone.

My dad saw how I was struggling and taught me a lesson on self-worth. He took a 100 dollar bill and asked whether I would take it, I said yeah. He crumpled it, ""what about now""...yeah dad I'll still take it. ""Everyone has value, everyone has their worth"".

(He saw that from youtube btw, but thanks anyway dad &lt;3)

That was a lesson I never stopped believing. I decided to turn over a new leaf, and I was able to manage my anger better. I developed a routine for me to do every day to keep myself mentally fit. Dad got a job promotion in another state, so we moved there, and there was a great school there. Things were looking good for me to start over.

Academic wise, the school had a good reputation so naturally the kids there were smart too, but obviously there are bullies in almost every school and this one was no exception. Some people here are cunning backstabbers, they do anything to kiss up to the popular kids. Bully cases here aren't rare...

Nobody would try stick up for the bully-victims, not even the victim themselves. So I would always try to step in, give the victim their chance to run off while I deal with the bully. I will defend myself but I won't fight back, when I see my chance to run, I run. It makes me look like the biggest ""coward"" there, but I didn't care. I learned to swallow my pride to try to be a better person.

I decided to not care what anyone has to think about me ever since I entered high school.  I didn't want to give them the reaction they wanted. That's what they feed off. Standing up for myself was the ""best I can do""...of course it's gonna mess you up in your head eventually but you gotta have your go to safe place. Mine was my routine for my anger management.

I was at content at how things were for the first time.

One day in class students were assigned to a partner to write a report on world war 2. I was assigned with one of the smartest students in the class, she was such a perfectionist compared to me. She was hell-bent on achieving great grades, so if I didn't meet her expectations she'd flip out on me. She attached her self worth on the grades she got. I told her living a life like that isn't a life worth living. She eventually broke away from trying to achieve other people's expectations, she was still one of the top students but she became more laid back. She stopped focusing on how others perceive her and focused more on what made her happy, and through that, we became best friends.

Thing is, she was apart of a popular clique in school, and they hated that she was hanging around with a nobody like me. I can tell... every time they saw me they always gave me looks, heck they were straight forward with what they thought about me. I didn't want trouble with them so I avoided them, but that didn't stop us from hanging out with each other.

Last year she was dating a guy from her clique. Smart, tall, good looking (everything I'm not &gt;.&lt;). I thought he was alright, he treated me alright....but as soon as they started dating he became relatively more hostile to me. \*Shocker\* he hates my guts, he hates that I'm her best friend. Last summer my friend went on a Europe tour for like 3 weeks, coincidentally around that time me and her boyfriend started bumping into each alot.

So I thought I'd get to know him more, thought I could clear some stuff between me and him, and convince him that I'm only her friend and nothing more. He never gave me any trouble for it, and we seem to have a consensus and cleared up any misunderstandings. So at the time, he didn't seem so bad. He seemed different from the others, so I tried getting to know him more. I was being optimistic.

But I never thought after everything, he would still go on to stab me in the back. He lead me onto a false sense of security and took me to a secluded site. Threatened me not to hang out with her or he'd beat me up. I tried talking to him, trying to stall the conversation before things escalate so I can find my window of opportunity to run away. But he saw right through that and he threw the first punch at me.

Everything went blank at that moment, all I wanted was to start over and live a peaceful life. He forced me to fight back and so I did. I fought back, and fought hard. I crushed him and threatened him that if anyone finds out what I did to him, I'd do it again in front of everyone in school. 

I had made him my bitch... he had no choice. He knew as well as I did that he cared more about his reputation as being one of the toughest guy in school. I know for a fact he wouldn't have blurted out to anyone. So I let him be the tough kid, and I enjoy going on with my life.

But from that day onwards I became colder....I stopped my routine on that helps me manage my anger because it stopped helping me, but I wasn't causing any trouble. I kept to myself, I stopped caring about other people's problems. Life seemed easier, that's what I thought.

There were many times when that guy came up to me to apologize for what he did, but it always felt fake and ingenious. I thought that he was only sorry because he hates how I got dirt on him.

My friend and the guy eventually broke up, on ""good terms"" apparently, but that was when the problem had started. Her friends in the ""clique"" had ejected out of the group and alienated her for some reason. I know for a fact that it wasn't the ex, as scummy as he is he wouldn't stoop that low.

Soon she was also a victim of the bullying...she tried brushing it off at the beginning, but it soon started to become physical. The boys from the popular ""clique"" would call her names, and the girls there would pull her hair, kick her bag and do worse stuff. People like seeing someone at the top fall...I stood up for her many times, but I would never risk showing by bad side to her. I ended up taking beatings for her.

I couldn't bare to see her so miserable, so I threatened the ""ex"" to handle the problem. But he spat right back in my face saying that I was a useless friend for not sticking up for her. That annoyed me, considering that I took so many beatings for her, and so I did. I took matters into my own hands.

Whenever I found her bullies alone, I would ambush them. I would wear a ski mask so they wouldn't recognize who I was, and beat them until they're unconscious on the floor. I didn't care if they were girls or boys...bullies in my eyes are all the same, garbage.

Throughout this year my best friend constantly asks me whether I'm facing any problems, I told her there's nothing and that she shouldn't worry about anything, but she never trusts me. I guess she noticed the inconsistencies in my behaviour as well.  

Last week she asked me about what happened between me and her now ex. I kept lying because I didn't want her to know that side of me, but apparently her ex had told her everything that happened on that day. She called me out on it, asking what had happened to me.

When I heard that, I snapped, and shouted back at her.

Thinking back I can tell that she was worried for me, but I always get defensive whenever someone asks me about my past.

I told her she ought to might her own fucking business instead of butting into mine. I know I shouldn't have said that but it was in the heat of the moment. We had a falling out and now she doesn't want to talk to me.

Am I really at fault here? I never wanted any of this...I need your advice on what to do, she was the only friend who actually cared for me. We enjoyed each other's company, but I don't even know what's the first step I should do. Everything is so messy, I can't even piece myself back together to the person I was proud off. I'm falling deeper into the person I'm trying to forget I was...

But does it matter at point? I feel like everyone in this school (except her) are pretty much the same. Her group, they treat me like trash, look down on me with disgust because I'm a loner.

I feel like it's hopeless, weak or strong I just can't win...I really tried so hard to keep myself from hurting people. But what's the point? Maybe it can't be helped? Maybe this is who I am and that I should just embrace that I'm garbage just like the others who treat other people badly for the feeling of superiority?

I'd like to know an outside perspective of what people think of me.",11Jul2020,1

772,"Hi all, I know this is very low-stakes compared to most posts on here, so thanks in advance for reading. 

I’ve wanted a dog since I was a kid, but I spent most of my 20s working long hours for not much money, so for 6 years I had a cat instead. I loved her dearly until she passed away from cancer. After she died, I started looking into getting a dog, and I fostered several dogs one summer. I absolutely loved it, and was happier than I’d been in a while, but I was living alone and concerned about finances, so I put off adopting until I made more money and lived with someone. 

Fast forward a few years, and my boyfriend and I live in a decent-sized one-bedroom apartment. I make more money, my hours are a more stable 9-5, we’re a few blocks from a great park with off-leash hours, we both love to walk/run/jog but we can also be big homebodies. We’re both working from home in the pandemic until at least 2021.

Our landlord won’t allow fostering dogs, so we’ve been fostering and socializing feral kittens for the past few months. It’s helped us feel confident we could handle a pet together (feral kittens are a lot of work!). Our most recent pair of kittens have been with us for almost 6 weeks. We’ve gotten used to their mischief and antics and we both love having them around. My boyfriend in particular has gotten really attached to them. 

In the meantime, our previously wishy-washy landlord has now agreed to let us adopt a dog up to 50lbs. This is a dream come true for me, something I’ve been wanting for so many years. But it would mean giving up the kittens we love to an adopter. 

So I’m stuck. We could adopt the kittens we’re already attached to, who are less expensive, less time-consuming, less noise, and easier to get a sitter for when we travel. Or, once the kittens get adopted to someone else, we could adopt a dog, who would offer more affection and companionship, be a more social pet (several of my friends have dogs, and I can bring a dog to work), and, I know from fostering, would bring me a lot of joy. 

Another option is to adopt the kittens now, wait until we have a bigger place with a yard (which could be 3-5 years down the line), then get a dog. I just don’t know if I want to wait that long. So, Reddit, what should I do?",11Jul2020,1

We live an hour apart and our cities have been locked down because of the Coronavirus. We plan to meet once it’s calmed down a bit, but when I mention meeting him he acts nonchalant and I sometimes think maybe he doesn’t want to meet me. I also find that I text him first all the time and if I didn’t text him I don’t think he would text me. I feel like I am chasing him all the time. He was the one that asked me to be his girlfriend and pursued me, and now I feel it’s flipped. I send him cards, birthday presents, and always let him know that I appreciate and love him. But when it comes to me, he doesn’t make any effort. I’m not asking for gifts or cards back, just a simple “I love you” or “I’m thinking about you,” is all I want. I feel stuck and I don’t know what to do to change this feeling. I want us to work, but I need some advice on how to make things better. Thanks in advance.",11Jul2020,1
775," My 15 yr old son was diagnosed with leukemia on June 1. He had what they call Induction 1A, where he was on 5 different chemo meds. On Monday, July 6, he began Induction 1B, where he would be on 5 new chemo meds. 

Last night he was admitted into the hospital for a low grade fever. He has no immune system, so this si standard. What has me worried, is that the nurse asked us for a chemo med that we should have been having him taken at home. We stated we had no idea what she was speaking of. She leaves to check out his chart, comes back and says the Dr forgot/didn't write the script for his chemo meds. I'm floored. I'm shocked that something as important as chemotherapy can just be forgotten. That my son slid thru the cracks and noone caught that he was never prescribed a life saving medication. I no longer want him to receive care here, and we will be looking for a new cancer center Monday.

This is negligence as far as I am concerned. If I nonchalantly told them ""Its been 6 days, I just forgot about giving him his meds"" They would have DHS at my door. They would be concerned about me being able to care for my son. This is the same thing.

I'm not immediately planning to get a job during coronavirus, as my parents are both immunocompromised, but down the line I'm inevitably going to need a job, and this is information I'd rather consider now rather than later. 

My mom is of the opinion that you should withhold your SSN until you're hired, since protecting your social security is important from preventing identity theft and all that. When I do a google search to research this topic, this is primarily the opinion held by the results. 

On the other hand, my dad thinks that you are more likely to get a job if you fill out the application to its completion, since if a job has multiple people applying, the people who are cooperating with the application form are going to get called first. To my knowledge, this is the way all my friends did it as well.

However, half a year ago my situation has changed. I still managed to pay rent and we continued rental agreement without the actual contract, which expire earlier this year as well. My aim was finding a new job and the persperctives looked fin priro the corona crisis. It went dowwhill for a time, but the landlord was pretty understanding during the period. Then, the communication started to be less please and more distant. My economy started to be worser and now I decided to leave. My interest is that the landlord used the deposit for covering rent for June and I have already payed other bills for that month. However, the person seems to be more irritated with every attempt for finding a suitable c and starts to take the victim position. I am responsible and take care of the living space, but feel very exhausted nowadays and want to avoid drama and more economical burdain. I do understand that the landlord has not interest in giving back the deposit at any cost, however the person will not earn a lot more before I get the last payment for the freelance work.

785,"So, my mom got married six years ago to my stepdad. I don’t want to make this a long story, but basically (she’s been a single mom all my life, gotten a masters degree and works full time with a stable job, but never had enough money to up and travel) he made her think he was a very hard worker and that they could travel.

She’s very independent and didn’t want to be taken care of, but the idea that she could have stability and more free time and get help with my college was obviously appealing. 

So, fast forward to now, he’s been unemployed for a few years, extremely resentful of her promotions and work ethic. He blows up over small arguments, and is at least 100,000 dollars in debt, at 56.

He is very passive and the most resentful person you will ever meet, very shallow but full of so much hate. 

He has called me a loser, a slut with no friends, a demanding and bossy bitch, a pothead who he’s afraid won’t make it out of my small town, he’s accused my mom of cheating, and a lot more.

But he hides all of those feelings behind a nice guy victim complex and is convinced that we are these huge villains and don’t appreciate him enough.

By buying me little things and filling up my car with gas, he has convinced himself that there is no reason for me not to like him, which seems like gaslighting.

I recently found his diary and it’s completely manic and unsettling. 

“I am in an awful relationship, why, why do I like sex being with someone WHY need to get her to LEAVE, is it better to just get it over with, I NEED HELP. Can NOT trust, MUST DO SOMETHING. “ and that’s just one little excerpt. 

He has told her he will let her keep the house but has not moved and tells her nothing regarding his work or house situation. 

She is such a positive woman and always looks for the best in people but I’m beginning to worry about what might happen. I don’t want her to go broke or get hurt.

The issue is that they broke up on really bad terms, with A recognizing that B has always understimated them and never really supported them in anything, and B being saddened about how A usually hid stuff from them.

After the break up A talked to my group of friends about how they didn't feel comfortable knowing we still talked to B knowing how bad they hurt A, and all of them immediatly blocked B without a word, except for me. 

As I said, B is still an important person to me, and while I definately stand by A, I don't have the heart to just block B and never talk to them again like this, but since everyone else blocked B, they talked to me about how important i was to them, and now shit is even harder to do.

A has started to feel like I don't care about them, saying that they feel like I just ""accept"" everything B has done to them.

I don't know what to do. Am I wrong for standing by A? How should I talk to B about the situation?

We have been increasingly having difficulties with our friendship (growing apart, different life goals, etc.). Up until recently, she was my best friend. I have slowly come to realize that she has been cutting me out of her life, but still attempting to be in mine. I have, in response, been taking myself away from this friendship, and am happy with this decision. 

Take it to now. My friend T is pregnant, and due in two months. She didn't tell me until halfway through the pregnancy (which was slightly hurtful, but I understood). The big issue I am asking advice for is for another friend, W. 

W, T, and I have been friends for over a decade, we were all in each other's weddings. T did not tell W about her pregnancy. W found out about a week ago, when she recieved a baby shower invitation. When W asked why T had not told her/waited so long to tell her, T said ""I feel more deeply about this kind of thing than most people can imagine; I'm just so private"". 

Keep in mind, the pregnancy was common knowledge by then and W only found out cause she was invited to the baby shower. I feel very much like T is starting to be kind of toxic for me to be around. Should I tell her that I will not be attending the baby shower, as well as not tell her I am coming into her town to visit others the week before?

800,"I’m looking for advice on how to move forward from this and if it’s really worth being upset about.

I’m in college currently, but during summer (and quarantine) I stay with my parents in my childhood home so all of my old toys and such were still stored in the basement. I was an avid LEGO enthusiast for all of my adolescence and I keep the few things I still care about in my bedroom.

This morning I woke up “early” to run around town picking things up for a wedding my mom is in and when I get home she is already gone, but she had sent a text saying that some people’s kids had been playing in our basement and asked if I would make sure everything was turned off (not unusual). When I went to the basement there were legos spread all across the basement, but I didn’t care much and started to clean them up. After a minute or two of this I realized that one of the kids had gone all the way upstairs into my bedroom and had found and opened a 10 year old unopened set that I had be saving since middle school. 

The kid had torn the box, opened every baggie inside, and mixed the pieces with others. For people who may not know much about legos, the older a set is, generally the more it is worth but by opening the box, the set has now lost almost all of its resale value. 

Although, originally I had bought the set thinking one day I would resell it, after all these years I have kept it more as a memory of simpler times than anything. The set wouldn’t have really sold for as much as I originally thought but it stills doesn’t sit right with me that a kid I have literally never met before, went into my personal space and destroyed something of value to me.

I honestly just don’t know how to feel about all this. I know it was just a kid who got excited about a new toy, but I can’t help but feel angry all this happened.

802,"27 (M) who's into both men and women. Over the past few years, I started growing hair on my back in patches, then on my upper arms/shoulders, lower back, obviously my ass etc. As it continued to grow, I would always be the first person to say ""fuck it, I don't care, I love my body!"" and tried to embrace it fully. I would always defend it by stating that ""some people love body hair"" etc. But for the majority, that is mostly a lie.

I just got back 10 minutes ago from a hook up and while I was going down on this man, I could see him staring at my shoulder hair stubble, and analyzing it. Immediately, I felt just really self conscious as we moved to the bed and I then proceeded to finish him off with the most dull, lacklustre energy. While some of you will argue with me, I can assure you: when you're really hairy, you can visibly see people's sex drive crashing as they undress you. It's happened so many times, people taking off my shirt saying damaging shit like ""Oh? You're really hairy?"" in a disappointed tone. What's more humiliating than seeing literal disappointment on people's faces when they see your naked body? And while laser is available, or trimming is also an option (which I fully trim monthly), it's really become the centrepiece of my newfound poor sexual self esteem, which saddens me as it feels like yesterday that I was a proud slut, extremely adventurous and felt so sexually liberated.

I know there are exceptions, but on a global scale, there is no visibility for hairy bodies. Every underwear package, every American TV show, almost EVERY shirtless guy you see in real life running or on the beach... it's always the same, hairless male body that looks smooth and desirable. If you think about it, when is the last time you saw a truly hairy man out for a run? Walking shirtless in a park? Any reality TV show where a man was very hairy? Our culture hates body hair. Of course, women have it far worse, where they are expected to be literally hairless from the forehead down, while male bodies are only sexy if their body hair is just enough to see it, but nothing more. Why do we only market hairless male bodies, which are considerably rare? Can anyone give me any sort of encouragement to help battle this hair-demon that's ruining my sex life? Let's face it; I'm very pro ""love yourself"" but can no longer ignore the voice inside that's making this a problem.",11Jul2020,1

807,"Thirteen months ago my current gf and I got into a physical altercation. I took out my phone to video here erratic behavior and call 911. The video shows her screaming and choking herself with an cord while I calmly asked her to stop. She comes at me, hits me, and you can see the phone shake. After this she threw the phone in water so I couldnt call 911. She came at me again and we clunked heads giving me a cut above my eye and her a black eye. We both agreed this was an accident and didn't speak of the incident again for a long time.

This event occurred during a time when we lived together but she was about to move in with roomates (college). I was waiting until she moved out to break things off with her but then this happened.

I am already on court supervision. After this event she knew I wanted to leave and would imply if I did she would report me or try to get me in more legal trouble. A few months after this happened she went did file a police report but she didnt answer the detectives phone calls when they tried to follow up so they didn't pursue charges. I know this because of foia request. 

Neither of is live in the same town that this event happened. She still has pictures of the black eye and I desperately want to end things but I'll afraid if I do she will follow through and report me trying to get me in further legal trouble. 

She is smart. She wont blackmail me through text messaging so I have no proof she is doing this. I cant record her because my state is a two party consent state. She has texts where I say I'm sorry about what happened but none where I say I hit her (because I didnt). She is good at ""making"" me apologize for what happened as if it was my fault.

I'm faced with ending this horribly abusive relationship and risking my livelihood or continuing it and being emotionally and psychologically manipulated.

The statute of limitations in my state is 18 months which is 6 months from now. What can I do? So I wait it out and then end it or end it now and risk going to jail?",11Jul2020,1

812,"Since I can remember I've always been really afraid of every single bug. Even butterflies. But none more than roaches. I've always known it was more than just a fear but I never got it treated cause there were never roaches in my family's apartment. I just moved into a new apartment with a roommate who thankfully is a close friend I've known since high school so he's better at putting up with my BS than a stranger would be. Unfortunately, he's currently quarantining with his family so he's not here and it's just me.

I didn't see any the first night I was here. The second night, I saw a big one in the hallway outside my apartment, and then I saw 3 more inside my apartment. The ones inside were small and they were all in the kitchen. The very next morning I bought raid and sprayed all over the floor. Like everywhere, and I also set up poison bait or whatever they're called all over the kitchen and bathroom. Since then I'll see about an average of 1-2 a day, some days I don't see any. They're only the kitchen and bathroom and most of them are very small. I've seen like one medium sized one and one big on in the bathtub and that's it. I pretty much only see them at night too.  It's been 4 days since I set out the traps and the raid. 

I talked to my roommate about it because the phobia really is pretty bad. I don't wanna get into all the details of it but I do wish I got therapy for it when I was younger because it's really hard to deal with it right now. My roommate says to wait a week or so to see how the bait works before we take any further steps. He says he thinks that since no one was in the apartment for about 2 weeks before I moved in and  it wasn't cleaned out properly that a lot probably came there during that time and they will go away over time since I'm now here and setting up poison and everything. I also think our neighbor hasn't been here for a very long time. 

But I really don't want to keep living in this state of anxiety for that long. It does get in the way of my everyday functioning and it can't be good for my health to constantly be this anxious. Even if the traps do work and I stop seeing any, I don't know if I'll ever be 100% comfortable in the kitchen or bathroom. Currently I carry a bottle of raid around with me everywhere I go. Even in the shower. And I always wear sneakers in the kitchen and bathroom in case they try to crawl on my foot. And I take up to 10 minutes to work up the bravery to go into the kitchen or bathroom at night. Sometimes if I'm really afraid because I saw one earlier, I have to call my friend on speaker phone so she can talk me through and make me go into the room. When I have to reach into a cabinet, especially around the kitchen sink, I start gagging cause I know that's where they're probably coming from. I'm afraid I might continue doing this for a pretty long time even if I stop seeing them.",11Jul2020,1

815,"So this is my first real reddit post..

I have a friend (lets call him bob) that i have known almost my whole life (26yo-m)
this friend i used to hang out with all the time when younger and we lost contact for a few years but found each other out of pure luck. since then we hung out lots went on holiday with others, played loads of video games together etc.

Me and my other friend (lets call him lemon) thought we would try out making youtube videos and streaming which we didnt have much luck other than some of my videos getting a couple thousand views etc.
So we helped build bobs pc and he we all played and still met up in real life, we got him in to streaming and youtube which we all had planned to do together and support each other. which we all did but as soon as bob got going he managed to get a big following which was from a very popular game. 

anyways bob agrees and then bails on plans all the time now, and he even has got to the point where he wants us to queue or pay money (sub and donations) to even play with him.

me and lemon are super pissed as we helped him with all his issues up to a couple of days ago, but im fed up and seriously thinking of cutting him out of my life as he is just being an ass, ignores us, wont meet up or play game with us.

am i wrong in thinking to just walk away? or am i being petty?",11Jul2020,1
816,"DISCLAIMER: 2020 has been a year of horror for many people (for obvious reasons), so while I spill out the conflict that has been going on with me and my brother (and even my family, as a whole), I am in NO WAY implying that I'm worse off than other people. There are worse things going on in the world, but I am in need of serious advice...

Around the middle of March, when COVID was beginning to spread like wildfire, my brother (30, now 31) lost his job in New York and had to move back home. Even when I (M, 24 now 25) first heard the news, I was horrified. My relationship with him has always been super rocky due to his bossy, and demeaning behavior. Even while growing up, we have some good memories, but he ALWAYS found a way to make things about him, always find a way to demean me in every shape or form, and always had to pick a fight over the smallest of things. I make a small mistake and he finds a way to criticize me. He's mean, to say the least. The only reason why we had somewhat of a special bond is because we are both gay, but in some sort of ironic way, I think it's what also has kept us from keeping a tight bond. Never really got down to it. 

Back to him coming home: Since I was working from home (due to covid), I knew he was going to be nothing but a distraction, always loud, always in demand of things and so I was dreading the thought of him living in the room across from me. Words can not DESCRIBE how much I loathed the idea of him living under the same roof. The next few months were not as horrific as I expected, other than me losing my Grandfather (unrelated to covid), but there were still moments when he was overstaying his welcome. More belittling and nitpicking. Always in the way. Even one Sunday (the day before memorial day), I had to drive him to the hospital due to a (what we now know was) a panic attack. Never got a thank you AT ALL. But if the table was turned, I'd never hear the end of it. He's also a heavy weed smoker which is probably what induced the panic attack, in the first place. Then, the straw that broke the camels back: The week he was FINALLY leaving, my mother wanted to make us all breakfast but since I had reservations at the pool I am apart of (again, due to COVID), I had to be there or I would lose my spot for the day. When I arrived, I received the nastiest text messages from him calling me horrible that I couldn't enjoy one last breakfast, ungrateful, etc. I told him off and blocked him immediately. 

That Friday he left and I have never felt more free. I felt like a million bucks and not the ""having to walk on egg shells"" feeling. It has been a quiet month and 1/2 until..

I found out from my mother that he's coming back home tomorrow (July 12th)... There isn't any work and there's nothing for him in New York, at this time. I'm heart-broken, I feel lost, and I also feel betrayed. It sounds very selfish that I am only thinking of myself and not his well-being, but it's very hard to feel sorry for someone that consistently puts himself in situations that makes me think he's lower than a human-being. 

**What the hell do I do?** I've already told my parents that this will be a HORRIBLE idea but they keep saying they'll talk to him....... Talk to a 31 year old who acts like he's 16 again? No, thank you. 

\* I fully understand that at the age of 25, I should technically be moved out but again, because of COVID, me moving to Austin (for work) was completely out of the question. However, I will be talking with my supervisors at the end of next work-week to talk about what the plans will be.

\*\* If any of you need more information or examples of his horrific behavior, I'll be more than happy to supply it. I wanted to keep this post to the point instead of deviating on an endless rant.",11Jul2020,1

818,"So I'll try to keep this kinda short and sweet. I'm a 43m and I've known this woman for about 4 years. Early this week I made arrangements (albeit extremely difficultly with a little bit of  miscommunication) to have an hour physical therapy session. When I arrived (which was an hour later) she wasnt ready yet but said she only needed a few minutes. Almost an hour later I left pissed off. She called me and we talked about what happened and I agreed to go back. Some more miscommunication about what door into the building I was supposed to meet her at and after 20 minutes I left as I was unable to get a hold of her. We finally talked again (this is about 2 hours after the planned start) and I tried a 3rd time (3rd times the charm?). We started the session and about halfway in she received a text and starts texting someone and telling me sorry she just needs a minute. I wait 10 minutes and get angry so I leave and she doesn't stop me at all or even question me and where I was going. I called her back after I had calmed down and explained that I wanted half the money back as I only had half the session because of her. She claims because I chose to leave she owes me nothing and has since blocked my number.
So now the advice question. I know she's smoking drugs (some legal and some illegal) and a few other things that violate the rental agreement she has for her apartment. So do I report her to the property manager and get her evicted or do i just let it go?",11Jul2020,1
819,"Hi everyone, i just want to share my story and ask for advice because my heart aches all the time, i can barely sleep and im starting to grow a hatred towards everything. 

I started developing signs of depression 4 years ago when i was 20 and it seemed like my external world coincidentally became more hostile since then. 

My friend died in a car crash shortly after which left me lost and heartbroken, on the day of his funeral i met up with old college ‘friends’ who kept bringing up this one argument i had with my deceased friend as if to say i wasn’t there for him and im partially responsible for his death. They then shared some of my most embarrassing moments/secrets with everyone else i was friends with.

My last remaining friends were stoners and I found myself smoking everyday for years which eventually made me spiral downhill even more. I developed mild psychosis which made me think everyone was talking about me 24/7, even my family who i have a good relationship with. 

I didnt know what to do with my life but took a leap of faith and went to university to study... 

My next door neighbour was crazy and threatened me with a knife on the first week of me being there, and almost set the whole place on fire if i hadnt noticed and doused it with water. 

I heard news that my grandma passed away, so i went out and got very drunk, on that night out the security believed i was ‘looking shady’ and decided to kick me out. I Lost my phone and asked a random person to share a taxi, he punched me in the face and walked away. I woke up the next day, one of my room mates received a message from someone saying they have my phone. I kept messaging the guy for weeks and he kept saying he was too busy to hand it over, eventually he said he handed it in to the police for unknown reasons. I contacted the police department and they said they were doing background checks on it and i should give them my pin number or it will take 3 months to analyse its data. I looked up the police department and the comments were pretty unsettling, some people saying ‘they are like the mafia with badges’ and how they harass people and enter premises without legal consent. I never got my phone back and i’m paranoid that they are profiling me even to this day.

Anyway so i left uni early due to debilitating levels of anxiety and depression. I wasn’t even capable of expressing how i felt and what had happened to friends and family because i stopped feeling emotions in a normal way. 

Fast forward to today, i’ve been working in this factory job trying to get myself back on track...

I thought to myself ‘this is my fresh start’ so i worked my ass off, worked faster than anyone else, went out of my way doing overtime and extra courses, essentially this company went from being a very small business to a medium size one just as i started joining. Then some fat guy covered in tattoos joins 8 months of me being there, slow and lazy as fuck, he got promoted after 2 months of him working there because he’s older than me. He would never shut up and constantly talk about how he used to beat people up because he loves it and how Im a weak vegan. He has ‘joked’ multiple times that he will kill me and how ‘peace is wrong’ and ‘violence is the answer’ not to mention this is a company that produces vegan supplements and he has a tattoo of a feather on his face that looks oddly like the classic tear tattoo you see on gang members (means that they have killed someone).

Me and another member of staff have already spoken to our manager about this guy and what he says and how he treats people, but he just defends him and turns it around on us and says how we are ‘too sensitive’. My manager has also called me ‘fucking retarded’ before and completely denies it. Not to mention my manager is never involved with anything, just sits in his office doing stuff, he doesn’t know shit but acts like he knows everything, and because my fat team leader always kisses his ass he doesn’t know better but to defend him.

So i have essentially been accused for a mistake that was made, even though it’s nothing to do with me. So they were planning on firing me so i quit on the spot. 

So now im in a situation where i hate everyone, i hate working, i feel like putting effort in is useless, i feel like the whole worlds against me, im jobless and im depressed. Please can someone show me how to live a normal, peaceful life. Any DMs are greatly appreciated.",11Jul2020,1
820,"We just bought a very nice new construction home in a great area 2 months ago. We went to the top of our budget for it and were so excited. 

Everyone is great in the neighborhood, except our neighbors across the street. 

They sit out there in their garage all weekend BLASTING music. During the daytime they aren't violating city ordinance so there's literally nothing we can do. It's just an annoyance for our house to shake all day. 

But weekend nights it's until 1 AM or so with blasting music. 

I've spoken to them cordially and explained I have a small child who can't nap or sleep at night with their music - that I don't mind their music but it would be super nice if they could just turn down the volume. 

They keep turning it up. I called the police on them last night and they're obviously getting revenge today by cranking it up louder during daylight hours.

WHYYYY do people have to act like complete trash and ruin others' peace in their homelife?? I'm so frustrated and already wanting to move.

But yes, we **first** need to be happy with **ourselves**, and here is where my request for advice lays: *How do we switch our minds into the mindset that WE ARE ENOUGH, and we need US more than US needing someone else?*

In my personal matter, I'm very insecure, slowly being more confident as I grow (21M), but  I KNOW that I should be happy with who I am, not just be happy because I have someone, or be unhappy because I don't, and it's been hard to click this into my brain and become ''careless'' of this feeling that at the end of a day makes us human.

I am not suggesting that we should suppress our feelings towards someone, but to learn how to control it to the point that, that feeling doesn't control us. 

Coming to the realisation, that yes, I am ''happy'' by myself, I always were, I never felt the need to date someone, but now that I have that ''happiness'' has hidden away, because deep down I know this woman or men in your instance has moved on, and I haven't because I have this recurrent feeling of the need of her ''love''.

834,"Hello there, this might seem incoherent so please bear. 
I’ve been feeling strange for a while now, I feel a void in my heart and the slightest comment from my family about how I’ve been triggers me into crying. While growing up, my house was a bit tense and so I’ve always told myself to never cry because it’ll serve no purpose but to cloud my thoughts. And for a very long while that’s worked, for the 3 months I’ve been in quarantine I thought it was ideal to introspect and try to grow as a person but I feel I’ve been sinking deeper and deeper into nowhere. What started as me trying to understand myself and resolve some issue I had ( certain resent I’ve felt towards myself where I feel I haven’t done enough/ that I’ve wasted so much time/ I have no chances left; memories of pain caused by my parents(whom I hold dear) that I’ve never tried to resolve but just pushed down) and yet I’m reaching a point where I don’t even know who I am. Just who am I and do I hold any morals and how did I arrive at them. My chest pains me at times and I sleep just to escape thinking. I wish the world could just stop for awhile. I feel cornered and so very afraid. Today while standing in my balcony it occurred to my that I could jump, and then I thought that perhaps I’d wait till someone noticed me and asked me not to. If I am worth persuading not to end my life. I’m quite distraught at how my thinking has got to. I can’t believe what I was thinking, is it my desire to be looked at and loved ? 
I thought to myself at that moment that perhaps all these walls I’ve imprisoned my self In I can’t get out of now. How do I turn back to normal? At the same time I don’t want to turn back to how I was, the whole purpose was for me to improve to grow to change. I’m scared and embarrassed by my thoughts. For the first time in awhile I very clearly felt my mortality and how easily my life could end. The pain I would’ve left my family with which they’d have to carry.

835,"I have (1) year worth of experience in the Medical Devices Industry from a couple different Co-Op experiences. My first company was great. They had an amazing company culture, I learned a great deal. I had a good boss and a decent boss, and generally felt like I knew what I was doing, who I could go to for help, and was appropriately challenged and evaluated...

Fast forward to now when I have graduated (May 2020). I started a part-time intern position in February with a med device company near where I live with the hopes of getting every ounce of experience I can before graduation. I was hired on with loose terms (meaning no actual end date) and was given word that I would be re-evaluated upon graduation. So I begin my role and have a mentor and boss in my field(great, this is the experience I need). But things quickly begin to unfold. I work in a fast-paced building and every ounce of my training was performed (on the job) by my mentor in the 3 hours time before he left for lunch at 11:00 AM. This left little effective time for training, and he was often swamped in the mornings. Come to found out, he was not the happiest employee and after 12 years of working at this company he left 3 months into my being there. This leaves me thinking oh man whats going to happen with me and who will replace him? Well the answer is nothing happens.. i continue on and apparently he has not been replaced. 

So the issues I have with this company are plentiful.. my training has been practically non-existent. I started my role as an intern and had no expectations layed out, no real chance to express my experiences and talents, no feedback from my boss, the list goes on. I fumble through my role, and take every chance I get to learn along the way. Ive reached out to a great deal of people for learning opportunities, and have done my best to understand what goes on and why and what I do in my role. But it all boils back down to my boss. He is involved in practically everything, and because of that has for nothing. My work is divulged in a matter of seconds, emails are one sentence responses, I often have zero context of my next project, and have gotten ZERO feedback on any of my work. I have reached out to HR about concerns but have gotten radio silence until a third email sent out 1.5 months after the first, and FINALLY a phone call.

But.. the response I get is one of seemingly more annoyance than anything and any feedback I so greatly desire is boiled into one phrase... ""we have gotten feedback about retention of information issues from multiple sources."" Ive gotten no chance to defend myself, and not to mention.. THIS STATEMENT IS ABSURD! If they would even take a moment to put themselves in my shoes and realize HOW the information is passed on, then there would be no shadow of a doubt that this is THEIR OWN FAULT!

So all rambling aside and frustration aside, I am genuinely seeking advice and other's experience. This company seems to be milking me as an intern and paying me as such to perform essentially the same role as my mentor.. i also find it strange that the company can afford to be without a replacement in our building, or (somehow) find it unimportant? That decision is beyond me... one other important thing I notice is the culture.. NO ONE WANTS TO BE THERE.. but at the same time, the turnover isn't THAT BAD? We have guys in our lab that have been there 30+ yrs. 

So am I just the young buck who is so naive to think that I am passionate about my work and just want to put in a good days work and be proud of what I do? But at the same time, how much do I want to invest into a company that sees no investment in me. Is this wrong to think? I thought it was a two-way street where I put in the work and effort and the company will provide me with the resources to succeed and be the best I can. But has just not been the case.

If the corporate culture is this way through and through, than i ought to just quit before i even start. Was so hoping to have found myself with a proper company and career outlook, but here I am COVID-HIT, mildly depressed, and VERY frustrated.

836,"The title. Me (18M) and him (18M) have been really good friends ever since we were 5 years old, love him to death.
However, he's just messaged me asking if I could loan him a whopping £1000 in order to help his family out with debt issues, and he needs it by next week. He also said he'd pay me back by Christmas because he'll be starting an apprenticeship soon. He is never a person to ask for money, so I assume he must be in dire circumstances.
The problem is that Ive been working 4 days a week, 6 hours a day to get that £1000 in my bank account, and without it il only have about £200 left. I also need that money for University (which is only a few months away) and with these uncertain times I dont know if my family may need that money in a month's time.
I really want to help his family out, as he is one ofy best friends, but £1000 is everything I have at the moment, I really want to keep it.
I don't believe it would even be possible for him to pay it back by Christmas, and I don't want him to be  in debt to me, as that can have some really bad consequences for me.

837,"I (21F) found out recently that a friend who I was supposed to live with in a different apartment next year changed her mind and didn't tell me. The way my apartment complex does leases is you sign a lease for your room and it isn't affected my your roommates so if they are late on rent it doesn't affect you. They will also match you to roommates if you don't have any. 

So I found out she bailed on me and now I have to decide if I want to live with my current roommate and get one random roommate in the third bedroom, or move apartments and get 2 random roommates. My current roommate took out the trash twice in the year we lived together never took out the recycling and never cleaned the kitchen or other common spaces. On top of that she was a friend at one point but repeatedly treated my poorly and when i talked to her to tell her she can't treat me like she was she essentially said that is how she treats her friends and to deal with it so I stopped talking to her. Now we no longer talk despite living together.

839,"I have been close friends with someone (we will call her Z) for about 3 years. She used to come over almost every day up until I had to move to a different town that was about 10 mins away, long story short my mom got sick so I didn’t have friends over. Now I currently live about an hour away from her and I am very flexible to hang out with so I am always asking if she wants to come over if anything exciting ever happens. 
Here’s where I am concerned, 
1. Z hasn’t invited me out more than 3-4 throughout our whole 3 years of friendship. She has been over to my house probably 100+ times.
2. Her other friends have been invited over to her house plenty of times, I feel like if we have been friends for 3+ years I’d be allowed to stay over at least once?
3. She has been really blunt when texting and replying to stuff. I have talked to her about it because I feel like if I have a problem then it needs to be addressed and each time I’ve talked to her about it I’ve always said “I understand why you could come off as blunt, you work all the time and you’re probably just tired.” But when is it time for me to stop making excuses? When I send stuff on social media apps she will open it and not respond. It could say I broke my leg and she would leave me on read.
4. When she isn’t blunt or giving half-asses responses it’s when I talk about her personal interests. 
5. When I invite her over i expect her to say no, before COVID hit anytime I would ask if she wanted to hang out 99% of the time it was a no. I felt like an idiot asking like I was literally begging to be her friend. Recently I asked if she wanted to hang out and it took her 3 days to give me an actual answer which was “I can’t because I don’t want my family to get sick” which I was completely understanding of this, why wouldn’t I be?? Well today comes and she goes into the city without a mask out to eat. Am I wrong to be upset?? It’s in the same city as me.
6. When I do ask her to hang out I feel like a secretary planning out her schedule. If I ask her to hang out on a day she has work she will automatically say no, I’ll literally have to ask for her schedule so we can work out some type of time to hang out. 
7. She still talks to a girl who trash talked my sister (who she is also very close with) When I first asked her why she was still talking to her she said “when your sister isn’t here I have nobody to talk to so I talk to her so I’m not a loner. Im not trying to be fake even if it seems like it.” Understandable, I know how it feels to be alone at school and it’s not fun. Well when COVID hit she was still talking to this girl. Out of respect my my sister and I, I feel like she should have dropped this girl the first day she found out about what she said about my sister. I ask her again why she’s still friends with someone who trash talked my sister and she leaves me on read. I felt disrespected. Not only had this girl trash talked my sister but she’s also trash talked her sister too! 
8. Some things she has said or done that have hurt my feelings. when my sister asked if she wanted to come over for my birthday she said “probably not.” Then made plans with other people. When me and my sister had invited her over she said no, then at a football game a few days later I had passed her and yep, she was with her other friend. I looked at her and walked past her, she seems surprised that I didn’t stop to have a conversation. Why would I?? 

I feel like I’m making too many excuses for her and I feel like an idiot. Anytime anything she does is iffy I always come up with an excuse as to why it’s not and she didn’t mean for something to come off as a certain way. What are y’all opinions?",11Jul2020,1

Worst part is, I have to pretend to agree because she will then get upset at me for “being rude”. It’s gotten to the point that if I want to stay up late to do homework I have to do it while she’s sleeping in there (since my desk and computer are there) and I feel so uncomfortable.",11Jul2020,1

847," My brother in-law's oldest kid is 18 and with quarantine her life is badly on hold, they were here last night and her dad jokingly said some shit about her bf and she stormed out and went and sat in the house alone. I went to talk to her and it turns out they MADE her break up with her bf, took away her phone, they have 4 other young kids so she's basically the slave that raises them all. The mom routinely beats her (badly it seems) and is super abusive (she is bipolar in a really bad and obvious way). She spilled all this to me like a hostage that had a 2 minute window to ask for help cause they have taken away all her forms of comm. And keep in mind, she's 18, super good kid, not the kind that would make up stories AT ALL. I have zero cause to doubt anything she tells me.

The Dad (We'll call him Bob) is useless. He lets all this happen while the highly medicated and alcoholic wife just destroys these kids and him. She's a train wreck (the wife, let's call her Ulga). Super insecure, many botched facelifts, doesn't hardly eat, medicates and drinks heavily. Just in the past 4 years she has wasted all the family savings in remodeling their house horribly 4 different times and the husband is as I said just useless cause he doesn't know how to deal with her psychotic spells and with that many kids he doesn't really have much choice but to try and keep the peace (at least that's how he acts).

So my question is, knowing that this poor girl and the rest of the kids are being abused, and also not wanting to involve myself at all with the psycho , what is my responsibility here?

I know this is not going to end well if no one does anything. It's like the entire extended family knows this is going on but everyone is afraid to do anything about it. My personal life is just awesome and I don't want to cause tension between my wife and I and her family, but I also can't just let these kids live like that. I have zero doubts that all those moms that end up drowning their kids in the bathtub were giving out all the same signals for years and no one did anything and I know that is exactly the kind of unstable time bomb I'm dealing with here. The kids btw are young, like 4,6,8,12 and 18. Sweet, smart, and well behaved kids that are on the daily getting this shit.

My wife's other siblings are all level-headed and all very close. I haven't broached the topic with them directly but every time we see Ugla act out well all look at eachother like ""someone should really do something"". I'm usually the guy who in a crowd will call out bullshit when I see it, but I feel like in personal family stuff like this I really should tread lightly.

Just writing this out has helped me organize my thoughts a bit. I think the best course might be to start an honest conversation with some of the other family members and then bring Bob in and let him know that if he doesn't do anything about the abuse that we will. I don't know. Your thoughts?",11Jul2020,1

Would just like to ask a quick question I hope loads of different types of people will answers . Background info. in a nutshell.

My friend(f) broke up with her boy-friend after 6 years or so,  an asshole very abusive physically and emotionally. He quickly moved in with her and rented out his house. Then he bought all kinds of things, like a fancy new kitchen with a super nice oven . She had all these thing but he wanted nicer stuff, so she even helped to pay a part of the bill for some of these things.  And ended up throwing her table, cabinets and all kinds away to make room for this new stuff. She has a nurses salary so when it was time to go on a holiday  she wanted to go camping and he took her on expensive holidays. 

The question;  

 She just got a bill for half of all of the above and loads of other shit , and she feels like she owes him for some of that.

855,"I just want to start off by saying that I would prefer not to be judged. So the backstory of our relationship is that we were basically friends with benefits up until a couple months ago when he told me that he loved me. After he told me that he loved me I asked him if that meant that he wanted a relationship. He told me no because he enjoys his freedom and doesn’t want to “do me wrong”. I was fine just being fwb even though we loved each other. A month ago, he started sleeping over at my place more and now he stays over 5/7 nights a week. So I decided to ask him again what we were because clearly it’s more than fwb if we spend almost every night together and say “I love you”. we established that we are together now about 2 weeks ago. We got drunk last night and he went to the bathroom. I saw on his phone that he had a text from a girl. I didn’t know his password and the message was blocked. He came back from the bathroom and I was laying on his chest. I memorized his password and this morning I went through his messages. He is having romantic conversations with multiple girls in iMessage and on snapchat. I don’t want to confront him because I don’t want him to know I went through his phone. I don’t want to leave him because i’m happy with him and I don’t want to start over with anyone else just for them to cheat on me too.

857,"Things between my bf (35M) and I are solid. We’ve been living together for 4 years now and we can’t see a future without each other.

Our honeymoon period is definitely over and while this bothered me a little, I thought it was only normal our love was morphing into something less passionate but stronger.

Until I started to experience a sort of honeymoon period with my coworker? Let me explain.

We met when he was my TA. We had chemistry from the get go. It’s hard to explain, our personalities just play off of each other really well. Our interactions were limited to class/office hours so there wasn’t anything inappropriate going on. I was in a relationship and so was he and even if we’d have both been single he’d probably have been too professional to pursue anything. I looked forward to seeing him and looked for any excuse to meet him during office hours but it was more because I felt so valued and like he was helping me grow.

He recruited me for this project going on at school and once I graduated, it became my full time job.

Things got a lot more confusing then. Suddenly we were spending up to 8 hours a day with each other, and we’d even text during the weekend when we weren’t at work. There was some light flirting going on. I didn’t feel too guilty because I could leave work and not think of him until I saw him again the next day.

He didn’t feel the same way. We went out for drinks one night and he confessed that he felt as though he had been emotionally cheating on his gf. He decided to cut all contact with me, and he did for a few months.

For some reason, we started talking again and got even closer than we were before. I started to think about him when I got home from work, too. I noticed I’d be thinking about him from the moment I got up to the moment I went to bed. He had broken up with his gf by then.

A few more months passed and one day, out of the blue, he texted me to say he loved me. I had a huge cry that day, I’m not even sure why. I told him I loved him back, as a friend.

Not much has changed since. He isn’t really hiding his feelings. He won’t show up to work events when he knows my bf will be there. He can’t talk about my bf at all without blowing up at me. He’s oddly jealous and possessive when it comes to other men. I’m inappropriately jealous of the women in his life, too. But he’s been sort of dating yet another coworker and I’ve been handling that okay.

At the same time he still takes his distance from me every once in a while and seemingly increasingly more often.

We went out last night and he told me he’s officially quitting as his second (and better) job will finally take him on full time.

I’ll be honest, it was devastating to hear. I still feel physically sick. And I don’t even know why. I’m afraid to lose him for good but if I’m honest with myself, have I let this go too far?",11Jul2020,1
858,"So I'm 24M and have been without friends for almost 3 years. Now, when I say without, I really do mean not a single friend... The only benefit to this is that it does save me a whole lot on calls, texts and data costs. 

This is partly/mostly my fault. October last year I finally got the diagnosis I've expecting for some time when I was diagnosed as a Sociopath. So the behaviours that come with that are a serious lack of empathy, grandiosity, narcissistic and almost a complete detachment from emotion and consideration. I'm egotistical even though I have fuck all to he proud of (Except for being exceptionally well endowed.... *Obvious joke*). I'm pessimistic. I'm what most would call ""A piece of shit"".

 The thing people don't understand is that this is who I am. It isn't for show or a persona that I'm putting on. This really does destroy most aspects of my life.  My recent ex partner once told me that I'm becoming so inhuman that it was almost like my heart and soul were replaced with coding. 

 The problem I have is I don't know where to start making friends, something I really am in need of. Friends in the past don't stick around long which is to be expecting once they hear ""I don't really care about your break-up"", or ""I know it's your birthday but I'm halfway through a season of House so I'll talk later"".

I'm a prick. I know this. But this is truly who I am. So do I hide this from people so that I can build the friendships that I'm in need of, or do I stay true to who I am given that nobody should have to hide who they are as a person. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. ☺️👌",11Jul2020,1
859,"I really don't know where to start here, it is my first post on this subreddit. I guess I'll start with explaining my situation a bit. Right now there is a lot going on in my life and I simply need some advice on how to cope with them. I will probably just sound like some super privileged spoiled 22-y/o, but these things are really getting to me, even if they sound like first-world problems. Perhaps I just needed to vent a bit. English is not my first language so please bear with me. These are some of my problems: 

&amp;#x200B;

1. I had lost every friend I had ever had over and over again, and I do not have any guy friends. I was a half European half Asian kid growing up in Asia. I did not have many friends in elementary school, two to be exact. Nobody wanted anything to do with ""the dirty foreigner"", and I was bullied heavily. Well, that is except for girls, but being friends with girls in elementary school was pretty much socially unacceptable, so I stuck to my two friends, one of whom disappeared to play chess in Russia apparently, so I was left with one. When my parents asked me if I wanted to transfer to an international school I instantly said yes. The time I was at that school was the best time in my life: I had everything I wanted, I was friends - or at least on good terms - with everyone in my grade and even other grades. Everyone had a different background and all were super inclusive. Then my family decided to move to Europe when I was 13. I was in a ""relationship"" back then, ofc it was nothing super serious and my parents did not know about it, but back then it was important to me. We held onto it for a couple months after we moved, but in the end it didn't matter. I tried keeping contact with my friends there too, but time difference and distance made it difficult, I stopped talking to them after about half a year. I transferred to the new school mid-term, and I was sat down next to someone I could not really relate to and who, without wanting to sound rude, was kinda a weird kid anyway. I had no idea about the school culture I was in, I had to figure everything out again. Again, although not as bad and as obvious, I was excluded for being the ""foreigner"" again, I was bullied too, but it was still reasonable compared to elementary school. But the girl situation was the same, they seemed to like me and wanted to hang out with me. I started to integrate more, it was more acceptable to hang out with girls in high school. Three years in, I had a couple of relationships, and through those I met guys too and became friends with them, although not particularly close ones. After I broke up with my ex in 2015 to be with another girl, things started to go downhill. My new relationship was extremely toxic, she banned me from hanging out with other people, even the few male friends that I had. As these things go, without contact and hangouts I had lost all of my friends again, but I thought I had everything I needed in my relationship and the friends weren't too close anyway. During the four years we were together, from 16-20 y/o, I had the desire to hang out with other people, perhaps subconsciously. It was dumb of me, but I had met up with a lot of people during that time secretly. Growing up with strict parents I knew very well my ways around lying. I am just now realizing that I had to lie to hang out with other human beings, how pathetic. Our relationship was going downhill, we went to different unis, our opinions and beliefs were starting to drift further apart, but we stayed together for a solid two years after it started to go down. Looking back now, it was my fear of being alone again, to start over again. She wasn't very supportive either, she often referred to me during our daily arguments as not having friends, of being someone with mental issues and that I was just some miserable piece of shit. I got myself Tinder and I started cheating on her. I didn't know and I still don't know what I was looking for, but I did it, not only once, and the thought of it makes me absolutely sick to this day. I cheated both sexually and emotionally, even before I had the app. I knew it was not working with her anymore, so I called quits summer 2019. I was completely alone with no social contact whatsoever, but I hadn't felt that free in 5 long years, and I loved it. I realized I could have a BBQ with people from uni without lying about it so I did and I absolutely enjoyed it. Again, I met super cool people on Tinder with whom I am still great friends to this day, but as you can guess: all my friends were and still are female. Over the years, I had never developed any proper social skill talking to guys, on the contrary, I had excellent communication with girls. I really wish I had a buddy or a pal, someone I could just chill with. I simply cannot ask guys to even just hang out. I also really wish I had some male friends to talk to about troubles in life and in love and in everything else. I have never opened up to any guy about any of my issues, I am just way more open towards talking to girls about these things. I have actually thought about whether or not I could be homosexual, but I don't think this has anything to do with that and I never really was sexually nor emotionally attracted to any guys. 
2. I do not belong anywhere. A bit of a stretch here, but I feel like this is a huge issue in my life. Ever since birth and going through different schools as a mixed kid, I did not feel like part of any of the societies or cultures I was surrounded with. I was always the foreigner. I was the European kid in Asia and the Asian kid in Europe. Most people have their ""safe place"" they could always go to and feel home at, but I just don't. I would count the place I grew up in to be my home, but that is technically and legally not true either. I just don't know where I belong. My relationships have suffered greatly because of this, mainly due to not understanding each other's cultures and traditions and having different mindsets towards relationships. Some parts of the culture where I'm from is just hard to explain and some literally not explainable to people who weren't part of it. But I wasn't part of neither culture. This developed into some sort of identity crisis and I really wanted to be someone else, to a point where I would even lie about myself and make stories up. I'm not sure how to tackle this problem, I guess it is just what it is and I have to accept it. 
3. Yep cheating is a big subject here. I have cheated on every girl I've ever been with, and it disgusts me. It's not just the one time I mentioned above. My first relationship I had was tough, it was when we moved continents. Technically we were still together after we moved, but I had already started to get close with other girls in my new school. I cheated on my second girlfriend too. It was always some different way I found to cheat. I just cheat all the time. Even the long-distance relationship I am in now, for which I really need help. For a bit of background: I visit my family in my home country if you want to call it that once a year. Last year, I met a girl on the plane. We clicked, hung out, ate pretty good food, and were just having a lot of fun, but we knew we were going to be separated. She studies something similar to what I do, we have similar world views. After I came back and blaming on my sheer incompetence and dumb ass passivity, I got together with her just 4 months after I had broken up with my ex. But she is the most amazingly supportive person ever, and I told her about how I was afraid that I could lose all my friends again and that she could get mad or jealous at the fact that most of my friends are female and that she would restrict me in my personal life. She promised me it wouldn't happen, that she understood how I was feeling and that she would give me the space and time I needed. Well, just two months after we got together I was hanging out with other girls again and not telling my girlfriend. I had never seen my girlfriend since we got together. We then met up again this year a week before covid-19 got serious in Europe. I realized that I really loved her and I could really see a future between the two of us, we just fit perfectly. She was everything I needed at that time, just someone super supportive and loving and caring and honestly I cannot see myself being with another person but her. But for some reason, I just keep on cheating. I have been single for a solid 4 months in the past 6 years but that's no excuse and I really don't know what is wrong with me. Last weekend, more on that below, the point was reached where I sexually cheated on her. I feel the biggest guilt ever, I feel physically sick, I don't know what to do. I am the biggest piece of trash on the face of this earth. I feel like I have to break up with her now because obviously I am not fit nor worthy to be in a relationship, and keeping this going would just hurt her so much more than I already did. I really don't know what my problem is and why I keep on cheating. I know that I am an egoistic, arrogant and pathetic asshole, but I just can't deal with the situation, and I have no one to talk to about it because I feel the biggest shame even talking about it with this throwaway account. 
4. Coping. Last Saturday was the worst day I have had in years. A couple of things happened: a) My mom was diagnosed with cancer. Not the worst type as i was told, but still tough news. She's in rehab now, I hope she will be doing better soon. My parents had always been extremely loving and supportive, though still being strict and rather conservative; b) My grandparents were reported to have massively deteriorating health and are - in simpler words - dying. I had spend all my childhood with them, they are the best grandparents one might imagine. All the memories I had with them. I am just so devastated that at this time where they need me the most I am not able to go see them even though I really want to and honestly have to; c) I was fined 1000 USD for downloading a movie on the internet, money that I do not have and cannot bring up being the broke ass student I am, I don't know how to handle the situation and I have never had any legal trouble like this one; d) And on top of that, I've gotten the first mosquito bite in 8 years, rolled both ankles, smashed my phone screen, the ice in my fridge melted and made a gigantic mess on my floor, I have no idea where to go in my life and more importantly I don't know why to go anywhere, and the uni stress is really not helping me. Normally, I am pretty ok at coping with things, I guess I'm a pretty logical person. But all these things happening to me on a single day, plus all the problems I already had before that, is just absolutely destroying me. I used to have pretty bad issues with alcohol and drugs and I really don't want to fall down that hole again. I talked to my girlfriend about it, how shitty the day was, and she listened and wanted to help, but I just ended up cheated on her the next day. I have contemplated about just going to the train tracks and get my head run over, or maybe I just had to vent here, idk.",11Jul2020,1
860,"I need help in so many areas of my life and I just have no idea where to even start. I've tried making lists and spreadsheets of everything I want to change but I feel so completely lost on how to even begin making that all happen- it's so overwhelming. I just want to have everything in a one-stop place where I can go in, tell them what I need fixed, have them tell me what else I need to fix, and have them fix it/teach me how to fix it.

I'm already doing the psychotherapy thing, but I need so much more than that. I need help with my hair, my makeup, my clothes, my weight, my skin, my health, my relationships, my aesthetic, how to walk in pumps, what fashion things go together, how to stop putting my foot in my mouth, and on and on and on it goes. I'm so overwhelmed and I don't know where to start. Right now I feel like I need a hairstylist who actually knows what they're doing because lord knows the last four didn't, a makeup artist who actually listens and not just trying to sell me more products I'll never use, physical fitness I can actually do without pain, a doctor who will work on everything instead of having to see tons of specialists, a stylist or fashion consultant who can work in my budget and with my weight, a plastic surgeon who will actually preform procedures instead of just telling me to ""wait and see"", etc. And these are all different people all over town or hours away from me who I have to somehow schedule in while working 8am-5pm six days a week. It's impossible! I need more help than Youtube or Pintrest can provide.

861,"To anyone who may be able to assist,

Ever since I got a new SSD and transferred everything over to the new drive and made that new drive the Windows boot drive, I haven't been able to connect to ANY online games that have game launchers, including Minecraft, Nexon, Blizzard, any MMOs, etc.

For some reason transferring the drives gave me all kinds of internet issues. I now have to manually enter an IP Address and DNS to connect because when set to ""automatic,"" it comes back with ""invalid IP address."" I've tried all the available Ethernet ports on my computer, an external adapter, and connecting straight to the modem and router. The only thing that works is a manual address I got off of Google.

So while I'm now able to browse the internet just fine and play Steam games, I can't play any other games with launchers and servers.

I've had this issue for several months, so I've had plenty of time to troubleshoot and try all kinds of ideas. The only thing left to try is a clean Windows installation, but I don't have enough hard drive space to back everything up. Beyond that, a new computer, which I will get eventually.

If you have any ideas or suggestions, I'd love to hear them. I'm not sure where to post this exactly, so if you know of a more relevant subreddit then I'll happily move my topic over to there. Thanks!",11Jul2020,1
862,"TL;DR - Our dad has verbally abusive behaviour and it’s taken a really big toll on our family and we don’t know how to navigate it. 


Sorry for the really long post and the format, I’m on mobile.

Before I go into detail, I’m really just looking for some advice on how to approach my dad and speak to him about his behaviour and get an outsiders perspective on this. 

Myself (24f) and my sister (23f) live at home with our parents and we come from a middle eastern background so there are definitely cultural differences that is evident in our upbringing and our parents behaviours/outlook in life.

Growing up, our dad was basically the ‘favourite’ parent and took us to parks every weekend, fast food restaurants when our mum wouldn’t let us, get us presents etc. But as soon as we hit about 14/15 and he retired from work things got a bit difficult. He spent a lot of time (almost everyday) helping my sister and i with certain subjects for our exams which must’ve stressed him out as he started shouting a lot. Nothing specific, just small things he would lash out about if we weren’t concentrating or if we got an answer wrong he would get really angry with us.


After we left school completely and started working/going university in the last four years, things have gotten really hard. His mum passed away in September 2016 and his behaviour changed and got really strict. At this time I was 20, living at home and working and my younger sister was at university and my older sister who was living at home with me at the time was 27. He wouldn’t allow us to be home late when seeing friends and would text us around 4pm telling us to come home because it was getting too late. He would completely flip at the smallest things, like if we didn’t clean the house or wash the dishes. He tried to make me quit work at one point because I had to get a 6am train to get to a location for it and he didn’t like that I had to leave so early and be alone on a train. He was so paranoid that if we left the house we’d get a lecture on being kidnapped or raped and that anything could happen to us and this happened every single time. He didn’t want us going to bars because he once read that a car went into a nightclub and was worried that it would happen to us. We just put it down to his way of grieving and hoped this behaviour would calm down. This went on for about 4-5 months before it calmed down. 

His anger didn’t stop though, it’s just gotten so much worse. Now my older sister (now 31) has moved out for about 3/4 years now so it’s just me, my younger sister and my parents so she doesn’t really see a lot of it. Everyday we wake up, we’ll check with each other what kind of mood he’s in so that we’re aware of how to behave that day, how jokey/serious we can be or if we should just stay in our room for the rest of the day to avoid a shouting match. If we take too long to have breakfast, he’ll shout at us about how we’re wasting time and how lazy we are and how we achieve nothing. If we take too long to have lunch, he’ll shout again the same things and maybe tell us how if he leaves us we’ll never be able to survive without him because we can’t do anything without his help. If we take too long to have dinner, it’s all a repeat with the added we’ve done nothing with our day and that we’re failing in life etc etc. If we even mention wanting to eat because it’s been about 4-6 hours since the last time we ate or even just sat down for a drink he gets really frustrated and starts shouting. If we stay up too late, he’ll threaten to cut the internet off if we don’t wake up early. If we’re literally just sitting down minding our own business, he’ll find something to shout about like a bit of water on the kitchen table, or a chair that’s out of place. He’ll scream at us and tell us how much he hates us and how he wants to leave us all and see how we’ll live without him. He screams at my mum about literally everything. My mum has no self confidence whatsoever and this really doesn’t help the situation because she’s just accepted it and just takes it. She doesn’t understand why its wrong or that it’s wrong at all. He’ll tell us we’re stupid, we’re lazy, if my mum has a lot of things in a drawer or a cupboard, he’ll tell us she’s sick in the head, she’s got a sickness. 
If dinner isn’t done on time or someone doesn’t make him a cup of tea, he starts screaming about how women have their roles in life and men have theirs. That our aunts/cousins (women) back in their home countries do everything for their fathers and clean all day and night and cook too and that we should be doing the same.
Sometimes he’ll threaten to financially cut us off or cut our phone bill off if we’re just sat having breakfast and taking a bit too long to do what he wants us to do. (My younger sister and I are disabled so my parents have unfortunately spent our whole lives coddling us and making sure we’re dependent on them especially financially but we’ve been breaking out of hold for a couple years now but it’s been hard because we still don’t know a lot and they have all our papers etc and it’s still a journey tbh) 


It’s like this every single day. There isn’t a day that goes by where he hasn’t made a comment or shouted at us or screamed at us for something that could be solved so easily by talking sensibly and appropriately and we dread waking up to find he’s in a bad mood because that sets the tone for the entire day and we have to secretly pull each other aside and whisper to each other to not give any attitude or moan about anything and just do whatever he says just to keep him in a good mood but something somehow will always set him off. 

My sisters and I have spoken a lot about his behaviour (not to him) and we’re really unsure about how to approach him and talk to him about it. If we tell him to stop shouting or that he’s so miserable all the time it’s had a bad effect on all of us, he instantly tells us we’re the reason for why he shouts or for why he’s so miserable. There is absolutely no apology, no responsibility taken nothing. I don’t think I’ve ever heard him apologise for anything in my life or taken responsibility for his behaviour because it’s always our fault and we know he’s going to get really defensive about this. 


The problem is, we’re completely aware that his behaviour isn’t okay but when he’s in a good mood it can be SUCH a good day and he’s an amazing dad, he provides for us and always makes sure that we’re okay and don’t struggle for money and supports us. He’s actually a really good dad and will do anything for us. And we can have so many laughs and everything’s good in the world. But then it changes within a split second and that’s it. It’s over. But because of this, we’re always doubting ourselves and we blame ourselves for giving him attitude or rolling our eyes which has caused him to ignore us for up to 3 days (or even a week!) at a time if we do it or if we don’t wake up when he wants us to or anything. 

There’s so much more but this is so long already.

The three of us just really need an outsiders perspective on this behaviour and what we can do to navigate it and speak to him about it because despite knowing its wrong we’re always making excuses for his behaviour (especially my older sister and I), because we love him but honestly it’s made the last 4 months of lockdown so so stressful and my twin and I have a lot of anxiety due to it and it’s put a massive strain on our relationship with our parents and we’re so worried about resenting our older sister for being lucky enough to not see any of it or go through it the way we have. On top of this, earlier this year our dad was diagnosed with cancer and he gets tested every few months to check that it hasn’t spread but if it gets worse, we want to remember the dad we grew up with, the dad we have all the amazing memories with but now this is all being clouded by the way we’ve been treated in the last 4 years and it’s really affected our relationship with him.",11Jul2020,1

864,"(If it matters, I am F21)

This is a little long and boring but please bare wit me.

A few months back I stayed at my fathers house for a week to visit him and my little half sister, she is 8 years old and her mother and my father have been together since she was born.
Staying there that week I learned how horrible life was for my little sister and father, who both were verbally abused every single day by her mother/his girlfriend. 

My father is an adult so I tried to block out everything said to him, but it really bothered me the way she spoke to the child.

One example that’s been stuck in my head, my little sister was quietly colouring with me while father went to the store, and her mother walked in looked at her and said “he’s probably left to get away from you, I don’t blame him” &amp; I had to watch as her face changed from a happy child to the saddest look I’ve ever seen. On top of comments like this daily, she also was always there to witness her doing the same to my/her father.

It got to the point the last day of the week I was there, while she was ripping into my father(in front of little sister) I looked at him and told him I don’t know how he bites his tongue and obviously she lost her mind and then started ripping into me. I have always been kind to her n the whole week I was there I spent cleaning/cooking and taking care of my little sister/father because she did nothing but lay in bed or yell. After that, I had a talk with my father before leaving and he expressed that he doesn’t like her but stays for their child, etc. I’ve tried explaining that’s not what is best for her but I know my father and he won’t leave her. Its been a few months and I’m really afraid of what my little sister is going to have to deal with growing up because of this.

865,"I was at a a party with a few friends and the guy I was interested in who has shown some interest back was also there. I was away from the group for a while and my friend took it upon herself to confront him about me and basically tell him to man up and do something because I was apparently “in love with him” and he’s “breaking my heart”. This is not true at all and makes me look needy and embarrassing. I had talked and flirted with this guy a bit but wasn’t expecting anything to come of it. This all happened last week and I just found out yesterday. When I confronted her about it she denies saying what I quoted and said all they talked about was if he was serious about me or not. She also apologized multiple times about saying anything at all and for putting me in this situation. Usually I would believe her but my other friend who was also there confirmed that’s what happened. 

Now everyone in our friend group thinks I am in love with this guy and want to date him. I saw him yesterday and it was really awkward and we didn’t talk at all which is not right because we usually joke around with each other. 

I’m having a hard time deciding who to believe because both are putting up strong arguments about what happened. I am debating talking to the guy but I don’t want to make it any weirder than it already is and make it a bigger deal. I’ve given up all hope with this guy at this point and he’s already moved on with another girl so is it even worth being mad over? And advice?",11Jul2020,1
866,"I don't even know why I am posting this. I just feel so conflicted. I am a 20 yr old male from Canada and I have two half brothers (13 and 15) living in the US.

I have not seen my dad since I was very young. To put it plainly, he is a pedophile. A person who I am repulsed by and I don't even consider to be my father. What he did- in the simplest terms is unforgivable. My punishment to him is never every uttering a word to him. I have refused all contact.

I hate that I received 50% of my genes from him... but for some reason... i feel a connection to his sons. Who look like me... even though its the part of myself that i hate. I feel like they are my little bros who I should be protecting. I have never spoken to them. I can only presume that they have no idea what he has done.

They have not contacted me, I have not contacted them. I am not even sure if they know my last name.. but I do know that they know I exist. (from my father's facebook posts about me).

so....

If they ever reach out to me, I would love to meet them. But... I feel an obligation to tell them what he did. To me, my mother and others. If they believe their dad is a good person.. I would be destroying their world and for what...

And who knows maybe he has told them I am a liar and my mum has brainwashed me... even if I told them they might not believe me, which would be insulting and infuriating.

I feel so conflicted.

I want to get to know them... as brothers. But our entire genetic relationship is tied to one man. The topic of what he has done is a little hard to avoid....My hope is that they have picked up on stuff. From what I have seen online I can tell he is repeating his pattern.

As of now they are too young to understand the situation, so I wouldn't meet them until they are independent. Makes me sad because I am missing out on them growing up.

I won't reach out to them. I will leave it up to them but if they do... do i meet and tell them the truth?",11Jul2020,1
867,"I'm asking this on reddit as kinda a last resort. I started watching porn at 14 which is the normal age. I spent my life in a all boys school and barely had female interactions. Porn, and masturbating was my only gateway to the reality i was living in. It became a habit of doing it at least 3+ times a day. Eventually it became harder and harder to get satisfied. Lesbian porn became normal to me, and i started getting more and more wild till i reached shemale porn. So this is kinda the cycle that stuck with me. Its regular porn for a bit and then i get bored of it, and it goes to shemale etc. for a bit and then back to regular porn. The thing is when i watch shemale porn the second i ejaculate i become disgusted.  It's only when im extremely horny  do i think about it . I thought that maybe its a fantasy and if i go through with it i'll get it out of my system, and so i went online and met a few trans girls and we talked, and it went great, but the second i ejaculate i kinda snap out of it. Throughout my whole life i had sex with out 3 woman. (all from tinder) i have extreme trouble meeting girls because of my addiction to porn and masturbation. I know it seems like not a big deal but only people who have been in my shoes know the pain of it, and i need advice to get through it.

My step father was an alcoholic and would drink pints of vodka every night and treat us like shit and get into screaming matches with my mother which occasionally turned violent. He rarely put his hands on my brother and I but he would hurt himself. For example, one night he got so drunk and angry that when we tried to leave he grabbed scissors and started slicing his arm with them. I distinctly remember having to throw my socks away because they had blood all over the bottoms. My mother wasn't a saint either. She has a personality disorder and neglected us our entire childhood.

It wasn't always bad, infact, I loved my stepdad. Even thought he was awful a lot of the time, he would tell me he loved me and go out of his way to try and do stuff with me, and he would always tell me that I was his son. My mom would never do anything like this. So I'm torn now. None of us talk to him (My mother and brother despise him) and he's desperately been trying to reach out to us. He's texted and called us and even sent written letters to us.

He told us he was in rehab and he was getting sober for real but he's been known to lie. I don't know if it's true. I want it to be true but at this point he's done so much damage he's lost his whole family.

878," 

I just ended my junior year of high school. This asshole in my grade embarrassed me about 6 months ago. I confronted him about it, and he apologized after realizing how much I didn't appreciate his BS (apparently he saw it as nothing but a funny joke), and admitted that what he did was stupid and wrong, and didn't intend for me to dwell on this 6 months later. Despite this closure, and me standing up for myself, I still feel this sense of victimization and resentment, that my voice isn't being heard, that I'm powerless, and feel this need to embarrass him back or do something else to get revenge. I always feel this others are going to remember this incident, and are going to judge me and think of me in a negative light. I feel that my rep has been altered in some way, but a lot of other people who I talked to about this told me that it was just nothing but a funny pic that no one cares about or even remembers. What do I do? Is it normal for someone to take an embarrassing pic of you, and have it spread through a lot of people? Should I get back at him or should I just let this go?

The pic was of me stalking my crush's Insta in a public space, and it was badly timed with my eyes closed and mouth open. People laughed at me before moving on to the next funny thing.

I'm asking this because sometimes shit happens to people, and the person just excuses it as ""oh, it happens to everyone, its normal, its natural, whatever"", even though that ""no big deal"" thing was rape, and they never get justice or go to the police about it. Or sometimes people get their things vandalized/stolen, and they would just excuse it as ""aww whatever, it happens to everybody, I should just let it go and move on with my life"".

881,"Every day there are more clear indications that america is collapsing and I am trying to figure out what would be best for me. 

I live in a city and cities, with so many ppl fighting for resources, will become uninhabitable. I don't know anyone who lives in a rural situation and think moving to one as an outsider may not go over well. 

I can sail but I have never crossed an ocean or lived long term onboard. I have a 6yr old truck I could theoretically sell to pay for a boat I have found which is in good shape and fairly well equipped for the price.

I'm not too concerned about my ""stuff"" since I have always been somewhat of a minimalist, pack light, kind of person. Some books, work cloths, and a guitar is about all I need.

If I stay here it currently seems ok but then I know how ppl will be running out of money and becoming homeless which is the same thing as saying ppl will become more desperate and therefore violent.

The elections are shaping up to be a shame with election securities decimated, covid, and polling stations being eliminated, current president indicating he will now be leaving anytime soon or ever if he chooses. ""maybe we'll try that some day"" Congratulating Putin on changing laws to keep ""electing"" him over and over, admiration for other dictators and their authoritarian behavior- yada yada yada it just goes on.

She’s had her bf for 10 years and I don’t want to get into detail but it’s been a pretty toxic relationship - needless to say I’m not his biggest fan. 

Anyway - recently he moved back from college into her apartment and she asked me to come over and I respectfully declined- which turned into her asking me why I never wanna come over .... Eventually I told her I don’t feel comfortable around her bf - he doesn’t out right disrespect me but he’s not very hospitable either.. He’s a mans man in other words. 

I do hang out with them sometimes but every time I feel like we do what he wants and never takes the opinion of women into consideration and he’s pretty selfish. He likes me and has no idea that I have reserved feelings about him ( I will mention a few times in the past years we’ve had drunken yelling matches at how he treats my friend) she always sides with him.... 

She told me she doesn’t like that I always only want to hang out her alone. To be fair I never invite him but I also don’t say no when she asks if he can come.. they have been living together now for 6 months and she wants me to invite the whole “household” and says she doesn’t know if she can be friends with someone who doesn’t like her boyfriend. 

I don’t actively bash him or anything - but I told her that I won’t be forced to be around someone when it doesn’t really make me feel good and I do spend time with the both of them and since I’m very cordial with him I don’t see the problem and that if she un friends everyone who doesn’t like him she won’t have very many friends...

890,"I'll be honest im mainly posting this because I'm down at the moment and im just confused at what to do.

I'm from the US and like 95% of the time I love it here.
The state i live in is amazing and is pretty good with financial and medical services albeit housing is more expensive than if like but it's not ridiculous.

I'm Native American and my tribe is lucky enough to have a lot of money to provide for us if needed like we get amazing health insurance to where it cover a great portion of the cost of a surgery as my sister played only a few hundred for a surgery and jobs pay well with a lot of options on and off the Res.

I love being near my people on the Res and my family. The state is so beautiful i don't think anywhere I move could top it. 

Recent politics and the lack of leadership has just made me feel embarrassed to live here though to where it seriously effects my mental health even if I avoid the news. 90% of people I meet are very welcoming and in the middle people who are just happy to live where they do with a few exceptions. I hate the minority of dumb people in this country get to represent the entire population of us to the rest of the world in the form of a circus act.

I have faith in our system including our election system I just don't have faith in the people to put it to good use.

I have thought about Canada but people from my family who have lived or visited Canada say they treat natives horribly. I thought of Australia but i just don't like the idea of all the deadly animals. Japan and the UK have bern my top options as I've always liked Japan and it's culture and the UK and Germany just seems to be a good place to live with the only issue i have are the small buildings as houses. Germany because of the same reason as Japan plus it seems very politically stable.

I don't want to leave the US as im pretty set up here with a house and a good amount of money to maintain a good life and love it and it's people, I love how I can travel a short distance to meet nice people in a different city with a different kind of beautiful nature but it's just im worried about the future of the country and the political climate and how it would affect my life especially if our current president is re-elected.

I’ve never been able to relate to my friends in any meaningful way beyond common interests, and I have always felt inadequate because everyone around me is better than me in pretty much every way. I just want to be an average guy living a normal life, and I feel like I can’t even be honest about this as my expectation for my life with anyone I know. My family is dysfunctional and further sucks any energy and self esteem that I have out of me.

893,"Hi all, this is a long post but I am at my wits end and could really uses some help. Please.

I’m having an extremely difficult time with my elderly father who has over the last 5+ years been in a steady decline of health and now really let himself go. He's always been somewhat of a problem but it has become unbearable.

He is of sane mind (arguably - read on) but suffers from depression and has multiple ailments (obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, COPD). He is barely able to walk without getting out of breath and will move only from his living room to his kitchen (twice a day) or to the car once a day (to go get take-out food for ‘dinner’, every day).

He is 72 and lives alone, his house has become really very disgusting. 20years ago he would have never lived like this. He’s been hoarding for years to the point of throwing out his bed to make room for more junk (he sleeps in a chair in the living room). If I visit, he won’t let me in the house but from the door/window I can see what’s going on. I don’t think the house has been hoovered/dusted in maybe 2years, there are cob webs and bugs everywhere, a foul stench. The kitchen worktops (visible from the front door) are piled high with dishes/tins/food waste. You get the idea. Aside from his house, he has also filled a garage and managed to accumulate around 5 or 6 vehicles. Having filled everywhere he has access to, he has now rented and filled 5 shipping containers with second hand furniture (he says he is starting a business!). All his previous ‘business’ attempts have failed and resulted in only more accumulated junk.

It's been bad for some time but has got worse. Around 2 years ago he was rushed into hospital when he hadn’t taken his blood pressure meds. He was in hospital for 3 or 4 days but I had to fight with him to stay there, (even though his heartrate was 200bps he was off trying to leave after half a day on the ward (I came back from fetching him food to find a ‘friend’ taking him out in a wheelchair)!. While in hospital he made so many apologies and promises to change but he’s done nothing and actually got worse. He has the money and resources for help (I work 60hrs a week in another town) and I’ve talked to him about cleaners and carers over the years, he seems receptive but nothing happens.

He’s not been the greatest father, he was not in my life growing up and there is more to that, his three other children want nothing to do with him, I’m probably only still in his life as I pity him and he has nobody else.

He has two elderly siblings but they don't live close to him and have little contact. His closest friends (some who were actually good influences) have all long passed away and he has just a couple of 'friends' who will fetch him groceries and run errands for £20 a time. I think I'm the only one in his life these days not being paid to be there.

I have tried to talk to him, convince him to change his habits over the years, even offered to go to the docs with him to get help. He refuses to accept his health issues are of his own making (a life of poor diet, heavy smoking, heavy drinking and for the last few years completely sedentary) and he insists it is all just old age! He disputes that KFC and Chip Shop food are unhealthy (fish and chicken are both good for you right!) and it’s got to the point where I’m talking to a brick wall. He thinks he will be around for years and disagrees that he is massively putting his life at risk.

Three weeks ago, I wrote a very stern letter (email) expressing my concerns and asked him to read it and give me a call once he’d had time to process it. I just got texts telling me I’d made him depressed and he wasn’t ready to talk and it would take weeks to get over it (nothing in the letter was stuff I’d not previously raised with him, only I was firmer in writing). After the third week/text of him not being ready (and me having lost sleep for three weeks) I just went to his house (didn’t get to go in) and talked to him. It went as I expected with him rejecting my ideas of small improvements he could make and not open to any change as ‘he’s too old’ and ‘people don’t change’! He will not give up his ‘independence’.

I have suffered from depression myself the last few years; my job is extremely high-stress and he knows this. I am worried not only that he will die, soon as a result of all this (he ticks every box for a stroke or heart attack), but also for this shit show he will leave me to deal with. He doesn’t like talking about death, has no will or testament, so I alone will end up having to clear/sort and store (£) everything until his other children can be located (2 from a different marriage) and his estate can be settled. This could take months and will cost *me* a ton in storage.

To be clear I don’t care about his worth, I’m not interested in his money, I just don’t want to have to deal with all this and I certainly don’t want to end up in debt because of his actions. I’ve spent the last 4 weeks losing sleep over this and it’s affecting my own family life (it’s all my wife and I seem to talk about in the evenings as I cannot shake it), even my young children have made comments about their grandad (who they rarely see btw).

* Has anyone else dealt with anything even remotely similar to this and have advice on how I can get him help?
* His house is rented (local authority), I don’t know how they can let tenants live like this – will they do anything?
* What about from a health perspective, I’m sure trying to talk to his doctors surgery will be fruitless (patient confidentiality) but is there any other angle?
* Any other organisation/social care type agency that can hammer some sense into him?

He will know that I am the one who has involved whoever might try to help and will resent me for it but what else can I do?

**TLDR: Hoarding father in poor health &amp; living in squalor.**

Refuses to recognise it as a problem, refuses to listen to me or get any help but has motivation to try to start a ‘business’.

I'm worried about the risk of his death (partly), my own mental health and the cost to me to sort out the mess he’s made (mostly this tbh). Who can help knock some sense into him?",11Jul2020,1
894,"So for some context, I'm in high school and our school gave us a midterm break last week. I was falling behind on some chapters (especially chemistry) so I was really looking forward to making the most of the break. I planned accordingly and everything went perfect until today.

896,"My parents have been picking on me for as long as I can remember but it’s gotten worse ever since I moved in with my bf. My parents texted a couple days ago on what I wanted to do for my birthday and brought up sushi and getting a birthday cake. I was excited because sushi is my favorite and said it was a perfect idea. So that was the plan. Well two days ago they changed it and said they wanted to eat at a different restaurant for dim sum. I said I really wanted sushi and I liked the original plan. They end up saying no let’s all eat dim sum on your bday instead so I was pretty disappointed because it’s my birthday and it’s tradition in our family that we eat where the birthday person wants to go. However they ignored anything I said and well we had dim sum. I didn’t make a big deal at all. I moved on and didn’t make any complaint. I wanted everyone to be happy and sucked it up. So today we had dim sum, which sucked btw. However pretended to enjoy it. I was grateful that they took me to lunch anyways. Well 30 min in my father tells my bf “how do you put up with her” referring to me. Which this comment has been said many times before and I’ve told them several time that it hurts my feelings and makes my bf uncomfortable. So I told them again, that hurts my feelings. That y’all are always saying things like I’m fat or I let myself go, that I’m lazy. I’m literally holding in my tears at the table talking in a quiet voice to not make a scene and my mom says stop your making a scene. Well my feelings were hurt and I’ve asked y’all to stop picking on me multiple times. Like I literally cannot go to my parents house without leaving sad and feeling like a worthless piece or crap. So 30 minutes later after me completely shutting up and holding in tears my dad gets the check and we leave. My parents are like do you want to go get some cake now and I just say no idk if y’all want to. I was still holding in tears, emotional and hurt. It’s not just at the comment my dad made it was that I couldn’t even have lunch I wanted to have. It was that I felt I had to do what they wanted on my birthday that we were celebrating. All I wanted was to spend time with them and have a good lunch so not getting sushi wasn’t a big deal but I was still disappointed. I told them that I didn’t want cake it was fine, I thanked them for everything and got in my car and bursted into tears. My bf was comforting me but he was pissed because we literally cannot ever leave after seeing my parents without me being picked on. I’ll go to there house where they tell me I’m fat, lazy, how could Taylor want to get engaged to me etc. so for them to make a comment at the table again after saying multiple time it’s hurts my feelings, it made me absolutely upset. So once a I got home I called my mom and apologized for my behavior and she didn’t accept it. She didn’t say sorry and said why are you calling me your dad made the comment but my mom was backing up my dad at the dinner table so it felt like both of them were involved. She did tell me I was making a scene and so it felt like she was against me too. Well I texted both my mom and dad and said thank you again for everything and apologized for my reaction. They haven’t messaged me back yet. So anyways that’s my story please tell me I’m not crazy and I’m reacting like a normal person would react. My bf says I was in the right and I shouldn’t have even apologized but I feel guilty too about not hanging out with them like I said I would after lunch. We were supposed to have lunch, get cake and go to there house but after that comment I just went back home to my apartment.",11Jul2020,1

898,"Hi all!

So I'm an engineering student, in university for 2 years, I have about 3 more left. I've had this part-time job in a retail location in Canada for 4 years, and it took me a year of applying literally everywhere to get it. I've been on exemption due to Covid because my parents are paranoid-scared about everything (like I'm common sense-scared, which means I take necessary precautions, but they insist I don't do anything, but that's a whole other can of worms), and my mom has to go help my grandmother with her meds in her old age home. I was laid off in March and got a call at the end of May asking if I'd be interested in returning. I've been on exemption since, and recently got a call saying, basically, ""show up or ship out"". I have a week to decide. I still live with my parents, and until I got that call, they kept telling me to drop it, that I don't need the job. Now they impatiently say ""well it's \*your choice!\*"" as if they want me to keep it.

I've been on a full-time internship since May (I know what you're thinking, but I'm outside 99% of the time without the 5000 randos crossing my path every time I'm there, so not the same type of job \*at all\*), and I have a possibility of staying on part-time as of September, but I don't know if that's going to happen as contracts that I would've been given are falling through due to timing (construction). I'd love to stay part-time, as I make almost twice as much per hour and I'd actually be doing something related to my field, in which part-time jobs are practically nonexistent. I want the money, but even if I can't keep the internship job part-time, I don't think I want to go back.

I made a pros and cons list, and it's non-conclusive:

Pros: pocket money during school, I'm already there, they're flexible with hours, there are a few decent coworkers, sometimes it's quite enjoyable, it's right next door, and it allows me to invest money.

Cons: garbage salary, I don't enjoy working with the public, it eats up time better spent, we rarely finish on time, the managers refuse to accept and address problems that don't directly affect them, there's no possibility of learning anything of future value, I have to spend my time defending policies and selling product I can barely pretend to care about, there's an endless cycle of change for the better, then go right back to how it was, I always have to drag myself in (at the last possible second), and last but not least, they're doing nothing to protect their employees in the wake of the pandemic (no spine to take the profit loss to force clients to wear masks, so we protect clients, but they don't protect us).

The other problem is that right now, I could give 1 night and 1 day per week, and they're willing to accept that. But both would cut into time I could spend with my girlfriend, who I barely saw for 3 months and who I'll probably end up having to not see much again as the intelligence-devoid part of the population forces us into a second wave (sorry, the pandemic made me even more snarky than usual). She also made her work schedule around mine, and it would really suck for her if I now went and took time she's giving me but could be working and work during that time.

If I'm going to change jobs, it's going to be once school starts since I'm full time with my internship, but I have no idea what to do in the meantime. I really don't want to go back, but I do want a fallback option in case I can't find anything for the winter.

I was thinking of trying to bargain if I decided to ditch. Like ""yeah I'll come back, but it won't be at minimum wage. If I'm putting my safety in danger because of the store's negligent policies, I'm being paid somewhere between a manager and what I was already paid or I walk."" My girlfriend says that's not worth it, but I don't know.

I'm sorry for the wall of text, but Reddit, what do you suggest? I want the spending money, limited as it may be, but I can't stand the job, and it took me forever to find.",11Jul2020,1

900,"Hi everyone. I wanted to get the opinions of others to see what I should do about my current dilemma. For context, I am in college working on getting my master’s degree in social work (MSW). A requirement of the MSW degree everywhere is completing an internship. 

I started my MSW internship placement in June and would be there through December, my anticipated graduation month. It's at an inpatient mental hospital and honestly I really love going and I was learning so much. However, 2 days ago I was informed that last week I had close contact (like I did their intake with them in a small room) with a patient who tested positive and I don't think they were wearing a mask. I also found out that another patient in a different ward tested positive and another intern was exposed. All employees wear masks, but most of the patients do not. 

This obviously scared me and I was told by my supervisor that I can transfer to the online version of an internship that my school is offering due to COVID if I feel unsafe. Many MSW students at my school are doing the virtual placement, many never even got an in-person placement to begin with, so I'll have some support if I decide to transfer out.

I'm conflicted about what to do. I love my internship, but I live with my parents who are very high risk and honestly I do not want to risk myself either. I'd be missing out on so much valuable experience though, but is that experience worth my or my parent's lives? I don't think so, but my parents are upset with me that I'm considering transferring out because they want me to have the experience. It would put me at a huge disadvantage to those who did complete an in-person internship.

Please let me know what you think!",11Jul2020,1

The main thing i worried about is because he deleted everything off of his instagram account. maybe he’s just taking a break from social media, but he also didn’t say anything about it which is unlike him because he’s pretty open with things.

I keep worrying he will randomly change his mind and dump me. I'm really scared. He shows no signs whatsoever and is committed to me as ever, but I'm so scared he might never propose or meet someone better. He mentions the future sometimes and jokes about when we're married/have kids/a house but he hasn't said for sure if we'll get married, he has just said it seems really likely and he assumes we will.

911,"I feel paralyzed. A USA citizen in my mid 30s, I want to come out as a comedian, musician, or a similar type of entertainer. I'm concerned about using my legal name for several reasons, but I'm also concerned about using a stage name. 

Up to this point, I've used my legal name on the comedy stage. It's gotten me into a lot of trouble. However, when I use a stage name, I feel uncomfortable. It feels as though I'm acting like a coward. What am I afraid of? What, I can't handle my house being SWAT'd, my car being vandalized, and stalkers coming to say hi? Am I not a man because I fear for my family's safety? I can handle myself, but what if someone Google's my name and finds my family, let alone my employer, social media, phone number, and so on.

What I really want to do is use my legal name as a way of showing everyone I'm not a coward. I want people to know that I stand by everything I say and that I'm not fooling anyone with disguise.

However, this seems more egotistical than practical. It's easy to sit here and say I'm an American with 1st amendment rights with the protection of law enforcement. Neither of those things protected my car, and who knows how they'll protect me and my family when I actually come out and 100% pursue my career.

I don't want to be canceled. I don't want to suffer life ruin and have to jump off a bridge. 

I don't know what to do. Stage name seems obvious, but I almost want to be proven wrong or right. Part of me wants to know what will happen if I use my legal name and say &amp; do exactly what I want - no holding back.

Of course, a legal name is an invented identifier with no inherent value. Sure, it would be nice to use the same name I've used all of my life. People I've known will easily be able to find &amp; identify me, for better or worse.

What's your advice?",11Jul2020,1

913,"
Okay so this might be a long post but I really need help. I’ve been with my boyfriend for a long time and I broke up with him for a lot of reasons that I thought were valid. I’m going to list them and try and explain them the best I can: 

-The amount that he depends on me scares me- he doesn’t have any other supports and relies only on me and I often feel like I have to like be his mom in a way
I kinda have to push my feelings aside to take care of him and I am getting to the point on not being able to take it anymore

-Our future goals don’t match up and I don’t think it will work out in the long run we just have two completely visions

 -He’s not ready to start moving forward in his life and I’m taking the steps I need to- he can’t even get a job even thinking about it makes him freak out 

-He gets paranoid whenever I’m talking to anyone even though I have never given him any reason to doubt me and it makes me feel like I can’t have new friends- I get along better with guys and I know that makes him uncomfortable but I wish that he just trusted me. I feel like he never really trusted me with other people. 

-I feel like the amount that he is willing to give up for me isn’t healthy. I don’t know how to explain it but he is willing to give up everything just to stay with me and I don’t want that I want to be with someone who can be themselves around me and not have to change key features about themselves 

Ive wanted to break up with him for a long time but there was so much pressure on me because if I broke up with him his quality of life would not be great. His parents are not good and he doesn’t feel safe living in his house anymore (he was living at mine), he wouldn’t have me as a support and I am the only person who he ever talked to about anything and just so much stuff. This pressure was eating at me and I couldn’t take it anymore so I broke it off. I didn’t really feel like it would be that hard. Then I did it and it hurt so fucking bad. I spent hours crying. I have a feeling it might be related to separation anxiety but I’m not sure. 

The thing is though, I have mental illness and even though it is mostly well controlled it still affects me pretty often. After crying for a while I started to regret my decision and I talked to him about it. He told me a lot of things and so many were about how I was the one and how there will never be anyone else. It sounded like a guilt trip but I can’t tell. But anyways, I came to the thought that maybe every problem I just made worse in my head. I have known for a long time that I perceive things in a very strange way.  I talked to him about it and he said he knew that too and he could see when I was doing it. So I’m thinking that maybe it’s all actually my fault? Not every problem but a lot of it. But I have been thinking about the things in that list for months. I have to decide if I want to get back together or be done. 

Another thing is, I don’t know if I love him but I honestly don’t know if I’m capable of love. I feel for him but I don’t know if that’s enough. I feel like he deserves someone so much better than me but he says all he wants is me. I told him this and I told him I may never love him and much as he loves me and he says it’s okay as long as I love him as much as I can. I just honestly don’t know if I do at this point. I can’t tell. My brain is so overwhelmed right now but I know that for the past few months I have been thinking about this a lot. 

He is an okay guy, he gets mad sometimes but nothing that is concerning. He has motivation issues and hasn’t had a job in months. (Covid made him lose his but he promised me he would get one so he could stay with me) He is pretty good at the romantic stuff, much better than I am. He does an okay job at dealing with my mental illness, I know that no one ever has to take responsibility for that but in a relationship sometimes you have to handle it with me. He’s just an okay guy. I’m attached to him and see a bunch of potential in him and have encourage him for months, gently so it wouldn’t seem too pushy, to get a job but he just hasn’t done it. He plays video games all night and then sleeps all day. We have been fighting a lot the past two months about basically everything. 

I’m just so overwhelmed and was wondering if anyone with mental illness (I have bipolar) has felt or dealt with anything like this? Or anyone else with advice?  I honestly just really need help.",11Jul2020,1

915,"Honestly this last year has really ruined my relationship with both my parents. Over quarantine I started harming myself in more drastic ways because of homeschooling difficulties plus then quarantine(cutting). I’ve burned myself before and when I was young I’d hit my head and yank on my hair in the back of my head, my mom would always get mad and tell me to stop being a baby and hitting my head. 

Now with the quarantine my depression has gotten worse and I was struggling with suicidal thoughts almost daily. I gained a little weight like everyone else, and I happen to already be chubby. I’ve started wearing pants because of the cuts, my clothes may be hot as baggy but I can still fit into 90% of them just fine. My mom is convinced I gained so much I can’t fit into them, and after my continual reassurance it’s not that, she wouldn’t stop. She bought me 6 pairs of shorts 2x-4x my size (it’s really no hate, I’m chubby, it just hurt to see her do that, she always does that and it fucks with my perception of myself). 

She knows I don’t like being bought clothes without being consulted(she gets annoyed if I don’t want them, but doesn’t get me stuff I like and constantly pushes me to keep them even tho their always too big.). Today she got mad I don’t wear anything but sweatshirts and pants. Then we had a conversation, where she told me I draw more attention to myself wearing ugly unfitting clothes, keep in mind she doesn’t comprehend I know how clothes feel, she says everything is too small, even when my pants were literally falling off of me cuz the waist was too big. 


It really hurts, she’s never once even questioned my mental health, she only got irritated I didn’t dress up or wear anything besides sweatshirts, and when I do she makes fun of it and gives her opinion about how I look. It’s a constant conversation about how I’m bigger, and lazy, and pretty much to sum it up a disappointment. She just gets mad if I forget to take my medication, and the other day got angry my friend and I were eating to much. She’ll defend my stepdad and his horrible and creepy actions till the dawn of time using my dad as an example”well you’re dad did worse “, but constantly blame every fight on me calling me selfish, after she got angry I didn’t agree. She’s so stuck in her own opinions, she lies and tells everyone our relationship is amazing, but last week was the first hour we’d hungout in months like we’d use to. She wants me to count calories Etc, and honestly doesn’t care what I think about it. It’s like she’d be happier if I had a eating disorder, which she basically approves of. She makes fun of how the calories I don’t eat during the week are made up by me eating with my friends. 

I asked if I could take a day off in 2 weeks from my hour and a half of class to play with the puppy we’re getting, she literally got mad and called me lazy. She wants me to do things I don’t know how to do, that honestly she should do like making my school transcript. She never cooks, but complains about how we eat out but then defends it by saying I should step up. I know I sound selfish, but I feel like half of the things she wants me to do is her job or she could at least help me with (she’s sheltered me a lot and I don’t know how to do some activities also I’m a kid so sometimes I just don’t know), she lets me buy stuff a lot and in those aspects is nice but honestly she hasn’t been there for me months if not years. I don’t really know her let alone wanna be affectionate with her anymore, but she pretends we’re perfect. 

I feel like everything with me is summed up in my weight, test scores, and my ability to get a job in the future not me and my happiness. My dad is barely there, but gets grumpy I don’t see him, when I explained how what my mom does really hurts, he said “well we don’t want you being obese”. Like yes I understand that, but there are so many other ways to discuss it with me then shaming me, and making me feel guilty whenever I’m hungry. He moved when I was young, and lately it’s been bothering me how he just up and left me for another family. With my my mom lately I tried to lean on my dad, but he couldn’t do it, and would often insight further panic.

I feel guilty feeling upset with them, but honestly I’d trade anything to feel like they were at least happy with me. I’m in a constant downward spiral of self hated, and the only thing I can do is sit there and take it, cuz I’m not allowed to be upset by what either of them say. I know how dramatic this sounds, it’s just really been bothering me.",11Jul2020,1
919,"My family was just cleaning out our storage room so we could sort through everything and get rid of things we don't want, when my mom found a box with a mouse and her four babies. They look, at most, days old. Their eyes are closed, and all they can do is squeak. 

My mom immediately told me to put them in the field across from our house, so I took the box and an old, dirty cup to get them out with. But as I tried to scoop out the babies, the mom jumped out and ran into the field. 

There were four little baby mice in a cup, and I couldn't just drop them. So I asked my mom if there was anything we could do, but she said that they carry diseases and that we (me and my little brother) have to put them outside. 

I very gently placed them in the place where the mom ran off, and I made sure that they were all together and touching. That was about five minutes ago, and in fifteen minutes I'm going back outside to check if they're still there, or if the mom isn't coming back. 

I feel terrible leaving them there. Is there anything I can do for them? My mom says they can't come back in, which I can understand, but I'm really worried about them. Can I call Animal Services, or will they not do anything for them? Any advice you have would be greatly appreciated :)",11Jul2020,1

I am a male 14 year old. My neighbors dog is always barking. Constantly. I’ve been putting boys through their letter box for a couple weeks “Shut your dog up” etc. So, today at about 8pm I placed one in. He happened to come home from work at that time. Instinctively he yelled out for me to stop. Adrenaline kicked in and I ran. I ran past my house and to a playground. He found me and talked to me, telling me his dog likes being outside. It sounded like the dog was ok. I told him I lived at a fake address, that I had a fake name and that I was 11. (I’m short so it should work) I apologized and pretended to go to my fake address. Trouble is, I actually live diagonally to him. He can see through my window from his house and vice versa. I don’t know if he remembers my face, but I’m worried. What do I do now? Avoid him? Send a not apologizing? Never look out my window again? I don’t want him knowing where I live, that’d be really bad. What do I do? Pleas send advice. My heart is still going fast.",11Jul2020,1
921,"i dont know if im bicurious or gay or a pedophile because this shit is fucked and idk what to do about it. so im 20 and my friend who is a guy is 16 and ive seen his dick like multiple times already. the first time it was a total accident, i swiped on his phone and saw a picture of it, and the other times were because he just wanted to flash me. like tonight for example, we were swimming together and i was underwater and he swims in front of me and flashes his dick in front of me. He thought it was funny, and I did too but I got a boner from it which i know is fucked up and it was just awkward and I don't know why I feel this way whenever I am friends with someone for a long time.

This shit even happened with my old friend who im not friends with anymore because he thought i was too sensitive and couldnt handle the stress of me venting to him all the time. back in 2018 i made a friend who was 14 at the time and 15 when the friendship ended and we hung out all the time and had lots of sleepovers. i ended up getting attached to him and forming a little bit of a crush on him in the middle of our friendship which made things awkward. He used to let me rub his ""abs"", I hugged him once after we had an argument and I got a boner, and i even asked if we could kiss to see if im gay or not (which he refused). oh yeah i did that to my current friend too, asked if we could kiss but he takes everything as a joke and dosent care about what i say. i ask if anything i say bothers him and he says nothing i say bothers him. we even go as far as to slap eachothers ass and ive put my hand on his thigh a couple times while he was driving as a joke while we were messing around.

I know the shit i do is gross and i honestly would never do anything to hurt my friend(s) and thats why i would never go farther than ive already gone. i would never do shit to someone while someone was unconscious, i would never beg for sex from a minor, and i would never force myself on a minor either. i know this shit is fucked and i honestly cant believe i even have to type this shit up. I guess it would help to say ive never been in a sexual/physical relationship ever in my whole life. ive never kissed a girl/held hands with a girl/hugged a girl/done anything like that. the only experimentation ive done was when i was like 8 or 10 years old and my friend wanted to always run downstairs until our pants fell down or lay on top of eachother butt naked or shit like that. anyway if anyone has advice for me that would be great because im honestly really needing it right now.

923,"First off, please don’t think I’m making this post just to brag, I already feel like I am making an ass of myself just talking about this, but I genuinely need advice. 
I am a digital artist, and I have a large following of a few hundreds of thousand of followers. It happened by chance over the last couple of years. I am not “get recognized on the street” famous, but when I attend conventions or events related to my hobby I am crowded, and people even ask me for autographs. 

The first few months, it was fun. Having been the shy quiet guy all my life, I was happy to have so many eyes on my work, and myself. Events were really cool because everyone was so excited to see me there. 

But then it got bad. Every day I felt constantly pressured to post something. Becoming irrelevant became a huge fear. I couldn’t get off social media, watching the likes and followers grow exponentially every day was intoxicating.

I am fatigued. There is a constant nagging within me to keep myself relevant. I have a serious addiction to my account and popularity. I’ve lost tons of followers and “likes” just from being inactive over the last few months (out of fatigue), and it actually makes me feel sad. Social media mentally exhausts me just thinking about it.... but at the same time, I don’t want to lose my fame.

God, it feels incredibly lame just to write that. 

You know, reaching the end of this post, I feel like I don’t even know what I’m asking for. I just needed to get this out and get some thoughts on it. This has gotta be a self worth issue. What can I do? What are some steps I can take to curb my social media addiction? Or, is there a way for me to continue to use social media in a healthy way? I am unsure of how to move forward.

925," I've been with my partner approx 8 years. His family dislike me, reason unknown. Everytime we visit I always take small gifts, flowers, fresh fruit / veg, chocolate etc as a thank you for their hospitality, just the way i was brought up. They always ignore me, when I try participate in a conversation they will talk over me and will never make eye contact with me. My partner repeatedly tries to involve me and tells them to listen to me, but they carry on. They've insulted me a few times and have said some very hurtful things about my deceased relatives. I've invited his family numerous times over the past 8 years to meet the rest of my family, but they always say no or don't turn up. 

Even after all this horrible stuff, I still give way too much of a damn about them? For example, when we got engaged I was hoping we would get a congratulations, but we got nothing. When my other half and I graduated, neither of us got a congratulations or anything, yet his siblings got cakes, gifts, dinner at a restaurant etc. Its just really hurtful, I dont know what I've done wrong and I hate the way they treat my partner too. 

How do I stop caring about what they do or don't do? I am fed up of being disappointed, upset or angry.

926,"Ok, so background story is that im 14 and i already lost my grandma who adopted me and was my mom to cancer, and that led me to develop severe anxiety (200mg of zoloft at the age of 13). My dad just passed to an overdose, suddenly, with no warning. I'm having episodes where like my peripheral vision is like.. weird, and I zone out, and feel mixed emotions if intense sadness and anger towards whoever gave him the drugs, and his friend (or roommate) who never found him or helped him while he was overdosing. Whenever i have these episodes, I usually get heat rushes down my body, and slight movements out of my peripheral vision startle me to death (for example, a dog). Are all flashbacks of some sort of traumatic moment, or can they be of memories of a dead loved one, too? I also cant stop thinking about the image of his dead body, it haunts me greatly.. I cant stop thinking about his voice either, but whenever I have these episdoes, I think about the struggle he went through.. Losing his girlfriend and having to deal with a child single-handedly, getting in a car-crash and losing his car, having a traumatic injury to the knee that took a long time to recover, if he ever even recovered fully.. Then getting kicked out of his apartment, moving into another apartment, working full-time (maybe two jobs), having a son that pushed him away.. before he had died, we had one full conversation on the phone.. He wanted me to read over the patriot act by george bush, but he never came back to talk to me about it... I pushed him away, I would always say ""No, I don't wanna see him"".. I'm so stressed out right now after I just typed that I pushed him away, and remembered how I would purposely make it so I wouldnt see him when he wanted too. This stress is worse than it was earlier..... I also cant stop thinking about how I pushed him away from me like that..

928,"my closest friend (m17) someone i would consider my closest friend for the longest time is slowly turning into a person i avoid and someone i don't want to talk to anymore. it all started a few weeks ago when he started to drink and it really showed me how much he was changing and i'm now his designated driver cause i myself do not drink and i now have to go to every party/get together he goes to because i know for a fact he'll drink. someone who i was friends with since we were both in the 5th grade is now drinking and changing into a person i don't want him to become. its not just the drinking i get upset by, he also thinks woman are only good for a few things (you can probably guess). seeing this is disgusting. personally i was raised by women as my dad was mostly working to make sure we had a roof over our heads and my mom and sister told me ever since i was young that every person no matter the gender, skin color, or sexuality i should treat everyone equal and i do to this day. my friend also objectifies woman if we are out in public and will nudge me and say ""look at that"" and point or mutter under his breath ""oh my god she is bad"" and it honestly disgusts me. he tells me girls wear simple clothes in public like shorts or yoga pants its cause they want guys to look and it disgusts me every time he says that to me. i personally never went through the whole ""checking out girls"" phase in my life cause i was raised to never like a girl for their body because their body isn't long term while their personality never changes. and when i tell him i don't check every girl out he says i'm gay and i'm not (i think anything is wrong with being gay i just personally am not) but he then pushes it further and continues to call me gay and it personally makes me upset. he also takes it one step further and sends me half naked girls on instagram and says ""check her out"" and personally i don't use instagram to check out girls but apparently he does. its just that he is one of my closest friends and to see him turning into this is honestly just disgusting. he's also racist as well as when he dies in a video game he will say the n word and call all of his (white) friends the word as well and he himself is white. i just don't know what to do and know how to tell him i see him changing cause he is such a loose cannon that he'll just tell me to kick rocks or something cause its his life and i can't change anything about his life. i love him to death and i just want the best for him and i don't think that him objectifying women and calling his friends a word he shouldn't say is a bright decision. i don't wanna be his parent but i just want him to be ok.

I admitted to him I was interested in a relationship and he said he doesn’t want a relationship right now because he recently got out of one and wants to be free and unchained. We agreed to be friends with benefits and had sex a couple days ago. I noticed he’s been avoiding me and I asked him if he was okay with the fact we had sex and he said he wasn’t sure. He said he thinks he wants to reserve sex for love. I said okay, I’m fine with that. But then I realized I really do want a relationship.

However, I had random people coming in my thread accusing me of sending them messages threatening suicide, and I don't even know who these people are. Then they posted screenshots of the messages, and I did not even send them. Their game happened after mine and I don't understand what the hell is happening. They then started going through my post history and calling me a shitty person for talking about suicide and ""crying for attention"" I'm so fucking panicked.

My current only option is waiting at the station for 8 hours while I watch over my bags, but that sounds like it’s going to be pretty boring. Of course, I’ll deal with it if it comes to that.

I don’t know if there’s another option I can do that involves my bags being put in a safe place where I don’t have be on constant look out and I can do something fun while in Chicago.

A terrible example, but gets the main idea of where I’m getting at, is checking into a hotel, placing my bags in my room, go out, and return to get my bags for the next train. I’m not doing that because it seems silly to spend an extra $150 just for 8 hours and not a whole night stay.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

(I'm not sure if I should put this here or not, but just in case, trigger warning)

Hello, I'm posting this on a temp account since I'm not sure if this friend uses Reddit or not. Also, I am a 15 year old male, and this friend is a 15 year old (trans) girl. I'm not sure how relevant that information is, but it might be.

I met this friend in school (I'll call her C for simplicity) and mostly I thought she was just a cool friend for a while. I also met this other friend (M) through her, since they've been best friends for ten years, who will come into the story later. It became very clear when I talked to her through messaging that she was going through lots of mental health issues, mostly with depression and anxiety (she claims she hasn't been happy for years, absolutely hates her parents, feels worthless, has nonexistent self-esteem, can be suicidal, etc.) I tried my best to help but I have not once been successful in making her feel better. I have even called Safe2Tell (an anonymous reporting service) or told our school multiple times when I was worrying about her safety. She also, and this is very important, refuses to even try get a therapist or any kind of help.

However, there was also one point in... around November or October of last year? I'm not too sure when, but quite late into last year, me and C were in a Discord call late at night when she told me that she was a lolicon. I didn't know what it was, she described it to me, and I was quite disturbed. I also figured out over time she was attracted to *actual* children and animals, and even has a crush on a 9 year old girl. This disgusted me, and very much still does. What weirded me out more is that M knew about this for a long time. I think the reason I didn't care about it as much at the time is because I was much more dedicated to thinking about her mental health than those other issues.

Over time, I just cared less and less which was wrong on my part. However, after becoming a much more active user of Twitter in June, the topic was brought up by multiple people in my feed and showed quite intolerant ideas of pedophiles, which forced me to think about C. The thing is, there were periods of time where I became quite anxious about the fact she's attracted to animals and children (a few days to a week at a time, once or twice per month), and then it goes away. But this time, I didn't let it go. I talked to M about it (and by that I mean we essentially got into a spat about it because we're both quite defensive). I understood the idea M was telling me, that ""they can't control what they're attracted to and if they have it under control then it should be fine,"" which I was leaning towards thinking a little more with time.

However, as I was still mad about it, I decided to ask C a few questions to see if, despite she's attracted to animals and children, she knows it's wrong. So I asked her ""Do you think animals and children can consent?"" Both of them she said yes to. This pissed me the fuck off in the moment and I sent M screenshots of what she said. To my dismay, he said that this definitely bothered him, but he didn't want to judge because ""she won't do anything, so why should her believing this matter?"" I was absolutely furious with both of them, but I had a little doubt because M knows C too well and I wasn't sure if what he said to defend her was valid or not.

I got into arguments about this with M over the next few days until I was put on the spot to say whether or not I was going to continue being friends with her. In a few messages prior, I learned that another one of my friends said (paraphrased), ""honestly, that is disgusting, but she's still one of the kindest people I know."" I also knew that other people in the friend group were still mad that I was going after C. This influenced my thinking at the time. So I answered to M's question with ""I will not forgive her for what she said... but she still is a kind friend."" He was quite happy with that answer and the ""drama"" was over, at least for now.

The thing that I hate to admit is... C is a kind person and does deeply care about everyone. I wish this situation was much more simple so the answer could be much more clear. I'm not sure what's morally right, or just right in general. If I'm in the wrong here, please tell me. Otherwise, I'm just lost and don't know what to do about the whole situation. Any help is greatly appreciated, and thank you so much for listening. I'm also open to answering questions that you might have.",11Jul2020,1

940,"I’m not sure where to begin so bare with my while I try to organize this best I can.

My roommate has been my best friend since we were in middle school. We moved in together mid-2019. Yes he’s a jackass, but he’s ultimately family. 

My roommates(m21) babymomma(f24) is an awful, disgusting person. She has a son from another man and he’s 5 years old I think, maybe 6, and starts kindergarten this year. She has NOTHING to do with her son and neither does the father. The kid lives with his grandmother, her mom, in Tennessee, in poverty, a filthy trailer that’s falling apart(we all live in Arizona). Babymomma has custody of her son, although he lives 1600 miles away and she claims him on her tax returns every year still, gets like $4000 or something absurd and blows it on nonsense, every year. Doesn’t give a dime of it to her mom, who’s on disability, or spend it on her first born.

My roommate got her pregnant when he was 17 and still living in Tennessee with his parents. Her and him lived with his parents the entire pregnancy, she smoked cigarettes the entire pregnancy. His daughter is almost 3 and she’s healthy. Anyways shortly after she was born he knew he wasn’t able to raise a kid and signed over custody to his parents, the grandparents. Babymomma didn’t mind as she had no intention of treating this child any differently than her first. They all still lived at his parents house. He was trying to work and finish highschool, she sat around and did nothing for the first year. Babymommas day consisted of sitting around bumming cigarettes off grandparents that are raising her screaming child, and taking trips to the store to waste food stamps on junk food. The food stamps that were legally meant for her first born. And sitting on the porch most of the day so she won’t have to hear her kid crying inside the house. She’s a liar and a thief. She shoplifts religiously and has even performed sexual favors when she got caught by security one time. 

Anyways my roommates mom got a promotion and transferred out here to Arizona in February of this year. Everyone moved out to Arizona, including me, with the intention of staying roommates. I got my own place almost as soon as I got here because of that disgusting woman. He just moved back in with me 2 months ago.

At this point babymomma and my roommate haven’t been “together” for a while but still live together at parents house. 

He got a job and moved in with me a couple months ago. She’s still living with his parents, not working. Coronavirus is her excuse for not working, smh. This year with the tax return she bought a $3000 car, doesn’t have insurance on it, bums gas money. Her kid and mom in Tennessee didn’t see a dime of that money, AGAIN. As far as I know she just enrolled in the beauty school my roommates mom teaches at(she’s gonna quit and make the woman raising her child look bad, guaranteed).

My roommates parents are the kindest, most generous, selfless people I know. And that’s why this nonsense has been going on, because they can’t bring themselves to put their foot down about anything. Love them to death though. 

Honestly I want to see her behind bars, but that’s not likely. Roommate is trying, sending money for his child and trying to better himself. I’m not saying he’s a saint by any means, cause he contributed a lot to this mess. 

Anyways who can I report her to? I have no evidence of anything at all. This is just so wrong and she’s such a sick person. My heart hurts for that child back in Tennessee. The grandma is not completely right in the head and has NO business raising children. She’s a lovely person don’t get me wrong. 

I can’t take hearing about it anymore. It’s taken a massive toll on me the last few years. I’m ready to kick my roommate out and move on with my life so that Im not around the bull anymore. Something has to be done.",11Jul2020,1
941,"So for the context, I'm 20 years old, male, college student,  never dated ever in my life. 

So I've always grown up with the idea of being nice to people, caring abt them and so on. This has led to me even going out of my way at times to be there, or care, or do things for my friends. 

Since highschool whenever, I've become close to any of my friends and thought abt dating or having a relationship, there has always been this issue of me being a really good friend that they don't wanna mess it up with. 

Earlier, I just took it as the cliche excuse of you deserve better or whatever, but in college, when I was told that I'm too kind, or sweet, I almost snapped, until I was told this - "" you are too nice to mess it up with"" like if the dating thing doesn't work u end up losing or making it awkward even as friends. 

Now I've always been told to be a  nice person, and now that I've been nice all my life, I can't even get a relationship at the next level from friendship.

944,"hey everyone, made this throwaway since.. Idk.. I just wanted to remain anonymous I guess.

I'm a 27(M) and I feel like I haven't done anything right in my life and need some advice.  


Some background about me, I'm a 27 year old black male whose parents weren't fit to take care of. This lead me to be adopted by my Aunt and Uncle who lived on the East coast while most of my family lived on the West coast. As a kid this wasn't so bad because my Uncle was so loved in my family that we would visit them multiple times a year and we would have relatives stay with us on the East coast all the time.   


When I was young my Uncle passed away... This lead my aunt to focus all her time and energy on her work to support us. We had to move to a different neighborhood, downsize our house, but I became closer to my aunt's white side of the family which was nice for awhile. As I got older I found out that this side of the family never truly accepted me. I get left out of the planning when they go on family trips, left out of family dinners, and even left out of celebrations such as a high school graduations for my cousins or even birthday parties... There have been a lot of subtle racist comments my family has made too and a few years ago I saw a confederate flag proudly hanging in my cousin's garage when I was visiting. I've always felt kind of pushed away by them.

I lost connection with old family friends that loved my Uncle, I lost connection with my black side of the family on the west coast, and from losing my Uncle who was my father figure I felt like I lost part of who I was since my parents weren't ever in the picture. My aunt never really made an effort to keep close to that side of my family, so I didn't spend anymore summers with my older siblings or grandparents or anyone from that side of the family. It has been about 20 years since my Uncle passed away and 20 years of me seeing my family maybe 10 times although as a kid I would see them 10 times in a single year.  

My nephew got accepted to college for baseball, two of my nieces graduated high school, and my youngest nephew just started middle school but I was only able to go and celebrate one of those special moments. I have been on my own grind though. I've worked most of my adult life and have been living on my own until I went back to college at 25. Recently finished my associate's degree and will be transferring to University soon to start my journey on my bachelor's degree.   


Last year to finish my Associate's degree I went on a study abroad trip which I paid for myself and it was amazing! But during that trip me and my ex broke up, my job told me I would be able to return from my trip and start work right away.. Then they changed their mind due to Covid-19.. And my grandfather's health had been declining rapidly and he sadly passed away while I was gone. My plan for independence was taken away from me and losing two close people like that was a hard blow.  


Now I've been back on the east coast since March but my family relationships are declining, my childhood friends don't want to hang out because of fear of Covid-19 so my relationships are basically only online now, no job anymore and I haven't heard back from 90% of the jobs I've applied to since March and the ones I've heard back from always start with ""Thank you for applying with us, unfortunately...."", and now I don't have a good source of income and have been relying on selling clothes and things online.  


I've been sitting inside for the last 5 months or so and working on a Google IT Support Professional cert, but other than that.. I feel like I'm not doing anything at all and my life took such a drastic turn for the worst. I planned to get my degree and move back to the west coast and make my siblings proud but now I don't know what to do. I'm stuck in this toxic environment, my aunt is negative whenever I try and talk to her about what I'm going through, she feels like college is a waste of time, I feel isolated and alone, and all my efforts seem to get me nowhere.  


So, the big advice that I'm asking for is how do I get out of this toxic situation? I've thought about enlisting in the military but I'm 27 years old now. I've applied to government jobs, retail jobs, waiter jobs, bartender jobs, even police jobs.. Just about everything that the basic requirement is a high school degree even though I have a college degree, but I still don't get any opportunities. I just feel like my life was on the right path for me to be independent and start a life with my ex and make my siblings and nieces and nephews proud... Now I'm just filled with grief and I'm losing hope.   


TLDR: I'm a 27 yr old who has been sitting inside for the last 5 months trying to get his life together but to no success. I was adopted by my Aunt and Uncle and live on the East coast far away from my parents side of the family on the west coast. Uncle passed away when I was young, lost connection with my west coast family, and I found out my aunts side of the family here are subtle racists who don't accept me and I feel isolated and alone. I recently got my 2 year college degree after a study abroad trip then came back to the states and was greeted with a breakup, let go from my job, and my grandfather passed away. Now I can't find a job, my family on the east coast doesn't support me, aunt feels like college is a waste of time, and I have been contemplating dropping out of college for now and joining the military. I just feel like I'm running out of options and don't know what to do and wanting to get away from my current family situation here.",11Jul2020,1

948," 

My great grandma was put in a nursing home for what was supposed to be eight weeks for rehab for her hip surgery. That was in February. While she was in there, my aunt told me that she caught a superbug which delayed her rehab. I really hate nursing homes, but know they are a necessary evil (I know there are good workers, but there are enough that are not good that makes it awful for the residents. Since the buildings are typically for profit, they do their best to pay the staff as little as possible and staff less workers). Before my great grandma broke her hip, she was living on her own at home, and was doing fine. I do not think she showed too many signs of alzheimers, and I had lived with her for about a year. I have since moved out and got my own place. She is very upset with her situation. Last time I visited her, she had a huge bruise on her arm, and with what she told me this time, I called APS.

So, the situation is that I want to bring her home with me, or put her somewhere where she will have better care. But, to do that I have to go through my great aunt. My aunt keeps insisting that she can't come home because she needs two person assisted in and out of bed and needs too much care. But I have experience with being an aide, and have someone else in the house who is willing to help.

When I suggest moving her to another facility where we would either be able to keep a closer eye on her (restrictions are tight due to the pandemic and it only makes abusive situations worse), she doesn't respond. I know that moving states would mess with her health care, but I have figured out how to get around that. I have friends who work at one of the facilities, so even if I was unable to be there, I know they would make sure she is ok.

What can I do to convince my aunt to consider other options? I know she is dealing with other issues in her life right now, so it makes even less sense to me that she wouldn't be open to the idea of letting me take care of my great grandma.

TL;DR: My great aunt won't let me take my great grandma out of a nursing home, even though my great grandma is unhappy and is claiming abuse (which I believe). My aunt always has an excuse as to why I can't change the situation. What can I do to get my aunt on my side to help my great grandma?",11Jul2020,1

Tonight I was about to make some food before bed they put a sign on the door and said “kitchens closed” even though I buy my own food like surely that can’t be normal? I’m 20 I know when I’m hungry.

When I moved back from university for the summer they hounded on me for weeks about getting a job even though I was already applying to everything possible and I managed to get a job working nights which pays well. Although not ideal I’m sticking it out, I’m constantly reminded by them I should get a “proper job” or they ask me what days I’m working, I’ll tell them only for them to sigh and laugh. 

I’ll arrange to go out with some friends only to be grilled about where I’m going and why surely I don’t need to explain my every move to them? A couple of friends they just love to bad mouth their life’s which I don’t appreciate and they’re perfectly happy.

952,"I don't know if this will get any replies but I will try to write.

This can be like a life story but I thought it would make more sense with chronology.

When I was little my parents wouldn't let me out because they thought it may be dangerous out there. So I mostly played video games and grew up to be quiet, asocial, fat etc.

I remember fighting with some disabled kid for no reason and harming (maybe even breaking, but I don't fully remember) his gear that helps him to hear. If I'm not wrong, my father paid for it. Of course that was in elementary, and you can't expect a kid to be too rational, but fighting thing is relevant for rest of the story.

I started masturbating in a very early age and got addicted. Again, relevant for the rest of story.

I was a successful student until middle school despite not studying, I would just listen to lessons and that would do it. In middle school my grades dropped, also in middle school I left Islam and became an atheist. I didn't tell my family about leaving Islam back then. Also in middle school I got a little bullying. I masturbated to my teacher(s?) sometimes and I feel shame and guilt about that.

When I came to high school, bullying skyrocketed. I would be made fun of and be called the r-word. That was of course because I was socially awkward. My grades were average or above average. I got into many fights, sometimes unnecessarily, maybe a half was my fault. I attacked another kid from the class for no adequate reason, if I'm not wrong something to do with my crush (maybe she liked him? I don't remember) fortunately I am weak and he easily controlled the situation because of that. I don't remember when in the HS it started but I would look at girls' asses like an animal. Like stare like an animal until girl sees I've been doing it. I thought there was nothing wrong with it. And maybe I started to do that because every other boy in school was doing that, but that's no excuse and I recently learned that's sexual harassment and I feel shameful. I masturbated to those girls I look at, who I was supposed to be friends of, also to teachers again. Also at least some of those teachers had husbands and children.

Despite bullying, I often hanged out with my bullies. Because I thought hanging out with them was fun. I also never had any gfs in HS and was shy, and more shy towards girls.

I became a Christian when I was suicidal at HS. Then I told my family. They became extremely sad, so I lied to my father that I reverted back to Islam. I didn't look at girls after that because now I was a Christian.

College entrance exams came, I failed to achieve my goal. I started to live in house 24/7. At this point I became amazingly irresponsible. My family sent me to a paid place for college entrance exams and I didn't go after a while. And did other irresponsible things. 

Then came a hell time for my mental health. I started to struggle with something called delusional parasitosis and pOCD (irrational fear that I'm a pedophile) and other forms of OCD. Sometimes some images just came/come to my mind, like a loved one being raped, by me or someone else; like some sexual image of a child. It hurts that it's not intentional and I don't know if I will ever get rid of it, and I'm ashamed against women I love. I also had sexual problems because of masturbation addiction.

I cried to my family, reverted to Islam and somewhat got it through some of it with professional help. Then I realized I can't really make myself believe and became and atheist again. I realized all that was to do with my converting to religion was that I was in a bad place.

I hadn't been in a relationship ever but I guess I'm not an incel since I don't qualify for misogynistic aspects. But I sympathize with some. I feel like it could have been me. I feel like when places like IncelTears make fun of incels sometimes they mean to make fun of romanceless and virgin guys like me. And I doubt if someone is a misogynistic neckbeard who's been bullied, making fun of them would help the situation or ethically right thing to do.

When I was a kid, I felt disgust even at the normal homosexual relationship. Now I at least sometimes don't even feel disgust for pedophilia or zoophilia.

That was my life. Now I wonder what I can do to improve my life and if I should even improve it instead of ending it all. I hurt people, just me continuing life is hurting people, and who knows I may do some of most terrible things in earth in future. I am a fight-hungry, harasser, disgusting guy. Why not just end it all?

Sure my family would be very sad, but do I have right to hurt people and risk hurting people more like that?

I guess that's it.",11Jul2020,1
954,"Hello all, I apologise in advance if I completely missed the mark asking this question here, I tried posting in r/management and r/askmanagement but I'm not allowed to so I'm here. If there is a better fitting sub for the question, please tell me and I will redirect it there.

Now, a bit of little background about me; I've just graduated high school in a country that has a profession system in place for high schools. What that means is when you graduate from elementary school, typically at age 14-15, you get to pick which profession you want to pursue in life. Although there's a lot of actual fields, the general is things like trade, economics, technology, medicine etc. This is really good for those who know early on ""what they want to be when they grow up"" as it lets them be in the field for a longer period of time without wasting time on subjects that have nothing to do with the profession.

I went into economics and over the course of the 4 years I spent there the field I fell in love with the most was management. I do think of myself as a leader and already have experience in leading others (head of the Red Cross team 4 years in a row, ""top manager"" at a practice company as part of the hs curriculum and captain of my childhood football club for half a season - I know the latter doesn't really count but whatever), which, along with punctuality, decisiveness and good organisational skills and others, is one of the reasons I'd like to pursue management through uni and hopefully later in life with a job in the field, preferably in middle/top management as long term plans/strategies and managing people are my strong points.

I will be taking a year off between school and uni, firstly because of c***d19, since it's very likely that my first semester or even year will be done online but also to reflect on myself and my choices and make sure that what I pick won't have me regretting it in 10-20 years time.

As much as I love management I know that I most likely have a very skewed perception of what it actually is, both in uni and at a job, so I want to make sure that the profession's true side isn't my ""went to med school only to realise I can't stand the sight of blood"".

Tl;dr - what's the dark/true side of management that might make me regret pursuing management if it's not something I'm ready for/interested in?",11Jul2020,1
955,"I'm 19/F. To note, I come from a very sheltered background and was raised by my grandparents. My parents are addicts, and were never around that much. So I was raised by conservative, religious grandparents who don't know how to not be bitter and angry about the world. The kind of people who would disown you for being gay, or shun you for doing something like smoking weed, and then demand respect because they gave you food, shelter, and clothes throughout your life. And still consider ""rap music"" to be ""black people music."" If it weren't for the internet, I would've never seen how negative they are as people. I guess it's has a negative impact on me over time, because now I always expect people to be mean to me, even if I've done nothing wrong. And my boundaries were never respected as a kid, so now I have boundary issues as well. I feel so fucked, but I'm trying to work on these things.  

I'm pretty isolated. I have a job interview soon, to work at a store nearby, after working in fast food for a year and a half. And I have about $4k saved up in total to get a car, and maybe move out. 

I met this guy in February, and when we first started talking it was pretty sexual. We met up, and yes we've had sex. I didn't expect a relationship, and I knew it was more casual, because I don't even want a serious relationship, but we started hanging out maybe three times a month. And like yeah - I got a little too attached. We're both ride or die people, and it's real for both of us. Meaning I really value his friendship, and I meant a lot to him too. But I feel like I fucked everything up. He keeps thinking I want a serious relationship with him, too. 

Basically, I kept bugging him to hangout, because I wanted to talk to him in person about maybe staying with him once I get a car, because he wants a roommate and we get a long pretty good. Plus I feel pretty safe, and normal around him. He was even offering to help me get a car. He's a good guy, just needs his space and can't stand pushy people. He doesn't like texting, but for me texting is how I talk to a lot of people on a daily basis. I can do it for hours when I have nothing better to do. 

But he started ignoring me, which made me nervous, and out of anxiety I started bugging him even more. He didn't tell me to stop though. I finally just asked why he was ignoring me, and he said because I was becoming ""obsessive"" and ""stalkerish"" by begging to come over every day. 

He doesn't really text me unless I text him first, but now every time I text him I feel bad and like I'm just annoying him. Like he doesn't like me anymore.  If I ask to come over he says he's busy. But he said he still wants to be friends, and still responds to my text and all. I just feel like he doesn't want me around now, or like I've become his ""problem"" and idk how to talk to him about it? I feel like I'm over reacting.",11Jul2020,1

Well things with the other person didnt work out which is fine, but now I'm faced with having feelings for her while knowing that she likes me back.

973,"Hey. I hope you're doing well. It's my first time doing this, so I hope I don't screw up, because I already have a feeling that this post is gonna be all over the place.

Ugh, where to start? Here's the thing about me: I get attached to anyone who shows me the slightest bit of attention, exactly like Jim Carrey says in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. I haven't decided if I want to go into specifics yet, but I guess I'll make my mind up on the way.

I am a male, 16, and I just feel like people mean more to me than I do to them. Fuck it, I've made up my mind. Specifics it is.

A while back I took to a critique website to get some feedback on my writing (I write short stories and am currently writing a novel) and in doing so I met this person who read my work. They said they absolutely loved it, and then we started talking to each other quite a bit. We were talking every day, and I like to think they enjoyed my company as much as I enjoyed theirs. Then, bam, one day they send me a message saying 'talking to you was the highlight of my everyday' (their words exactly) and that we can't talk anymore (for reasons I wouldn't like to go into but I suspect that it was a lie). 

I don't even know what this post is, man. Like, we stopped talking and I was completely fucking devastated, but we only knew eachother for like 2 weeks. What the fuck is wrong with me? And I can't help but worry that I never really meant anything to them at all. But their absence kinda made me realise that I cling onto anyone that shows the slightest bit of interest in me, and that I act like it's more than what it actually is and then pay the price for it. And I know people will suspect that I feel this way because I severely lack human contact or some shit; not true. I have a best friend of eleven years and he's a Godsend but why can't it ever be enough? Why do I need more and more acceptance and appreciation? I don't know, it's all a mess and I'll probably be in a better state of mind in a day or two and I'll probably look back on this post and cringe but hey, it's how I'm feeling.

974,"Hello i am a 15 year old boy,  


story starts when i was 14

i used to be quite an obsessive type, my newest obsession was a futurology one. I joined a discord server and met a man there. He was into lollita memes like me, so i approached him whit a fairly simple lollita joke. I invited him to a server and he shared a lollita head whit me that was wearing an face mask and a mouth ball, She also spilled some spit out of her mouth and an hand petting her. He joked that i should make that my server icon so i did. After a while talking about futurology i made jokes like ""a lolli wants you"" or ""keep lewding the lolli"" or ""do lollis like anal?"" or ""i am a minor so i can bang lollis"" or ""i will lewd the loli"" or ""my internet connection is as smooth as a lolis belly"" or ""lolis are magic, they expand ur dong"". These jokes where one of the worst i made about lollitas, i made alot. He also shared some images like 3 lollitas in a bath suit, that was the worst one. We contineud to make loli memes untill we roleplayed, Not eroticly but just a very weird rp where i fought lolis whit other memes. He was team loli. The worst he did was an arabic 1001 nights dance whit a loli or causing an earthquake by making a loli kick nicki minaj's butt and thats all.  


i got into loli jokes by a communist loli video and several fbi open up loli videos.  


I joked a few times about lollitas whit my friend but not bad jokes, jokes like ""lol you are a loli you keep sending nudes to elderly men""  


i did an erotic rp once whit an 19 year old as a 4 year old who turned her body  and later feelings 16 magicly and abused the fact people treated her like a 4 year old but that isnt that bad.

now, i began my insecurities about being a pedophile 1-2 months after i met him. I looked at (non-pornograpic) pictures of kids and began to grow more insecure because i thought i developed feelings for them. Turns out it was a phase or the feelings werent sexual and it stopped after 1-2 months.   


after i turned 15 i became to grow more and more concious because of this and  realised how wrong lollita was. I stopped after some time and blocked the guy later. Note that i was never attracted to lollitas or sexually aroused by them,  


i told my mom and she demanded i banned the guy and searched for a psychologist for me.  


i know we all did stupid stuff as teens, but this was pretty bad.

977,"I   \[24 F\] was best friends with a guy \[24 M\] for a year. We met in July   2019, and we talked everyday for a year. Let's call him Marc. We met on [r/Depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/Depression/)   and we were each other's emotional support for a year. I'm American,   and he was Belgian. We never met in person, but we used to spend hours   each day confiding in each other about our life problems, our nerdy   interests, etc. We used to talk about how cool it would be if we could   one day meet in person, and we used to talk about all the science   experiments we would do together if we ever one day met in person.

This   June, I was scammed out of $1500 while searching for an apartment. I   told a few online and IRL friends about the incident, including Marc. My   friendship with Marc had felt mutual at the beginning, but around  April  or May, he had gotten super obsessed with a girl he met. He would   always talk about his sex life and sexual fantasies. Before the  scamming  incident, I didn't mind listening to him talk about this girl.  I was  always there to offer advice and offer support every time he  wanted to  talk about this girl. But when I was spending hours in the  police  station and calling my bank to deal with the scamming incident,  he only  said ""I'm sorry"" and then went back to obsessively talking  about how  this girl thought he had sex appeal. It felt very wrong for  someone I  considered my best friend to talk about how much a girl  thought he had  sex appeal when I was dealing with such a big problem in  my life. Even  online friends and IRL friends I considered less close  were much quicker  to offer support than Marc.

I  was  very angry and disappointed. I told Marc how I felt, and he  apologized.  I forgave him. We went back to our normal friendship for a  while and  continued talking everyday. He and the girl later became  boyfriend and  girlfriend, and he would continue talking about her.  After the scamming  incident, I didn't mind because I had less to deal  with.

A  few days ago, he said to  me, ""Best of luck at UC Berkeley Law."" I'm  going to law school this  fall, but I am not going to UC Berkeley. I'm  going to UC Irvine. I got  into UC Irvine in January and I accepted the  offer in April. I've been  messaging him about UC Irvine Law on a weekly  basis since April. I took  photos of campus visits,  talked about zoom  chats with classmates,  etc. When he said UC Berkeley Law, I felt very  uncomfortable. I thought  about the scamming incident again, and I felt  as though he hadn't  really been paying attention to anything I've said  since April because  he was too obsessed with his fantasies. When I told  him I felt  uncomfortable, he responded, ""That's not fair. I'm not even  American.  UC Berkeley is the only California school I knew before  meeting you.  These school names are all abstract to me. I don't know the  difference  between these schools.""

If  a  different online friend who didn't live in the same country and whom I   spoke with less frequently said ""UC Berkeley,"" I would have forgotten   about it. However, I know I talked to him about UC Irvine Law frequently   at least since April (possibly even earlier because I was accepted in   January). As I mentioned earlier, we had been speaking everyday since   July 2019. I was very disappointed because I considered him my best   friend, and I thought this was a detail that close friends would   naturally care enough to pay attention to. I am not Belgian, and I   remember what college he graduated from and little details about his   life because I pay attention to what he says in conversations.

From a young child I was exploring a lot and seeing a lot of different videos and hearing a lot of things boys in my primary school would say about wanting islands full of women they can have sex with etc, I was probably around 10 at this time and constantly interested in sex and getting aroused from a lot of things. 

As I got into highschool it progressed into me being used and manipulated by many boys which was partly my fault as I could’ve just not done it but I was an attention seeker and still was until around a few months ago, probably last year. I would sexualise myself at the age of 12. I was in year 8 and had a boyfriend who was going into year 11 (I was 12 turning 13 he was 15 turning 16). He would touch me and I would say “no” laughing and he wouldn’t stop. I went to a boys house after school because I was too scared to get the bus when everybody else was there, he grabbed my boob, I can’t remember if he asked or not. Months before this I had boyfriend at the time spread naked images of me round school twice, I had a lot of boyfriends and I was bullied for being a “slag” despite not having had sex yet. I sent a lot of people photos but due to bullying left my highschool and moved to another one at the age of 13.

I had decided at the time if I was going to be known as a “slag” I would embrace it. It’s disgusting I know. I lost my virginity as soon as I started that school to my now boyfriends ex best friend. I sent a lot of photos to people, I was “proud” . I had a boyfriend for 11 months and I cheated on him a lot over social media, he wasn’t a good person but I still feel disgusting about being a cheater. A boy touched me and I froze. We broke up and I sent photos to a few other people for attention. 

A month or two later I have my now boyfriend, he’s amazing. He has helped me a lot, I would lie about smoking/smoking weed and he almost left me but I fixed it and getting over depression. I enjoyed attention off boys still but never thought about it until the past few months. I told him all my past and how I would want him to be jealous (because I thought he was really out of my ‘league’, I still do think he is but don’t do things for attention anymore) which is immature, I enjoyed when his friends would flirt with me because it felt nice to get attention and I was very insecure and felt bad that his mates probably didn’t say “your bird is fit” when they went out. I did things for attention that meant nothing at the time and mean nothing now, never ever cheated and never ever would however I’m convinced I have and I don’t deserve someone like him. ever since I met my boyfriend I knew I wanted to be with him. I have never thought about this stuff until around a month ago, he said he understood it was for my ego but I feel disgusting about it. I was never and would never be unfaithful however convincing myself I am/have been. He says he doesn’t care about my past and he understands it was for myself. I feel disgusting  and I’m having a lot of intrusive thoughts,sexual and from past and I get very nervous when we’re going to have sex and I am convinced I’m a horrible disgusting person. 

I hate how I used to be so sexual at such a young age, I wish I didn’t have a phone, I wish I didn’t want attention, I wish I was smarter, I wish I went to a different school, i wish I didn’t want attention, I wish I was never who I was, I wish I didn’t think being sexual was cool. I am not proud of my body anymore, I hate being proud of it or wanting it to show it feels like I’m just doing it all for attention, it feels like even if I just look at a boy I’m cheating I feel so stressed I haven’t done anything wrong as nothing meant anything. yet feel I don’t deserve to clean myself, take care of myself, eat, drink.

I hate having a woman’s body and I wish I was a man I wouldn’t have gone through any of this. I absolutely hate myself and I see no way out, I fucking love my boyfriend but I feel like I don’t deserve him and every single day I think about it and I don’t know how to stop. I don’t want to be who I am or be sexualised or be hot or good looking. The other day I got called a “lad” and it felt nice i felt no pressure. I am so confused as to what’s happening, I love my boyfriend but I hate myself and how I’m living. Please help anyone, I know it may sound crazy or weird or whatever but I don’t know what’s going on please. I’m disgusting.",11Jul2020,1
985,"Background: I'm 17 and I dont have a car, license, or a job. I am going to go to a couple interviews this week tho, and I'm positive one of them will hire me because I have really good references. I want to save up for a car from my job money and then some. I dont have my license right now tho, but my mom has set me up to drive with this nice lady who's gonna teach me. If I get one of the jobs and work it this summer and part-time thru 12th grade, and I get my license, could I move out?? Is there like a loan poor kids can take out?? I just really need to get away from my Mom before she completely ruins our relationship, my mental health, and herself. I also want to stop being so dependent on her so that she cant hold it against me. I'm afraid tho if i act how i really feel around her she'll cut me off from the driving lessons (shes not paying tho bc the lady said no payment is needed, so maybe i could still take them?) And also i dont have a car to drive to my job, or my license, so my getting to work is dependent on her. She's honestly probably going to make me lose my job when I get it because shes always late and I have to force her out of bed. That's why I think I'm gonna just drive myself even tho I only have my permit. I'm not gonna lose my job because of her. Maybe I could live with a friend and pay half of the rent/upkeep during highschool?? 

Also I plan on going to college, is it possible to have a job and also go to college? If I work part time could I make enough money to pay rent (I'd probably have to live with someone else so I could afford it) car insurance, gas, and some food while also attending college?? 

I dont care how hard I have to work as long as I can get away from the house and I'm not completely dead tired everyday. Even then tho, I could just drink coffee and remind myself why I'm doing it.",11Jul2020,1

988,"Hey, so I'm a male 30s and I'm been speaking to a nice girl (mid 20s) we've been getting on well but I'm not sure if I'm physically attracted to her that much yet. Looks aren't a huge thing for me so I thought I'd suggested maybe going out, hang out together and see how it goes.

My idea was kind of to just go with the flow, and if it doesn't work out oh well. But she's told her mates she's really into me and keeps talking about future date ideas which I thought were just jokes but it now appears not. I've also found out she is a virgin, I am from Toronto, so it's uncommon for people to be virgins in there mid 20s. 

This has kind of freaked  me out, and I'm not sure I can hang out with her anymore because I don't want to be that person to take her virginity when I'm being so laisse faire about it all, but then I do think she's a nice girl aswell and cool to chat too.

So what do you suggest i do?",11Jul2020,1
989,"Hi! I've never had a stray cat scenario - and have never owned a cat in my adult life - but for almost a year a precious Calico has been visiting us regularly, even before I started putting food out for her. She warmed up quickly and (sometimes) let's us pet and even hold her.

I've grown super fond of her and it's at least kind of mutual. Any recommendations on how to care for her? She stayed in my basement (because my housemates have two cats) last night because there was an awful storm and she was out back soaking wet. She was purring a lot.

Anyway, I don't think she's too fond of the food my housemates get for their cats. Are cats sometime picky with food? Is it dumb to toy around with taking her in, at least part time?

992,I broke up with my boyfriend a couple of months ago and we agreed that maybe one day we would get back together but during the break I got drunk one night at a party and kissed a boy. The kiss meant nothing because the dude was just horny and wanted someone to make out with. I felt extremely guilty about it after even though me and my ex were not together. The weekend after my ex wanted to talk and hang out and I agreed but I didn’t know that he wanted to get back together with me. I still really really like my ex but I don’t know if I should tell him about the boy I kissed. Also the boy at the party will not stop texting me and asking me to hang out and FaceTime but I do not like him and it was just one kiss and I don’t know what to tell him. There is going to be a party in the future my ex and that boy are in the same room and I do not want him to get hurt or upset if he finds out I kissed this guy. this sucks.,11Jul2020,1

997,"I'm in teen age and I have this since I remember. It makes me aroused when someone is expressing sympathy towards me, is worried about me (particularly in terms of health, be it physical or mental), or expresses their love towards me (or is too kind).

For instance, when I made a post on r/selfharm months ago about starting, I got over 80 comments and there was a lot of ""please don't do it"" etc. and I was hard almost 24 hours without a break (I don't cut now). Or when some person was saying good things about me (you're so nice etc).

It's obvious why it's a terrible characteristic. I am trying to be careful about this, but it sometimes makes me pretend that I'm feeling worse than I really am (not only to others, but also to me myself) and I'm sometimes feeling bad about not feeling bad :D

Most of my applicants where female, so i deiced to go ahead and interview the one who i felt would have been a great asset to our team.  interview goes well, and i bring her in for a training shift and she exceeded my expectations.

the owner, who saw her amazing work ethic, even told her that her probably has job and a final choice would be made the next day. 

As soon as i come in the next day, he told me to let her go, because ""we don't need women in here"". I was so furious, i quit.  I'm not willing to work for someone like that.

999,"I  am  actually the SM in this situation.
My concern is for my fiancé(bio-dad) and my SD.

Bottom line, my SD’s bio-mom is a narcissist. She abandoned the kids with my fiancé twice to go sleep with or start another life with other men but, now that she is settled again, she’s been trying to do what she usually does and tries to find ways to get the kids back from my fiancé before they graduate highschool. They are ages 9 and 7 currently.

She threatened a whole bunch of stuff one year ago, which forced us to lawyer up and fight for my fiancé’s rights. And he won!
In a state that usually favors the mother, he got custodial parent and she has to pay him $25 a month.

The point I’m getting to is, she now what’s to give the 9 year old a phone. We were able to disable this stupidity because she’s 9 years old, dosnt need and had tried to do stuff recently behind both their back before and decided she wasn’t mature enough to handle the phone or keep herself safe.
We are relatively safe from this until she’s probably 12-13 but, my fear is the only reason BIo-mom is pushing so hard for a phone is to work with SD to build “evidence” to get her to live with bio-mom.
And I don’t k ow to what extent this will reach. Will it just be a bunch of over the top, exaggerated texts from SD to bio-mom?
Will she she actually try to coerce SD into doing certain things to make her bio-dad look abusive?

And how do we defend ourselves against this sort of thing?

She eventually will have to have a phone and if it wasn’t for her bio-mom, I would t be near as worried.
 
Is there a special phone we need to get?
Should we allow SD or bio-mom to buy phone so, we are not legally responsible?
Are there ways to know what’s being said between her and her mother?

Any info would be much appreciated.",11Jul2020,1

1004,"So for 15 years of my life, since the age of 4 I have been beaten and emotional abused by my parents. The amount of things they have done to me is a never-ending list. I always hated it when they hurt my younger siblings so I basicly became their human shield. As I got older I tried to push through my issues and set aside my anger and disappointment to make sure my parents became better people. And after years they finally almost have. It's unbelievable how much they have changed in 6 years. At least to sme it is. They still hold to certain things, but those are beyond me.

Now that they are better parents they treat my younger siblings better. I am happy to see that, but recently I went on a trip with the family and I realised how much better they're lives are and will be.

I thought it would make happy to see them having a better live, but it honestly has made me envious. Like I lost so much for this and I don't think it's making happy. I feel like I wastedy time doing something ""good"", but lost so much for it. There is also the part where I promise not to share my horrible past to them. In return my parents would be better.

1006,"I have been contemplating whether to post and share my issues and inner thoughts on this sub or anywhere to be specific. I'm a Bengali Male 18 heading off to college.  I immigrated to the US when I was 5. I want to start of by saying that I respect my parents and I know how much they left behind to give me a good life and the amount of work they put in for me. I also understand why parents must be strict and harsh to their children from time to time. 

Backstory:

My father was a definition of a Tiger ""Mom""(Dad). Very strict, emotionless, only school, only studying, no fun. He is an extreme extrovert and has so much fun hanging out with family and friends out in public and their houses. However when he is home that energy is entirely drained. He acted emotionless towards my mother and me. I did seek his attention by trying to gain good grades and getting into certain schools but he always compared me to other people and bashed me in front of his friends as a ""joke"" but to me it didn't feel like that growing up. I did try and confront him about it but to no avail. Later as I grew and realized more of his behaviors I noticed he was stubborn. No matter what he couldn't be wrong. He was the man of the house and I had to be a man too. I understood that as he had old world values but whenever I would be helping him or give random advice or ""fun"" facts because I'm nerdy like that he would get pissed. ""Don't teach me, don't tell me what to do"". He would get pissed at me very easily. Despite all that I was still grateful to him for the financial support he gave me which let me hang out with friends and play games. Counting all this my nail in the coffin that started my resentment towards him was when I came out about my suicidal intentions and how I was depression. He reaction was not expected. He got angry like I've never seen before. He told me why I was depressed. That I can't be depressed. That I should just stop being depressed. He treated it like it was being sad. He said that I can't go die because I need to go to college. In that moment I lost all faith in him in the fact that he can provide me emotional support. I secretly went to therapy with the aid of my school's therapy and anti suicide office which they had luckily(it was a high standard/workload and past incidents happened before). Two years later from that event I asked him the same question about depression hoping for a different response as he was actually being supportive and emotional towards me and my mother. However the response was the exact same and I realized he hadn't changed. 

Problem:

As I get closer and closer to college I am slowly starting to hate myself as my actions are becoming just like my father. I'm losing my care free attitude and becoming short tempered and aggressive. Aswell as seeking attention to the point of even forcing it from others just like how my father does in public events. I am becoming scared that I will become like him when I grow up because despite all my efforts not trying to be what he wanted me to be his behaviors still rubbed of on me and I am lost at the moment.

1011,"Ok TLDR at the bottom 

I work at a small-ish restaurant in Texas. Over the past 6ish months that I’ve worked there, we’ve cycled through a fair number of employees, and had a switch in GMs. We’re really struggling to find people to stay with the job, and two of our employees are seasonal, and will be leaving to go back to college soon. Everyone who works in my location in 17-23, aside from the owner who steps in to check on things regularly. 

I’ve recently been offered a promotion to shift lead, mostly in part to a particular manager (M) hyping me up to the GM. This past week, a new girl (let’s call her S) started working with us. She also works at a popular coffee chain that is commonly known as a tough job. From my experience with S, I would say that she’s got great work ethic, a good personality for customer service, and she learns amazingly quickly. She seems like a great candidate for a long term employee. 

For some reason, M has taken issue with her, even going so far as to be mean to S’s face. M &amp; the GM are what I would consider friends. So when M decides she doesn’t like someone, GM generally trusts her judgement and the person (who doesn’t know that they’re being spoken against) eventually quits due to bullying or gets fired for a minor issue. This is, in my opinion, why we’ve lost so many employees over these past few months. 

S and I had coffee a few days ago because she was having a rough day with her personal life. I could tell she really needed someone so we met up and talked for several hours about work, and life in general. The general vibe I get from S is that she’s an honest person who just wants to live her life. S told me about the things M has said to her, and then hours or a day or so later, GM comes and offers similar criticism. Then, today while I was at work I heard M and another employee talking about S behind her back, mocking her for being proud of her success at the coffee shop and talking down on her work ethic and things of that sort. 

In the past, the GM has asked me to come to her with issues that occur when she’s not around. And over time, I feel like we’ve built a little bit of rapport and that she generally takes my words into consideration. I would really like to speak up about what I heard while working today, and vouch for S a little bit, but I also don’t want to get on M’s bad side and possibly lose the promotion I’m training for, or just have an uncomfortable working situation. 

Should I speak to my GM about this? If so, what do I say? The atmosphere at work and with my GM is very casual, so a text would be well within character for us to communicate. 

TLDR: I’m worried a manager is bullying a new employee after possibly bullying a handful of employees off the job. We need people now more then ever. How do I approach my GM? Or should I even speak with her?",11Jul2020,1

1014,"TW: Pedophilia

Here's the situation:

When I was like... 11-13 my dad would molest me in various ways. After he stopped I blocked it out of my memory. Something triggered that memory like 9 months ago just before I turned 17 and I've been acting hostile towards him as being around him doesn't make me feel safe. And there are little things he still does like smack or squeeze my butt or grab the sides of my arms so I can't do anything but stand there while he shakes me back and forth to see my boobs shake. I can't just tell him to stop because he's always done it and that's our family's ""normal.""  
He's also manipulative and gaslighting. He verbally abuses my little brother and treats my mom like shit. When you bring up a concern or disagree with him at all he does this thing where he lures you into saying what he wants you to say so you can't say (or forget) your argument and makes you think that he's right even when he's not, and even when you know he's not you just can't keep arguing without looking like an idiot. And he hides behind this guise of ""It's not that I don't care or that I'm trying to make you look like an idiot, it's that I put that information out there and you connected those dots yourself."" He utterly refuses to do anything around the house. He comes home and plays his video games, and when I ask him every night what he wants for dinner, he gets mad at me for interrupting his game. When I wait, he gets mad at me for not cooking earlier, and when I decide what to cook on my own, he gets mad at me for not making what he wanted for dinner. He wakes me up at 3 am sometimes to make me do his laundry because he never does it himself and he's out of business shirts for work the next day and ""Sorry I forgot to tell you to do my laundry earlier but I need it.""  
Years ago my mom finally got diagnosed with all her stuff and got medication that she needed. But it took time for that medication to fully work. She told him she couldn't cook and clean and take care of everyone herself and that she would need help. She also told him that if he needed sex so bad he could get a side bitch because sex was physically painful for her. (It's around this time that I think he started to molest me.) Instead of helping, he made me cook and do the laundry and clean the house. On one hand that's not so bad because they were important skills to learn but he only did it so that he wouldn't have to after mom explicitly asked him to. He's honestly insufferable and impossible to live with. My mom is on a stance of ""Ignore him and tell him what he wants until he leaves you alone."" I don't put up with as much shit as her so me and him get into more fights, especially since I recovered that bullshit repressed memory.  
I never considered telling him no or telling anyone what he did because the most important thing we learned as kids was to never *ever* say no to dad no matter what. **""I don't care if you're on fire, you do what I tell you.""** My hesitance with telling anyone now what happened is that I personally know women that have been raped and assaulted. Many. None got their 'abuser' for lack of a better term, arrested, except for *one*. She was raped by her dad, who had been previously been arrested for abuse. And they put him in prison and she went to another school. She came back the next year, and we were horrified to find out that it was because they had let her dad out and she was living with him again. If I tell anybody, I don't have evidence and it wasn't recently. Nobody will believe me and it might put me in danger with my dad.  


I'm 17, and I worked my ass off in high school to graduate a year early. I did! This June I graduated with a 3.8 GPA. :) I was planning to do dorms to get out of the house, but in the process of enrollment, I got to financial aid and realized that in the process of the stress from early graduation, I forgot college costs money. I didn't apply for scholarships. So the financial aid I was offered was a covid waver, a student loan thing for like 7,000 out of the 20,000 dollars needed for tuition, and a loan my parents had to take out. My parents can't take out a loan because their credit is awful. I can't take out my own student loans because I'm under 18, I can only take the $7,000 one offered to me. I literally can't afford college. So we decided on a community college that's half the price, which isn't a big deal to me, idc. But I don't want to wait another 2 years while I get my associates degree to get out of this house. I don't know what to do. My parents would never just let me leave or go live with a friend. I hate it here. My dad is so hateful and my mom ""Isn't ready to talk about"" the idea of leaving my dad. What can I even do...",11Jul2020,1
1015,"So, I have an account on an art site with a small following. Around a month ago, someone asked me for a commission, said he sent me money via paypal, but nothing arrived. I told him that it hadn't arrivved, and PayPal usually processes this stuff right away. He offered to trade art, which when I declined since I didn't want to trade art with a stranger who has no art in their account, they flipped out on me. They sent me dozens of pissed off messages, on several alt accounts once I blocked them.

I managed to get them kicked off the site once they made an account very blatently to harass me, and everything was cool for a month.

However, recently I got a DM from someone asking for a commission, I sent them my paypal link so they could sent over payment. I got no response for an hour, then a friend messaged me saying that the person who had harrassed me had posted something.

They made a post with my full name and email address, and a link to my art page. The moderation team took it down quick, and that wasn't a massive deal. What's annoying is now, he keeps on spamming my PayPal with money requests over and over again, and has even signed up to one of those ""family tree"" websites with my email and name (not that it did much, since I just changed the password the second I got the email telling me the account was made).

What should I do? Can he really do anything malicious besides spam me for a few days till he gets bored and leaves again? I'm pretty sure that this is going to be at best annoying, and (hopefully) nothing actually bad will come of it, but any advice is appreciated!

TLDR: Guy pissed cause I didn't give him free art, has my email/name.",11Jul2020,1

1017,"I feel like an asshole. I feel like a bad partner because he is struggling with depression and I don't know what to do.

His negativity sucks the life out of me and our relationship. It's suffocating. I know he needs me now more than ever, but I'm tired everyone.

Let me paint the picture. We've been dating for a LONG TIME. I know him better than he knows himself. This depression is nothing new, only intensified by the quarantine. He gets so angry and so cold...there is such little intimacy...and I know these are just a few consequences of dealing with depression. I'm not saying it is bad, just the reality of our situation right now.

Meanwhile I am suffering with my own feelings of depression and self worth...all which seems secondary to his. 

So I try to be present. I try to listen. I try to not discuss how I feel the depression is impacting us, but I feel like I am breaking. I feel like I can't hold him and myself up. I feel alone and I feel terrible that I can't do more to help.

We don't really argue because I don't have the energy. I just don't have the energy anymore. 

By know means do I want to leave because I think he needs me, I just don't know how to be there for him and him for me. I don't think he can give me much of anything right now and that hurts. 

I try to be understanding but the truth is I miss him. I miss us. I miss having a fun afternoon laughing and enjoying each other's company. I miss being intimate. 

I feel horrible for feeling this way. Even writing it makes me want to delete it but I am at a lost.

I am worried what was once a beautiful relationship is crumbling. I feel like I lost control and now I feel like I am chasing him to be with me which sucks.

Am I selfish for wanting to be chased too? Does it make me a bad person for just wanting him back? I don't know.

He is unwilling to seek therapy. He closes himself off to me. When I try to speak to him, it usually results in an HUGE argument. To be fair, I don't know why those conversations escalate but I won't put the blame on him for that. Maybe it's my approach? 

I feel lost and like this relationship will end. Those are not things that I want. But I also want to be happy and work on my mental health. 

Maybe this is an ""Am I the asshole post"". I don't know.

Tonight is date night and was so excited to plan it yesterday and now today it's up to me. I want to feel wanted too but maybe that is unrealistic when someone is depressed and I need to try to be more understanding.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",11Jul2020,1
1018,"That's basically it, we broke up like 3 or 4 months ago, he's already talking to some random girl and I'm still here and I swear to God I tried to move on but it's just too fucking hard cause I love him!

That I still love him and blá blá blá, of course he didn't want to get back together, I'm so stupid. I just don't understand, I really tried to be the perfect girlfriend, really, I read all the things men usually complain about in their relationship, lack of love, no compliments, lack of support, feeling like they have the obligation to protect and care but the girl never does the same so I decided to be different, I was the most loving girlfriend, always complimenting him supporting him, making him feel safe and loved, I cooked for him, I would search for things he liked such as animes and mangas so I could talk to him about that, every tv show he started to watch I would watch as well so he would have someone to talk about it. I read a huge manga more than 300 books magazines? I don't know how you call it, of course I didn't do entirely for him, when I didn't like something I would drop of but usually I liked. 

I'm super sad, not even joking, why is it so easy for him to find another person and I'm here stuck like an idiot? Madly in love with someone who doesn't love me back?

1024,"I am from California and I attend a small college, of around 4 thousand students, in Pennsylvania that has a nearly 900 cases of COVID within a 5 mile radius in the surrounding neighborhood. They are offering students the opportunity to return to campus this fall under the condition that students wear masks, restrict their interactions, and follow social distancing guidelines. Although students will be able to return to campus, all classes will be available online with some in-person courses. Those who cannot make these in person courses have the opporitnity to watch the class live on zoom. No one is required to return as all classes will be online.

Right now it just seems as if I am running into a burning building if I decide to go back. After all COVID-19 is heavily contagious. I know students will continue to have parties. My friend was telling me that several frats already have one planned for September when they return. This past week alone Berkley got 47 new cases of COVID-19 because of a frat party. It's my senior year and I want to see my friends before I graduate. Not to mention the time difference will be a bitch. I know I'm young and I probably won't die from Corona so am I fool for deciding not to return in the fall? Did I miss out on my senior year for unfounded fears of catching the virus?

1025,"Ever since I was a kid, I loved horror movies, books, games, etc. I also love thrill rides, spicy food, and generally very stimulating, exciting things. I have two theories about this. The good theory is that I grew up in a traumatic and highly stressful home as a child, and that level of stress is actually a normal or comfortable state where I have something to focus on and I’m not alone with my own thoughts. The other is that I’m some kind of sick, twisted, psychopathic person. People tell me I’m kind, empathetic, and gentle. That’s how I hope to be and try to be.

1026,"This is a question that's been haunting me for the last few weeks, but i guess some back story is required.

My parents have always had high expectations for me, making me revise for my GCSEs up to 7 hours a day and not allowing me to see friends during this time. They told me this is becauseI don't put in enough effort and my grades aren't good enough (i was still achieveing 7-9s despite missing 2 years of school)

When i was in the depths of an eating disorder they would constantly remind me how they couldn't afford me to be throwing up what I ate and how its selfish to waste their money that way. They'd tell me I wasn't eating enough and then days later call me greedy for eating, which greatly impacts my relationship with food even now.

In february i came out to them as a transgender male and it all went down hill from there. My Dad keeps telling me theres something wrong with me and I'm mentally I'll for ""thinking im a man"", i spend a lot of time in my room because i want to avoid confrontations with him yet he'll come in my room and call me an invalid, ask me if I'm physically disabled as well as mentally since i spend so much time in bed.

 He suggested that anyone finding me attractive would be perverted and wrong. He scares me when he shouts and i often start to cry, when this happens  i try to hide it because he'll shout at me for crying. ""Awww not this again. why are you crying?"" ""Oh is this the wounded soldier act"" ""careful not to trip over your bottom lip"", so I'll walk away and try to hide it, which will lead to me being called disrespectful and ungrateful. They invalidate my emotions and identity.

something that hit me a bit harder was when he stared at me for a few seconds before saying ""Go to your room because just looking at you makes me feel sick.""

Apologies if this was a bit rambly, it barely covers half of what happens and doesn't really include mother, but i guess what I'm trying to ask is... Would you call this abuse? A friend mentioned it and i don't know what to think, so could you perhaps offer some advice as to at her this would be classed as some form of abuse? and if so... do i say something?",11Jul2020,1
1027,"I'm 22 and have never had a girlfriend. I had terrible acne as a teen and have horrible scars now that killed my confidence for years but I'm getting better now. This year I told myself while living at home I would go downtown more and try new things but corona kinda killed that.

I still try to talk to strangers when I go rock climbing but I feel like I shouldn't rely on just meeting someone there. That could take a long time.

So instead I started using dating apps and have improved my conversational skills a bit but can never make the jump to actual ask someone out. It just seems like a massive jump for me and I never feel like I know the person well enough to do it. I want wherever we go on a first date to be somewhere I feel comfortable so it is easier but so many cool places are closed down. It is mostly just bars and restaurants open.

I don't talk to that many girls in real life so I want that experience before making this jump. I was hoping to get that experience by doing things like cooking/pottery classes and maybe yoga but meetup.com is a barren wasteland right now.

Is it reasonable to delete all my dating apps and work on myself physically, mentally, and professionally, for the next 8-10 months while corona keeps going? I mean at this point what difference does it make if I wait until I'm 23 to be in a relationship.

I have never considered them as a friend since we have 0 same interests and they have no hobbies or passions, and literally don’t do anything that I like or anything at all apart from school &amp; video games (and not the kind of video games that I like). 

We had a group chat that was dead since the beginning of March (or around when corona started). They left it all at the same time about a week or so ago, without saying anything. I didn’t care coz I knew they (3 of them) already had another group chat and I honestly didn’t mind. 

But then they added me to theirs and talked about how I must be confused that they left, they feel like I don’t wanna hangout with them, that they don’t interest me, etc. which is true (I know this sounds very mean, but all they are are classmates to me only). 

Idk is it because of the virus or what but my mental health is doing quite badly right now, and I am in a hermit phase where I just want to be alone and do my hobbies and not really go out or meet anyone. So I really do not want to go out with them. 

All they wanna do is go shopping/ for a coffee and I am really not interested. 

I know people will say that I should be honest and just say it, but I am not brave enough and I don’t want to hurt their feelings or want things to be awkward if I see them at school again.

1035,"I have been friends with F since university, and been friends for about 3 years, during those years we’ve became so close. We knew a lot about each other, and have been in contact almost everyday. After we graduated we found jobs, but ended up in different places. Despite this, I felt that we’d still be close. And this was true for the first year since university, we talked on the regular and still kept up to date about our lives. 

However, recently, I feel as though we’ve been drifting apart. F wouldn’t really start conversations anymore, and when I take the initiative to ask open ended questions, they wouldn’t really reciprocate. It just feels as though they are upset at me, but I have no clue as to why. And I don’t want to ask because I hate confrontation, and feel like it would open up alot of things that I feel aren’t related to why they are ignoring me.

1037,"Before I start I just want to say that I have never made a Reddit post and I am unaware of any format I should take.

So I am truly unsure of how to start this. I have contemplated writing this for months now and I don't know what to do. I genuinely shaking and riddled with fear by posting this.

So a short autobiography of me: I am a student who is deemed quiet and shy by my parents and teachers. I've always been awkward interacting and conversing with people, it is honestly pathetic how bad I am with it. The awkward silence between trying to talk to someone is soul shattering, it scares me. I have become so introverted that I avoid any interaction with people at any cost. I have also developed a distaste of people in general (Not that there is anything relatively wrong with someone, I just don't like them).

While in school I would usually hang out with this specific group of friends that I've known for 10 plus years of my life (Plus new ones). However, I've always felt as though I am cast aside from them. Am don't really know how to put it in words, I am just unnoticed I suppose. When growing up I would always see them in xbox 360 party chats together and my absence from them was never really questioned. As typical as it may seem I would be the kid who was never picked for sports and had to be assigned to a group by the teacher, I was always ''that'' loner kid.

I don't want to sound too ungrateful, I was invited to hang out and to parties when I was younger but that is never really the case anymore. As we all grew older I became more distant to them, especially now. They created new friends and people to talk to that they seem to have more fun with then me. No one really talks to me, and if they do it is usually out of pity because they feel bad for me, it is never because they 𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐮𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐥𝐲 want to talk to me or are interested with what I have to say. They would only ever talk to me if there was no one else around, and once there was they would leave me.

I think because of this I developed some sort of an ego and thought I was better than everyone else and when I was not I became angry, I mistook isolation for independence. I would find it funny to see people having fun with their friends and anyone who was not alone like me were idiots. I began to prefer to be alone (I still do) to the point where I found it boring talking to people.

Now lets go back a couple of months ago, just as quarantine started. Everything was fine, I would wake up do my school work and that was that until curiosity took over me, I would check our discord to see them all in a call. I would want to join but I always chose not to, I though ''I never have anything to talk about anyways, they wont care'', and I think I was right. Months have gone by now and none of them have questioned ''Huh? I wonder what is up with \[My Name\], I wonder if he is okay?''. As that one quote goes ''If your absence isn't questioned then your presence never matter'' (Or something like that).

I would always be the last though on someones mind, none of my friends have cared to talk to me in anyway. But I suppose I do the same, I have nothing particularly interesting about myself that anyone would take notice in. Not a single one, even after like 6 months, have questioned my absence, not even the one friend that I thought would. 

I guess this is what I deserve though, I am not nice or kind, I have an ego, I hate people, I hate people who are better than me and there is not a lot that is likable about me. I am not sure if it because of this ''friend'' situation or something else but I have developed this prolonged sadness that gloom over me, I haven't been genuinely happy in a while. My average emotions range from sadness, anger or I don't care about anything whatsoever. I just feel terrible all the time, I've given up on most of my dreams at this point and I just want it to end. I think of the future and I am just filled with rage, annoyance, sadness and so many negative emotions. I have contemplated suicide and I don't know what to do. 

I feel absolutely horrible, don't get me wrong, I literally have almost everything I could ever want: I have food on the table, a loving family, all the games and junk that I could ever want. But no matter what I feel awful, I just want to go to sleep forever. When I have these though I begin to feel even worse because you would think that with this loving family etc. I would be extremely happy but I am not, I feel extremely guilty for having these thoughts, I SHOULD NOT FEEL THIS WAY. I just want to punch a wall, I don't care. 

Before or If anyone says ''talk to someone like a parent or something'' I would never, I am never telling my parents anything about this and that is fact, nothing will change my mind. I don't trust them or anyone to this extent, I have a fear that they would tell someone else. I have put on this false facade of happiness when interacting with people and sometimes I can't keep it up. That is why I am writing this online anonymously, I want to talk to someone who does not have a biased opinion of me. 

The only reason I haven't done anything to myself yet is because it would all be to waste. I am scared for the suffering to transfer to my family. Also all this money that my family has invested into me will go to waste, I can't allow that. Everything they've done to me will go to waste, I can't allow them to suffer like this. But........... I just can't. I am probably going to delete this soon because I have an overarching fear that somehow this will be tracked back to my real self and if that were to happen I don't know if I will be able to control these thoughts. 

I don't know, it just feels like I am wasting my and other people's time at this point. I know it sounds selfish but I am so sick of seeing people respond to this situations with ''Hey... it get's better, you have to cross the storm to see the rainbow'' it just sickens me. 

May someone talk to me? I am sorry if I wasted your time.",11Jul2020,1
1038," Like most of the time I don't see myself as a good person. I can't know if this is just self loathing or I am really a bad person and that is the reason I don't have close friends. I don't want to ask my parents as they will give my an expected answer because I'm there son.
So what can I do?",11Jul2020,1
1039,"Luckily, I’m about to go to college. Unluckily, I can’t get my sleep schedule back on track for that time. 

I’m a light sleeper, so I tend to wake up early. On top of that, I always manage to pull myself out of dreams because I might think too hard about something, and then I wake up. That, or my mother’s knee injury keeps her from letting the dogs outside to do their business in the morning, and so she calls me to do that around 6-7 am. After I wake up, I usually can’t get back to sleep.

Because of COVID, my sister moved back into the family house. My mother and sister have always had a strong (questionably codependent) bond. Whenever my sister has even the slightest emotional issue or anything to rant about in terms of boys, or friends, or feelings, etc, she rushes to my mother’s room to chat. Sometimes I think it must be that the walls are thin, but I can hear every word she AND my mother say with extreme clarity. They stay up and talk in intervals usually, but the talks begin anywhere from around 7-9pm and last until 2-3 am, sometimes with a brief 20 or so minute break. Neither my mother, whose hearing is going imho, nor my sister ever learned to control their voices. They’re both easily excitable and easily aggravated. They talk all night, at least 4 or 5 times a week.

Recently, my mother told me that I had to start sleeping at a proper time. She went full-out scolding. (At the start of quarantine, she often got after herself and my sister for their bad sleeping habits, but this waned as time went on.) She said that I needed to be more responsible since school was starting, tho I regularly have all my lights out at around 10:30 pm. 

I’ve told her countless times that I can’t sleep because of her endless talking. (If it’s not with my sister, it’s with my Great Uncle over the phone whose hearing is more than certainly going, as he’s never on speaker but I can still hear him. He’s also terribly lonely and if he begins talking, he will not stop.) 

In response, she told me to buy ear plugs. I have done this countless times. I can still hear them. My last box, she threw away while we were cleaning together to get ready to pack up for the move to college. Currently, since my mom quit her job so she could move to the state where my sister and I will be attending college, we’re right on money, and we can’t spend money on anything more than the essentials either. 

I’ve tried earplugs, music, white noise, and even sleeping on the couch. The music worked alright, but my earphones always break, and we’re in a tough spot to be buying anything right now. I just really, really need sleep and I don’t know what else to do.

tl;dr my family talks loudly all night and I can’t sleep—my circadian rhythm is incredibly out of whack. If anyone has any ideas about how I can get to sleep faster, or broach the situation with y family, I would greatly appreciate it 😞🙏🏻",11Jul2020,1
1040,"So basically, the problem is pretty self explanatory by the title , i have found myself hearing sniffles of my sisters cries at night, shes been doing this for 4 months(when I discovered it) . I cannot think of any reason why , during the day she seems completely fine and is usually in a ‘fun’ mood where she teases me and makes jokes with me . Shes in a happy relationship and met her boyfriend today and meets him like once a week or so.
                                                           my siblings  and I do have dad issues( dad was a money hungry A-hole who would leave permanently live with his mother and leave wife  and his children alone, would visit regularly and stay temporarily at their house tho , if it  weren’t for my moms job which got us a much better house and a much much better quality of life compared to my dads and his mother , despite him being a  near billionaire, we would have turned out like him , having a never ending greed for money and just storing it away and not even using it to improve our own  life. My mom didn’t divorce him because society would badmouth her daughters , they would have fights so bad they would hit each other with chairs and such and get bruises,
                              not coming to his own daughter’s birth because his mom didn’t want him too , marrying again not for love but for a free houseworker , considering his responsibility fulfilled as a father after only paying for a portion of monthly house expenses and the entire education of 1 child and university of 2nd, the 3 rd and 4 th are his wife’s responsibility if they don’t study what he wants , not going to his daughters wedding , even after she invited him, and not paying a cent for it , leaving the entire burden on my mom who just barely was able to pay for it with loans and committees, are just a few examples of his personality)                

however we openly talk about them , and i honestly do not think any of us having trauma over it because we talk about him openly and even laugh when remembering his pretty comedic stupidity and misery , my sister , if  anything ,  hates him and i cant imagine her crying secretly because of it because she’s always been someone who wears their mood on their face. She did have a little bit of mood and anger issues in her teens but she’s doing really good now and keeps them in control. 

I confronted her about her secret crying and she said it was stress relieving but for some reason it seems a bit more than that to me because she consistently does it almost every or every other night and I don’t know how to approach this ,having already confronted her once. Please give me some advice on whether I should leave it alone and if not , how should I approach and handle it.",11Jul2020,1
1041,"All she said was ""you're my son, I know you're relapsed/using, I know you're depressed, you need to speak to your psychiatrist (can't do it because of virus lockdown), you're decaying day after day.

1044,"My first love was my childhood friend (A) that lived in my town and was someone I'd talk to everyday after school on call. I had a girlfriend in university but I felt like I was still attached to A so I broke it off and we haven't spoken since. A and I both made it clear after this that we weren't talking to anyone else and we both knew we liked eachother since we were young. We never actually made anything official from that and only ever met up once in real life. She would call crying and be jealous if I added other girls on social media so I assumed we were in a relationship? 

The problem was A would use me for her university assignments and be on call constantly whilst I basically did all her reports. Once her deadlines were finished she wouldn't message me for days and just go out clubbing with people or play video games with other guys. Since I've known her from childhood and I feel like we were suppose to be together, I have a huge emotional attachment to her. We got into an argument about this, went no contact the she apologised a few months later. I forgave her) then she told me that she failed university so I did her assignments leading to her ignoring me after deadlines again. I don't know why but I think because she's my first love I'll always forgive her and want her back. 

I wanted to hurt her back emotionally as revenge when we had the 'breakup' so I downloaded a dating app where I ended up meeting this girl (B). We had loads in common which I didn't have with A and we are compatible in all levels. We were in a relationship until I broke up with her because A came back and apologised to me. I was B's first love so the breakup was really hard on her and I felt so guilty because the only reason we even dated was because I wanted revenge on A. I still talk to B everyday and meet up with her often and she has been there for me at my lowest and highest points. She cares for me a lot and I don't think I'll ever get any better than her. But I can't commit to her because of the guilt I have from how the relationship started and that I'm still not over A. I don't deserve B but she said she'll still wait for me and I don't understand why she still loves me and forgives me after I told her all of this. I feel like I'm robbing her from someone who will treat her way better than I did but I'm selfish. 

I don't know if I should commit to B as I do love her, even though A is still on my mind or do I take a break from relationships and then when I do realise who I want I can pursue it from there. I told B that if I do take a break from relationships to get over A that I don't want her to wait for me but I know she will. It makes me feel more guilty because what if I no longer want B anymore when I've had time to think and she's waited for me. 

If you were in my shoes, would you commit with B who I'd say is an all round perfect girl or talk to A again and get my mind off the 'what-ifs?'. I don't know why I'm attached to A as we had nothing in common, used me and we only met once. I think it's because since we known each other since we were young she is a big part of my life. My friends that know her tell me that she's not that type of girl to do that so should I talk to her and see if it was a misunderstanding and if we could work things out?",11Jul2020,1

1046,"So a year ago my mom left my stepdad after a emotionally abusive few years. He was kind for many years and I looked up to him. But after a stressful move he became controlling, narcissistic and cheated. He didn’t let us make decisions for ourselves or have opinions. The tipping point was at my grad party when he got a little drunk and started yelling at me in front of family that gathered there to celebrate me. My mom left him a few days later and as a result he blamed me. In the month before my mom and I moved we lived with him. He pretended I wasn’t there, ignored me and talked openly to others about how he blamed me for the divorce. It crushed me. He had been another father to me for 12 years ( my dad is still involved too) and to have him shame me and tell me I wasn’t his responsibility anymore shattered my world. The most hurtful thing was him commenting on someone post that discussed r*pe about my fathers pending trial and how I was willing to defend my dad. I didn’t talk about my dads trial publicly so it was hurtful. Since then I have met with him once with my older sister and he was polite but nothing was resolved. He says he wants to make monthly meetups and I texted him privately saying that in order for me to consider that I wanted to meet and discuss things he agreed. The thing is I have anxiety and he is very manipulative. I want an apology for what he has done but I don’t know if I can do it alone. I want to bring my boyfriend of three years, but my mom thinks he would view that as us ganging up on him. I really need some advice on how to handle this/ what to say.

I just receive this extra cash from the government exclusively. 

He hasn't taken the necessary precautions considering the pandemic, he has gatherings with his friends, and travels near cities.

1048,"We’re currently looking to buy a home and I have many questions as to what we should look out for and what we should look into. We both have families who own homes but both sides are very salt of the earth types and are very proud, not very willing to talk finances with either of us. 

Both of us are first generation college grads and are finally starting to make good money, unlike our parents who both sets have worked many many years to either acquire their homes or pay it off. We currently live in an apartment but I don’t want to get trapped in the cycle of rent payments, working towards payments on something we will never own. 

Some of the questions are: What is the best financial route to buy a house in terms of what we should look for in regard to down payments, interest rates, mortgage lengths, etc.? Second, we live in Rhode Island and the housing market here is terrible as well as in neighboring Massachusetts (which starts to get a bit pricey). We’re looking to move north to Vermont, New Hampshire or Maine, is this a good decision in regard to picking up and moving everything to somewhere completely new as well as a good financial decision?

1049,"i’m in a band, with a friend that i’ve known since high school, and he really likes to push me around. he gives me a lot of advice i didn’t ask for and don’t need, and he generally treats me like shit over small things, like not wanting to play video games, or having not seen a show. he also has a tendency to minimize his own flaws. he’s got a tendency to say very very offensive things for shock humor, but the thing is, no one finds it funny nor shocking, and it just makes him come across as fucked up or racist. he has a lot of childish behaviors as well, like anytime anything goes wrong, like now, he just leaves me on read when i try to confront him or talk to him about the issues, and he’s also been known to just flat out block me. when he gets over it we very rarely talk about what happened and he just minimizes it, or pretends it never happened. for all his flaws, i do still love him as a friend, and i would be devastated to lose both my best friend and band all at once, but i’m not sure how much more i can take of this. 
last night i was watching some movies with friends in a discord server, and i was pretty drunk. he starts trying to get people in another server to play games and says “i will make (me) get on if you guys get on” and i said “i’m busy, no you won’t” which is rare that i would stand up for myself, but drink will do that. he then PMs me telling me to just get on and i said no. then he jumps back in the server and calls me a cunt. at this point i drunkenly blow up at him in PM, telling him that he always brushes me off whenever i’m trying to do something with him, but the three whole times i’ve told him no, he freaks out and starts publicly making fun of me. i was drunk so it was a little angrier, but you get the point. instead of talking to me, or asking if i’m okay, or even just leaving it alone, he screenshots it and puts it in the server. 
this isn’t the only time he’s done stuff like this, and i’m so sick of having to deal with this man child. i don’t know wether or not i should just leave this once and for all, lose a frustrating friend and a band, and make the shitty awkward trip over to his house to pick up all my gear. or maybe just give it some time and work it out, and this make sure this doesn’t happen anymore.

How desperate I've been for attention. And that she's also had a tough life and it hurts knowing that, and that's just how it is.

1055,"I'm 18 years old and I don't have a license yet. I've had my permit for about 5 months now and I've only been able to be behind the wheel about 10 times for various amounts of time, the longest being for two hours. The problem is that I'm on medication (antipsychotics, Adderall and mood stabilizers because I am bipolar and have a history of severe anxiety and ADHD) that make my vision blurry and out of focus, as well as make me spacey, very forgetful, and always extremely tired. I've always had coordination issues, one example of this that is kind of stupid but I think captures the point is that I can't play the game ""Just Dance"" because I can't react and do the moves on the TV fast enough or figure out how to do them at all sometimes. They're not even hard moves, it's a game marketed to children. The combination of these things make it really hard to drive because for one thing, I can't react to signs or things on the road fast enough, can't seem to figure out the proper way of turning the wheel even though I've been shown so many times, (the hand over hand method I can't figure out how to make myself do) I forget what I'm supposed to be doing, I get extremely panicky and tense when I'm driving as I'm absolutely petrified of it, and I can't see the road or anything else because of my vision problem. The reason I waited so long to even get my permit because I've been in and out of mental health facilities since I was 14 and my parents really just wanted me to focus on finishing high school and nothing else. I graduated and now I'm going to my town's college in the fall. The problem is that both my parents work and they will not be able to drive me to my classes. The only reason they are forcing me to drive is to get to my classes. This is beside the point but I already feel very apprehensive about going to college, I feel like it's not a good fit for me and that its going to be a waste of so so much money that we don't have, but my parents are making me go and I don't have a choice, I know that it's what I have to do. My mental health is fairly good right now but whenever I think about college I have this intense feeling of dread and start having some bad thoughts. I can deal with going, I know it's just something that's necessary for me. But the driving thing is different, I can only handle forcing myself to drive like every two weeks if that, I need that much time afterwards before I can work myself up to doing it again. I've never been so scared of anything in my life and whenever I'd try to tell my parents just how terrified I am or the fact that I'm genuinely worried that I may injure someone while driving because I can't see they tell me I'm being ridiculous and that I just need practice. They keep yelling at me every day for not practicing driving and I don't know what to do. I don't believe that I could be able to deal with it if I hurt someone, or worse. I couldn't have that on my conscience. I am so scared. I have nightmares about it often and my parents just keep bringing it up. Even my girlfriend has been getting upset with me about it, saying that I just need to do it. She's scared that my parents will kick her out (she lives with us) if I don't start driving, which wouldn't happen but she's just paranoid and anxious because she has a rough past. My parents are wonderful people and are generally such good parents. They've done so very much for me and I hate making them upset with me but I truly don't think I can do this. I feel like I'm also justified in that. Are my parents right to make me do this? Am I just overreacting? It really doesn't feel like I am but I just really need some help deciding what to do.

1057,"I'm a mid tier supervisor at an essential administrative office here in Texas. 

We have NOT been given the option to work from home. Our building is 2 floors and there are less than 150 people working inside. Its not a very large office. These 10+ cases have been confirmed in hushed tones. Nothing official. 

Our agency has not disclosed any of the positives officially, but due to the contact investigations and my closeness with upper management,  I know for a fact that we have over 10 confirmed cases in our building. No contact investigations were conducted for people who have shared common areas (bathrooms, elevators, staircases, break rooms, etc..) Only for those working in the adjacent low-walled cubicles. When a new case is discovered, there is no clean up of the area or time off. They are told not to come in and its business as usual.

I have severe asthma. Any kind of flu or cold puts me in the hospital. I estimate about 60%+ of our staff are high risk: Diabetes, elderly, emphysema, etc.. We are feeling like sitting ducks and were only told this passed monday that we needed masks in the office. Prior to then, masks were not mandated. If we contract the virus it comes out of our current balances of PTO (paid time off). If we have no PTO it is LWOP(leave without pay). No leave is given for quarantining, so we are incentivised to not do so. 

I have had many discussions with our staff over the issue. But with one employee from a different department being taken away in an ambulance yesterday,  we are getting fed up.

Some of us openly complain, but it seems like no one cares or is just as helpless to do anything. The 10 that had the virus are still out. 3 of them caught it back in early May.

In late May, I sent an email out to HR and upper management responding to their claims that the number of cases in the building is on our agency's website (which it is not) in addition to a few other false claims that had me and my staff pissed. I also included a number of other questions that our staff had. I Cc'd our staff and we have yet to receive a reply. 

It's a running joke now. 
""Have you gotten a reply yet?""

I am at a crossroads right now and am feeling like walking away.

I love my job and my people. I was just promoted again and my pay is decent. But Friday's ambulance incident has me shook up. I am a student in my last semester, but I am willing to put everything on hold if it means lowering my risk of dying. I don't want to leave my people behind. 

Worst of all, I have an elderly family member that works in the same building. They are in the center of covid town right now. I am worried if I leave, I won't be able to convince her to do the same... I have tried to convince them that FMLA is an option, but they are resistant due to a fear of losing job/benefits/retirement stuff.

1058,"Hi

So I'm a guy (19) and 3 close friends and I decided to meet up in a friends garden to celebrate someones birthday. Social distancing was not as good as I wanted but all assured me they had no symptoms. We all got very drunk and then things went wrong. My friends who is a trans male told me they found me super attractive which I laughed at and then they asked if they could kiss me. I consider myself very much straight, but was very drunk and consider them objectively quite attractive and we made out for like 10 seconds. Afterwards I felt really awful and decided that that was very much not me and did not feel ok with it. I stopped drinking and started sobering myself up. They asked me if they could kiss again and I refused. They have a bf but are in an open relationship but I did not feel ok with that, nor about kissing them. They are a dear friend but not someone I feel I would want to kiss and I only did as I was drunk.

Not long after I walked past them and they tried to touch my ass and my stomach which I was very much not ok with and feel quite violated. They are my friend but I'm not ok with them doing that. My friends thought it was funny and started questioning if I was bi which I very much know I am not. I feely deeply uncomfortable about the situation and don't know what to do about our friendship. I think they will be too drunk to remember but I feel so awful about it all, and although they had no symptoms, I'm particularly worries about Coronavirus, particularly as I'm living with my mum who is high risk.

1059,"On one hand I, so so so want to to return to my university and have that life again. But at the same time I don’t want to lose thousands of dollars. Covid is still widespread and continues to rise. I live in FL and my uni is also in FL. 

I have some savings but I don’t want to sign into a lease I can’t get out of. Currently, I have a place to stay rn with family and am saving money and also have a part time job I enjoy.

Another option is for me to go to the community college which is not ideal. Community college obviously won’t be the same. 

And I do really like my normal uni I go to. But obviously with covid measures in place it won’t be the same.

What I mean by this is I don’t have consistent meal times, I don’t have consistent meal sizes, and I don’t have consistent meal numbers (I should preface this by saying that I take vyvanse which has been fucking with my appetite). I don’t tend to plan much when it comes to food so I’ll either just make and eat whatever I can find at home or I will get take out. I get really stressed and anxious when I’m trying to pick something to eat (especially when I’m trying to prep an entire weeks worth of meals), and I always need to plan ahead with groceries because since Covid happened my dad has discovered grocery delivery and he prefers it over going to the store, so he places one grocery order every week.

The minimum requirements were listed as having an associates degree in a related field along with relevant experience. Honestly I was surprised I received a call and interview as I only have about 3 years of purely electrical experience in a commercial setting. 

I interviewed with the HR rep and two supervisors over that department through a conference call. I believe the interview went well as I felt confident in all the answers I gave to the  ""explain a time when ....""  questions that came up and I even made the guys laugh a few times in general conversation through out the interview.

1065,"I am an instructor at an online university and because the work is remote all correspondence is online as well. Every term I get a new temporary “supervisor”. This is essentially a person I report to for the term and the person that I go to with any questions. I have a boss above that person who never changes. But as you can imagine it is exhausting to have a new supervisor every term, because it is a new person to get used to. Usually, the supervisors are really chill yet responsive. 

This term, my supervisor is...a lot. This is the first week of the term and I’ve already received 7 emails from her that are explicitly about how I am not doing a small thing right and by that I mean, to her expectations in my courses. Every day it is something new.

Her- “I noticed you haven’t responded to that student who asked you a question on the general discussion board yet”
Me- “I have actually, but I emailed them back cause the response required was extensive”
Her- “I would prefer you use the discussion board so other students and myself can see your responses”

Her-“I noticed you haven’t finished grading this assignment yet”
Me- “I was under the impression I had until x day to grade these”
Her- “yes technically, however, I wanted to make sure you were okay because it looks like you haven’t started that yet”

In one email she didn’t like how I phrased one of my course announcements (but the information I posted was accurate). 

You get the gist. Usually these supervisors just check in. However she combs through EVERYTHING in my course, including my feedback to students and nit picks. But it’s hard to take her seriously when I know she is only temporary.  I am up for a promotion at this place so I don’t want to go nuclear on her. I also want to be polite, yet not give into her every whim?

I am a 21-years-old senior college student studying at a decent university who lives in a mediocre country. My major is English language teaching and I want to highlight the fact that the only talent I have had in my life has been my linguistic competence especially in English. I chose this field and major because it was the only one that would get me into a great college within the end of high-school exam system I was participating in. I had a really great freshman year in college where I ranked first among my peers (my major). In my second year I tried taking on another major on top of my current one and it didn't work out. I spiralled into the worst depressive period of my life and got pnemonia on top of it. On my third year (which is 2019-2020) I did better compared to the second one but still I feel a lack of confidence plus interest to become a somewhat decent teacher. Ever since I started college I discovered my other interests and just fields that I felt passionate about which are psychology and law. The problem is, I don't know if I should study either psychology or law on top of my teaching degree. I have received very mixed feedback from my acquaintances regarding whether it would be worth another four years spent on it/ would I be able to find a job.

In conclusion, I'm asking for your experience with studying for another degree after 21 years of age and thoughts on my situation in general. Thank you if you've taken the time to read my problems\^\^",11Jul2020,1

1072,"A lot of this will be copied from a post I made in confessions sorry. I want to make it more concise though because I don't want to waste anyones time. 

Two years ago I (18F) made friends with another girl (15F) online, we could relate to a lot of each others problems as well as sharing interests and would talk frequently, and quickly became best friends.

Eventually she 'confessed' to me and I was unaware that was what she was doing and responded back telling her I loved her too and was excited to see where our friendship went. But, then it turned out she was confessing romantically and began calling me her girlfriend and saying that we were dating. I was taken aback but it made me feel happy at the same time and so I reciprocated. 

There wasn't anything sexual about the relationship and we hadn't even shared pictures so there wasn't a physical attraction thing, and so it didn't immediately hit me as terrible and I went along with it for an entire month. At the end of the month I began feeling awful about it and explained power imbalances in relationships and how it can lead to dysfunction. I'd never been in a relationship before so I wasn't even completely sure what I was talking about but I did my best to get it across and 'break up' with her in a way that wouldn't hurt her feelings, and she said that she understood. But I'm still scared that she didn't take it seriously enough and it messed up the way she saw acceptable relationships. The guilt I felt kept getting worse and eventually we stopped talking. I wish I could have just done everything better.

Now that I'm 20 I keep thinking back on it and I feel like I'm some kind of predator or pedophile, I really wasn't trying to do that but I'm sure lots of predators don't see problems with their behavior when they're doing it either. I cannot get it out of my head no matter what I do but I don't know if I deserve to either. I don't know why I thought for any amount of time that it was okay to do that and I don't know how I'm supposed to atone for it when I don't think there's anything legally I could do to pay for it. I talked to two friends about it and they said they didn't hate me for it but I don't know why they don't when it seems so cut and dry disgusting to me. I'm scared of death I've been considering suicide for the past couple of weeks because I don't know what else to do about it or if I deserve to live anymore. It just keeps getting worse

Im not even completely sure what I'm expecting by posting this again but I dont know what to do or who to talk to and I feel like strangers will tell me better how bad I am than friends will, and if there's something I can do to somehow make it better I would really appreciate it.",11Jul2020,1

1076,"So me and my boyfriend rent a two room basement suite with a friend who is great.  Unfortunately our friend went to live with her parents for the summer and we sublet her room.  We had a hard time finding someone but eventually found a guy who seemed chill.  We are in our early 20s and this guy, let call him Gavin, is 33.  So whatever, we get along okay but he mostly keeps to himself.  He didn't come with sheets or a pillow or towel or anything so he's using some of ours.  I bought sheets for his bed but they didn't for and he decided to just use the mattress protector (it took two weeks for him to even see if they fit and by then I got rid of the receipt).  He drinks a TON of juice and puts the unrinsed, capped bottles in our recycling bin... We talked about it and it's a bit better now.
There have been other little things like not cleaning the counters or leaving the sponge to get gross in the sink, but the worst part has been that he has started to smell.  At first I thought it just might be his body wash or something because I could smell it after he got out of the shower, but I know it's not now.  My boyfriend pointed it out yesterday that standing in the living room beside his room we could smell it.  It lingers after he walks by.  I know he hasn't washed my pillow or it's case, or the bed protector.  He does laundry maybe once every two weeks.
I'm super awkward and don't know how to bring it up without sounding rude or making things between us awkward.

If it was a friend it would be fine but I almost just want to ride out the next 6 weeks and help my friend wash everything afterward (she doesn't know the situation yet).  The only thing I can think of is to let him know that the bed protector comes off it f he wants to give it a wash, and that my comforter is also washer and dryer safe.

my boyfriend (23M) and I (24F) have been together for nearly 2 years. we have been in a long distance (we still are) for about 8 months. he will come back here and we will close our distance in september. i think he is an amazing boyfriend.

but i am always so jealous omg. it's to the point where i think i am actually crazy sometimes lmao. 

we were introduced by a mutual friend (they were pretty close), we were best friends. when me and my boyfriend got together, that friend slowly tried to exclude herself from our life lol. but that's another story.   
but somehow i am jealous of this friend. not because of her as a person. but because i feel so insecure and there's a voice inside my head saying that maybe they will end up together in the future?

because they have pretty similar interests and similar personalities. my boyfriend and i are pretty similar too but him and my ''ex'' friend literally do the same course in college.

just little things like me finding that he looked her up on facebook twice (saw it in his search bar when he let me use his phone - he was beside me, i wasn't snooping). when i asked why he said he didn't know and was just curious what she was up to because as i said, she kind of stopped talking to us.   
then he actually got a job in the country that my exfriend went to for a year abroad (but she's not there anymore). the only reason why is because it was just a coincidence (i believe) that he got an email for a job offering there. and it was very close to where he is at the moment.   
then i don't know, just randomly when we would call i feel like he would ask questions that would pertain to her?

i know i really sound crazy and i am willing to hear anything from u. any advice, criticisms.. they're welcome!! in hindsight though, i think maybe i feel this way because i also have a bit of anger/resentment towards this friend (because of the fact that she just ignored us when we got together).. so then i project that onto my boyfriend? i'm not so good at english but yeah, i hope someone understands out there.",11Jul2020,1

My son was playing with one of the sprayers when an older woman with a younger child climbed onto the platform. I don't know how old the little one was but there was a swim daiper so I'm assuming 2 maybe 3. The woman approached my son,  pointed her finger in his face and told him to stop playing cause she didn't want to get wet. I was standing a few feet from the platform and heard what she said over the sound of all the water so she certainly raised her voice. 

My son looked at me confused, and I made the choice to speak up. I addressed him first and told him to keep playing that he did nothing wrong. Then I told her calmly that it's a kids water park, hes doing nothing wrong and leave him alone. I didn't yell,  cuss,  or use any abusive language. 

A few minutes later a woman and her husband approached and started yelling at me. I guess the older lady was the grandma and the daughter brought her husband along to yell at me like it would be intimidating? She said I was inappropriate to be ""aggressive"" to her mother and that grandma had every right to ""ask"" my son to stop using the sprayers. She said her mother was just protecting the younger child. 

I tried to respond and explain that my kid was playing in an age appropriate area and broke no rules, and that if grandma didn't want to get wet as she stated then she shouldn't be in a water park and if she was concerned about her toddler then they should be in the baby/ toddler play area that was 100ft. away.

1083,"This might be a long one to explain but here we go anyway, I need adive from people who are not at all involved in the story.  TLDR at the bottom

It was June of 2018, my cousin (let's call him Dave) and I go for a day out riding our motorcycle. We often switched bikes because they were two completely different machines and we liked riding them both and in 2 years nothing ever happened when we switched, but that day we were riding with two other guys who weren't used to riding in groups and after pulling out of traffic me and one of the other guys were about to miss our exit so he cut across the highway and brushed my front wheel while I was braking hard to take the exit, making me drop the bike and letting it slide on the pavement scratching the paint and denting the fuel tank. I got back up with a couple scratches and a hoodie full of holes but thankfully both me and the bike were good to go. Dave and I both got back on our own ride and we kept going for the day. We agreed that I would pay for the damages since I dropped it and we didn't want to cause a scene with the other dude we barely knew. 

2018-19 were not my best years financially and i couldn't afford the repairs right away, long story short summer 2020 comes around and even with the whole Covid-19 situation I had managed to get back on my feet and I could afford buying the bike from my cousin instead of paying for repairs which I thought would make both our lives easier, but then for some literally unknown reason the engine blew as I was driving back home the same day I bought the bike. So I call Dave right away telling him the engine blew up and that i'd bring it to his mechanic the next day. His mechanic says it looks like I might have downshifted instead of shifting up over reving the engine and skipping all the mechanical explanation blowing it, which did not happen, and my guys are saying it was a lack of maintenance and abuse that caused it.

Now the real problems start, where I live the consumers Office states that in a private sale if there is a hidden defect the sale is cancelled and the seller has to give the buyer a refund. Now since Dave and I are family, I didn't want to take this to court and figured we could come to an agreement. He suggested to ''crash'' the bike and call my insurance to claim an accident but I have a criminal record and that does not go well in an insurance claim so I told him that was not a possibility. Then he asked that I pay him for the paint job and all that I was supposed to pay for at first and that would be it, but he changed his mind a couple days later saying he lost money by not selling the bike waiting for me to repair it and that he should be compensated for that loss. In my opinion since he knew I couldn't afford it when it happened, he could've gone to the repair shop, get the bike fixed and sell it without loosing money since I would've repaid him the cost as soon as I would've been able to. Dave is saying I'm running from my responsibilities and that I should've gotten the bike fixed asap knowing he wanted to sell it.

His brother who I'm close with has the same opinion as Dave and one of our cousin tells me I shouldn't give him a cent more than what the repairs were worth so do my parents. I'm lost, Dave and I used to be very close but that whole shitshow has taking a big toll on our relationship.

;TLDR; Switched bike with my cousin dropped it scratched the paint, bought the bike 2 years after, engine blew up same day, cousin wants money he lost by not selling earlier waiting for me to repair it knowing I was broke and couldn't afford it but I told him I would pay him back asap if he repaired it himself.",11Jul2020,1

On a whim, I applied to a year long program in Norway that would allow me to study Norwegian in depth (as well as a small amount of other subjects) without the stress of grades or many outside factors (it’s not that I don’t think that I would normally be able to get a good grade in a Norwegian class, it’s just that I want my drive to study the language to develop authentically from my desire to progress, not my desire to get a good grade). I was accepted, and realistically, I need to make a decision within the next two days.

While, yes, I have always wanted to learn Norwegian, I have also gotten the impression that it isn’t really regarded as an important enough language on the international stage in order for me to justify making a substantial monetary/time investment into it. Practically all of Norway speaks English, and the number of those who can is only getting higher.

When I was accepted into a very expensive intensive Chinese program that was supposed to take place this current summer, my dad expressed to me that the $13k+ cost would more than pay itself off in my future salaries. While my main goals with Norwegian aren’t necessarily career oriented (while it would be awesome Norwegian could play a part in my future career, it is quite unlikely), I am not sure that my enjoyment or my need for time to sort out my life goals are worth the $11k+ price tag.

I am fortunate enough to have developed a college fund that has enough money to devote to this. Furthermore, I am surprised about the level of support that my dad has given to the prospect of going to Norway using this money (he has always wanted me to not use it and turn it into a retirement fund). And if I’m being honest, the program is something that I know that I would absolutely enjoy. However, I feel like I need a more objective, outside opinion in order to make the decision quickly and not potentially waste $11k+. 

I hope this made sense lol",11Jul2020,1

She steals my makeup, sneakily puts stuff in the cart when we go shopping so my mom can buy them for her, and tells me that a lot of my close don’t fit me so I can give them to her (even tho they clearly do). She’s very rude sometimes.And she lied about not bringing other shoes just so that I’d have to give her some. And not to mention her purposely scuffing the hardwood floor we have.

1091,"Hi there,

I see a lot of instances (through various forms of media, posts, etc) of people getting in to careers they love, without going to school or really having a background in it.

I have about 2 years of college under my belt at this point (I’m 25 atm, have been in and out of school a few times). But I’ve never really found anything that speaks to me. I have a few interests that I would love to be able to pursue professionally, but I have literally no experience in any of them. 

I see a lot of stuff about “just doing it” and learning as you go. But that seems so unfathomable to me. I’m interested in filmmaking and pizza making (weird combo, I know), but I have no idea how I just “go do it”. I live in a studio apartment that barely has a space that would qualify as a kitchen, and it seems to me that filmmaking requires a decently big investment to get started. 

I feel like I might have a bit of a defeatist attitude, or maybe I’m just making excuses for myself. But, I really truly wish I could find a way to pursue these career paths I idealize.",11Jul2020,1

1096,"So my mum and I fight quite a lot. And sometimes she says things like ,I wanna get into a coma and never wake up again‘ or ,what would you do if I was hospitalized for a long time?‘. And I told her to stop saying she wants to die but she just got mad and said she never said that she wanted to die. And sometimes so threatens to throw me out or that I have to move to my grandma. Last time she said that I could just move out if I didn’t like it at home. And I don’t really like it at home. It’s really loud, everyone is very noisy, they don’t respect me or my feelings and don’t take me serious when In feeling very depressed. They also are very toxic. And when I try to talk to my mum about feeling depressed or her being rude to me she just talks about herself and that I should stop acting like my life sucks. She also says that I have no reasons to feel that way and she always makes comments about my appearance which make me feel insecure. But then she also has moments where she acts extremely nice and understanding. Like really really nice. Do nice she would seem like a picture book mum. But every time we have a fight she just smokes a cigarette and acts like nothing happened after. And that every time and if I even try bringing it up again she gets mad. She never tried to physically hurt me except for when she threw a yoghurt at me once (kinda funny she missed).
So now I’m seriously thinking about moving out. I have around 3000$ saved up. And I would have around 600-700$ monthly because of the money my dad has to pay. I’m also looking for a job rn.

I don’t really know what’s the right thing to do so I’m asking you all for advice. But I’m seriously thinking about moving out.

1099,"I (f/20) have been at home for over 6 months due to a chronic pain disease. I had to completely stop working because of it. On my bad days the pain is so excruciating I only leave my bed for food and other important stuff. On my “normal” days I would rate my pain as 5/10. I’m in constant pain and it only gets worse the more I move around. That means sitting on a chair 45 minutes tops. Standing around half an hour max. I can only walk short distances without needing to sit down.
Now to the situations leading up to my question:
Last week my mom took me out to go grocery shopping. We had to walk a short distance to the shop and while shopping I already noticed my “standing” time decreasing. That means the pain got worse and worse. By the time we checked out I really needed to sit down. We wanted to go to other shops right after, but I just couldn’t. So we had to sit down at a cafe nearby for 20 minutes at least, until I was able to walk again without the feeling to get stabbed by a thousand knifes. I was really lucky the café was opened or I wouldn’t have known what to do.
So today the same thing just worse happened again. Today was a especially bad day in regards to my pain. I didn’t want to bail again and miss another opportunity to get out of the house instead of just laying around in bed and doing nothing. We went shopping again and we only had to wait 15 minutes in line and my pain got so bad I couldn’t even carry my own handbag anymore, since the weight of it made the pain even worse. When we finally left the store every step hurt like hell and I really just wanted to go back into my bed. I shifted part of my weight on my mother since it made it a bit more bearable to walk. That’s when she brought up the idea about getting myself a walker. I’m really torn on this idea.
I looked a bit around and they’re a bit expensive. I would have to pay for it by myself since insurance wouldn’t at this time being. Plus I’m a young woman and it would feel really weird to me to take such a thing with me. Also it would probably get me some stink eye and hurtful comments of strangers I’d pass in the city since I’m so young and you can’t see that I’m sick (except when I’m in bad pain). Plus I wouldn’t know how to explain it to my boyfriend, that I could use this thing on walks etc. Don’t get me wrong: he’s been very supportive every step of the way, but I think he’d find it weird to take it with us, too.
But on the other hand it would probably encourage me to go outside more often since I wouldn’t have to worry about what to do if I can’t walk anymore. I’d just have a place to sit down whenever I’d need it. Plus this thing could carry my stuff if it gets too heavy again.
But I don’t know if it would be an “overreaction” to get one.

1100,"I've always known I was an anxious person and now that I'm stuck in my hometown over the summer, with no job or friends to meet, I've gotten so much worse.  I'm not officially diagnosed yet but my therapist said it seemed possible I had OCD after my 2nd session, and if not OCD, an anxiety disorder and  suggested I go to a doctor for meds and an official diagnosis. I obsess over my health for 3 or 4 hours a day sometimes, convincing myself I have various cancers according to Google or even schizophrenia because I hear one creak at night? It's so absurd.

We have a fancy dinner at the end of camp called banquet, too. I asked her to go with me for that and she said yes. My friends all thought she liked me because she would talk about me a lot, except I stayed in the tents and she stayed in the cabins because I’m a year older than her. We also do this thing on the last night of camp where people are given the opportunity to talk about the times they had at camp and I was the only person she mentioned. I think I dared her to mention me or something, but I didn’t think she actually wanted to do it.

There’s no sleepaway camp this summer due to the coronavirus, and I’m really upset because I’ve gone every summer since the summer of 2016 and this would’ve been my last year due to my age. Maybe I’m just missing sleepaway camp, but I probably miss her the most.

I have her phone number, which she did give me without me asking, but we haven’t texted in months and I doubt she even wants to talk to me. The real problem is, though, I’m a girl. She’s never claimed to be anything but straight, so far all I know this was just a fun little friendship thing for her. My friends say she gives them “bi vibes” or whatever, but I’m honestly not sure. She’s never even talked about a boyfriend or anything, but she hasn’t hinted at not being straight either.

Are the dreams saying that I still have feelings for her, or are they just me missing sleepaway camp since I usually go around this time? Would love some advice and/or interpretations. Also, should I reach out to her?",11Jul2020,1

I have a really rough relationship with my father, meeting on and off throughout my childhood years, culminating in me calling it quits about a year ago. Both my father and mother moved on, with my father re-marrying, and my mom recently getting a new boyfriend.

Cue to today, my mother and her boyfriend booked a getaway at a camping ground a few hours away from our city, it was supposed to be a nice relaxing outdoors getaway.

Then i ran into my father.

His wife was there too, she didn't seem surprised at all to see us, and gave us a smile, on the other hand my dad gave us a very dirty look. We haven't been in contact for months, and we run into each other hours away from either of our houses. I don't grasp how this could be down to coincidence. Additionally, last summer i also ran into them at my camp counselling job, though i assumed it was just a fact of coincidence, or me having told him prior to us cutting ties.

Is it possible this is just dumb luck, and that i'll win the lottery tomorrow as well, or is this malicious? My father is quite wealthy, and can become unhinged and obsessive, i wouldn't put it past him to intentionally seeking out these “bump ins”. Should i be worried for my safety?",11Jul2020,1

I feel very conflicted because I want to save money as much as I can and I don’t think it’s really a great idea to pay money for tuition and rent if I don’t have any classes to go to, but there is a chance that I might have some.

1113,"I am M16, she’s F15. I think that’s important to get out of the way. 

This girl, which I’ll name Jane, has told in very specific how when she was with her foster dad, she was forced to fight in a fight club. 

This is in Hawaii, in the island of Oahu. Jane had to fight in this fight club every other day for 4 years. It started out as an underground boxing club when she first started but turned into a fight club. 

Very rich people watched these fights. Millionaires and billionaires. It would be girls as young as 7 and boys aged 13-16. 

Jane said that the fights happened in an empty swimming pool that was deep. It happens from 9pm-4am. You’d fight for with someone else until you or them were knocked out or started bleeding badly. You can do anything, punch, kick, choke, slamming against the concrete pool, and have a pocket knife to cut and throw at who your fighting. The matches on average last 1-2 hours. 

Once a kid knocks out another, they’ll wait to fight the next kid, like a last man standing sort of thing, until their is one winner for the day. Every time you win a fight you win a $1000 for yourself and your parents get $1000, all cash. The elite paid a lot of money to see kids fight each other to near death. If the parents were fine with it, the elite would fight the kids as well in the pool. 

Janes record for the 4 years she was fighting her record was 2,684-1,897. She made well over $200,000 fighting when she was the ages 8-12. 

The only thing she doesn’t know is the exact location. Her and all the other kids would be blindfolded on their way to this sick underground fight club.

She got out of the fight club once her grandparents got custody of her. She does not know if the underground fight club is still running today.

1117,"Some context...my mother in law doesn’t like me. She never has and probably never will. She plays nice and is civil but she still tells my fiancé that she doesn’t like me. It’s a deep story but it basically comes down to she hates me because I took her little boy away. Even though I treat both him and his mother very kindly, it’s never enough. Anyway, my fiancé and I are tying the knot at the end of August. Her and her daughter(sister in law) are invited. I’ve also invited my friend. She’s not an awesome friend but she’s the only one I really have. I’m too shy to make more friends and I like it that way lol. I’m just not a social person. Lately, I’ve been venting to her about how my MIL doesn’t like me and how I’m worried about the wedding. My friend keeps taking my MIL’s side on everything even when she’s clearly wrong and even her own son says she is. She told me she’s going to dance and sit with her and my sister in law at the wedding and said if her and I fight she’s “putting money on MIL”. There was also an annoyance with my SIL where we had to shell out money for her rental. Money we just didn’t have because of saving for a wedding. I was frustrated and told my friend. She took my side but then months later when we finally paid the bill and I vented about the stress said I know how she feels on the matter but she can’t comment...WHY?! Your my friend not their daughter in law/sister in law! She’s been a friend since middle school and has always had a crush on my fiancé too. They used to be best friends but he never felt that way about her. I think she still harbors feelings(she sometimes flirts with him. Him and I just ignore it) and is mad we’re getting married because every time I bring up something as simple as the wedding decor she gets quiet and distant. I’ve just stopped talking about it which really sucks because I’m supposed to just be able to talk about my wedding with my friend. Anyway, I’m getting angry that she’s acting like she’s trying to get them to love her. She happened to be with me a week ago when me and my fiancé went to see his mom and she acted all buddy-buddy with her to the point that she kinda tried to shut me up when I tried putting in my input. For some stupid reason I want so badly for my MIL and SIL to love me. I want to be accepted in their family and it boils my blood that my own friend is trying to get them to like her more. This has gotten to the point that when she said she’s going to sit at their table at the reception, in their row at the ceremony and dance with them that I got really sad and feel that if I see that on my wedding day it’ll be ruined and I’ll cry. I don’t feel it, I know it’ll happen because I cried the whole way home after my MIL and her were hitting it off and hugging the other week. I care way too much about this. She’s done stuff like this before but with friends I did have (hence why I just don’t want to make anymore). She gets a buddy-buddy then goes and hangs out with them alone and comes home and rubs it in my face for weeks. How do I prevent these sad feelings from happening on my wedding day?

1119,"Most of my friends live a dream of mine. They either got a good paying job, travel, or have a healthy relationship and seem very happy.

I am a sophomore, and I had a very precise plan about how I want to spend my summer: get an internship, get a job offer and get hired, afford to pay rent for my last university year so I don't have to live in the college dormitory anymore, and save enough money so I can travel to Asia next summer. And maybe get a girlfriend.

But all of my plans went downhill. I had a few interviews and I got rejected. I didn't give up, and kept trying with no result. A friend of mine only had one interview, and he got accepted(the internship was an Android development internship and he didn't have any knowledge about it, while I told them about the small apps I created on my own). I was frustrated when I found out, and I may be a shitty friend for that. I wasn't happy for him, I was actually sad. And now he goes to work and learn everything I studied so hard on my own, and in the end I'm going to be left behind. He also got a girlfriend out of nowhere. That doesn't make me frustrated or anything, but when I look at it I see it as he's starting to live my dream.

I also have other friends who got developer jobs at the age of 19, and now can afford to live on their own, and travel.

That along with the worry of finding a job to sustain myself next year, actually doing well enough to pass next year, and trying to get over a stupid drinking problem. Whenever I go out on nights out I always get blind drunk, and I’ve done some horrible things, and said some horrible things. People are embarrassed to be around me. Whenever people look at me they cringe. 

It just eats at me, and I don’t want to go through any of this anymore. I desperately want to change, but I don’t even know how. I hate even posting this, because it reads like a wall of self-pity and loathing. I just want to hear some advice of where to begin.",11Jul2020,1
