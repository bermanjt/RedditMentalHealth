2,"Alright so I am a 17M and I think there might be something wrong with me. I never had a girlfriend, partly because my parents are strict and I never got to go to parties or similar events to meet new people. It should also be noted that I am an introvert. I had some opportunities but i failed everytime. I am going to talk about the 2 most recent ones. Okay so I had to do a class project with a small group. In that group was a beatiful girl that I had a huge crush on. I learned from my mistakes and thing were going well. So when the project was finished I asked her out and she said yes. I felt like that was the best day of my life. She couldn’t pick a day because she said that her week is full so I said no probs I’ll just text you next week... and so I did.  She never replied. After this incident I was depressed. Actually I was depressed before I met her, she was just kind of a light that kept me going and after she ghosted me it got worse. After a couple of months I was pretty desperate but now I’m better. I don’t know if it was a good choice but I just ignored everything that made me sad, still am ignoring it. And at this point I said fuck it and installed tinder. Finally had a match. We chat for a bit and it seemed like it was going well. Next day I decided to write back to her. I just wrote that I had a great time chatting with her. That’s it. Guess what... got ghosted again.

5,"Hi Reddit Advice community,

In a nutshell, I want to draw attention to the plight of the writer who has academically been acknowledged of having his work plagiarised in a major TV show. Alongside the support of the faculty in question, he's created a website detailing the background of the case and similarities and set up a petition on Change Org. He's also served the media company in question a Cease and Desist letter, today. However, when I've tried to post this information on a number of Reddit community boards, I'm either been blocked or told this isn't factual information (when everything I've written is the truth). Help/advice would be greatly appreciated.

6,"1. I’m majoring in English Linguistics while I was originally going to major in chemistry and lab science, I feel like I’ve taken a hit there. Have I? I know it’s ridiculous, but I worry my new major sounds like an easy way out - like I’m doing something easy that’s a waste of time - like how some people view art degrees.

I’ve always been pressured to compete at the top of my class and right now I feel like I’m failing. I’ve always done honors / AP etc and now I’m concerned I’m wasting it. 

2. How could I start to make friends? I’ve spent a long spell of being really set on not meeting anyone knew or forming relationships after SHTF in my personal life. I essentially refused to speak to people apart from being polite, will meeting people make this easier/how could I do that? I understand joint clubs etc is a good way, I’m thinking more along the lines of personal expression.

My current roommate has 2 cats and rarely cleans up after them. I often see loads of litter pile up outside of their litter box. They rip up everything and I am often the one that has to clean up after them even when I ask her to do it. I have brought this up to her many times and even have tried to come to a compromise of putting the litter box in her room so I don’t have to smell the thing (that’s cleaned almost once a week), but she continues to say that makes her uncomfortable. I told her that I don’t want the cats here anymore because they stress me out. This has been an issue for months and brought up many times during these months, but she continues to let it go.

Hey Reddit. I’ve had a pretty interesting and non conventional life. I have been put through some traumatic experiences and have had to deal with things from a very very young age. I definitely don’t have the worst life ever, and have been blessed with growing from my experiences instead of crumbling under the pressure.

I have wanted to write a book for a few years now and recently have been involved in more experiences that could also be written about. I want to write a book that details my experiences and what I have learned from these. I have been through things, but you would never know unless I told you. And I want to be able to reach other people that feel this way. I sometimes feel like I can’t complain about my life or experiences because it seems as though I have it pretty good.

I know my story. I know what I’ve learned. And I can write decently well. But I’m not quite sure how to write it and condense it but still have it be meaningful. I’m also not sure how to get a book published. I’m prepared for this to take time, possibly years, but it is something I am very motivated about. Does anyone have any tips on getting help transferring thoughts to words and reaching out to publishers?

13,"Hi all,

Im in my twenties and I think I might be gay, but I'm not sure. It's been a question on my mind for a long time now, but I'm really not sure where to go.

I've been in a relationship with a man for 5 years. As the years have gone on I've found myself less attracted to him and I've been thinking more and more about what it would be like to be with a women. If I'm totally honest it's not just him that I'm not that sexually attracted to, it's almost all men. 

I'm scared and confused as I come from a family which might not be all that welcoming if I did figure myself out to be gay and I don't want to hurt anyone.

14,"Firstly, to start of this post sorry for any grammar mistakes or paragraph errors I'm only getting c- in English.

This all started in year 9 in secondary school when this girl (let's call her Kate for privacy reasons) decided to join my school. At first I didn't really take notice of her even though my school is relatively small(100 people), however when I was in maths she sat next to me and then I got to know her better and after a few months we got particularly close.

After a certain period of time our connection weakened as I ended up getting a girlfriend along with my best friend dating my gf boyfriend. However, this relationship ended after a month due to finding out she was trying to make a move on my best friend( let's call him jacob).

After the breakup I spent quite a while deciding if I was to blame for any of of the breakup but Jacob reassured me it wasn't my fault. A few weeks later I ended up speaking to Kate again and eventually ended up catching feelings for her but was too nervous to admit it to her. After consulting with Jacob on what to do he told me to go for it however I ended up getting rejected but for some reason my feelings towards her wouldn't go, even now I still like her but anyways some time passed on and I slowly started to realise that jacob and kate started to get very close and before I knew it they were dating.

I never ended up confronting jacob about how I felt about it or how I felt jealous but he started to distance himself from me and he eventually cut me off completely. This really affected my work at school for a long time as he was my only friend and even though I wasn't dating her I sort of felt betrayed by him. Now I find it difficult making new friends and I know I'm probably in the wrong but I just dont know anymore. Need some advice if any of you could be bothered reading this. I would appreciate it thank you.",15Jan2020,1

17,"About a year and a half ago, my parents installed Covenant Eyes on several of my family’s devices as a safety feature to protect us from pornographic content before it became an issue. This wasn't a big deal for me until I got interested in online gaming and talking with internet friends, which concerned my parents because you have to be very careful about who you trust and talk to online. I met one guy on a video game who soon became one of my best friends and still is to this day. I uninstalled Covenant eyes about a month or so after knowing him, because I didn't want my parents to see that I was staying up till 2 am some nights on a video game and/or Discord. I've never had an issue with pornographic content and still don't. Two months ago my parents installed and reinstalled Covenant Eyes on every device in our house because my younger brother had accidentally stumbled across pornographic imagery and was slowly being addicted. My iPhone and laptop also had Covenant Eyes installed/reinstalled on them. This was really tough for me, because I wasn't the person having an issue. I only uninstalled Covenant Eyes in the first place so that my parents wouldn't see how late I was staying up and what games I was playing at those hours. I figured out how to ""disable"" Covenant Eyes on my iPhone (turn off the VPN and access on demand), but is there a way to do that on my laptop? I've already turned off VPN in the settings, but I'm not sure if it's done anything. I mostly just want to turn off the ability for Covenant Eyes to take screenshots and say what time they were screenshot at. I don't really care about it monitoring what I search, but would prefer not to go through the uninstall process again, as it is very stressful. Any advice?",15Jan2020,1

22,"I know this is all going to sound extremely crazy and weird but that's why I'm posting here and have temporarily stopped looking for a lawyer myself. I want to get advice on how to deal with the situation properly and what I actually need to look for to proceed with this since I can't figure out any of those legal websites myself as of right now.

So I met this person in 2016. He (if he even is a he) claimed to be a famous musician in Japan. I believed it at first because all of his friend group also seemed to know about this and be fine with it so I didn't think anything of it. But as time went on (I knew him for a year and then we dated for two years) sometimes things just wouldn't add up or make sense in regards to being that famous musician he said he was. Sometimes they would, like he would know something or have some picture or sound file or talk about a song that was gonna come out or something, but sometimes they wouldn't, like if he was playing a game online and suddenly the musician started an Instagram Live and then he would suddenly log out and not reply to messages for an hour or two. Or he would say he was at home and then out of nowhere the musician would be posting pictures about being out drinking with friends, and if I asked about it he would just say ""I didn't want you to know I  was drinking"" or some excuse like that. He never wanted to do voice calls, always had excuses for that, and never wanted to take any pictures, again, always had excuses for why he couldn't/didn't want to. We would sometimes talk about me visiting him in Japan, in fact I visited there twice and both times he was conveniently too busy to meet up with me, but we had talked about me visiting for Christmas last year and, surprise, he also had excuses about why he couldn't actually plan the details with me once it was December. So all in all, neither I nor my friends are buying the ""famous musician"" story anymore. We all think its a huge lie.

Anyways. Over the time we were dating, he became more and more abusive toward me, emotionally and mentally, manipulating me and controlling me. And yeah I know people have said and will say ""just block him and move on"" but it wasn't that simple. Either way, there were a lot of times when he told me with 100% seriousness that he wanted to kill me, and times when he told me he wanted to send SWAT to my old house to kill my ex, which he knew the address to because he stalked me and found the address online because he knows my full real name. This is the part I am most concerned about, because in the past month he was called out on some pet website similar to Neopets, for being abusive and bullying people off the site and being a bad moderator. While those callouts were happening, things he had done in the past few years were brought up, such as him sending nudes and other adult nsfw content to minors in the US ""as a joke"", all of which he is still good friends with for some reason, and also admitting to raping a girlfriend when he was in high school. This made it incredibly unsafe and uncomfortable for the people who also use that pet site because it was made for children and most people that were in the Discord server dedicated to that petsite (where he was a moderator) were also minors. A lot of people left that server and it even eventually got closed down completely due to the callouts and the proof that was coming out from victims or ex-friends of his. A friend of mine even made a public tweet and tagged the real musician's twitter account with a picture of my ex's second life account (since that's where we met) asking if this was really him or not. After that, my ex deleted all of his social media accounts (which we're sure were just throwaways anyways, none tied to his real name or self) and basically went into hiding, we figure to hide from me/any of my friends and/or his other victims as well as being discovered by any authorities, being that we still don't know who this person is.

So... my question is, what should I do now. I know impersonating someone famous is illegal, and he has definitely been using that name to do a lot of harm, catfishing people (including me) and manipulating people into doing things for him or buying things for him, or even just staying his friend because of it. I don't know if someone can necessarily get arrested for that, unless the real musician knew and did something about it maybe. But like I mentioned before, the part I'm most worried and scared about currently is the fact that this person does know my full real name and knows my ex's address and could probably find my current address very easily and very quickly. And I know nothing about who he really is or where he is really located in relation to me. He could live in the same state for all I know, maybe even the same city, I really have no idea. He made those threats against me and my ex when we were still on pretty good terms too, still pretty decent friends and he wanted to date me again like a month after we broke up in 2019, but now that we aren't in contact anymore and he has reason to hate me, if he doesn't already, I feel like I may be in even more danger? I think I need to hire a professional to find this person first, possibly find a way to get a reply from either the musician's label or maybe his personal website to confirm or deny the association with this person (since I have tried contacting both with no luck), and then potentially get him arrested or something? For threatening me and my ex? On top of the pedophile stuff? I don't know. This is where I need help. Sorry for the long post, it's just a really long weird story.

tl;dr- abusive online ex knows my name and address, and has sent me death threats. However, I've come to realize they probably definitely lied to me about their real name. Is it possible to find them and/or potentially press charges or file a restraining order? How would I go about this?

I graduated in a good university (one of the best in my country ) and I applied for a job in a company that needed someone who understood and knew about how Brazil (my country) works.  


So I applied to the job opportunity and they call me for a Skype interview, they love me, then I did an interview with the manager in the area I was applying. Everyone liked me, but then today I receive the news that they were about to hire me, when they talked to their immigration lawyers and they said that due to new immigration laws and procedures they could not guarantee that I would be able to get a visa and if they approved it would take 10 months for it to get ready, so they said that despite them liking me they would not be able to hire me.

Keep in mind that this position was temporary and I would not ""steal an american job"" forever and I would go back to my country to work for them there.

So last week I matched with a great guy on tinder. We exchanged numbers and texted all through the night and the next day. We later met up for lunch soon after. I thought it went well, and I felt a connection. I assume he did too to some degree, as he wanted to continue texting and possibly meet up this coming weekend.

We later text a little later that evening. He was studying for a big test this week, so I didn't want to be overbearing with the texting. So the next morning he asks me what's up, I been quiet. So I ask him how his days going and never get a response. We text through messenger and my message is left unseen.

So the next day, after no response and the message still unseen, I get nervous. I ask him if everything is all right and he replies, yeah just busy studying :).  

So I wait a couple days and still nothing. So I send him short text telling him good luck on the test. It went un read for a couple days, however it shows he's active in messenger.

I think deep in my gut, he's no longer interested in me. It's just part of me thinking maybe he really is tied up with his classes and doesn't have time now to chat.  I really felt a connection with this guy I haven't felt in years. I just don't want to give up.

Yet I don't know if I'm just being blind and just need to move on. Or should I send him another text saying hi or ask if he's still interested. I don't want to come off as weird if I keep texting and he's not interested in me.",15Jan2020,1

For about 8-9 months, I have been getting anonymous text messages that very clearly come from a texting app since they’re all different numbers with totally different area codes and if you try calling them, they have a really weird fake voicemail. Anyway, I have been getting messages that are very insulting, like “You’re a slut”, “Fuck you you fat bitch”, “why don’t you go fuck yourself” so on and so forth. Some of them even described things with people that I know which was really creepy. I just got another one tonight with another insulting message.

I moved out of my old home at around that time (~8 months ago) and the people there didn’t really seem happy with me when I left. I never really understood why since I hadn’t done anything to them and one of them was a good friend (let’s call her Patty) who refused to ever talk to me again after I left. Well, one of the insulting messages I received from one of the anonymous numbers, had both of “Patty’s” parents included in it like a group chat. They both replied with insulting things to this message as well. 

As a side note, I know that Patty had previously used fake texting apps and definitely knows about them. Is it safe to assume with all of this that she is the one that is sending me all of these messages? How can I go about confronting the situation? Or is there any way I can find out for sure who it is? I don’t think this is ok for her to continue doing this to me because I don’t know when it’s going to stop.

31,"I was never really super drawn into drugs like other people I know, I really hated not being in my natural state or not feeling like I was in control of my body. I’ve only had 2 dab pens. But I started experimenting with psychedelics in October, bought 3 acid tabs and took them over the span of a month, also got high off a dab pen multiple times throughout that month too. Took 8.7g of shrooms throughout the entire month of November; Didnt have a good trip once. I always felt very insecure every time I tripped, I really picked at myself for my acne and basically destroyed all my confidence. Even though every trip was fairly different, there was this one, consistent, feeling that wouldn’t go away where I just broke down into every single emotion at once and I’d cry because I felt like I was losing my mind during every trip. My thoughts felt stirred and uncontrollable. I was sober for a while and everything was fine but mid-December I started experiencing that exact feeling all over again even though I knew I hadn’t taken anything. I wouldn’t hallucinate the way I did when I got high but my brain would play a lot of tricks on me. I remember seeing a truck on the highway and thinking it was a giant person. I feel like I lost my sense of being and I’m running aimlessly in circles trying to find who I am again. I started taking marijuana infused edibles in the beginning of this month to try and feel something.  Took 2-5 mini edibles every day for 2 weeks straight. I think that made things worse. I get triggered back into “that feeling” very easily. My friends have told me that “there has to be a deeper reason why [I] keep getting high” and for some reason that conversation topic makes me spiral into “that feeling.” It’s so difficult to explain; I’ll be happy and then my sobriety is brought up. Then my brain goes into this hole of endless emotions and I’ll cry and start praying until I can’t anymore. Then I’m fine again. I drink sometimes too. I really don’t have any resources— I resent my father and I’m convinced my mom will kill herself if I tell her all this. I’m not exaggerating, she’s mentioned it before.

33,"
I (15F) have a friend (14M) who I’ve been close with for almost a year now. We’ll call him J. I actually had feelings for J for a while, starting about two years ago and ending a few months ago. A little bit about him: he is extremely intelligent and bright- he can speak near-fluent Japanese, does competitive rock climbing, is the second best violist in our grade, and is incredibly funny and entertaining to be around.

Anyway, I initially befriended J with the intention of getting closer to him and eventually starting a relationship with him. However, as I got to know him better and learned more about his personal life, I realized that he has some very complex, very serious mental problems that are preventing him from doing his best and developing properly. 

It started a little over four years ago, before I knew him and before he was the person he unfortunately is today. J developed depression when he was in 5th grade, which came with suicidal thoughts and actions. He made a few suicide attempts that mostly went unnoticed by those around them, but it got worse as he was left untreated. This particular period of J’s life came to a climax when, in 5th grade, he attempted to climb to the top of his school and jump off with the intention of ending his life. He was almost to the roof and would have gone through with it had the teachers not caught him and immediately realized what he was going through. He was transferred to another school for the remainder of his 5th grade year.

J saw a therapist for a little while, and soon enough he had overcome his depression. When he was in 6th grade he was able to emote and feel properly for a short time, even if it wasn’t that strong. But around the time he reached 7th grade and became a part of my life, his mind sort of just... collapsed. I still don’t know how to explain it and I have know idea what the fuck could have caused it. All I know is that it is now a whole new problem for him.

To say that J became “apathetic” would be the understatement of the century. To this day, he can hardly feel any emotions, with the exception of mild happiness and annoyance. He is never afraid, sad, hurt, or truly excited/happy about anything. On top of this, he doesn’t really care about anything. He has no motivation to do certain tasks, such as schoolwork and having fun. I soon discovered that he was incapable of having romantic or sexual feelings for anyone, so I was forced to say goodbye to my goal of dating him. 

In 8th grade, J developed nihilism. He began to believe that nothing truly matters, so he may as well not be here in the first place, particularly because of his glitched mental state. For a while, the only thing he was interested in talking about was death, and he would constantly mention his desire to “live life as an NPC”, leaving as little of an impact as possible, serving no purpose and not having much fun, and dying alone at a fairly young age. He still sometimes talks about this. Obviously this was all very concerning to hear, especially coming from someone so intelligent with so much potential. 

Around this time, it slowly became clear that J was losing his ability to feel empathy as well. He admitted to no longer truly caring about us (his friends) and feeling for us, now seeing us as simply a way to pass time and share his sense of humor with. This may make him sound like a bad person, but he’s really not. He’s a helpful, fairly sociable person who has fortunately begun to care about and appreciate us again, although there’s still a lot he needs to work on.

He obviously is in need of professional help of some sort, and he told me that he has considered the idea more than once. But his parents don’t know about his current state of mind and he feels that they won’t believe him and won’t take him seriously at all. J is also pretty unmotivated by the idea of seeking help, saying that regaining his lost emotions/personality would be nice for him, but “not something he actively pursues”. He of course needs to be motivated to work towards recovery, which is the main thing preventing him from doing so. 

Despite all this, J finally seems to be sort of recovering, although very slowly. Recently, I began dating one of our friends (we’ll call him D). When D and I went public with our relationship and J saw all the details, we were shocked when he told us it had brought back some of his emotion. It was the first time he had genuinely felt happy for others in months, and it made him want to see what other emotions he could recover. He’s been doing a little bit better since- he is far more open to the idea of seeking professional treatment, and he is even considering it. He is more receptive to people and things around him, and had started to emote to certain things in ways he couldn’t before, such as feeling happy and bad for others. Needless to say, we are all delighted by his slight improvement. Even if it’s very small, it’s a start, and shows that it’s possible for him to get better after all. He even gave me a suggestion: he says that if we were to expose him to fun things and sort of “teach” him how to feel again, maybe he could begin to grasp the concept again.

So what do we do? I REALLY want him to get professional help, because I feel that it’s the best possible thing for him, along with support and being able to have fun. How can we convince him to get this help, and advocate for him along the way? Does anyone know what’s causing his mental state and what me and his other friends can do to help? Since J’s more positive behavior seemed to be caused by observing the happiness and success of others (my new relationship with D), is it possible that exposing him to more positivity is the key? Although my romantic feelings for J are gone, I love him so much in a way I can’t describe- maybe like the way a mother loves her child? I want nothing more than to see him improving and being able to develop like a proper teenager. I want him to be able to feel and care and be experience all the things he’s missing out on- but how?",15Jan2020,1

It made me question a little bit. She insisted for me to change my phone plan from me paying for it, to get on her plan.

She claims to have wanted me to get on her plan because she was going to pay for it anyway, so might as well have someone use the phone while she pays it off. It was my brother's old phone, and he needed an upgrade.

Now, Im suggested that I pay for my own phone plan, so I can have privacy just in case she is, and she got a visible look of surprise.


She said that she was going to pay for it anyway because of the contract and she wanted the phone to be used by somebody or it will be a waste.

I said that I wanted to feel independent a little bit, because I'm moving out in 4 months.

I am currently a sophmore in high school and our second semester starts tommorrow. That also means of course, grades are also due tommorrow. To put it lightly.. I havent done all that well this semester, I had lot's of c's and 2 d's. My grades took a hard dip at the end of semester and I felt like I was pretty much screwed gpa wise. For example: I had a french final that was worth 100 points, and initally for whatever reason, the teacher did not see that I submitted my project (it was a 100 point project) and I got a 0 out of 100. This increased the number of D's I had and made me quite stressed. I ended up meeting with her and getting a 65% but my final grade ended up being a C-. In addition, many people flunked a test in bio before the final (me included) despite studying for 2 weeks almost daily! I studied hard for the final and brang my grade to barely a c-, exactly 70%. Without making this post too long, I still have 3 bad grades: chemistry, math and social studies. I felt like I tried everything I could, I am still uncertain about the social studies grade because I retook a bunch of stuff thats not in the gradebook yet. My gpa is a 1.64.. I felt like I gave it my best shot this semester.. I was attentive and studied but I still screwed up. I don't plan on attending college in the future and I still earned all my credits but I feel like I am not getting the help I need. I studied 2 weeks in advance for all these finals but my grades barely moved. The C-'s are pulling my grade to a D average and I don't know what to do!

51,"I’m a dumb guy and I need some advice because this is beyond my little pea brain and it’s becoming a problem. 

We’ve been married for almost 11 years. 3 kids, lots of pets. Always had debt but we pay our bills on time.

Wife has worked 3rd shift weekends at the hospital for a year, I work 40 hours regular 8 - 5. This has let us avoid using daycare because one of us is always home with the kids.

Downside of our schedule is very limited time together, her and I. We both have to work.

Last year we decided to sell our home and we are in the process of having another built. In the mean time, we moved into a tiny apartment. It was the only one that would let us take all our pets. It kinda sucks - the kids are all in one room and it’s dark and cramped.. but it’s temporary. By July we’ll be in a nice roomy house and it’ll all have been worth it! Right?

My wife has been having extreme anxiety at work. Anxiety about what COULD go wrong - but for the most part, nothing is actually going wrong. Good bosses, minimal drama with coworkers. She saw a Dr and ended up on Prozac. Seemed to help with the anxiety.

Now a few weeks later she just can’t get out of bed. I think she’s seriously depressed because other than being super tired she’s not sick or anything. I’ll go to work in the morning and bring lunch to the apartment and she’ll have been in bed all morning since I left. I feed everybody, walk the dogs, and go back to work. When I’m back in the evening, she’s been in bed since I left. I make dinner, she eats, then back to bed. It’s not constant as this every single day but it’s a lot of sleep. I get she needs to catch back up after the weekend but she’s had this schedule for a year and this is new and getting worse and is pretty much all week long now.

I think she’ll be better once we’re out of this apartment, but that’s months away and I don’t know how to help in the mean time. I don’t know what to do. She’s always been relentless and never slowed down, always doing stuff for the kids, until now.",15Jan2020,1

I'm just a little confused, maybe I'm just worried, maybe I'm right to ask. My dad has had a small recurring issue, but and he's been to the hospital for it once already. Because it's related to blood loss, it's a bit shocking at times but after checking related organs, his heart, etc. nothing has been found. My mom is abroad and returning in like 2 days, but we haven't told her because all it would do is cause her extreme worry and she'd be on the other side of the world.

So today he messaged me saying he was in the ER again, he was fine, my uncle is there, and they're just gonna have to apply the fix that they were hoping they wouldn't have to. I'm being a little vague on purpose but if anyone wants details I'll expand. Everyone involved (including my dad) is a doctor. I'm not worried for his life in any capacity, but he did have a major heart attack a couple years back and it's hard not to worry as his son. I've kept my younger sister company so she doesn't freak out, and I know who to call/when to call them.

I'm just wondering if I'm in the wrong for not telling my mom? For reference, my uncle, 2 of my aunts, and several other people that know my mom well know what's been going on. We just don't want to worry her as she's abroad and will be back soon anyways.",15Jan2020,1

Sorry, but this will be a long one.

I’m currently a freshman in high school. I had a big friend group back in middle school that I still hang around to this day. When this friend group and I got close, we started to rough house a lot. I didn’t hit puberty until the start of 8th grade. This meant that all throughout middle school I was the short little twerp with a high voice who was the punching bag. It wasn’t much it was really just annoying slaps on the back of the head from my friends with an inability to fight back. Never anything verbal though. I preferred the slapping because I have a decent pain tolerance. Then high school hit. My friend group was pretty big so I am cool with everyone, but I am not popular and there are two main cliques that I hang around. It was even better because I now have a deep voice and I grew like everyone else. There is one kid who I have been pretty close friends with for a while, we’ll call him Jack. I have been friends with him for a good amount of time, but he changed in high school. He can be hilarious at points, but also (he has admitted this to me) needs desperately to be validated by his peers and be a cool kid. We have a discord server that we go on with our friend group and it started when the server was first made. He has a very short temper now and gets mad at the smallest things. If I say one thing I get told to “shut the fuck up no one cares” or if I don’t know how to do something I get called a fucking dumbass. He has also told me to kill myself many times and makes fun of how I miss the days when my brothers and I lived under one roof. He also has a very intimidating voice so it hurts. He always thinks about how mature he is and how he’s all that. I’m a straight A+ student and often get told how smart I am, but it’s hard to believe with this guy calling me stupid at every chance. Both my brothers have moved out and I miss them a lot so and that’s why I want to go back desperately. That’s why I have already been sad. He is not helping at all. I have confronted him before and he said he would stop, but instead of stopping he would just say “IM JOKINGGG” after every insult. This made me feel worse. I plan on confronting him again, as it has now gone back to where it was, but I just want to know what to do if it happens again because I can’t take anymore of his shit, but he can be a good and wise friend at times.

63,"I have a bit od a pickle here. I need some help with it cause I'm not able to think anything that would work.

Okey, a little backstory, I have this really close friend, she is like a sister to me. A while ago (like 1,5 year) she met with this one guy who is in our, let's call it, friends group. They went out for like a month then she dumped him cause they didn't fit. And let me tell you, they did not.

But he didn't surrender ""on her"", he is convinced that she is the woman of his life, and he won't stop going after her.

He essentialy broke one of her relationships, cause he constantly bombarded them with stupid drama. Her bf had enough of it and said that if it won't stop then he quits (that guy is another story but yeah, really supportive).

Thing is, now he thinks I am the one who stops him from being with her. He won't listen to her, and countless times she told him that they are over. But because our group is really close and he cannot be ""thrown"" out of it we need to cope with that. 

What can I do to stop him? I mean, I really like the guy, but when it comes to her, he is a dumbass. I don't want to lose him as a friend also but I need to do something about him. I tried talking, then he said that I'm in love with her and he won't listen to me.

They had better relationships with these guys then i had with mine. their boyfriends were best friends so they became closer. i began to feel left out because they would hangout without me and barely talk to me during lunch. Understandably i took a step back from the relationship with them because no matter how many times i told them how i felt they did nothing. it has now been about two years since then and we recently reconnected this summer. We are all now single. 

Recently S has been acting extremely ignorant, and is acting very (at the risk of sounding mean) dumb. She has been blatantly racist saying things such as “i want to punch [a certain race] in the face”. She has been incredibly fake toward people by talking badly about them behind their back but then going up to them in the hallway and starting a conversation.

75,"So basically, I have two indoor cats. They don't get along very well, and it has obviously taken a toll on both of them. One of them, the younger cat, is very mean to my older cat. The younger cat chases her around, picks fights, and attacks her for no reason.

The younger cat has been peeing in the exact same spot on the couch, nonstop. It is a very expensive couch, and she pees on it no matter what we do. My mom took off the cushion to clean it, and my cat peed in the exact spot where the cushion was, making it ten times harder to clean. My mom has spent hours cleaning the couch, and it stressed her out a lot.

So, a few days before Christmas, we locked her in a room (it's a pretty big room, and it's unfinished) and she's been there ever since. Before we locked her in there, she was in that room most of the day anyway. But, I can really tell that locking her in there is bad for her and is a terrible idea. She needs attention, and she's not getting enough while locked in that room.

I think we should give her away, because the lack of attention is kind of abuse, but my brother is an emotional kind of person and wants to give her one more chance and let her roam around the house again. I know that she'll pee all over again if we let her out, but I also don't want to keep her locked up. My parents and I are close and they let me have a say, even though I'm still a teenager. 

I need your guys' opinion on this. Is locking her up okay? Is the best option to give her away? Should we give her another chance? I honestly have no idea what to do...",15Jan2020,1

uh, hey, this post is about hentai and shota-con, so if you're sensitive to that sort of content, it'd be best if you didn't read.

and sorry for the dumb question! anyways, i'm a 10th grader, and i needed some help with an issue concerning my friends and i about shota-con.

as your everyday average horny high school student, i often read hentai and make half-ironic jokes about it with my gaggle of friends, who sometimes join in. today i made an off-hand statement about liking shota-con while we were talking (which i never really mention that often due to past disagreements). one of my friends told me that saying that was admitting i was a pedophile, the other gave a look of disgust and annoyance, and my sister tried to lessen the damage by saying ""oh you meant that you enjoy manga that only \*happen\* to have shota-con, right?"" honestly i felt kind of hurt and betrayed and a tad guilty. not gonna lie, i was also extremely frustrated, as weird as this sounds i was offended that they said those things simply because i enjoyed something they saw as immoral and didn't enjoy. also, earlier in the year when i admitted that i also had a liking for loli-con, one friend said i was disgusting. i wanted to know, does enjoying shota-con and loli-con make me a pedophile (jeez does it feel terrible to write that), and is what they say a misinterpreted attempt to help me? are they justified in what they said to me, am i just being over dramatic because what they told me hurt? should i tell them how i feel, and risk them saying worse thing and breaking off the friendship? am i right in feeling upset, or is shota-con really that honestly awful, and am i awful for enjoying it? what should i do, and what's the right thing to do?

and am i taking this way too seriously? probably

I have seen him once since his wife passed, as he is usually pursuing his extreme sport overseas. He is, for lack of a better term, a professional athlete.  He has plans for the future, which I was excited about, but he has confessed to me that his latest venture is essentially a suicide mission, and he is not expecting to return from his next trip. 

I have offered to go overseas with him, but he doesn't want me to; I am not proficient enough in the sport to follow him, anyway. I check in with him nearly every day and tell him how much I love him constantly.  I know he doesn't really want to kill himself, because he's still alive, but he says that things keep getting worse.  He says he doesn't want to spread his wife's ashes because they should be together.

93,"TL;DR: We're in high school. I'm in the US. My friend who moved back to Japan after second grade contacted me via social media (I gave her my info in a letter) and we started talking, but she doesn't carry the conversation. I'm wondering if she's actually interested in reconnecting, or if she's just being polite?

More details:

I was best friends with someone who moved over to here in the States from Japan when we were in kindergarten. She learned English while in the States. She and her family then moved back to Japan at the end of second grade. They sent us a letter or two soon after that, and my family would send holiday cards too back when we still made them.

I never got around to writing my friend directly until middle school, and we exchanged a handful of letters once every few months over the last 4/5 years. Around September of last year I sent her a letter with my social media info, figuring she could just not initiate contact if she didn't want to. Late in December she followed me via Instagram, I sent her the first message, and we've been sending each other messages once every few days since then.

She answers my questions/messages, but she does not carry the conversation at all. The only time she asked me a question is when she asked how I'm doing, and has not introduced or mentioned anything new. I completely understand if she's not interested in reconnecting, but it seems odd to me to maintain contact but hardly put any effort in conversation.

Based on her writing, she has a solid grasp on English. She makes minor grammatical mistakes, especially with more complex sentences. For all I know it could take her several minutes just to write one sentence, which is why I'm wondering if I'm mistaking a language barrier for disinterest. Does she not like messaging me because she has to type in English? If I learned Japanese in order to talk to her, would she like that or would it be weird and clingy/obsessive? We're both into drawing so I sent her drawings of my favorite anime characters back in my middle school/early high school weeaboo days, so I don't want to seem like I'm only interested in talking to her because of anime.

Is she just being polite? Maybe she doesn't want to reconnect, but she feels guilty if she doesn't message me? Should I just (politely) stop carrying the conversation now and see if she still messages me?

Thank you for the advice",15Jan2020,1
94,"Two co-workers of mine are engaged in an affair that not only would easily get them fired, but one is married and there's a 30 year age gap. I, unfortunately, know too many details of this relationship and it's pretty toxic coming from the older party.  The younger wants out, but every time she ends it is manipulated back in - think ""but I love you too much"" ""I can't live without you"", ""god wants us to be together"" (that last one is especially painful). He's a big shot and has his own set of rules in the company, along with making a good deal of the rent money. They also work closely in the same group and are in close contact every day so it's hard to get away. Per her telling me all this he always weasels his way back - she's tried dumping him several times only for them to get back together within weeks. 

So know someone has finally contacted HR about it, but people talked and they got a heads up and laid low for a few weeks and nothing happened.

Basically... This is a very tiny summary of the past 2 years

My parents were together, new neighbors moved on the street (a family) 

My mom cheated on my dad with the dude neighbor.. The guy neighbor was also cheating on his wife..

My parents divorced..

My mom is still with that guy... Hes a dick, he Fights with her all the time (not physically) his 2 kids are annoying and dicks as well 

Then my dad met a girl.. Shes a bitch, terrible person, rude to everyone. Such a brat.. Her 2 kids are awful too

Because of my step mom and kids... My cat ran away (they were very mean to it.. Dont know how to treat him so he ran away) that cat was my best friend.. He was like 11 years old... I loved him... I swear i could like communicate with him thru emotion or smthn (it sounds corny but its true...) He was legit my best friend.. And he just left a few months after we moved in with my step mom...

We got rid of a lizard because ""she only wanted one""

We got rid of our dog because he turned mean... He was never a ""good dog"" always food aggressive.. But when we moved he went crazy and started snapping
I believe its because they all treated him like shit...

So now i have 1 lizard.. Thats all...

That is all the main huge points in the past 2 years... There's countless mini stories i can tell that kinda, ""ruined"" me..

Anyway.. That's brings us to present day...

I hate my families, id rather be at school.. 

My family just, changed..

My mom is rude af now. My stepdad is a dick to everyone... His sister and mom live with us and they are annoying af.. His kids are annoying and rude..

My dad is rude. My stepmom is controlling, bitchy, bratty, (list can go on) her kids as well

I usually feel depressed all the time, but always have an upbeat vibe, i try to be funny and entertaining..

A position comes up for relief team leader within that airline, I apply along with 3 other candidates. 
My backstory is, I’ve been on that airline on a 6 on 3 off pattern for the last two and a half years. I know the system and product inside out, been in almost every situation, I organise Christmas meals etc for the team, have a good relationship with everybody and genuinely work hard and help others as much as I can.
Everybody on the team encourages me to go for the position. 
Now two other girls who have applied have been with the company around 6 months or so, have a basic knowledge but good at picking things up and have been to university to study aviation and travel and tourism. 
The other candidate is a girl who had previous warnings for lateness, been there 6 months, basic knowledge of the product and shows little to no interest when placed in leadership roles, a nice girl all the same though. 
Over Christmas myself and one of the other girls have done some shadow team leader shifts. We both did a great job and the company was pleased. 
Our interviews roll around and I feel my interview went great, answered all the questions easily and gave examples of how I’ve helped employees with visa issues etc, how I’ve managed to save ground time on shadow shifts and how passionate I am about the airline and progressing. 

 Now the station manager for said airline is a well known pervert in short. He’s around 60 years old and enjoys the company of young girls in their 20’s, buying them gifts etc. 
The girl who has had warnings etc is very close with him. They’re from the same part of the same country, speak the same language and she sits in his office with the door closed at lunch times. He’s even asked if he could set her up with his nephew. 
Anyway, he’s promised this girl this position prior to interviews and overall shows her preferential treatment. 

Anyway we all have our interviews and guess who gets the job, this girl who’s favoured by the station manager. 
I feel as though the interview process was unfair as this girl already had the position promised to her, and overall feel cheated out of a chance to progress.

Is preferential treatment legal?",15Jan2020,1

It makes it difficult for me to bring up anything serious with my parents. So, I've usually put off confrontation about my issues as much as possible, thinking ""It's not too bad right now, I can wait"" even though I know that's a flawed mindset. Lately, though, things *have* gotten worse. I haven't even been able to hang out with my friends for months because they're busy all the time, and I'm separated from them at school because of our schedules. That, among other things, is really starting to get to me mentally. I know I need help. My friends know I need help. But I struggle so much to try to get it.

I know a lot of people would say ""You just have to go in and do it,"" or something along those lines. And I understand, there's not much else I can do. But if I can just get any other advice on how to make it easier I could really use it. I've seen recommendations like texting a parent while you've already left for school, so it's not as direct and they can't just go talk to you in your room once you send it; though I worry about the stress that would put on me throughout the day. Anything like that, though; advice on when/how to say it, how to phrase the question/conversation, whatever. I just need some help.",15Jan2020,1

111,"The family I am house/dog sitting for are spying on me via security camera &amp; I have physical proof (so far I’ve found 5 hidden cameras). I’m extremely uncomfortable &amp; don’t know to deal with this. I can’t leave as I’m dog sitting and I must care for the dogs whom I love. 

The proof is via text—

1.) I’m making dinner last evening around 6PM and the dogs, as dogs do, are begging for a scrap, so I sent the owner a photo of each dog being cute. In response, she texts ‘yay you brought back my jacket!’ (Which I accidentally brought home last time I house sat, and immediately told her &amp; said I’d bring it back next time I dog/house sit AKA yesterday—I wore the jacket to walk the dogs because I didn’t bring my own). The pictures I sent did not have the jacket in the background. Not a single one. The jacket was laid across the back of a chair, which is in front of a security camera I found.

2.) 9:08PM last night the dogs had to go out for a potty—they waited by the back door so I knew they were ready to evacuate their bladders/bowels. While they went for a potty, I also went for a potty (in the bathroom). At 9:12PM I get this text: 

 ‘Btw ... dog #1 is at the back door with Dog #2 waiting to come back in.’

113,"I hope I can keep this curt.

She has a huge amount of interest in raw veganism, juicing, yoga, sound healing; things within that vein. She also has a variety of digestive issues, so her health and adjacent topics is more or less all she talks about.

I, however, am a huge skeptic, and while I'm vegan, I'm more low-key. I don't really feel comfortable doing yoga in a class (let alone hot yoga, her preferred class, because I overhear easily). It's not that I'm not active; it's because I prefer to exercise alone.

Life is not easy, it's only my mom and I and I put this huge pressure on myself to be the best I can everyday at work and study hard to have a better life, like buy our own place and lower the risks of going through all the bad things we wen't through so far again. 

My GF lives with her parents, both of them work and are able to provide in full for her and for her brother. She's starting her own business selling cakes, but she's a much more laid back person, for example she says she doesn't wanna have an office job because she hates the pressure and all the toxic environment.

Because of how I am I unfortunately end up not messaging anyone including my girlfriend during work hours. Hell, I even neglect my own health if I need to go to the doctor but it's during work hours.

From the beginning I laid everything out to her. I told her I worked hard as fuck and that during work hours I simply ignore my phone if it's not work related. Even though I said that, every month it's the same thing, she get's sad because  I don't talk to her during work, only at night, but at night I'm studying, so we catch up on the weekends. When she gets near her period it gets even worse.

So today she came up to me and asked: what's your suggestion for me not to feel so sad about it?

And I simply didn't know what to say. Like, I don't wanna be rude, but she have a good life, her financial situation is stable, if things don't work for her her parents can still provide enough... you know? 

So I told her I was gonna think about it.

What would you do?

116,"First time posting but this is kind of a rant and just a vent, but I just have to let this out cause I'm so fucking pissed at myself and feel like absolute shit. For context, I'm a senior in high school applying near the end of the college application process. I've always hated school (or at least public school) and have always struggled to do well but fuck I worked my ass off to keep my grades good and take harder classes that interest me. I didn't care that much for the SAT mostly due to the fact of what I want to major and hopefully do with my life. Ever since I was a kid I've always wanted to become a filmmaker and make movies, that's all I've ever wanted to do. So, I was actually quite excited to apply for college but, like the dumbass I am, I didn't take it too seriously. I don't know if it was out of sheer incompetence or if I'm that fucking lazy but I ended up waiting last second to apply to my dream (and reach) schools (USC and NYU) which resulted in me creating shitty applications. Not only this but I took my other options of FSU and Chapman not super seriously and ended up fucking those two applications as well, Chapman I missed the deadline for their film school and FSU I selected the wrong major and realized it too late (Selected Media Production instead of Film Production which involved more supplements). I fucking hate myself! Why the fuck am I like this! Why the fuck can't I just take shit seriously like my life and dream! What the fuck is wrong with me!

Now I do think I am blowing this way over proportion as I did get into one of my top (and more likely) choices of Emerson as well Ringling. I've also applied to Virginia Commonwealth University and generally, I always saw myself as possibly going to Emerson as I enjoyed it when I took the tour. But fuck, I keep reading shit about film school and it terrifies me and it's making me think that I should have applied to more schools correctly and seriously. Fuck. I need to make movies in my life and I know schools aren't necessary for that but fuck I want to make those connections and gain those experiences so fucking bad and to leave my shit town which was always devoid of anything arts-related and took a more intensive STEM-related academic path. I don't know I guess I'm just asking for anyone who has any kind of experience with the film business or fucking up their college application if I'm just overblowing this.",15Jan2020,1
117,"So I have a crush on this guy at my school, I’ll call him H. H and I have similar personalities; we both like dark humor, love hugs, hopeless romantics, affectionate.  I have two classes with him and we have one mutual friend that i use as an excuse to talk to him. She offered to talk to him for me but I told her that I’d rather have him willingly ask me out then ask me out because I’m ok. I want someone who likes me enough to make the first move so I don’t get stuck with someone who doesn’t share my feelings.
He laughs at my jokes whenever we talk and we like to talk about movies and memes. I don’t have his number. 
However this happened:
H: I have (me) in fourth period. You’re friends with her, right? 
My other friend: yeah! She’s really cool!
H: yeah I like her jokes!

My other friend: you should date (me) 
H: yeahhhh, but I’m happy being single right now. 
His friend: yeah you guys have like the same personality. 

Also he complimented my hoodie!

I think this guy would be perfect for me. Also he’s been searching for a girl for a pretty long time to find the perfect one. Most girls have broken up with him because he’s “clingy.” I wouldn’t mind a clingy boyfriend at all, in fact, I’m also kinda clingy (not in an annoying way though) and I think we’d be happy. I also could be there for him because I’m not too busy for a relationship. 

How do I get into stronger conversations with him and even get an excuse to get his number? I don’t want him to know I like him though, because I want him to act on his own behalf instead of doing it just to take the opportunity. 
Also importantly, how do I get him to like me?
By the way, my flirting is weird; I went up to him and said, “hey sir, excuse me could I just - *boop* - thanks!” And I booped him in the stomach. He looked confused. Oh god why do I do this XD.

So my work is having a potluck that is Mexican food themed.  Most people are bringing stuff like queso, guac, cake, crunchy tacos with ground beef, etc.

And so I wanted to bring something different that’s also not very heavy and I thought about jaiva, which is like a crab ceviche.  I was excited because I remember my peers in HS LOVED it when my friend who is Mexican brought it for us to try.

So I signed up for it and went home.  When I came to work the next day, all of my co workers immediately told me that I’m “bringing something fancy” and then mentioned that one of the other workers “didn’t think it was real” because it’s not served at her favorite Tex Mex restaurants.  And after some of the others discussed what ceviche was with her, she was still not for it and was very adamant and told the others that she refused to even try it.

Now I’m hesitant to even bring it since I’m questioning if everyone else is turned off by the dish and that’s why they talked to me.  One of my friends that works there encouraged me to bring it and said that it would be okay, but I’m not sure now.  A part of my does want to bring it out of spite and pettiness.

126,"Okay so hear me out please.

BACKGROUND:

I'm the golden child of my family, no bragging, basically it means that I was everything my parents and others would ever wish. I was planned, as a kid I was quiet, modest, and thoughtful. I was that kid with brilliant grades that nailed chess, that kid who never made a fuss of anything, that kid who always did the chores neatly and knew how to respond properly to every question any grown up had.  

I was always seen as the Good seed, the one with potential between my siblings and even classmates.

And I liked it.

I loved being adored, hearing always ""Follow her example, you'll learn something from her"", ""Excellent as always! Why am I not surprised?"", ""You'll do amazing things one day"", ""In whatever you choose you'll succeed, it's a guarantee."", ""How's my brilliant student?"", ""Who loves you? Your family of course, my little daughter.""

It wasn't until the 9th grade when everything started to change for me. It wasn't the people who changed but me. I started noticing how different I actually was from others, in an unhealthy way.

I noticed that where other had liberty I didn't. That you could actually choose how you dress, what to eat, how to style your hair, how to crack jokes, your style, etc. That my dad's shouts ,harsh critics and psychological abuse weren't actually okay.

I noticed that as a Golden child, slowly but surely, people, specially my parents, were raising their expectations , putting all their dreams on me and trying to control every single aspect of my life because they would never bear seeing me messing things up. That year I discovered that all my happiness wasn't real but just pleasant moments to cover my growing anxiety and depression of having all that pressure to be what they want me to be but never letting me discover who I was. That me neglecting all of that was a result of constant grooming from my parents telling me how ""it's just the hormones or common stress from school.""

It hit me that I actually didn't know who I was. All was just a product of what people wanted me to be, how I was subconsciously forced to be someone ""perfect"" ,and since I never was allowed to make that myself, I always thought that that was my truly persona. This realization was devastating and made my life emotionally draining. At some point I thought maybe it was all just in my head and I'll just need some therapy to get me back on track. I discussed this with my mom, her reply? ""Sorry, we can't get you mental care, your dad doesn't believe in it. Besides, other's have it worst. Sort it out on your own, you'll be fine, you always are.""

All those ""errors"" I was letting be shown and trusted to my parents would only set them off edge, deny them and just try to control me more to ""fix it"".

It felt like I was some sort of project,and just last year I was proved to be correct.

Remember when I was told ""In whatever you choose you'll succeed, it's a guarantee."", well, that's bullsh#t. 

DILEMMA:

I chose to become a biomedical engineer and when I told my parents things when straight down hell. That was the first ""disappointing"" answer I ever gave them. They threw my opinion out and basically told me I'll be studying Business Administration because they strategically knew it would be the best option for everyone. NOTE THIS, EVERYONE (them).

So, plan was that since  I was the golden child I'm the most suitable to be heiress of my dad's company, and when my dad is too old then I'll be in charge to keep financially well my family until my parents die or my siblings have their own jobs. I won't be allowed to move out form my house, nor to work at any other sort of job, or have a license or bank account until they were super sure I couldn't double cross them. 

I asked why was I then filled with the naive believe that I had a choice in the first place, they just said they didn't want me to sabotage anything. I asked why not biomedicine, since it gives good cash and its what i want, she told me I won't survive the outside world and that I'm better staying here, safe, sound, with my family, and with wealth. That sometimes, dreams lead to failure and the unexpected. That I should be grateful for having this opportunity not many have, to not be selfish.

Now I'm torn. I don't know if I should just leave and be called selfish; or stay and live as a life doormat. I know all consequences of whatever I choose yet I'm still unable to pick one. This could change my life forever.

I'm a 19 year old who has no direction or motivation. I have no work experience.
 I have some mental issues that make it difficult for me to attend school for long periods of time. I decided to not attend Uni/college for the time being as my family needs some more income.


With these thoughts in my mind as I was struggling through High school, many people told me that skilled trades are a good option. After graduating, I attended a Pre-Apprenticeship program for electrical and am now job searching.

At first, I thought for sure that this was the way to go for the next few years in my life as I didn't really enjoy my time at the program, but it was manageable. 


Recently though, I've been having second thoughts about all of this. I'm not sure if I would be able to handle a construction site job environment (I don't like loud noise) and the stress of not being able to meet a deadline might be too much for me (Can't even handle going to school). I'm also physically weak so I'm not sure if I can help much. 


I decided to consider some alternatives one being a certain Computer Hardware store (Canada Computers) as I have the most experience with computers and not stuff like clothes. I remember going there and finding the atmosphere to be pretty good. I know people say retail isn't the best type of work but people say that about almost every job.

For me, the priority isn't really money or fulfillment, it's just finding something to do because I realized that staying at home isn't healthy for me.

Sorry for this terribly written rant.

TL;DR: I'm unmotivated and I don't know what to do with my life. I thought I wanted to become an Electrician but after thinking about it I'm not sure anymore and I'm considering a retail job at a computer hardware store (Canada Computers).

I want to figure out what type of person my father is and why he did what he did. What fueled his rage? 
I think being able to put a label on him might help me understand and give me some sort of explanation why we  had to suffer so much.

I’ll try to keep it short.

One of my earliest memories is my father beating and yelling at my mother, the police being called, him trying to run and after a few days in jail my mom brought him back. 
He was a teacher, very strict, liked to withdraw love and manipulate my sister and I to turn against each other by setting us up for failure and getting us to tell on each other. 
Four year old me didn’t like to eat fish but I was forced, So I came up with the idea to stuff all of what was left in my mouth, ask to go to the toilet and spit it out. Well he found out and I was given the choice between the belt and walking barefoot in the snow while my mother and he watched until he deemed I had gotten my deserved punishment. 
The cold seems to be one of his favorite methods of punishment. He locked my mother on the balcony in winter and had her sleep outside. Once on Christmas years later he threw her out again and didn’t let us have the little books she brought us as gifts. To this day this is the event that breaks my heart the most. 
My mother was very vulnerable, she was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder years ago but I don’t know what kind of symptoms she had back then. 

My father used to have riding crops on the wall in his office but I don’t remember being hit with them, though I know for certain he didn’t ride horses. When I was around 4 my mom was away sometimes and I was alone with him. When I didn’t eat properly one day, he cut off all of my long hair while I was whaling. 
After my mom, sister and I had gone on vacation without him because he had changed his mind and tried to mess with our car to prevent us from leaving, we came back to changed locks and where forced to live with neighbors until we lived in a women’s shelter. After some time he somehow convinced my mother to come back though and hell continued. 
He also convinced a social worker, that came into our house and asked us kids questions, to tell on us or she was just completely incompetent. 
When I was 3 my sister and I were left with my fathers mother for half a year because of something with my mother and that’s when I learned where he got all this from. 
My grandmother didn’t let my sister have her crutches when she injured her foot, didn’t let her face the table during meals if she had a wrong look on her face and locked me (3 y old) in the dark bathroom on a barstool that I was too small and too afraid to get off on my own. 

So yeah what do you think. Why did this happen? What fueled his rage ? Could this be narcissism? Is he just a cold antisocial person ?
I just want answers.

(My foster mother thinks he is a narcissist because he openly stated he doesn’t care if he makes me feel hurt during a phone call. doesn’t seem affected by any of his actions and still likes to exert power over us by withholding pictures and so on. He does seem to have a fragile ego as well.)",15Jan2020,1
137,"Hi. Essentially, my question is, should I take advantage of economic privilege?

I""m not so far out of college and my family still helps me with a lot of my finances. Food and phone are taken care of by my parents because they can, and I could use it (I work for a non-profit, and they don't mind, and it doesn't cost them much). My monthly budget accounts for everything else - commuting, laundry, utilities, savings, a charity donation, and rent. Now, all of that is moot because my grandfather pays my rent. I never asked him to, but he likes helping me out and is very well off. Because of his help, i can effectively put a month's rent of salary into savings every month.

I've been thinking lately about getting a gym/sports club membership. Really, I can't/shouldn't afford it because doing so would be using money I should put to saving. So the question is, knowing I get help, can/should I spend money that's available, or should I act as though I'm on a tight budget and not pay for the membership?",15Jan2020,1
138,i’m a 13 year old and i play basketball even i really don’t like it. growing up i played basketball and baseball. i’ve quit baseball because it got boring and i decided to start playing actual basketball. i’ve played basketball all my life and people say i’m good. tbh i’m not that good as people say i am tho. i feel like people just say it because my dad and brother are athletic. i play middle school basketball and i really don’t enjoy it. i’m decent at it but i get nervous and i feel like i’m not good enough to play sometimes. i always practice but it seems to not have helped. we’re 0-9 and i don’t score that much. and it does get boring sometimes with annoying teammates who get mad at u for no reason. it just gets boring sometimes. the reason i haven’t quit is because i wouldn't have any sports to do in high school and that means my parents would probably be mad at me. my parents tell me that their okay with me not playing any sports but i know their lying. i like playing sports casually but not competitively. and they would probably think if i quit sports i’d be on electronics all day which isn’t true. i don’t know what to do. i don’t want to play a sport i dislike for the rest of my middle school and high school years. but i don’t want to upset my parents. if i stopped playing people would also think that i’m a quitter and they’d think less of me. what should i do because i’m getting really stressed over this?,15Jan2020,1
139,"Alright, so I’m 23F. Never worked a real job in my life. My “job” has always been being a full-time student (and I excel in my studies).

Recently I became a grad student. My schooling was fully covered by the post 9-11 GI Bill (housing, supplies, ect) and scholarships (I have all highest possible honors). 

But because of a change in my grad program, and a possible job, the amount the VA paid for my grad school (thus far— 15,000) will be due back in full. Additionally, before we knew this, my parents purchased a well-bred poodle (2,000– I know, expensive, but she is practically guaranteed to have no medical/ behavioral problems) as my undergraduate graduation gift. 

I should start teaching the undergrad next semester (and get a stipend), but I want to stop being such a leech on my parents and learn how the fuck to support myself. I’m an artist and make decent (200-300 a week) doing commissioned work, and I’m not sure if I can deal with a full-time job as my grad program demands many hours— should I look anyway?

140,"I belong to an international WhatsApp group, where I've met many people, some of whom I've know for months and even years. There is one member there who I connected to a lot in the last 6 months or so, and he also became close to some of our other members pretty quickly.

So, since 10 days ago he disappeared completely, without any warning. He hasn't been online either on WhatsApp nor on Snapchat, so much so he hasn't even received our messages, much less read and replayed to them. We are all confused and wondering what to do, and we understand that can happen with online friendships, but it looks so out of character for him, we can't help but being worried something happened. 

So I have been thinking to myself about this option of sending him a letter, just to say we care about him and give him other information of where and how to contact us if he wants to. Problem is, I don't have his full name or address, although I have enough information I could maybe identify him online and definitely find people he knows online as an alternative, and then could maybe send them the letter and ask them to get it to him.

Obviously, that feels invasive though, so I am not sure about whether that is a good option. I wonder if that'd be too much, or if it makes sense to you guys? A letter would be a way to make ourselves available while also giving him the option to reply or not. My concern, to be blunt, is that something happened to him health-wise, that we might not be informed if people who know him don't get to know about us.

Just so you know, I'm thinking about it but I'd not be sending it before a while, say a month or so, if he continues ""disappeared"". I could also look for local newspapers from his town before doing it, or do you guys think I'm overreacting? 

TL;DR: friend from online group vanished without trace. Should I try to sent him a real life letter or not? Worried it might be invasive, specially considering we don't have all his data and would have to either search more information about him or send it to someone he knows irl.",15Jan2020,1

I lived in Italy for an extended period of time with my family and I was over the age of 18, however I spent that time taking care of my grandfather in our home so I did not have a job. Job gaps in Italy are not the same as they are here in the USA, they are much more serious here. It never occurred as an 18 year that I would need any kind of proof explaining why I needed to take care of my grandfather. He is my family and that is common practice there.

They are requiring this letter to be on company letter head, written by a non-family member, written and hand signed by someone who can verify the reason for the gap while validating the dates. 
We owned the house and car so had no loans or landlords. We lived off of his previous income/savings so we did not have any co-workers I could ask.

146,"Hello! 

Before going to college I had a big fight with a few members of my high school friend group which made me split off from that group of friends and have kinda left me mentally traumatized. 

During my first semester of college I've met a lot of amazing people that have honestly changed my life and I have come to love every moment I'm with them.  

However, during a break, me and my family met one of the people I had it worst with in the group. I tried really hard to basically act like they don't exist, but my mom noticed and now she's always asking what happened between me and my past friend group.

It's really something in the past that I wanna leave behind and I don't really want to share with my mom what happened. How do I communicate that it's something I don't want to talk about and that I'm fine and better off with not having them as friends? She's stubbornly believes that high school friends are really the only ones that stick around cause her friends are all from high school (that being said she came to the US for college so it would make sense that she believes college friends arent much) and me losing them means ill be lonely forever lmao. She also won't take my answer of ""sometimes friendships fall apart and thats that"" and demands an explanation of what happened lol. I ain't that emotionally open with my parents so I'm having a lot of trouble talking with her about this.

148,"I graduated undergrad in May 2019, so it hasn't been a full year since I graduated college, nonetheless I'm so unsure of what to do with my life. I'll explain it the best I can:

I was raised by a single mom. We often had financial issues and food was a privilege. Despite our struggles, I was incredibly blessed to be accepted into a prestigious college. The tuition was sky high, but the education was great. I maintained a work-study job for 2 years that payed about $180 every two weeks. I couldn't work more because my course load was tough and I didn't want my GPA to suffer. I had scholarships, but the money either went to my fees or my research/internships. All in all I was still broke in college and used any money I had to support myself or help my mom. My plans after college were this:

Plan #1: Before I graduated I was accepted into 2 really great master's programs. The one I decided on was across the country where my aunt stayed. It was a research masters and I didn't need to be there full time, just some weeks out of the year. My aunt had always told me that she would do anything to help me and after asking to stay with her a few weeks out of the year, she gives me a confident (but tentative) yes. 1 month goes by and I'm still making preparations for school when all of a sudden my aunt redacts her offer and I eventually have to unenroll from my program.

Plan #2: Since I'm no longer going to grad school, I start looking for jobs - this is around June 2019. I don't get a job offer until October 2019. I'm excited because it's in my desired field. However upon completion of my first week, I knew it was a bad fit. The work culture was very toxic and I end up staying just a mere 2 months until December 2019.

Present day: It's January 2020 and I was offered a temp job that's pays base minimum wage. I need the job because money is low, my student loans are due, and I have $0 in savings. Problem is I cannot afford to keep the job. The commute is about 1.5 - 2hrs daily and costs me a fortune in transportation. I want to keep the job but I cannot afford the commute with pay being minimum wage. 

Honestly I don't know how people do it. I have yet to get a car, savings, or anything substantial at 23. I feel like a serious failure because I have yet to find a good job. I have experience, skills, connections, but I'm either overqualified or underqualified and until I get my master's I'm stuck in a salary limbo because my specialty is humanities, not something lucrative like STEM.

155,"Alright, my brother is excellent on a piano and my dads the same at the drums, my sister sings and I have always wanted to pick up an instrument. My first choices are between guitar, piano, drums, or trumpet but I really don’t know which one of any. 
I think a piano sounds great and I would love to be good at it but I would probably never be as good as my brother and might not be able to play when everyone’s together.

And while drums sounds good, and I would be able to play when my dad didn’t want to I don’t think I would enjoy playing it by myself

Next up is trumpet and I do have one of them, I honestly can’t think of a major reason not to play besides it not being able to go with any song and not being able to find one to play in public.

Lastly I have the guitar, it fits almost everything in laid out besides being able to play in public ( free use ones at train stations, airports, hotels, etc) but it sounds great, acoustic or electric.

156,"So funny enough, my boyfriend and I met on reddit some months ago, and so far things have been going great. The reason we started talking was that we were both kinda lonely and in search of someone to be close to, however not necessarily in a romantic way. The reason we decided to keep talking was because he informed me that he and his family had plans to visit not only my country, but coincidentally my CITY with his parents over the holidays. Obviously we couldn't let an opportunity like that go to waste, and we kept talking, letting the chemistry build up. Long story short, we ended up meeting while he was here and we got along extremely well. We had liked each other for a couple of months by that point, and we both knew it. But that was the night we decided to make it official and he asked me to be his girlfriend. Of course I said yes. The distance is temporarily an issue, but it won't be for long as I have planned for about two years now to study abroad and get my bachelor's done in Europe (not his country, but about an hour's plane ride away) so it's not like we're just blindly walking into this without thinking everything through. In my eyes, we are being realistic about our relationship, and the whole long-distance thing hasn't even been as hard as I thought. 

Anyway, to the point. After he left, we obviously both missed each other a ton, and since I'm going to be graduated by the end of this month and since he's already been to my country, we decided that we wanted to plan for me to come to him (he's still in school but he has a one week break at some point in February). Anyway, he's already mentioned this to both of his parents and they are both very supportive about it and on board with letting me stay in their home for a week. My mother however, is very overprotective. Unlike his parents, she doesn't even know I'm dating someone, nevermind someone who lives on the other side of the world. The thing is though, the problem to my mom isn't that I have a boyfriend- She's actually super excited about that. It's the fact that I met him over the internet, and so obviously he's gonna kidnap and murder me, right? I was talking to him on the phone some months ago at 1am (stupid timezones) and of course she flips the fuck out asking ""who are you talking to"" ""why are you talking to strangers on the internet at 1am"" ""how do you know it's not a 40 year old neckbeard in his mom's basement"" and so on. I get it, I'm her kid, she loves me, and sometimes teenagers can be naive, especially when the opposite sex is involved. However, we had been talking for quite a long time before doing our first call, loooong reddit PM's which then turned into emails about our lives, interests, past histories and so on.  I was pretty confident about who I was messaging, and hearing his voice for the first time confirmed it. We of course got along great. Showed me how to play some videogames, showed me some memes his friends and he made, just talking about anything and everything etc. Just dumb harmless stuff until my mother busted in and embarrassed me with the interrogation. Anyway, we continued to call and communicate, snapchatted each other, we had multiple photos of each other at this point and know we're who each other say we are. I just make sure to be super quiet when we call now and do it later when everyone is sleeping.

This is how it goes until we meet. (We met twice, both times I told her I was out with a friend) Went great, we slap a label on it, my mom doesn't contact me once. We met once more while he was in my country, and this time my mom was blowing up my phone because she didn't believe me that I was out with a friend this time. I come clean, tell her I'm on a date, and to please, please just leave me alone as she's embarrassing me. She apologizes, leaves me alone for about half an hour, then starts FREAKING out because for some reason she got it into her head that I'd be unable to find my way home. She's yelling at me over text, calling and calling over and over again, threatening to drive out herself and get me etc. I seriously have no idea what I did to provoke this (other than not telling her I was on a date) but oh well, that's my mom, nothing new. I get home, she's calm until she tells me to sit at the table and I do. She asks how it went, if he's my boyfriend, how I know him etc. and obviously I'm not going to say I went and met up with the same boy she had such a problem with me talking to before online, as I know she'd freak. She even said herself ""the reason I hate you talking to people on the internet so much is because my biggest fear is that you'll go and meet them in real life"" which is exactly what I did, BUT I made sure I knew him enough and trusted him enough BEFORE doing that and we also met up in a very public place. So I told her it was an exchange student from my school, we walked around together in the evening to which she reacted poorly to as well, telling me as a girl I could have been raped and murdered and so on. Honestly, I get it's a threat and a possibility, but come on. Walking around in a public place with a boy? Possible? Sure. Likely? I don't think so. And ever since then she's been off my back, because whenever I'm on a call with my boyfriend, I tell her it's the same ""exchange student"" I went on a date with. I get that it's bad to lie and for most people, just telling the truth would have been a lot easier in the long run, but with my mom and the way she is, I feel as if I just didn't have another choice. She pretty much forbade me from talking to my boyfriend (before he was my boyfriend) because I just happened to meet him on the internet and nor irl. I told her everything she wanted to know about him, too. His name, his age, where he was from, why we talked to each other, etc. and she still wouldn't leave me alone. But as soon as I told her that it was the exchange student I was talking to, he literally had zero problem with me talking to him and even encouraged it. Now, however, I HAVE met him in real life.

I'll be 18 this year, and I genuinely think she's being overbearing. I find myself feeling suffocated a lot of the time, and I'm just so tired of it. Please help me out. His parents know I exist. They're on board with me coming to visit. He's a year older than me. I've met him in real life. But I just DON'T know how to tell this to my mom. I want to go and see him like you wouldn't believe, he makes me so happy and I just want to be with him. I don't want to wait until I'm a ""legal adult"" to go and do that. He's already getting a bit anxious about booking tickets and stuff. The problem here is I've sort of weaved myself into this lie with the exchange student and I don't know how to tell my mom the truth. I really just want her to let me go. Anyone else have overprotective parents, and if so, how do you deal with them? How do I get my mom on board with this?",15Jan2020,1

Her family (dad &amp; siblings) live in Pennsylvania (we live in Atlanta) so I thought about throwing an over the top, huge birthday party and inviting all of them?... 

Any stories or suggestions? TIA, Reddit!",15Jan2020,1
169,"My best friend just got engaged and while all I want is for her to be happy, it doesn't sit well with me. She (26) was with her bf (31) for less than 2 years before they recently got engaged, then celebrated that anniversary, and now want to be married before the end of the year. Less than 3 years together before tying the knot. I guess some people do it this fast, and I guess sometimes short relationships can have a greater impact than long ones, but in my mind there are so many other things to take into account, such as:

- I don't think I've ever seen her really stand up for herself and/or get what she wanted in a relationship (or otherwise tbh)
- Her boundaries are...? Strange? Do not serve her like boundaries should? Non existent?
- While her man seems like a generally good, patient, caring dude who can't wait to spend the rest of his life with her, I feel like she's still in the honeymoon phase and won't be able to see past the rose-tinted glasses for a while in order to have serious adult conversations with him about their lives together
- She's too nice to be honest in said conversations (and I say this because she's been too nice to be honest in her feelings with me, who really doesn't get bother by people's honesty and who has known her for literally her entire life)
- She has been *IN*LOVE* with every boyfriend she's had since early high school, was determined to marry at least the last three (damn near proposed to the last one herself), and ended up getting her heart badly broken every time. I think for her to go through another heartbreak, especially when marriage is a very real and attainable goal, would be truly devastating, like, depression spiral and maybe hospitalization devastating
- I don't see a lot of independence in her life: her mom is still on her bank accounts to track spending even though she has a whole ass career, her mom is constantly checking in either thought phone calls or tracking her phone, she has gone from boyfriend to boyfriend since she began dating and constantly hooked up in between, and has never lived on her own for any significant amount of time (a week or two at most)

I feel like that sounds like I'm trying to put her under a microscope or being overly harsh, but I just need some help (and clearly some peace of mind considering the length of this post). Idk if I should start a conversation or stay shut up and just be happy for her. I'm not trying to come at this with any judgment or even to say that short dating periods or engagements can't end in long and happy marriages, but any advice, personal anecdotes, or tips on how to get the convo rolling or to get her to just mayyybe take a step back from the whirlwind of this relationship and be able to see a little more clearly is greatly appreciated.

TL/DR: Best friend getting married too fast - how can I talk to her about this w/o being a dick?",15Jan2020,1

This will be long, so buckle up. I am in desperate need of advice. This is a throw away since people involved have my normal username. 

Back story: 
I was molested as a child and sexually assaulted multiple times over the 29 years I have been alive. I also come from an extremely conservative family with closed minds and heavy bible thumping beliefs. I have known since I was a child that I was bisexual(were talking like 80% into chicks and 20% dudes). I had a girlfriend when I was younger but when my family found out they crushed that and I’ve had sexual and emotional bonds with females so yes, I’m sure. It has been ingrained in me since birth that not only is masturbation and sex bad(until marriage), but that if you like anything outside of the standard norm, you’re going to hell and that you’re only seeking attention. My family does not know I’m bi/gay(obviously) and only a select few close people know currently(to include my husband). 

Needless to say, I have a lot of weird emotions/anxieties/issues that come with my sexuality and sexual acts. Over the past couple of years I have really been trying hard and focusing a large part of my attention on dealing with the childhood trauma(heavy mental abuse and some physical abuse) part of that involves dealing with the sexual abuse as well. As I have come to terms with things I have noticed that I’m more open about my wants/needs in the bedroom and finally starting to break out of this shell of “sex is bad” “I’m gross” “hide my body” “do what your partner wants because your wants don’t matter(not that I knew my wants in the first place). I’m starting to “find myself” in this sexual realm and it’s stirring up a lot of other things. During this exploration, I have started to notice that the bisexual side of me is starting to turn further toward lesbianism.

I have been with my husband for 11 years. He is my best friend, my go to, my rock, and I do love him(just have fallen out of love) I have been unhappy in my marriage for several years now although my husband is so blind he thinks that things are fine(yes, I have told him they’re not). We do have a 6 year old child together. As stated above, he knows that I am bi. When I came out to him he told me he was concerned for what my sudden realization meant. He didn’t want me to go out exploring that side of myself(meaning don’t sleep with women or start dating on the side or leave him). I never intended to do any of these but find myself wanting a relationship with a woman more and more. 

I have thought about leaving my husband. I should note here, he has had a history of sporadic abusive behaviors. He has slapped me, almost punched me in the face, used to break things, holes in walls, etc.(Please don’t tell me how dumb I am for not leaving then, I know.) I have noticed an increase in abusive behaviors as his stress increases or he loses control of a situation. He is nowhere near where he was once. Even though there hasn’t been any issues in years my hidden fear of him still remains. On top of this I’m not in love with him anymore and I think we both deserve more. He does not see things this way. He claims he is never been more in love with me. 

I was venting to a friend recently and they asked me “what would make you happy? It seems like he’s trying so I don’t understand” And ever since I have really been focusing a lot of energy onto that question. When I look at the big picture, my husband is not a bad dude. He doesn’t clean well which seems to be a common issue and he struggles bonding with our child but overall he takes care of me and has been really supportive lately and working through things with me. So what’s wrong with me? I started thinking further and realizing that a large portion of this failing marriage is on me. I’m struggling so hard with my sexuality. I’m constantly thinking about if my husband was a woman would I be happier? On top of things I have this insane anxiety that if I ask for a divorce he will either snap and turn abusive to either myself and/or our child or that he’ll do something drastic like kill himself. I still want what’s best for him but my one and only priority is my child and ensuring that he’s safe with the smallest amount of emotional scarring by this. I will also note, my husband relies on me financially currently. Should I ask for counseling? In house Separation(since he would be unable to afford something elsewhere)? Go straight for divorce? I have no idea what to do with my life anymore. I’m so lost.",15Jan2020,1

I play high school football. I’m going to be a senior in my next season and I’ve noticed I literally get no respect by my teammates even some of the lower skilled ones have no regard for my past accomplishments on this team. I’m literally the only tight end on the entire team. I feel as though I have that outsider mentality just based on the position that I play. I’m not as fast as the receiver guys but not as strong as the lineman types. I always thought that was the beauty of my position. Fast enough to do damage on short to medium routes but also to be an adept enough blocker to help in the run game but my so called teammates don’t see it like this. Not to mention I’m one of the only guys on the team with a girlfriend which I surprisingly get teased about from time to time. Another thing to mention is I’m a tall guy.

177,"Hello, I would like to preface this by saying I am not pregnant.

I've had this issue for as long as I can remember, and I have no idea what causes it. It can happen at any time, and it lasts for about 10-30 minutes. It's not just an aversion to certain foods within this time, it's specifically that any and all food I see or smell within that timeframe repulses me. 

It's not unbearable, I can still eat, and while the sight and smell of food is repulsive in that timeframe, strangely taste is unaffected, so if I get past the initial repulsion I can still eat.

It's not connected to hunger ethier, I can be starving and then suddenly be hit with this repulsion (and still be hungry), or not want to eat anyway and still be randomly grossed out by the sight/smell of food.

181,"I'm at a point where I know very little about what is going on and I'm left in the dark to fit the pieces together, I'll try to explain the best I can.

A little less than a month ago, I had a very close and beloved family member, lets call him null was incarcerated on a seemingly absurd drug charge (found with several kilograms of a schedule 1 drug). The only thing we've heard from null about what happened according to him at this point was that they were in a car with a man we have no idea of his identity and asked null to pull over to go to the bathroom where minutes after he got detained by a police officer and searched where they found the drugs in his car . Null is easily the most noble, hardworking man I've ever met. Toiling for years to get the high paying respectable job he had. He had a clean criminal record until now which is why this is such a shock to me. Recently however, 2 members of the family received a call by a Latino man asking where null was in Spanish. They both were scared to say the least and hung up. A couple days later one of the family gets another call from seemingly another man stating that they know us so they're going to be ''Kind'' to us but if we fall out of line or refuse to cooperate they will send in someone to kill all of us. Saying this has had everyone on edge is a vast understatement because not only does this imply that they know who we are but also they have hold of our information. Now this is where I ask for advice, what can I do to ensure my family's safety and what precautions can I take that don't involve law enforcement?",15Jan2020,1

On the Ookla Speedtest, download speed went from \~50 Mbps to \~25 Mbps and upload speed went from \~9 Mbps to \~7 Mbps.

Could be small things like just skipping a family dinner to spend time with me or really big things like changing travel plans for me or moving towns for me. The bigger the invest, the more I'm put off by it and the more I tend to pull back because of it.
Now I've always rationalized this as me wanting them to stay true to their goals, plans and who they are. Protecting them in a way. But I've been thinking two things lately - 1. don't people do that for people they like all the time (and shouldn't you be super hyped about someone investing that much into you), 2. isn't it somewhat condesending, me thinking I know better what they want then they do.

The one friend I do have doesn’t like that kind of music.

I have these guys I work with that really enjoy the same type of music, they’re cool with me and when they found out I was single they talk to me more (they just found out a couple days ago) they haven’t asked me to hangout outside of work so that’s stopping me from asking them to come along with me.

187,"After three years of emotional struggles between me and my now ex-gf, yesterday I finally said enough is enough and cut her out of my life blocking her on everything. And yet, even after making my decision, I still have the lingering sense of loneliness and depression like the first time I lost her. 

We had broken up in late 2017 after I found out she was dating someone else behind my back. We were together for almost 2 years then when this happened. Unfortunately both of us are very stupid and didn't know what breaking up actually meant. We kept texting each other. Then we would hang out in secret, since my friends would always roast the shit out of me when they'd see me with her (rightfully so.) We were on and off at that point. I wanted our old, loving relationship back, and she only wanted me around as a second option for when her new boyfriend would act up. 

I was used. Literally. I degraded myself down to that point and I don't want to be that guy anymore. She would rely on me for emotional support after I stood up for myself. Guilt tripping me with her family's financial status and health. Even after we came to terms with each other, she'd indirectly pressure to getting back with her. 

Now she's gone and I want to make sure I don't make the same mistake again. I want to keep myself from coming back to her everytime life gets hard. I want to move on, and any help that one could give me to stay above water is worth so much to me. Thank you",15Jan2020,1

Now he has pretty much phantomed. After months, I requested my money back through the same platform I paid him on, and the day I did that he actually responded. He said he had been locked up on some bogus weed charges, and he would send the files. He did not again.

Now it’s been like 8 months since I originally commissioned him. At this point I don’t even know if I want them. I dunno if he’s an idiot or an asshole. It seems like he is just really bad at following through. I requested the money back again and no reply this time. 

Would it be inappropriate to do a little public shaming to try to kick his ass into gear? Would it be crazy to just use some of his other art without technically having the permission?

One day I came driving home from school and I noticed a woman in a blue van sitting at the end of my driveway. My house has the only driveway on this tiny stub of a road so I know she wasn’t there for another home. Because of this, I couldn’t access my driveway so I had to sit in my car, right in front of her, until she moved. When she drove past, she waved. It was very weird. This happened a few more times, I would come home and see her sitting there. Every time she only left once she saw me there, and waved when she went by. I told my parents about her. One time when my whole family was leaving the house, she pulled up a stopped at the end of our driveway. My dad ran to ask what she was doing and she drove away very fast. We ran her license plates and found out it was a woman who lives down the street, but why wouldn’t she ever talk to us, and why was she always sitting at our house. My neighbors have even seen this lady sitting outside our house and taken pictures of her. 
        Another time when my younger sisters were home alone, a man in a black car parked outside the house and rang the doorbell repeatedly. They didn’t answer and he went away. The next day I was home alone and he came up to the door again, rang the bell, I didn’t answer, and he left. He came back about 30 minutes later. I never answered the door. 
          One time while I was working for an office, I was all alone and a man came inside asking weird questions (that I don’t remember) about the business He was holding his phone in a way that suggested he was either recording me or taking photos. 
           Today, while outside walking my dog, a car came down our street and sat in the intersection looking right at my house/me. After a few minutes he circled around the intersection and sat there even longer until I stared at him, and he left.

My boyfriend, let's call him ""B"" is pretty affluent and doesn't have to work a job because his parents own multiple ""Ace hardware"" stores around the area I live in. So he offers me to go on a trip with him to North Arizona (We live in Phoenix) and I say ""sure why not"" and we head off the following weekend and stay in a nice resort. Well the day comes that we leave and he wants to go even further up north to a area with more snow and I say ""sure why not"" well everything is going fine but he wanted me to drive the entire time which I don't mind at all... Just one little problem, I only have my permit because my license was coming in the mail the day I was leaving (my permit was expired by months and months) . I'm simply never got it. So we're going along and a truck pulls in front of us and I have to slow down to about 30 when I was going highway speed (the correct speed limit for that road) and the guy waves me along, well about 15 minutes later I see a cop pull behind me and I'm going the correct speed limit and he signals me to pull over (I'm sweating bullets at this point but I look fine on the surface) he comes up to the car and asks if I know why he's pulling me over to which I respond "" No, I have no idea."" And he says that I passed on a solid yellow line, well I I have no recollection of that, and in the condition that the road was in I couldn't even see that it was a solid yellow line. Well long story short he doesn't even notice that my permit is expired by months and months but rather gives me a ticket. I'm just not sure how I'm gonna explain that entire situation to my mother, I almost wanna fight the ticket because The cop was nowhere to be seen and I know that the coconino county officers don't have dash cams nor body cams.

Im currently renting a garage space from my step mother I pay $500 of the $1600 rent. Here are the problems.

She only allows one guest over (my girlfriend)
There is one bathroom that she does not clean and leaves Pampers and clothes on the floor
My garage space does not have flooring (just wood that I can get splinters on if I walk barefoot. And my brother has already got one and she doesnt let them in here. (Its been three months)
I have access to the living room but it's a total mess all of the time kids toys and even a slide there.

She is really lazy and doesnt want to get up in the morning so the kids run around making noise until 1am every night (I have to get up at 4am for work)

I asked if my girlfriend can move in she said she would have to pay $300!!? Extra on top of the $500 I'm paying 

And not only that the internet which was agreed to be in the agreement has been off for 3 days


Am I being taken advantage of or should I be grateful I live in Denver and can find something about the same for maybe $100-$200 more

The only benefit is if I lose my job I can pay rent by babysitting. I can help her stay afloat and I live very close to the light rail (train).",15Jan2020,1

213,"I moved into a new house 1 week ago, and I’m still setting up electric, water, internet etc, and unpacking boxes.
I had my empty gas tanks replaced yesterday morning but because I know nothing about gas systems I thought it’d work immediately after they were replaced with new tanks, which isn’t how they work. I called my landlord at 8:30pm, (as she is the person who arranges it all) and she tried giving me instructions over the phone; said “the top of the gas tanks are connected by a red lever, turn the lever to open the lines”, I told her there was nothing red at all on the tanks that I could see. She’s getting frustrated with me and tells me “calm down, use your eyes to look for it, theres a red lever. It’s red. It’s at the top of the gas pipes.” Again, I say there’s nothing red there at all, and there’s no lever. She responds with “look, just stop, calm down and look for the red lever. If you want ill drive over and fix it now”. She lives 30mins away so I told her “no, I’ll be ok until the morning, the house isn’t looking great and I want to go to bed soon” and so the 1hr round trip isn’t needed, (I’m Australian, the water coming out of the taps right now is already hot enough to use, and I had no reason to cook with gas in the next 16hours, so it wasn’t a big deal. Also I was just in a shitty mood and didn’t want someone here that late)
About 45mins after the call I see her car pull up in the driveway, and she goes straight to the gas bottles. I ask her to show me how to do it so I know in the future, and she snaps at me because the red lever is actually green and not in the place she said it was, and the lever she was referring to was actually a button. 
I tell her no, I didn’t touch it because I didn’t know what to do, that’s exactly why I called her in the first place. She then walks upstairs into my house without saying anything to me and goes straight for the kitchen sink and stove top to see both are working as normal, which they are/were. I’m sitting with my son on the couch, getting pissed off im being ignored by a woman who didn’t have permission to be there, and I hear her walking around opening up every door and letting out a loud passive-aggressive sigh each time she closes a door because of the mess she’s seen (we are still unpacking boxes so yes, everything is a mess, but that’s not typical for me and she has my rental references to prove it). As she walks to the door to leave I ask her to please give me warning next time she wants to come over for any reason. I’m totally cool with it as long as it’s not unexpected or when I specifically tell her not to. She ignored me, got in her car and drove off. She still hasn’t said anything to me, even though since made contact asking what I did wrong and apologising if it upset her, because if I was in the wrong I want to know, I believe I’m rational enough to hear someone out if I’ve done the wrong by them, I’ll apologise and try to be better in the future, but I really don’t think I could have made this situation any different, but that’s why I want opinions and advice. It’s a 12month lease with a private landlord in QLD, if that means anything.

2019 kicked 100shades of shit out of me, so my self esteem is at an all time low right now. I really struggle with people who are so blatantly rude, because I think a lot of the time I might deserve it. That’s why I’m confused about this. I tried to write this as factual and unbiased as I can because I want genuine opinions and advice on how to handle this and prevent it from happening in the future.

On top of that he hasn't been responding to my texts or wanting to hike either. He found someone to climb with that's way more skilled than I am and ever since it's like I'm not worth his time. Just makes me feel like I'm gross, or that I'm not strong enough, smart enough, good enough?

221,"My husband had been a smoker for nearly 25 years when we started dating.   He wanted to quit and I pushed him to as well.  He knew from the time we started dating that I wanted him to quit. - he said it was motivation for him, because on his own he never would, but he wanted to for health reasons.  

He quit right after we were married, and although he had a hard time at first, I was so proud of him for sticking with it, and he had been 3 years without a cigarette.... or so I thought.  

Today I decided to wash our coats, and while checking the pockets of his, I came across a Vape pen.  Further investigation led me to find a second one.  When I confronted him he tried to lie and say they were from a long time ago - until I pointed out that it wouldn’t be in the pocket of your winter jacket if it was from a long time ago.  When cornered he finally admitted he has been closet smoking/vaping for a year.

To be clear, while I am disappointed that he started smoking again, I do understand that it must be an extremely difficult habit to break, and people have slips, and we could work through it. What I am FURIOUS about is that he blatantly lied by omission for well over a year about it.   I can understand being nervous to tell me he had slipped at first, but in the past year he has had so many opportunities to come clean.  I am forever telling him that I am so proud of him, and I have also made sure to ask him if he still finds it hard to not smoke, and he just answered “at first, but I’m used to it now.”  At any point in those conversations he could have come clean, but chose instead to lie.  

He told me the reason he didnt come clean was because he knew I would freak out.  Twice he has fallen off the wagon, and both times I freaked out because he lied to me, and had to get backed into a corner until he would admit the truth.   It wasn’t the smoking that made me flip - It was the lying.

I have always been very open with my husband that I will not be in a relationship where there are lies.  I can honestly say I have never lied to my husband, and have always valued honesty above all else.   

Through this whole episode, it’s made me realize that he is a much better liar than I knew.   To hide his smoking from me for a year, and even having me be angry with myself when I suspected him on occasion - I had no idea he was capable of that level of deceit.  How do I trust him from now on - he’s fooled me twice.  The first time was shortly after he quit smoking and I forgave the lie, thinking he was just embarrassed.  But if I can’t trust that he isn’t lying, does our marriage stand a chance?

I am not sure that he will even try to quit smoking this time.  I might have to learn to accept this habit- I could really use some advice on how to handle it without picking a fight about it constantly.   He wanted to quit, now he’s changed his mind.  

It’s the lying and the lack of trust - it has me feeling completely betrayed and broken.   How do I get to a place where I can trust him again, because I can’t imagine a marriage without trust, but I can’t imagine my life without him.",15Jan2020,1
222,"My friend recently (about 2 months ago) went through a break up and was obviously pretty upset from the start. It was a pretty amicable break up but the obvious sadness took him over for the better part of the last month or so. He’s been better with that recently, but now he’s complaining of feeling depressed for seemingly no reason. I’ve poured out so much effort into trying to comfort him and give him sound advice over the phone as well as while playing Xbox together (we go to different colleges) 

Is it wrong of me to feel kind of irritated at this point? I understand that he very well may still be sad or upset about this, but it’s starting to suck emotional energy out of me at this point and I don’t really have much else to say to him that I haven’t said multiple times by now.

I’m a sophomore in college and I don’t like to tell my parents the names of friends, where I’m going, how my day was, hows school going, or really anything for that matter. And I think this was a defense mechanism bc my dad mostly would tease about me having friends and mention them a lot and stuff, and my mom is just your textbook helicopter parent. I’ll lie for what is probably the most childish stuff like how I’ll be going to play basketball, but I’ll be going to a friends house or something.

I’ve never had a real conversation with them bc in the past it’s been used against me or they just won’t take me seriously.

231,"I am a 28 year old female, and I've never had a super close relationship with my mom. It isn't that I don't love her or anything like that, but I've always since little had a difficult time trusting her or keeping her informed on important aspects of my life as I grew up. As a child, I remember multiple occasions when I would tell her something and she would overreact (both to positive news and negative news) to the point where I stopped wanting to tell her anything. It's why as a teenager, I didn't tell her about my sexual abuse, my first boyfriend, or my decisions regarding college. As an adult, I never told her about my boyfriends, my decision to go to South Korea for study abroad (until I had secured a spot at my university of choice), or anything that bothers me in general.

This unwillingness to share information with her has turned into a simple over-independence (is that even possible?) where I like to deal with things without her help or input. When I moved out of the house to a house only 5 min away, she's absolutely hated it and threatened me with disowning me. In the end it was a bluff on her part to keep me home, but I felt bad about it at the time. She was also very over-protective of me growing up well into adulthood, which resulted in a lot of control over where I was allowed to be and who I could see. I was still having to ask my mom for permission to go the mall at 24 years old, and if I visited a friends house (who she was very familiar with too) she would drive to my friend's house and ring the doorbell to see if I was actually there. It was infuriating. Don't even get me started on dating. Part of the reason I had difficulty dating was because my mother would not allow me to go to any guy's house (even if he lived with family), nor any parties that might be at someone else's house, nor like 60% of the restaurant's available in town. Essentially, options were like 5 restaurants and the mall that were date-approved and I had to provide detailed time-estimates of when and how long we would be at each place. 

These were big issues for me, and my mom has other faults (like trying to control the way I think, putting expectations on my body image and outward appearance, putting down my goals etc.,), and they reflect on how I deal with her now that I've moved out of her thumb. I call/text her maybe a few times every 2 weeks or so, and visit her house every 2-3 weeks or so (on account of living a pretty regularly scheduled life that involves school-home-work out- repeat that doesn't give me a whole lot to chat with her about in general). She always complains that I don't visit her enough and that I forget I have a family, but the truth is that I just don't need to see her that often because I don't feel that I have much to say when I do go. I especially dislike visiting because she always /always/ without fail mentions how I have gotten fatter and in some form uglier (even though I work-out daily and lift weights and am at a toned healthy weight), and attempts to gaslight me in my current undertakings because they affect her negatively, and she always /always/ manages to reconnect previous conversations that we have with entirely different words so that she can make it seem that I did something wrong or paints me as having agreed with something she said (which is rare for me to do). She still tries to control what I do and who I see, and she has been entirely horrid to my current boyfriend of 5 years (which is a whole other issue, mind you. She once tried to hook me up with a complete stranger right in front of him at a dinner he was paying for). 

My mom says I have no consideration for her feelings and that she misses me. I know this isn't true, but I don't feel the need to see her every single day the way she wants either.  Am I being too harsh on my mom? Too inconsiderate? I understand she gets lonely because for 25 years she had me with her 24/7 and that she loves me, but I just...

232,"First, some background.

I come from a very small town, and having known everyone since kindergarten, I never really have needed to make friends. I’ve also never had a girlfriend or much experience with women in general.

My first actual semester was abroad (it’s a thing my school does) and I had the same issue. I was miserable and unable to do many of the things I wanted to. My roommate situation was less than ideal.

Now I’m on campus, and don’t really know how to go about making friends. Everyone from my program seems to be settled into their own little groups, but I can’t find my place. My current roommates are all sophomores and I kind of feel like an outsider. I find myself very anxious around new people and have begun falling into a depressive spiral.

I don’t want this semester to be a repeat of the last one, and might be joining some clubs to try and compensate. But being around people isn’t enough. I genuinely am clueless about how to make someone from an acquaintance into a friend, and by extension a relationship, casual or serious.

233,"Some strange comments in a thread caught my attention a little while ago, at first I just assumed they were an odd attempt at trolling or something but after reading more of the user's comments it really seems like he's suffering from some sort of mental affliction. 

I don't have a psychology background and I'm not at all qualified to suggest a specific kinda diagnosis or anything. But his comments never seem relevant to what he's responding to, he frequently (but vaguely) references what sounds like an abusive relationship with his roommate, and the way all of his comments are written just really paint a picture of someone who is out of touch with reality. One of his posts is a pretty long audio recording of (presumably) himself talking about his roommate and it's a little disturbing. Not especially violent or anything, just really disjointed thoughts and what sounds like delusions. There's a comment on that post from the user himself that suggests they didn't even realize they had recorded and posted the audio, and a lot of his other comments sound really paranoid, saying things like ""people keep changing the words of my comments,"" etc. It just sounds like he's ""losing it,"" or has lost it. 

I don't know why I feel so invested in this, maybe that's weird. I guess it's just that the idea of someone needing help and just kinda shouting into the void here makes me sad. 

I sent him a message gently suggesting that he sees someone, and maybe that wasn't appropriate, but I can't think of anything else I could do (I haven't heard back from him.)

I really want a Ram 2500 Cummins diesel pickup truck. The one I want is about $60,000. So I figure I could live with my parents for three years and save $20,000 a year for the truck. I’ll pay them some rent.

239,"I don’t know if this post is allowed here, but I guess not knowing which community to post to is why I’m asking for advice. I have a friend who’s Muslim. We’ve been friends for a few months now, but I never spent time with her outside of school. I was trying to make plans and she kept telling me that she can’t. Eventually she realized I didn’t know, and mentioned how because of her race/gender/culture she can’t come over to my house. I’m white, non religious. We have another friend who is Muslim and she goes to her house all the time, so I think it’s the fact my household is not Muslim. I tried searching, but not much came up so I’m guessing it’s not a very explained thing. 

There is no negativity/judgement against her or her culture in this post, just a desire for understanding. I respect her lifestyle and obviously will stop asking her to come over. I’m just not sure the specifics as to why she can’t come over to my house. I just wanted to know if there’s a community where I can ask questions respectfully about Muslim culture to get a better understanding of this type of stuff, without making my friend uncomfortable. I’m hoping to have a place where I can learn, as I did not grow up religious in any way. I don’t understand the specifics of pretty much any religions or their cultures and I don’t want to accidentally offend/push topics that are uncomfortable for them.

If anyone can explain this to me and/or recommend a community where I can go to ask questions, that would be great!",15Jan2020,1
240,"So me and four friends (will refer to them as T, A, B, L) rented a house together in June of 2019.  We were all great friends and had no reason to not trust each other.
 
L had some trouble getting on the lease. She moved in before being officially on the lease, but after a month or so she told the house that she was on the lease and everything was fine. We had no reason to not believe her, I cannot stress this enough.

We received an email in August with our updated lease and L’s name was nowhere to be seen. She said she’d take care of it. We trusted her. 

Recently, tensions have arisen between L and the rest of us roommates. L has been messy, disrespectful, and inconsiderate to the rest of us on many occasions and a lot of feelings of resentment have bubbled to the surface. Trust was lost after multiple lies were uncovered.

We realized that she was not someone we could trust. One day, one of us remembered that she never really told us about her situation with the lease. We double checked the copy of our lease on our online portal and L’s name wasn’t on it. T called the leasing office and asked for the most recent copy of the lease: L was not on the lease.

L pays rents. She has a login on our tenant portal and has paid rent a few months in advance (anyone can have a login and pay rent, being on the lease is not a requirement to have access to our portal). She has paid utility bills every month and acts like she is on the lease. While a horrible person to live with, she has paid everything up to this moment. She also has a pet bunny that is not on our lease either.

T, B, A and I do not know what to do in this situation, considering we could all be impacted by someone not on our lease living on our house. We don’t know if we should confront or keep the information to ourselves, if we should ask her to move out or hear her out, or any other option in between. We don’t want her to homeless, but she’s made living in our house hard. How should we go about confronting this situation?

TL;DR- my roommates and I just found out our problem roommate is not on the lease and she doesn’t know that we know. Should we kick her out or allow her to stay?",15Jan2020,1

246,"Ok fam, I’ve got a real dilemma here. 

My best friend and I got into this HUGE fight last night. I found out they lied to me about something significant and it made me feel incredibly stupid and a little worthless. When I confronted them and asked them for their side of the story they said it wasn’t a lie at the time but things just changed. (But I found out today that was also a lie.)

But when the conversation/confrontation ended last night, they said something along the lines of “ok well guess our friendship is over now probably. I’ll leave it up to you to decide.” 

I’m trying to decide if 

A. I let my emotion get the best of me over the lie (people aren’t perfect and that’s ok) or if it was just a really crappy thing to do (it was a pretty hurtful lie). 

B. I should leave the friendship broken. (I was honestly so angry and hurt that I was 100% over the friendship) or if I should try and mend it (am I being manipulated to feel guilty)

I want to reach back out to them and make it all better but I also don’t want to be friends with someone that would lie and walk away from our friendship so easily. (Or could they tell how angry I was and were they just saying it more like “ok if you need space and don’t want to be around me, I’ll back off” instead of actually meaning it like “this is over, we’re done”

He has sometimes said ""I was Dad was dead."" The thing is my dad is not a typical 'bad dad.' He is completely normal and he yells ot gets angry its nothing too bad. For example my sister asking to get a toy and negging him. My dad would eventually get fed up and yell NO. I feel like when he becomes older he will start doing these actions to other people or eventually women. I love my brother but I dont know what to do.

251,"I’ll try and keep this short as I can with the background involved. I am more or less starting over at 35. I have grown up in the stainless fabrication industry. My father started two businesses in his life and I worked at both. The latter ended up closing while my father was battling cancer. It was an ugly ordeal and he basically ran it into the ground thinking he would come out on top because of his previous success in the industry. He lost literally everything and would have been homeless if not for living with me while he did his last bouts of treatment. I ended up losing my savings, having to sell my house and move home to Louisiana to be with family for my fathers last days.
I ended up getting a job with another fabricator and moving back to Dallas. The pay is not great but it stopped the work gap and keeps a roof over my head. I have been looking for better opportunities and in the last few days I have had two job offers. One with a fabricator whose business is doing well and I could basically step in and run the estimating department from day one with my experience. The other is something completely different, estimating playgrounds and park equipment, mostly for cities, counties, etc. Both are a 50% increase in salary and have medical. The pay is equal.
Having a hard time choosing with going what I know and having the owner express that he wants me to run with it. This is something I struggled with working for my father as we battled a lot. In this job I could basically show up with my price book and start working, eventually adding another estimator to train and grow the company. On the other hand I have the opportunity to try something new, new designs and new challenges with a company that is equally growing in its own field.
Both present long term potential and the chance to allow me to rebuild my life, put some savings back together and plan for retirement. I having been looking for 6 months and then within 3 days I have these two opportunities. I am starting to get a little anxiety over it. Do I risk it with something new or stick With what I know even though I feel bored and a little burned out with some of the redundancy of the work.",15Jan2020,1
252,"To start this off, I’ll give you some background on the person who I’m referring to as a monster. This individual used to have quite a high status in our friend group before everyone eventually realized he was a douche and everyone stopped talking to him. For about all of middle school I would have called him my best friend. During that time he had gotten physical with me during arguments on more than one occasion, leaving bruises whenever it occurred. I had also caught him lying on several occasions about both big and small things, ranging from playing a video game which he hadn’t, to his parents kicking him out of his house and putting him into foster care. What’s screwed up about the second one is that he never said that it happened back in the day, but once we were all in high school and he was looking for forgiveness from the friend group he suddenly brought this up, along with saying that he was on antidepressants which had a side effect of making him act like a douche and a creep. He repeatedly would be very grabby with female members of the friend group, and there may be more. One of my best friends, well call her Ashley, has implied in the past something bad happened sexually between them, in a not so consensual way, and although I don’t know if it is true or false, when discussing this person with her ex my friend, we’ll call him Casey, I said “maybe (the person) isn’t so bad” Casey then got very serious and said “don’t you ever say that about him” implying that he knows more than I do about the situation with Ashley than I do. Anyway after the summer of 8th grade we all decided we’d had enough and all stopped talking to him, at the same time he moved away. During my senior year of high school he moved back to town and started making fast friends with a similar group of people that the middle school group was, nerds and weebs... with a notable exception, he was only making friends with the women. Flash forward to a year out of high school and he has been extremely creepy in one of my friends girlfriends private messages, and is now hanging out with one of my best friends who well call Colleen and her little brother. My question is, do I tell Colleen about how creepy he has been in the past, not to mention violent and deceptive? I really don’t want to ever talk to this guy again and I’m afraid that telling her, or any of my other friends about him would just start beef with this guy, and I really really don’t want that. But simultaneously if he’s truly as bad as he is, shouldn’t I at least tell people to keep an eye out for any fishy behavior from him? Colleen didn’t even go to out school till highscool, so she doesn’t even know what he was like in middle school. 

TL:DR 
A friend of mine has become close with someone who I know for a fact is a liar, and has a tendency to get physically abusive amongst other things. Should I tell her about how he used to be, and to be on the lookout for suspicious behavior?",15Jan2020,1
253,"I hate my day job, It sucks the soul out of me. I am a passionate and creative person that is DESPERATE to create. I used to be a streamer and loved it (I even started making like 2k a month from it) but it conflicted with my day job and I ended up giving it up out of stability for my family. I regret that decision greatly.  


Now I have gotten in to making porn with my spouse in our spare time. Our channel got a good amount of traffic in our first month and I am seeing a potential to pursue a career in Porn. However, as stated, we do it in our free time, which because of my day job, usually means at like 10 P.m. at night to start the shoot and finishing at like 6a.m.  


this means we can only do shoots on the weekend and only one or two a week. Plus the time for editing and color grading the videos is massive so I am starting to feel the effects as any spare time I am not at work I am either writing scripts, planning shots, doing promotion admin work, editing the footage, interacting with the community, or building on platforms like our Patreon so that we can get paid. All this means I am dead tired these days and i feel my creativity is suffering.  


So the original question: when do I quit my day job and give my 100% to a career I am passionate about and can see a future in?

259,"I'm male, 31.  She is female, 36.  We began dating in summer 2017.  We spent lots of time together.  I was in university and she was working the only job she could her given her immigration status.  I would go out of my way all the time for her and I didn't mind it.  I was in my third to last semester of university and work was piling up.  She would throw these animated temper tantrums and say she hated my work because I couldn't see her as much as she wanted me to.  I thought she was just being silly but she said she was being honest.  I did the best I could to make time for her but my grades took a hit.  I had to do really well my final year if I wanted to graduate on time with good academic standing.  

That semester we had sex multiple times.  We had it once where I went in unprotected for a brief moment.  I pulled out and put a condom on.  The next day I realized pre-seminal fluid could get her pregnant and I asked her if she would take the pill.  She was reluctant but did it.  I felt awful and responsible for the entire thing.  I told her it was wrong for me to go in without a condom.  She said she could raise a baby by herself.  She lived in a small home with her elderly parents.  I thought that would be very difficult and explained that to her.  I told her that if we would have a baby that I would want to be with her every step of the way but that I would also want to have a good job so I could support both her and our baby.  She said it was selfish of me to think this way.  This made it hard for me to see her sexually and our relationship declined.  

The next semester was the first of my final year.  I let her know I would not be able to see her as much as before because I had to make sure I would graduate.  Not long after this her mom was the victim of someone's wreckless driving.  Her mom survived and the driver turned themselves in.  I had hoped she'd understand the importance of being prepared after a situation like this but I am not sure.  I was there for her too then and helped her out as much as I could.  I wondered if she thought about what her life would be like if she was pregnant and this happened.  I would be in constant stress too worrying about her well-being and our baby.

I only got to see her a few times during this last year of school and we talked on the phone.  She told me I cared more about my work than her.  I finished school, got my degree, and got a good job.  Now I have time and money to do all the things we couldn't do before.  Now she is the one who is busy.  Some days she calls me and she seems happy and other times I call her and she sounds like she doesn't want to talk.  I told her that I am happy for her that she has more responsibilities at work and that she found some new hobbies outside of work but I ask why she can't make time for me.  I told her I have a lot of time now but she says I am complaining.  I express to her very politely that I want to spend more time with her like before and that I couldn't during my last year of school due to needing to focus on graduating.  I ask her why it's okay for her to be busy and not me and she says it's not the same.  She says I am complaining.  This really hurts me.  

Despite our differences, I still love her.  I still think about her.  Despite the several things I don't like about her, especially after our bad experience, I still think about all of the good things and how I want to keep experiencing more of them.  At the same time, I think it's very unfair that she thinks it's wrong for me to express politely that I wish she would make time for me especially since i made a big sacrifice for the benefit of not just my future but potentially ours.  We never ""officially"" broke up but it feels like we have fallen apart.  I don't know what to say to her because anytime I tell her how I feel she says I am complaining and I don't think it's fair.  I also enver got to meet her parents.  She is from China and I'm from the USA.  We both live in the USA.  She would tell me to hide when her parents are home and the one time she almost introduced me to them she made me turn the car around at the last minute.

1.  I just stumbled upon their Knot wedding profile and found myself listed as a bridesmaid. I was never asked in advance, and don’t know that I’d have said yes considering the circumstances. She’s also been oddly pro-my ex and I think it’s pretty uncool of her. 
2. Ok so I am not even being petty about this, the description of me on their profile is literally awful and completely inappropriate.  It even mentions my employer?! I have no idea who wrote this profile but I’m totally uncomfortable with it. 
3. My ex’s description is directly below mine..I fucking hate seeing him anywhere near me, including in a picture, and especially online.
4. My brother and this guy drunkenly agreed to be each other’s best man before we broke up. Not sure he would have been his best man under different circumstances. My brother is incredibly charming, but my ex is a very difficult person to be around. Even to the extent of friends refusing to hang out when he’s around. My family will be judging the situation enough, the thought of them interacting with this guy makes my skin crawl - I know it’ll be awful for everyone. Really not sure why I’d need to be on the stage with him. I know I can’t insist he’s not in the wedding (totally banking on him ruining their friendship in the meantime), but this bridesmaid thing feels like too much. 

The fiancé is extraordinarily sensitive, so I feel like I’m kind of walking on eggshells. Any thoughts on best approach here?",15Jan2020,1

So slight backstory, I am 18(F) and I have never had a good relationship with my dads mothers side of the family. (My grandfathers side such as him, his wife and my half aunt&amp;uncles are the best.)  Ever since I was a kid she has always played favorites and spoiled my dads sisters kids, otherwise Entitled Aunt. My cousins would flash off shopping items in my face that my grandmother got them and had no problem showing off and never really including me in things unless my dad told them to. 

 Well, flash forward I’m now 18. In November of 2019, a Snapchat rant of mine got sent to all of them, I will admit I did not say some nice things but I never posted it. Someone hacked in my Apple account to get it off my phone. Before all this, my grandmother had done some things leading up to me making that rant. 
First off, I was at my boyfriends grandparents house eating dinner with them for the first time in four years, she sent me a text saying I’m disgusting and she’s done with me all because I got more tattoos. I cried in front of his grandparents. 
Second, when we went to lunch so she can apologize, she never did. She tip toed around it, and brought up my deceased grandparents on my mother’s side (who raised me, and I love way more than her.) saying how they were basically bad parents because of how my uncles turned out and compared them to her children. 
Which includes my entitled aunt who posted on Facebook that I hate her and she can say what ever she wants about me because of it and posted extremely disrespectful stuff onto my Facebook page calling me ungrateful, hateful and a manor of other things I do not need people to see on a public page. These people are so messed up we almost ended up on dr.phil. 
After the video got sent out (which no one told me it did.) I was basically disowned by all of them, for the thousandth time, including my dad who said he is done with me.
After not speaking to them for awhile my dad finally broke down and started talking to me again, but he keeps trying to get me to talk to his mother and his sister. I’m not even on speaking terms with my cousin who sent me a text blaming me for all the negativity in her life and how she’s apart of that family and she loves them and can’t see why I hate them. So I’m not speaking to her now ether because I’m not taking the blame for bullshit problems that have nothing to do with me, and if she knew the amount of things that her mother and grandmother say about her I would accidentally put her in a mental ward. For starters her mother went to one of my psychiatrist appointments and found out what meds I took for ADHD and BED, what happens a week later? My obese cousin is now on them and all of a sudden she has adhd. No, her mother put her on them because I lost weight taking them. My grandmother talks to her therapist about her problems and so fourth a lot more shit they have done. 
My dad won’t stop siding with them saying I should apologize for that video that was never posted or meant to be out at all and was used as a form of anger management. I think I am owed an apology for always being told I’m disowned, ungrateful, hateful, never going to get a job (I’m 18 and my checks are 1500$, so suck it, meanwhile my aunts 20 year old son is a delivery driver.)  I refuse to apologize for something that was a form of personal anger management that was a reaction from them treating me so badly. My dad says I should make the first move and talk to my grandmother because she misses me so badly, but this woman acts like me being alive I owe her a never ending debt and have to act like she’s god and get down on my knees to be grateful, a simple thank you isn’t enough for her. She even told me I’m the only person who has paid her back a full amount of money (I borrowed 200 and paid it all back, my entitled aunt took 5000 for an apartment down payment.) 
Am I the asshole and should suck it up and talk to them because “they’re family” or should I stand my ground?


Edit since I wrote this: I found out who went onto my accounts, it was my younger cousin, entitled aunts daughter. I have since completely disowned her and now fully hate her. I have done nothing but protect her from very nasty things her mother and grandmother have said about her to my face. For her to betray me like this is unforgivable in my eyes. She claimed I was negative, and acted just like her mother would towards me- blames me for her problems and sided with them even though she does not know the full story. She inserted herself into other peoples problems and tried to side with them without knowing anything and I’m done with her, if I were to ever see her again I would probably knock her teeth out.",15Jan2020,1

272,"It'll be easiest to start from the beginning. It begins in high school with my junior prom date, we were friends for a couple months before prom, we went on a date beforehand. On the way to our date she got in a car accident (she was fine). For some reason we still went on our date that night and it ended up that I didn't think we were too compatible. Probably because I didn't think about how she was still in shock from the crash. Being the immature highschooler I was I started distancing myself to the point we had to catch up at prom. This led into prom being super awkward and we stopped our relationship and communication shortly after. A couple months later I got invited to her prom (we went to different schools) with one of our mutual friends. I was civil to her and her friends the whole time except for being again an immature teen and completely running off to go dance with a girl I had a crush on. After that I was understandably shunned from that group that was the last of it. 

Fast forward about 8 years to these past few months. I'm working at my dream job now. My company posts a picture of all the new hires in the company and I see my old prom date in the roster of people. We do different jobs at the company but cooperate regularly. I know that it's a matter of time till we cross paths and have to work together. Over the past few months we made eye contact twice now. The first time I embarrassingly walked away. The second time we were in a group with others for a photo and was just discussed stuff with the group without making direct conversation. I know I want to clear the air and hopefully move past high school days but I just don't know how to start and go about that conversation. Please any advice will be helpful.",15Jan2020,1

But she is going into theater and Broadway acting for her career, focusing on singing. She sings all the time around people in are class and is clearly proud of her years of work and control over her chords.

Now the problem is that she sucks, she just sucks. Some people can sing and others can. She hits all the right notes, holds the right tone. Does everything that should make you good, but she just doesn't have the right voice. Everyone in our class jokes about it behind her back and agrees that she sucks, but no one ever tells her. Her theater friends are to afraid to tell her as well as the teachers.

277,"Throwaway account so the people who cause my problems can't get even more horrible.

I don't even know where to start with this, but I'll do my best. 

My problems stem from my stepfather. He is just human fucking garbage. Like the kind of guy that got kicked out of high school his senior year for physically assaulting a teacher, then marry a woman that has a decent job in order to fund his self-employment fantasy which mainly consisted/consists of blowing thousands upon thousands of dollars of my mother's money on bullshit power tools and shit. Dude bought two cars, and only uses one but still expects my mother to be responsible for part of the insurance even tho she can't drive it (she can't drive stick). But on top of draining my mom financially for years, the man has not once in my life ever treated me like an equal to my half-siblings, his actual children, and goes out of his way to be a fucking nazi. Anytime something happens that isn't exactly, 100%, what he wants, he goes apeshit and verbally abuses the person responsible. Like in my case, he will wander the house and if he finds one little thing out of place that could even possibly be traced back to me, he'll scream at me about what a piece of shit I am, and I'll end up grounded, which means all of the electronic devices (All of which I work for every dollar towards, and paid for) will be stripped from my room and I will be trapped in my room and only able to leave to go to work or school.

Well anyways, I'm coming here for advice because I'm just so emotionally drained. I'm at a point in my life where I'm afraid of being home, because I know I'm just going to be miserable. I never thought in my life that I would be happy to go to school or even to my shitty below-minimum-wage job because it means I don't have to be home.

My Father has tried to give me advice in the post whenever I'm with him, but it never works. And extended family (who live out of state and near my father), are no help at all. All they do is offer empty vague advice that is no damn help. And moving over there isn't an option, unfortunately.

That included messed up names (it was throughout the ENTIRE school year, and there were only 6 Asians in a class of 30), mixed up papers and general disrespect like getting mad at us when we corrected him. 

We were talking about it at lunch, and mentioned how we thought he was being a little racist, and a good friend of ours who is white kept insisting that it wasn't racist or even racially based at all because the teacher wasn't aware he was doing it. We all said that we had repeatedly corrected him to no avail, but my friend still gets upset when we say the teacher was being a little racist. How do I talk to him about race with him?",15Jan2020,1
279,"Sry new to this subreddit first post but could use the advice.  I have been with this spectacular girl for the past 7 months and for the most part I’ve loved every second of it.  I’m the kind of bf that just loves making putting a smile on my girlfriends face whether it be a stupid joke or a sweet gesture it’s just extremely pleasing to me to look over at her and see that beautiful smile on her face and know it’s my fault.  Like for example it was my girlfriends birthday yesterday and I wanted to make her her favourite breakfast (eggs Benedict) for her to wake up to before school, she wakes up at 7:00 am which meant I had to be up 4:45 am to start heading to her place (got there at like 6:10 am, I live on an island but we go to the same school so we could head there together after) she enjoyed it and the smile on her face made it totally worth it and I felt great about doing it.  Now getting to the advice, doing this things make me happy but sometimes after I can feel a little uncared for in the sense of not too many signs of affection are displayed (unless we’re in person and alone that’s really the only reason I know she does love me so much it’s evident) we’ll be texting and I won’t get a response for like an hour and it’s usually not very engaging/doesn’t really further the conversation like I’ll say something and she’ll respond with “mhm” (that’s the most often one) which I get if she’s busy so I usually ask “hey if you’re busy do you want me to leave you alone for a bit so you can do you work?” And she’ll almost always say “nah I’m good to text” the pretty frequent “mhm”s and infrequent displays of affection can leave me feeling strangely anxious (I have anxiety ofc) and kinda makes me feel a little down and I don’t really know what to do, I love her so much and her the same to me (as said previously only reason I know is because when we spend time one on one together.  there’s just a certain way someone will look at you and you just know they care about you so much and she pretty frequently tells me she loves me when we’re alone) advice would be much appreciated and if it’s important we’re both 18 (essentially I am in 2 months and she just turned), thanks.",15Jan2020,1

281,"Recently, I found out an old friend's parents got divorced and her mother picks on her everyday because she does not have enough money for herself because her mother is not using the care and control power she has over my friend. Her father also has not enough money to fight for custody over her because he pays for everything including friend's sibling's school fees overseas and living expenses.
My friend also has smoking habits and she says that shes probably smoking and drinking her life away atm. To add onto that she was recently cheated on and taken advantage of whilst emotionally unstable. She has a new boyfriend and he is really supporting her so she said shes fine for now.
But the worse I feel is when she told me about how her dad transfers money to her mother every month for my friend, but her mother only transfers her not even 1/6 of the money her father had transferred.
Even more recently, my friend had not enough money left and asked for more money to last her through for 1 week, but her mother transferred her roughly 25$ thinking it was enough to last her through the week. Not only that, she proceeded to block her on whatsapp so my friend couldn't text her for extra money. She doesn't even have enough money to help herself.
I feel her mother is being very unreasonable and my friend says that her mother doesn't give her enough allowance money a week and she quote says,""she (her mother) still asks for the money to be 'on dutch'."" and shes frustrated because she feels ""can you imagine your own mother asking you to pay"".

283,"First post ever on Reddit- who'd of thought it would be for advice? 

So, the backstory you need to know for this:

I moved into an apartment with my two best friends (they didn't know each other before this, at least not very well) last August. We were all thrilled to get out of the dorms, have our own rooms, and our own kitchen! Honeymoon phase quickly wore off though, and as friends turned roommates do, we started butting heads. It started with the freezer- one half freezer for 3 people was a bit tight, as we don't share food. Then, it was chores. Roommate 1 got frustrated with ""always doing the chores"" and cleaning the kitchen, so as a result we made a chore sheet, which Roommate 2 and I have followed as best as we can. Complaints stopped from there, until this week. 

This weeks problem that led to this post:

Moldy food in a Tupperware in the sink. We clean out the fridge weekly, and if you throw something out, the rule is you clean up the container. I noticed the full, moldy Tupperware in the sink, but didn't mention it, figuring someone had cleaned out the fridge, and hadn't gotten around to it yet. 

The next day, we awake to a long text (never something good to find in a group chat) from Roommate 1, blaming me for not cleaning said Tupperware, and how inconsiderate it was for Roommate 2 (who was travelling) to not empty her food before leaving. Roommate 2 defended herself, saying it was not hers. Both Roommate 2 and I were being super respectful, denying it was ours, but not attempting to shift blame, just saying how we needed to be more careful with our food in the future. 

Roommate 1 had a attacking response about how she's not to blame poor and can't afford the kind of Tupperware used, so it wasn't hers, etc.

Cut to today, where we had a meeting. Typical roommate meeting stuff (though obviously prompted by the text exchange)

Roommate  1 initially apologizes, saying she was frustrated, and felt attacked, but shouldn't have talked that way. We begin discussing kitchen cleanliness, and I guess Roommate 2 said something that struck Roommate 1's nerve, as she started saying how it wasn't fair, she does not want to live in ""filth"" and have to finger screw the drain every time she has to use the sink- you get the picture. With these statements, she storms out of the meeting, leaving Roommate 2 and I quite stunned. We talked, said we'd let it cool over and try talking and resolving it later, after the heat cooled off, you know. 

However, Roommate 2 sent another long text to the group chat, saying how she felt, some passive aggressiveness was had. Cue Roommate 1 sending a responding long text about how ""Roommate 2, you're not the only one who's had a terrible life."" o.o  A lot of blame going around, which gets real ugly, real fast.

I'm not sure what to do! Yes, everyone has left messes in the kitchen, myself included. But I try my best to clean up my dishes and whatever surfaces I dirty. That's the only part I know in it's entirety. So I feel attacked, and like I don't know what to do, and like I'm caught in the middle of this whole kitchen cleanliness debacle! We still have 6 months on the lease, so we need to sort this out to make living at least tolerable until then. I want to keep my friends!

How do you deal with conflict resolution in this situation? I could really use some advice, I tried to be as unbiased as me, a biased person, could be.

I looked at other argument/roommate/housemate threads before posting, and couldn't find anything that really applied, which is why I decided to post.

I am super insecure and always feel like my boyfriend has ex's that are way more attractive than me. I feel like he could do better. I get emotional about it and I hate that I react this way. This belief that I'm not good enough has been reinforced by instances where it may seem like my boyfriend makes a comment that makes it seem like he doesn't like the way I look, but this just be my fault for interpreting that way. Ex. ""Girls who are attractive have no personality"" and then comments about how I have a great personality and that's why he likes me. (Which is great! I love that he thinks that way of me, but I interpret it as well you're not pretty, but you're personality is good)

Some days I don't feel in love with him. However, I don't know what it feels like and anytime I think about ending it, I can sew it hurting a lot. I've told him, about the loss of interest some days, during a fight and I highly regret it. I should not have said that and feel really bad about it.

When I get mad, I shut down and can't talk. It creates a barrier that's really hard to overcome and he doesn't know what to do in that time and I don't know what he can do to help.

Don't get me wrong our relationship has many positive things that subjectively can outweigh the negatives. These are just things I need help/advice about. Don't be too harsh I'm trying my best.

286,"Can't keep this brief enough... My kids are in late teens, I divorced their father when they were still toddlers and it's been severely high conflict since then.

Where I work is a warehouse and we have a solid crew of about 13 people. All different ages and backgrounds and despite us all being grown men, for some reason immaturity always seeps into the mix.

I'm a veteran at this job now almost 6 years and last year we hired some temps. After about 10 different temps in and out of the building we settled on 4 and 2 got hired on.

This is a story about a white middle class magic nerd (well call him E 26) and his battle against a dark skinned latino former crack dealer cleaning up his life (A 38).

Now A moved from Jersey halfway across the country to start life new and move beyond gang banging and I presume to avoid jail. Actually really cool guy 8/10 I could see myself being his friend outside of work despite our different up bringing a. 

E on the other hand is a sheltered, ""depressed, autistic, bisexual, with multiple Personality Disorder."" Child is a walking complex of excuses to get what he wants when he wants to so he can cry wolf. He's not medicated, does not have a workplace assist (or social worker), and has succeeded in making most of my crew uneasy with his attitude and his abhorrent personal hygiene. Besides his, ""afflictions"" E is extremely intelligent and knows to use his special circumstances to his advantage. He's highly conceited extremely self-centered, and worst of all entitled. He set his sights on me since day one having thought that, because I had in the past played Magic I'm going to be his number one nerd friend about Anime and magic. While I do enjoy some of the same things, I'm not at work to have my every conversation be about said things, especially when hes been killing morale with the crew. After having learned about how he conducts business, with his victim play I am 100% against him working in my environment, because I now fear for my job. I'm also very uncomfortable with his two face dealings between HR and us on the floor.

E on the very first week I met him told me that when he encounters people he doesn't like at work he tries to record them so that he can get them fired. Fast forward almost 9 months, he's having issues with A. E and A haven't always been nice to each other A just wants to work and for whatever reason E has decided to make his job purposely harder every chance he has.

Last month, he was being insubordinate to the supervisor in cleaning up a mess on the floor and went upstairs and pointed a finger at the supervisor (who was doing his job), A who had nothing to do with the incident, and myself who wasn't even there at work, I had the day off. The following day we're having a meeting with HR about sensitivity to his Autism and his vile stench. 

Now beyond what has already transpired, today at work A asked for a specific job and got it from the supervisor. After reviewing the workload, the supervisor asked him if he'd like some help. A reluctantly said that he could. After this, the supervisor made a joke about how he couldn't handle it and E jumped into the fray and attempted belittle E, which of course wasnt the supervisor's intent tongue in cheek.

After this, E was switched to work on incoming product with no complaints and A was made to do the job E was. He commented to me about how, A I just being a baby, little realizing that A had a rather nasty couple weeks at home evicting his GF and her kids and almost dying when she tried to rush him with a knife. 

Now about 20 minutes later they're having an argument I can't quite make out, but it ends with A telling him something along the lines of, ""he'd better."" Soon after that E is saying he's going to record A and get him fires.

I had front row tickets to this working where I do.

I'd like to clarify that I have no problems with special needs people, as I too suffer mental illness. I am, however, very much against people attempting to get special treatment whilst hurting others.

My question to Reddit is: how do I report to HR that not only myself, but others on the floor are extremely uncomfortable with E and his behavior without coming across, ""a bully"" when in fact I want a workplace where I and my other coworkers feel comfortable?",15Jan2020,1

I am at a complete loss for words.  I need some good advice, despersately. Here is my situation.

I've been an Amazon Prime member for several years now.  I have only had one DNA (legit) over this period and I have spent ALOT of money. Recently I have been looking for a new gaming monitor.  The first one I tried out I did not like at all, the picture was ugly, and whenever I would use my webcam (Brio 4k) it would cause the screen to tear and ghost terribly.  I sent it back, in the exact same condition it was in when I received it, along with all perepherals that came along with it.  Fast forward early January, I receive an email saying that the item I returned did not match the item that was sent to me, and I would not be getting a refund of my $400.  On top of that, they also informed me they would be ""discarding"" the item that I sent them, but made no mention of what that item was.  I got a supervisor on the phone, and she was probably the rudest Amazon rep I have ever dealt with.  First I asked what item they received ""supposedly"" and she said it was the same item but had a different serial number.   HOW IS THAT MY RESPONSIBILITY?   I returned the exact same item they sent me, I never even glanced at the serial number or even know where it is located on this monitor.  I told the rep she might want to be careful, because she is calling me a liar, when in fact I am telling the truth.  She actually reaffirmed her stance that I was lying, and said I would not be getting a refund.  I then asked okay, well then if I paid almost $400, should I not at least get the monitor back?  She said it had already been ""disposed of"", even though she explained to me earlier it was returned in perfect working condition.  Shd told me I had no avenue for recourse, that this was it.  I was so mad, I hung up, called back later after calming down.  I explained the situation to this new rep, who puts me on hold and comes back and says they will not discuss this issue over the phone with me any longer, only by email.  

Am I truly screwed out of $400?  What should I or what can I do?  Someone please help.  $400 is alot of money to me.


Thank you",15Jan2020,1
295,"Readers, I would love to hear your advice. 

My mother is about sixty years old and is currently homeless. Despite this being true, she has been financially stable all her life until we were evicted from our apartment about two years ago. She is suffering from Addison's disease, ( a severe auto-immune disorder ) a potential drug addiction, the aftermath of a nasty lawsuit, the death of my father, and symptoms of what I believe is borderline personality disorder. She spends her days in coffee shops and she sleeps in an unheated pool shed during the night. The conditions in which she lives are slowly killing her; she is emaciated ( predominately from her illness ), and she doesn't eat nutritiously ( she eats junk food mainly, it's all she can afford ). She will not seek out nor accept any help from me or her loved ones. She claims that she is fine and she shuts out anyone that intends to help, as she does not want people to worry about her. With this said, she has always been somewhat volatile and nasty when she is hurt or criticized. She vacillates from loving affection to sharp and calculated cruelty ( she has always been this way ).  She is very intelligent, funny, eccentric and lovely, but she has a very dark and difficult side. Because of her complex nature, she is very worried about her image and not her safety and health, thus she does not get help. I am eighteen and a freshman in college very far away. I am suffering every second and I would appreciate any advice or information. Something to consider is that my mother is completely opposed to getting disability for various reasons and it seems impossible to convince her to pursue that option. What should I do? Please help.",15Jan2020,1

I’m a junior in high school at the moment and everything feels so pointless. My friendships are dry and most of my days are spent going back and forth between home and school. I wouldn’t say I’m depressed, because I’m still keeping my grades in  good shape without too much effort, and I have really big plans for college and the future. It just feels like I’m not doing anything to better my life in the present and I’m basically just trudging through high school. I figure I’m going to end up regretting my decisions later on, and I’m fearful that this’ll lead to issues in college with making new friends and romances. I’m curious to hear others’ take on it, although I’m probably just gonna suck it up until I get to college.",15Jan2020,1

Other teachers be like ""let's learn and if you don't understand something ask me"" but he is like ""come to my class I won't be coming to your, take those 100yo books and rewrite those 20 pages"" or ""redraw those projects"" or ""just do something on those cutters"" and he then go away to sit in his teacher room. Never learned us anything. Now I had projects with him and something else too but that's not important. He take photos of different teachers student and gave it to us to redraw it (it was always wrong and sometimes he took photos half of one project and half of other so it gave no sense to us but cuz he never explain we didn't knew what to do.

Then 3 days before diploma(or how it's called) my class teacher(different) told me that he saw I havent made that subject so we went confront D. He told us I didn't gave him anything. My class teacher send him to go search for it (I think that wasn't smart that D went alone). After school I saw D throwing something away but I can't prove anything. I asked like every teacher how resits work and they all told me I will get mail(paper) with all instructions. Paper came but late. Paper was written 2.7 and send 3.7 and in that mail was that I had to come 1.7-4.7 to school so they give me project. So it came after that date or soonest 4.7 while day.

I always resented myself and honestly had a lot of self hatred. I would do thinngs like harm myself and even after the weight change i did it sometimes. lifes rough before and after the journey. but...
i never met a guy who was viewed as attractive by everyone and had so much self hatred. sounds dumb, i know. i knew it existed but rarely- because most of the guys i grew up w loved how attractive they were and always metaphorically sucked their dicks to others about there looks.
i am in a new country studying abroad and i met this guy who confided in my roommates and i about his cutting and hatred towards himself. it broke my heart honestly. hes incredibly kind, too- to everyone. hes tall and tan and gorgeous and he was explaining all these issues and it made me sad that no one was there for him.
And he told me that i remind him a lot of a girl he was hooking up w last semester and he saw as different. 
I wanna express my ability to be there for him in anything no matter what but im not sure how. we were all drunk last night and he ended up sleeping on our couch but thanked me in the morning and said we have unfinished convo to finish ( we were interupted a lot and never finished our personal convo).

Her schizophrenia gives her the idea that she can do anything she wants with no consequences. She hacked one person's email and found their address, phone number, etc. For another she has been stalking on social media and follows in the real world. Finally, when kaya used to be with her ex boyfriend, she did messed up things like poke him with sharp objects to draw blood as a form of affection (that's where the sadism comes in). In terms of my friend Jenny, she's scared to do anything because Kaya has given a picture of Jenny to some random older guy and threatened he will do something if Jenny does not comply and date Kaya. She wants Jenny to cut contact with me and the other who care for Jenny because they're the one thing in the way of Kaya controlling Jenny. She has threatened to blackmail us as well.

It turns out the apartment will get this smell when her door is open or slight wafts here and there from heaters or fans pushing and pulling the air.

I’m sure depression and other factors may exist, so I’d like to lay on some hints and passive suggestions that would give her the stimulation to improve her small room of a situation.

When we were kids sharing a room was definitely the right call for us. You know we bonded, we made memories all that good stuff. But as we’ve grown we have kinda drifted apart and it’s getting a bit crowded for the three of us. Our room is constantly a mess and privacy is practically nonexistent.

I’ve been considering moving out to one of the other two rooms in the house, the guest room (we haven’t had guests in over 7 years) and the housekeeper room (our housekeeper no longer lives with us) but out of respect for my parents I do not want to do so without their blessing. Right now I’ve already spoken with my parents about it and they do not like the idea. Since I know my mother, I did not ask her to flat out give me a room. I wanted to earn it and prove that I’m ready to handle the responsibility. I was quickly shut down and any “challenge” I was given was set unrealistically high as to prevent me from actually achieving it (“I’ll give you a room if you score an average of 100 this semester”).

As far as I can tell she is reluctant to give any of us our own rooms since she believes we’ll “drift apart even more” and any attempt of me trying to get her to understand that space will be a good thing for us has not been successful. Another reason might be that the housekeeper room is significantly smaller than the other two rooms and she doesn’t want to seem unfair to any of us. I’d honestly be willing to take the housekeeper room but yet again she denies my request.

Currently it seems that I am making no progress in convincing my mother and though I haven’t discussed further with my father since initially suggesting it, it is unlikely he will feel any different.

Any suggestions?

This happened on New Years Eve. So my dad has had mental problems my whole life and they've only gotten worse. He already had PTSD from going to war and his abusive childhood. Now he told my brother that the TV talks to him and tells him to do bad things. First and fore most my dad is the best dad in the world. He has given up everything for me and my brother. But things were not right in his head and he saw suicide as the only way to keep himself from hurting others. He cut himself really deep but luckily we were able to call an ambulance in time.

I like to keep track of my relationships with people...that makes my ocd go cray cray when I don’t know what I am to someone. We don’t really sext that often a lot either. So we aren’t really sexting as often then how much I’d like. Idk what we are ugh

338,"First of all, I'm not a native english speaker, so my apologies for any mistakes here. And I'm indeed a mobile user.

And please, before coming screaming at me that I'm dumb or a creep, please read the full story... I know it's stupid. I know I'm stupid. And this is why I need help.

(TL/DR at the end)

So, I (18M) started to become a huuuge fan of music when I was like 12-13. Any genre, really. I was a bit in an emo phase, but even then, I was genuinely attracted to the music's world. I started to take guitar and drum lessons, was always excited about discovering another artist, always with my earbuds on...

But then, when I was about 14yo, I found the one. You know ? Everyone has one. The one. The one that gives you shivers down your spine when you hear their voice, their lyrics. The one that makes songs that make you dream while being awake. The one you really admire and like. Well, I found them. At first, I was not really convinced. And I think it's the reason I didn't see my obsession coming. Because it was not instant. It was step by step.

I started to watch more shows and interviews about him. I learned more about who he is, how he became such a talented artist, and it came to a point where I listened to his songs everyday, downloaded some videos and pictured of him, joined some fan's groups.

Then... The merch. I don't know why I didn't see my obsession before. First, albums. Nothing wrong here. Then, more albums... Posters. Goodies. Jewellery. Literally everything that could make me think about him. I even bought things from the other side of the world because it was a limited product in his native country. I even tough about getting a tattoo related to him, without being to obvious. 

And I think I didn't realize this obsession because it was just part of my life. Of course I was doing something else too ! And, in fact, I was still really into other artists. But it was so usual for me to just go for him that it was just part of me. Part of my life. I was even lucky enough to attend one of his concert one time, and it was hecking good. But I was not super excited like a 12yo 1D fangirl. I was just happy and enjoyed this moment like I was supposed to.

But 2 days ago, something happened. Something huge. Out of nowhere, he announced that he was getting married and a child was already on the way. Nothing wrong, of course it was going to happened. And why would I care, right ? I mean, he didn't talked about any girlfriend during all these years, but of course his private life has to be private. But I... I don't know. I was so shocked. My mind just... broke. Instantly. I said in some other reddit post that I was diagnosed with Panic Disorder a few months ago, but with treatment and a lot of sport, I was getting better. In fact, I haven't got any attack in a few weeks now ! Well I just totally broke down. I passed out. I cried. I vomited. I was scared. For what ? I don't know. I'm not the straighter guy on earth, but why the hell would I care about his private life ? I admire him. I want to be like him. I don't wanna be with him. And I never did. So I knew that the problem was not me being gay again.

It's been two days now and I just realized that I was obsessed. I think I'm scared because I don't want him to drop off his career. I'm scared because I used him to get my head out of the water, but I never really learned how to swim. Now I'm lost. I was his shadow for almost 4 years (and it's a long time for someone that young, I think so ?) And now I just feel... Empty. Like my world started to fall. Like I don't have any goal now. I can't even eat without feeling sick. And he didn't even say anything about ending his career. I'm just... Lost. Scared. I don't even know. I don't even know why I am like this. I'm just so tired of myself.

So, people of reddit who were in similar situations, how can I snap out of it ? How can I stop wanting to be like him, and being just me ? How to stop this obsession without losing my admiration ?

(TL/DR: I got so obsessed with an artist that all my life was based on him, and now that he will soon ends his career, I'm lost. What can I do to snap out of it without losing my admiration ?)",15Jan2020,1

My manager has already visited this client with our CTO and some architects. (Everyone else in this post is male over forty.) Each trip they've come back with crazy stories of good and bad nights on the town. There have been black eyes, dive bars, bromance bonding - living it up. 

So now I'm joining a two week trip with me, my manager, our CTO, and two major sales/account managers. We're tasked with smoothing over and renegotiating some major fuck ups.

344,"I feel like im running out of options with the way my life is going right now.

I've been struggling with a lot of things within my life the last couple years and have done nothing to improve them.  Some underlying issues to consider that I believe made my life the way it is today was my parents divorce when I was 4, Im 22 and havent seen my Dad since I was 6. Since then my mom has gone through an emotional whirlwind almost causing unhealthy relationships everywhere she goes. My older sister and I cant stand her half the time. Honestly, i'v felt emotionally abused by her since the divorce making it hard for me to have the ability to have healthy relationships with people, I have a strong lack of confidence in relationships because of this I feel like. I always feel like people are going to hurt me or lash out and leave me like many people have in my life. 

There are many details I could include right now and I really want to fix what is going on in my life to the fullest extent because im tired of how I am living. I feel like I accept mediocrity and never put any effort into anything anymore. I got depressed freshman year and during the summer got a girl pregnant and destroyed the next two years of my life holding the news in from my family. Up until recently I found the strength to forgive myself for bringing a child into the world. Meanwhile I have a bitter relationship with the mom because I abandoned her because the fear of my mom finding out petrified me. Even now I feel remorse towards the girl for keeping the baby because I was not ready....at all I feel cheated out of a life experience because there was no love involved. Even now I still have visitation once a week but theres no feelings, I cant hold myself to accept that part of my life. Since graduating I'm living at home. Was working a temp job and the job turned out to be a dud. My employer didn't even take the time to train me properly and set high expectations for situations that were out of my control. 

Additionally to that, I just broke up with a girl I had been dating for 2 months for multiple reasons. Everything started out so well and it was the first time I was actually serious about anyone and I jumped into too quickly. It fell apart when she left to study abroad. I think my judgment is poor because there were many  signs that it would not work. one being she didnt want to get married until she was in her 30s and the lack of communication of her feelings was difficult to assess the relationship. Maybe it was everything going on in my life but I wanted one person to invest in me, and make me feel cared for. She ended it saying she needed to explore what was out there and find herself, maybe i need to do the same. But when she said this at first i accepted her feelings because she wanted to get back together at the end of her trip but I became destructive that she would leave me or not want me or didnt care about me. I messaged her enough times to block me on everything because that was the only way I felt like I would get over her. If I didnt have access to communication to her I would be forced to move on.

Now a couple days later im living at home, struggling to find a job, without a girlfriend, no plan in mind. I feel destructive and completely alone. One thing I want to do is move to a new city and start over.",15Jan2020,1

Well, I'm 16 and, yes, I know what many of you might say: you're young, you are still going to experience many things in you life, and so on. But, I just can't move on. It's been 2.5 years and it seems I'm still stuck in the past. So, some friends of mine introduced me to a girl (gonna call her Mary) and we started talking and became really best friends. We had so much in common that we could talk to each other for hours and it would seem like minutes. Our relationship was really special and we knew we could always rely on each other. One day we started talking about our relationship because our friends were suggesting that we should date and she asked me out. I told her I was not sure because I thought we were moving too fast but it was actually because I was afraid of changes and losing the friendship we had. She said okay and we waited. I kept acting like that and avoiding this type of conversation (okay I know, I was immature and I'm not proud of what I did). We loved each other but I just..  ah idk. So, one day I got into an argument with her because of something **REALLY** irresponsible and inconsequential I had done which upset her. I knew I had fucked it up but I just didn't know how to make it up to her. After that day, things changed. She changed, I changed and our relationship changed. As time passed by we stopped talking to each other and, a couple of months later, she started dating a guy I didn't know. She moved on, but I didn't. I don't know why I didn't. I had had other relationships before I met her and I've overcome them, but I haven't forgotten Mary. Perhaps, it's because we had something different, something special and that's true. She was different from all the other people I've ever met. Every time I think about her or what we had it gest me down. I just wish I had a second change. I wish I could try again, but that's practically impossible, unless we suddenly started talking again after almost 3 years (not gonna happen).So all I want is to forget her. I want to move on. I missed many opportunities, lost friends and practically wasted 2 years of my life because of some bad things that happen because I keep thinking about the past, especially about Mary and how bad I wish I had a second change. I can't explain, it all seems so irrational and silly but I just can't move on and I really want to.",15Jan2020,1

Trigger warning: Sexual assault

________________________________________________

This is written in a stream-of-consciousness style, so I apologize if it is hard to keep track of. I'll try to keep things in order.

This is a long-read; Go to Part 8/P8 for question

So, just some background to start: I am asexual, but not because of the trauma you're about to read. 

Part 1:  When I was about nine years-old, an acquaintance's (of my parent's) son, inflicted some sex-related trauma (sexual assualt? rape?) onto me and I proceeded to block out the whole event for ten years. Hell, I don't even remember most of it other than where it occured, events surrounding it, and so on and so fourth. 

P2: Afterwards, I proceeded to become adverse to sex and anything really related to it. But, I just didn't know that the trauma had caused it. Note: this bit is important. 

P3: In between the ten years of repressing the event as a whole, I have mild flashbacks that appear sometimes out of nowhere and when some triggers happen. These flashbacks are not explicitly of the event occuring. Just the feelings, seeing my assailant's face for very brief moments, and having an out-of-body experience from when the event is occuring. The triggers stem from music (50cent) that was playing the day of the event and of something (mustard) that I stepped in the night before. 

P4: When I am in my freshman year of college, so about ten years later or so, I start to connect the flashbacks and triggers together. 

P5: I never really touch on the subject again until a few days ago. 

P6: I have been out of a relationship for a few months now. Hell, a lot of these ""relationships,"" were just one-off flings or could-be relationships. Anyway, I got into thinking about why I decided to stop dating: sex. Now, I've never really been into sex due to me being ace and just finding it boring. I only had sex to appease my partner. That got me to decide that I need to do what's best for me. But there was something still bugging me. 

P7: This ""bug"" was the constant feeling of underlying disgust that would appear after having sex. It wasn't disgust that came from not liking my partner. I only had sex w/ people I was interested in. But, every partner has always been into sex in a big way. Especially two partners: one that I was with who was big into kink.; Another that was very, very perverted and I dated for 1.5 years. I left the kink partner because I discovered that kink as a whole, when I was involved in it, disgusted me. I left my longish-term partner because they were emotionally abusive. 

P8: The main underlying issue was that I forced myself into having sex despite knowing I don't care for it. I always felt disgusted. Did forcing myself into having sex for 8 years have an affect similar to disgust as a result of my trauma? 

I know it can be confusing but I'm sure there has to be a reason I'm constantly disgusted by having sex and why my trauma keeps reappearing. I know that I generally don't care for sex, but wouldn't I refuse to have sex at all if I was completely disgusted to begin with? 

I hope someone can help. If not, at least I was able to get this off of my chest",15Jan2020,1
353,"So to start off I am not an anti vaxxer. I am vaccinated, my kids are vaccinated, hell even my pets are vaccinated.
My problem is this I am not a pharmacist or a pathologist but I do see some concerning things about the flu shot.
1. If the flu is only around during flu season where does it go the rest of the time to come back later?
2.how do the pharmaceutical companies know the new strain of the flu before it hits (ie flu shot before the flu even starts going around)?
3. I've never had a flu shot and yet I've only had the flu twice. Both times I got it was immediately after someone in the house got their flu shot.

So from my perspective the flu shot seems to be what is passing the flu around. But as I said I'm not a pharmacist or a pathologist. So if someone who knows could please explain it to me it would be much appreciated.

He cheats quite a lot and normally I'd just ignore it, that's not my relationship (plus I liked when I said his gf is tolerable.

I thought the first flash was a random lightning as it had been raining earlier. At the second flash, I could pinpoint where it came from (ground floor window in one of the houses). It's when I realised it was a man taking pictures, and clearly aiming at me. As I looked in his direction, he took a third picture (third flash) not even hiding what he was doing.

We would be in the break room and he'd just open up to me, it was very cool and humbling. He just instantly valued me and appreciated me.... we didn't work often together, but we remained cool.

A few months later he had told me that his sister will be working here; they are very close and when she began working here, her and i didn't really talk or anything.
then a couple months ago I realized that he no longer worked here, yet his sister continued to do so...

When I found out this happened, I knew I had to ask his sister what happened.... soon after we were working nearby away from everyone, which doesn't happen often since we're in different departments...
nonetheless I asked her about school, winter break, and then her brother... I then asked for his number since he would open up to me a lot, and she seemed gracious to give that to me...

Ever since then we've had a few good conversations over the past few weeks and get along well! She also frequently says hi to me and initiates conversation etc... she'll just walk up to me while I'm working and greet me, talk to me a bit... she went on a trip recently, and I asked her how it was etc... she wanted to switch departments, and I offered to email this manager about it, which she agreed.... and then this happened:

The other night, I’m doing some work in my department, and all of a sudden I hear someone say “Hi (my name)!""

I look up and its her, and I greet her back, and then she tells me how she’s getting more hours at work now that her schedule has freed up a bit.. she works just once/week.
then I let her know that I spoke with my manager about her wanting to work in a different dept (she had asked me to do this), and that we'd talk later.

About an hour later she's on break walks by my dept and says “Hi (my name)!"" again.. She was on her 15 minute break, and she was just standing in front of my dept in one of the aisles, waiting for me to talk to her it appeared..

I had to help a customer, and a few minutes later she walks up to me and asks “are you closing today?"", and I said yes and asked her the same.

I then told her what my manager said, and mentioned that I could take down her number and update her if anything changes... I also let her know that I want to keep in touch...

She agreed, so I took out a pen and post-it note for her to write her number on, and she actually wrote the wrong area code, crossed it out, tried to write it again and wrote it wrong again…

third time she wrote it right and gave it to me… she seemed nervous, yet we then talked for a couple minutes about her getting more hours, and then I told her “well I’ll keep you updated! Have a good break!”

I was determined to be a psychologist during my freshman and sophomore year of high school since I enjoy communicating with people and listening to them. 

During junior and senior year, the medical field peaked my interest. I took a lot of regular and AP science classes because of that interest, and they were all awesome. I thought that maybe being a pediatrician would be cool. Or a cardiologist.

But a couple of months ago, I had a small epiphany and realized that I could be a vet. More specifically, an avian vet. I asked myself, why not this career? I’ve had parakeets since I was a kid and grew up with them. I currently have 8 budgies. I would absolutely love to be a bird veterinarian.

And yes, I've tried selling stuff. I got low-balled and that's all I've seen was people asking to pay $50 for a $600 camera I held on to since mid 2018

368,"hey everyone, this is my first time on here so please don't be too mean to me lol. Im a 20 year old girl and im just now realizing how im so stuck on this one guy and its so hard for me to let go of him. I met this guy in high school and we never really spoke like that but towards the end of the year he would flirt with me a bit. I found him superrr attractive and I entertained it but I also had heard that he got around a lot so that put me off and I didnt think that much about him. In the summer after high school I would go hang out with my friends at the local hang out spot and he happened to work there. Whenever he would see me he would be super flirty but he literally never bothered to message me on snap or anything which i never understood. I saw him a few times and I guess i just developed a little crush and i started to think about him more and more. one night i replied to his story on snapchat because i was so frustrated and he responded super well. We immediately started talking, facetiming every night, hanging out, and doing all that lovey dovey shit but we never dated. Keep in mind I was 18 and he was 17 at this time. I got super busy with college and we started seeing each other less and he ended up breaking things off with me. i was super crushed and he literally got a girlfriend a few weeks later but he would still message me from time to time and i was super clear that i wasnt going to have anything to do with him if he had a girl. they broke up and we started talking again but at this point we started being intimate and having sex and it turned into i guess a friends with benefits situation. I still had feelings for him even though i tried not to and i would get jealous and angry over stupid stuff. I knew it was bad for me so i told him i was officially done and i couldnt do it anymore. i told him to delete my number ( i was pretty dramatic) he ended up blocking me on snapchat and blocking my number. this lasted for about 1-2 months and he unblocked me on nye and sent me a long paragraph apologizing for everything and saying that he took me for granted but appreciated everything that i did for him and for being there for him and how he still wants to be in my life even as just a friend. we became friends again but after chilling with him a few times i did end up having sex with him a few times. At this point in my life my mom ended up in the hospital and i think a part of me felt that by hanging out with him it would make me feel like nothing in my life has changed or that i was still the same dumb little girl that i always was but at this point my feelings for him were not a priority. My mom started to get worse and so i stopped answering my phone and would go visit her every day after work or after school. i spent time with my brothers worrying everyday about her and trying my best to take care of my little brother at home without her. this guy was blowing up my phone with calls and texts asking me if i was okay but i didnt answer. he saw my little brother one day and asked him about me and wanted to know what was going on and my little brother told him. i ended up talking to him on the phone and apologizing for being distant but didnt go into detail about what i was going through. my mom was in the hospital from january to may until she passed away. the night before my mother passed away, i was eating out with my friends because it was her birthday and saw him. the next day was the worst day of my life and i lost my best friend. i cut off everyone, every single one of my friends and didnt leave the house. i didnt tell anyone about the funeral but my best friends somehow found out where it was and showed up which had me sobbing. i feel like everything is just coming out right now and i dont know where this is going so please bear with me. i just wanna say that losing my mom is a nightmare and im still in so much shock that i feel so numb to it now which scares me, but i dont want to talk about that because its just a bigger issue but i know that it could relate to whats going on with this guy now because i just wanna understand if he really does care for me or not. anyways i never answered this guys texts or anything because i just cut everyone off for about 4 months. i was doing my own thing trying to grieve and in october i started to get back into a regular routine, going to school, seeing my friends. my friend ended up posting a picture with me on her instagram and that was probably the first anyones seen of me for months. this led to him messaging my brother and asking how i was doing. he asked him for my number because he got a new phone and my brother gave it to him. he sent me a text apologizing again and i was confused because nothing happened between us but then i realized that he didnt know what happened and that he didnt get why i stopped talking to him. long story short, i explained and he listened. we ended up becoming friends again and talking and hanging out. ive had sex with him twice but i dont know what we are doing or what i am doing. we hang out a LOT like we've spent a lot of time together and we just chill in the car, listen to music , smoke and talk. we go drive around and go up small mountains to see the view of the city , we go to the movies, and i dont know what it is but i feel so connected and attached to him now and it scares me. ive cried in front of him and talked about my mom when he asks and i hate feeling so vulnerable especially with him. i know he has PLENTY of girls that think hes attractive and that message him and he's also been with a lot of girls, so i just wanna know why he keeps coming back to me? and is it a bad thing that i keep letting him? i dont want a relationship with him but i love whatever it is that we are but im scared of it ending. he told me that it hurt him that i stopped talking to him for 6 months and that he thought it was because the last night i saw him he said something wrong. he said that he always thought about me and asked his friends what couldve happened. but now i havent seen him in like 3 weeks and i was feeling a way about it but i didnt say anything i just asked him how he's been ( we've still been messaging just not chilling) and he randomly reassured me that hes just been in his own zone and that he misses me a lot but im just kinda worried that its over. i dont know what i want or how i feel about anything but i feel like im always thinking about this guy. i just feel like i need other perspectives. please be nice lol",15Jan2020,1
369,"When people have issues in their friendships, how do they move forward?

A friend is dating the ex of another friend, which is fine we're all grown-ups. But in the course of all this happening, they behaved really badly and hurt a lot of people's feelings. It also raised old issues for some people (not so much me).

Our friendship has changed since then. We used to chat every day, now we text once a week. 

Things may never be the same as she's busy with her new boyfriend. That's fine. But how do I heal from being hurt by her? (No point sharing the long story) This is more of a general question about how do you move on within friendships after being very hurt? Nowadays when we are in contact, I'm reminded of the hurt I felt. I need to move past it. I'm not sure if raising the issue with her will help or if it will just make things awkward.

I don't tend to have frequent dramas with people, but over my 39 years I've had the occasional drama and I never know how to deal with it, so I often find myself drifting away from those people instead of dealing with it.

I had a situation last year with some relatives where there was hurt on both ends. We seem to have patched things up. We talked about it briefly via messenger but not in a level of detail that could have explained things. So not much was actually sorted out, but we both desired to fix it so we just started hanging out again. Over time the tension eased and now things are at a good place. I really value that. I wonder if that's how I should deal with this other issue?",15Jan2020,1

372,"Okay, so I am a 23f. I’ve never been in a relationship. For various reasons but mostly because I get extreme anxiety when it comes to the idea. Like, even growing up I was the type to think a boy was cute but then once I knew he felt the same it’s like my brain immediately hit the abort button and I was no longer interested. It’s like I never outgrew that. I’ve had opportunities to be physically involved with some guys but I found myself getting paralyzed at the thought and wanted to immediately exit the situation. Which means, I’ve never been in a relationship. And yes it’s an anxiety thing but it seems deeper than that. Like I like the thought of sex and I’ll fantasize about it. But, I don’t like the thought of actually having sex with someone else. Sometimes I think maybe I’m a weird form of being asexual (not that asexuals are weird I just mean I’m sort of an off brand asexual). It’s like I like the idea of love but don’t actually want to be loved?

I don’t know if I’m making any sense or if my words are coming out in the way I mean for them to. But, has anyone felt with something similar? Is it maybe just a matter of getting comfortable with someone first or am I just this way? Is there a term for something like this or am I just over complicating things (which I always do)

Moved into a new apartment, hardwood floors everywhere. I can hear my below neighbors TV frequently. I don't think they are listening super loud, and I don't think the noise is really deep bass or anything. I think the apartment just sucks and the floors are thin so the STC is probably really low.

I was wondering if something like buying a thick rug or two could help? My floor is pretty open and I can really hear it in the living room where I have nothing (no couch/table). I would even consider buying an undermat for the rugs or MLV for under them if those would help as well.

My concern is from the saying ""treat soundproofing like waterproofing."" The windows &amp; doors leak a lot of noise from the road outside (which doesn't bother me since if feels more like white noise), but I don't think the neighbors noise is coming from those. I also have no chance of covering the whole floor in something since it's a decent size.

382,"I (F18) am about to start first year uni this year, but decided to attend summer school to get a head start on one of my subjects. I am not officially enrolled into this class. My brother did this subject but failed so he is enrolled and I’m just tagging along with him. 

The lecturer does not even notice my existence which is fine. But my tutor is a pretty keen tutor so when marking the roll, I had to explain my situation. And he was really nice about it and was more shocked about me voluntarily joining this class. 

This tutor seems quite awkward and probably is on the spectrum. He is really nice but just kinda awkward and all. Kinda dorky? Idk, I hope I painted the picture well. 

I’ve only attended this tutorial 3 times now. But he has been sending me and my brother emails (to both of us and then privately for some). He would mix in class related stuff with a long winded stuff not related to class. Whether that is about my name, other students who I shared my name with and their background whom he has taught previously and then stuff about my love/happiness??

I’ll explain. Stuff like how he plans on pair up students in the class and was wondering how he would pair me up someone. (But I don’t get why he needs to pair us up. There’s no reason to for a math class) If I don’t mind going with an older guy and how old I would go for. (He asked this to my brother privately) and then goes to change the class code name to LOVE in stead of MATH. And that he wishes me a lot of happiness and that. It’s weird cause it’s mixed in in with normal math class content. He’s also reading into my email sign off with “kind regards - (my name)”. Asking if I say it to other people o if it’s just automatic???

He would use his private email to email me. He had asked for my email in class but I gave him my uni one. 

Idk my brother is pissed cause he just wants to pass this class. He doesn’t want to deal with this tutor’s private emails but doesn’t want to be harsh with him in efforts for good rapport. But at the same time, he kinda feels bad for the tutor. We suspect that he is lonely and just wants people to talk to and is just being overly nice. This tutor doesn’t bother me at all in class, he’s just quiet and awkward around me. 

I don’t want to escalate the issue cause he hasn’t necessarily done anything wrong. I want to still turn up to class to learn but idk.

and posts stuff on her story shortly after.

I’m a bit hurt at this, because she’s obviously starting to slowly phase me out of her life for her first ever “boyfriend/date”.

384,"So I am currently a sophomore in highschool and I am dealing with a few issues that I feel like are holding me back a lot. 
For some background information I am very fortunate to be living comfortably in the middle class and have two great parents who take really good care of me. I wouldn’t consider myself extremely popular but I have a good amount of friends and people that I talk to everyday. I do not frequently use drugs but occasionally will smoke some weed, drink, or vape, although I try my best to keep from turning these into habits. 

My main issues are:
1. I feel like I am always tired especially during the week no matter how much sleep I get, I usually drink a cup or two of coffee in the morning but it doesn’t help that much.

2. I usually am pretty distracted in class and pay more attention to my thoughts and friends than what the teacher is saying.

3. I don’t really have any long term goals or aspirations and I don’t have any idea what to study in college. (Although I am interested in film, politics, video games, and history)

4. Being raised in a Catholic family I have began to question the Catholic Church a lot and don’t really consider myself religious anymore, this really scares me as I feel like the human race truly doesn’t know why we are here and religion and philosophy are all just theories of reasons why we MIGHT be here. 

5. I usually have a negative mindset and find it hard to see the positive side of some things, I guess I have more of a “doomer”mindset and think pretty nihilistically. 

6. I procrastinate a lot because of how I view a lot of schoolwork as busywork and don’t see much point in doing it. 

7. I feel like a lot of my days I’m just doing the same thing over and over again and I feel like I’m wasting some of the best years of my life not enjoying it. Most people I see in school seen so ignorant and carefree of the issues plaguing our world today and I don’t know how they can be so effortlessly happy. This summer I volunteered at a physical therapy clinic and I just can’t imagine myself doing the same job everyday for years.

8. I feel like the mental health of my generation is really terrible and on social media I’ve been seeing a lot of videos from people my age who experience similar thoughts and problems.

She explained to me that she represses her narcissistic thoughts, instead of voicing them, because she knows that people would get sick of that. She expressed that she doesn't care about anyone or their feelings, but rather how they can benefit her in the long run. 



About 6 months ago, we grew closer and became best friends. We started spending most of our free time together, always making spontaneous plans with each other. One night, we jokingly had a wedding ceremony (we have an inside joke about how we're basically a married couple from all the time we spend together). The next morning, we took a spontaneous trip to the flea market and bought rings. From that point onward, we began referring to each other as wives, and wearing our rings everyday.




Afterwards, our bond became a weird complex. We slowly started getting a little romantic with hugging, holding hands, kissing, and lots of cuddling. As a touchy feely person, I saw it as nothing, but I noticed that it was out of ordinary for her. She is more of an introverted person, and isn't remotely affectionate with anyone. One day, she randomly told me that she cares about me. That when I'm sad, she feels bad for me, and that she doesn't feel that for basically anyone else. It kinda took me off-guard, as I didn't think that she possessed any empathy whatsoever. It hit me in a soft spot, because I'm clinically depressed, and it was nice to hear that somebody cares about me and my wellbeing.  We soon became each others biggest support systems, filling each other with attention and validation. 



Last month, her aunt went on a vacation, and asked us to watch her house while she was gone. We knew that nobody would be home, so we mutually decided that if anything sexual happens, it happens. We got really drunk, and we were inseparable for the entire night. We were just making out, then one thing led to another, and we did it 4 times. We've touched on the subject of our hookup a few times after that night, but never in depth. Ever since, we're still romantically affectionate with one another, but nothing sexual. But my issue is my developing feelings for her. 



I feel emotionally and sexually drawn to her, but I'm scared to talk with her about this because I'm not sure if she feels the same way about me, since she has NPD. I know she can't express empathy as easily as I can, and I'm afraid that I would lose my best friend if I told her that I've developed romantic feelings. What should I do?",15Jan2020,1
397,"I'm in Florida, United States of America.

My sister recently had a problem with her kids and my parents took custody. (2, 4, 5, 7 year old kids) I've been staying home from school (9th Grade) because I know my parents are doing a bad job, and there's no way for them to go to a different household right now cause my sister broke a restraining order, and the boyfriend's family has all done crimes.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been feeding, teaching, and helping these kids, and trying to help my parents be with them better. They came from a terrible family, and my parents are having a hard time getting them to ever do anything they say. There is no violence, but constant yelling, screaming, crying, broken glass, toys, stepping on cats (on accident).

I'm not the one who directly talks to him bc frankly I had my fair share of people who needed my help and I just ended up wrecking myself. I didn't want to go through another situation like that one because I got too into it that I felt that it was my responsibility to help them and not thought of leading them to professionals who knew exactly how to deal with it. Anyways, I didnt want to help him because he would make you feel guilty for not hearing him out or for being too busy. He wouldn't just text you but, call you as well no matter if it is in the morning or when you are sleeping. Most of the time he calls when she is sleeping or at work because that's where she usually is all the time. The thing is my sister is getting annoyed of him. Despite her advices or contributions to help him, he still does not listen nor take the help that is given to him. We all know that he still needs the help and it is the right thing to do to hear him out and talk to him. But, he now turned to me for help as well (I'm the only one out of us three sisters that he didnt constantly bother) 
I am in no way ready to receive his problems and in no way the right person for the job. But, I still want to help.

404,"I have a job interview soon, where I am sure they will ask me about my past work experience and why I quit. A few years ago, I used to work at a similar type of company. During my 1 year there, I developed a relationahip with a coworker, which went bad. This was one of the main reasons I quit the company, as it was too painful for me to stay there.

In my resignation letter, I made no mention of my relationship, but rather that I needed to focus more on my school (I was a full time university student). However, gossip was spread around and everyone found out about the relationship, even my hiring manager, who I plan to use as reference. 

Now, I am not sure what to quote as my quitting reason for this job. I don't want to say I need to focus on school, as I am still studying and that will discourage them from hiring me. Also, I don't want to mention my ex, although I am a bit scared what my manager will say when they call to reference-check me.

405,"I'm a fresh college graduate and just getting into the workflow. I recently was hired as a temp employee at a big firm and I can't afford the commute. The job is basically minimum wage ($11/hr) and I live quite a distance from the office. Although it's way across town, I took the job because I really need the money and I was told pay is deposited weekly. Today was my first day and the recruiter said new hires get payed next week Friday, not this Friday like I assumed. I don't have enough money for this week and next week.

For clarity, when I say I live across town, I really do. I must leave my house at 6:00 a.m. to get there by 7:50 - 8:00 a.m. I use public transportation, but the trains only go so far and I end up spending $55 (or more) per day in Uber to take me the rest of the distance. I did the math and $55 per day is $275 per week. For a whole month I'd be spending $1,100 in transportation. 

I have asked my mother if I could borrow some money and she isn't in a place to help out because I'm usually the person she borrows from. I have a wealthy family member that sometimes gives me money, but I don't want her to think I'm abusing her kindness.

I really would like to keep this job as it's only a 5 month assignment. I'm trying to save money so I can get my master's degree. I also need to pay bills and eat. What are my options?? Should I resign? My recruiter mentioned that the staffing agency keeps a profile on it's employees and if I resign I may not be eligible to rehire with the company. So If I do decide to resign it may take months to find another job. I'm at such a loss. Advice?",15Jan2020,1

407,"It’s a bit of a weird situation, because I think my RSVP to the bachelorette party actually got lost or forgotten about.  

I RSVP’d to my future SIL’s bachelorette party in late November and told her in person that I was attending. It’s now about a month away and I haven’t gotten any additional details about the trip, so I figured I would ask the MOH what was up.  

In talking to my brother about it, he said that future SIL thought I wasn’t going. For whatever reason, it appears that I might have been left off of the planning. I doubt it was intentional, since we have a great relationship and if I wasn’t wanted at the party, I wouldn’t have been invited in the first place.   

My brother said he was going to ask her about it and let her know that I’m going. Problem is, I just checked flights for that weekend, and they are WAY more than I can afford. Add up flights, hotel, meals/activities, AND splitting future SIL’s expenses too— there’s no way I can afford it.   

How can I tactfully back out of attending, when it appears no one thought I was going in the first place? I don’t want to go through the trouble of finding out if I’m still invited, only to turn around and decline the invitation.   

My first instinct is to text future SIL first thing tomorrow morning and say something like this: “I think there was a mix up with my RSVP to your bachelorette party. I originally RSVP’d yes, but [brother] mentioned you thought I wasn’t going. I was going to email MOH and look into it, but I also looked at flights and realized that they’re way out of my budget. I think I’m going to have to miss out on the weekend. Is that ok with you?”

I don't like who I am, who I've been, or who I'm becoming. I cringe at the thought of my mistakes.

I'm scared and a coward around others. I'm beta. I am capable of pretending to be normal, but only to an extent. People usually realize I'm lame pretty quickly.

410,"I have always had issues with myself but over the past several months it feels like everything has piled on at once. I can’t do anything anymore it feels like, I tried going back to the gym yesterday but I didn’t complete the work out because I just couldn’t motivate myself, I had been trying to learn to sketch and I enjoyed it but now I can’t bring myself to practice it anymore, the only thing I’ve been able to keep up is my diet.

 It feels so pointless to try or do anything because I know that nobody wants to be with me. I have tried everything in my power to give myself some appeal but none of it works, I thought maybe it was because I was overweight but I’ve lost 80 pounds and still no one is interested in me. This hurts so badly because I worked so hard to get to this point and what was it all for? Just to be healthier alone? I don’t care about being healthy or being fit, I just want to have the opportunity to have some chance at finding somebody who feels like I’m worth their time. I wish that somehow I could articulate how defeated and demoralized I feel when I see myself in the mirror every morning, I have grown to absolutely hate myself.

I feel like an insane person because it’s almost all I think about anymore, no matter if I am hanging out with my friends or playing games or whatever these thoughts are always in the back of my mind. When I daydream in class I’m lamenting over how ugly I looked before I left my dorm. My friends always tell me I’m an attractive guy and that they can’t understand why I have so little success but I can’t help but feel so irritated when I hear stuff like that. Obviously I don’t try to express my frustration but i just feel like if I were anywhere near even average somebody would want me.

I’m just at the point where I think about suicide quite a bit, I would say at least twice an hour. I don’t think about plans for my future life anymore or daydream about stuff I’ll do when I graduate, it feels silly to pretend like I don’t know how it’s going to end. I have no resources to reach out to for this, I’ll never be able to afford therapy and I don’t have people in my life I can talk to about this. I thought about asking on r/suicidewatch but they definitely don’t promote any help.

I feel like this is it, like no matter how hard I try to improve my situation that I’m just screwed regardless. The only things that have been keeping me going is drinking and weed, I don’t know how else to cope with this.

420,"Sorry, long post, but I kind of need to type all this out.

Background: 

I am in my late 20s, living in the suburbs of a college town.  I live in my widowed father's house, and am reliant upon him financially (he gets pension + social security).  He's in his late 70s and his health is declining.

I have dealt with mental health issues, Depression and Anxiety in particular, for most of my life.  I attempted suicide once.  I have tried numerous antidepressant medications and seen many therapists.  My current med was working for a while, but is slowly losing its effect.

I never had a clear idea on what I wanted to do with my life.  I've taken career aptitude tests, but every career ""field"" is equally unappealing in my eyes.  (Is this a result of my mental illness?  Maybe?  Does it matter when the mental illness is a variable that cannot be removed?).

I got good grades in high school despite my lack of interest in any of the subjects.  I applied to, and got into, the nearby 4-year university even though I had no idea what I would want to major in or anything.  I attended for a couple years, then took a break due to apathy and mental health issues.

Two years pass where I do nothing but wallow in my own misery.  I get officially diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and start taking antidepressants.

Eventually, I managed to get a job at a call center and stayed there until I got sick of it and quit about a year later.

I decided to try going back to college.  I chose Anthropology as my major because it had the most lenient graduation requirements.  Every other major either didn't interest me in the slightest or was too technical/beyond my mental faculties.  I was never any good at math or science stuff.  At this point I figured ""any degree was better than no degree"".

I got through a couple more semesters, but mental illness and apathy forced me to withdraw, again.  I had crippling doubts about my future.  I read countless accounts about people who got liberal arts degrees and couldn't find a decent-paying career.  I thought about the thousands of dollars I was sinking into this fucking degree that I didn't really care about to begin with.  So I took another break.  102 out of 120 credits required to graduate, but I couldn't bring myself to do it.

Three more years of doing nothing.  Trying antidepressants occasionally.  Almost all of them do nothing or make things worse.  In 2019 I finally mustered the willpower to apply for a job.  I got a job at a grocery store where I work part-time to this day.  I don't like the job, but it's better than nothing.

Then, I got it in my head that I should finish my Anthropology BA.  18 credits left.  I reactivated my student status at the university.  Enrolled in 2 classes for the Winter term (7 credit hours).  I'm still indifferent towards this major, as well as every other major.  Now considering withdrawing again while I can still get a refund for the tuition.

I don't know what to do.  I still don't know what I want for a career.  I don't have the willpower/work ethic for a more intense bachelor's degree like engineering or computer science.  I've already sunk so much time and money into this liberal arts program.  Feels like I'm succumbing to the sunk cost fallacy.

My resume is a mess.  Years and years spent taking classes at a university with nothing to show for it, and unexplainable gaps galore due to mental health breaks.  Feels like no one would even bother hiring me besides retail places.  I don't know what I would do if my father wasn't around to support me.  Probably kill myself instead of succumb to homelessness.

My life's a goddamn mess and I don't know what to do or who to ask for help.  My dad is sympathetic, but he's dealing with his own mental health problems due to my mom passing away abruptly about 7 years ago.  Not to mention his problems just due to aging.

Do I withdraw from the semester and give up on this stupid liberal arts degree?  What else am I gonna do?  I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't know what I want to do.  I don't know what I should do.  I simply cannot envision a positive future for myself no matter what.",15Jan2020,1

Sorry for any grammatical mistakes non native 

Hi, i am a 18(m) from a middle eastern country.  And I am currently writing this from my locked bathroom

Sorry for long background 

I don’t know where to begin. My problem is from cousin let’s call him (ac) who is visiting from an another country, he is older and bigger than me, and is a guest at our house. He is a “charismatic” person from the perspective of other people like my family and others, but I see him as rude and ignorant, and at time he is just plain rude to me and others. When I would visit him in his country he would always boss me around shamelessly even tho I am his guest . If I didn’t do what he says he would just get angry. Then he would try to nitpick EVERY SINGLE THING I say to get angry about and get him self riled up, even lie about things in front of other people to get to that point of anger. 



To get In front of the replies that say just tell someone of authority or someone older. I tried to tell my mother(because ac is a cousin from my mothers side) 
And in our culture we can’t just kick him out. 

My dear mother is the only one who I wish would listen to me because I love her to bits and her me. But when I told her how ac usually is when we hang out together she just tells me to not talk about him like that . As if she was entranced by him. 

That broke my heart. 

For instance When I was a guest in his house and his country he always would invite me to dinners and restaurants and forcefully insist on paying the bill, then by the end of my visit in his country we had a small argument that resulted into him asking me where “his money”(200$) was . I was stunned by the question but relented hoping to avoid further conflict. But I saw it as mistake from my end due to being dumb and shoulda paid for my self. I was 16 at that age 

When he comes I’m always forced to hang out with him. And act like I am his chauffeur.

Today an incident happened That resulted in him getting angry at me, Because we were supposed to hang out with our other cousins. And when I was  Picking them up they decided to change The destination where we were going to meet at. Then he decided to get angry at me specifically for him going to the first place we were going to meet at. 

He acted distant all night to all my cousins. And they questioned him why he was distant but he just said there was nothing wrong and kept quiet the rest of the night and only talked to make fun of me or insult me. 

When we got home I sat at my desk and I felt this overwhelming sense of anger from him. Then he pushed the chair I sat in into the desk and pinned me. Then told me to continue what I was doing while he was looming over me. It only lasted a minute, but it felt like an eternity. I am not ashamed to admit that I was fucking Terrified that he would snap my neck or something. After he left the room I was shaking

I have to keep them on for 5 months long and i just made it to the first month and i’m thinking, my teeth weren’t reallllyy that bad. i’ve always received compliments on my smile and i never really had a problem with it before. i feel so stupid saying this but i saw my crush’s crush had them it made me want to try and straighten my teeth cause u know, hey why not ._. yeah so just to be clear i know i fucked up and i know i really did not give this much thought. after completing this month using it, it shifted my jaw. before using the aligners, i used to have a clicking sound when i opened my mouth on my right side due to having locked it for about a year and never saw the doctor or dentist or whoever. now when i open my mouth, it’s like the tinniest little click and so i feel like it’s gonna change the way i deepthroat. i completely know i sound even more dumb. i was in a five year relationship so you guys can figure it out. but that jaw lock did end up in my favor and i really feel like i should just put an end to this. i love my smile but i’m also way out the window for a refund or anything which is why i don’t know if i should just stop.",15Jan2020,1
426,"I've been dating him for a year and I've never loved or been comfortable with anyone more, but i feel like he's losing sexual or more interest in me.

For the last 2 months or so when ever we have s*x he starts talking about threesomes and makes me think about possible ideas even though he knows it turns me off and tell him to stop talking about it almost every time. We had one idea but they turned us down and that's okay but he still sees them as a possibility and keeps asking what it would be like and if i would still go through with it.
I'm protective and i don't want him sleeping with someone who will latch on and all of my friends would.

He's only ever slept with me so i understand him wanting to try these things but he really really wants to do this and I'm so scared that its my problem.
Should i talk to him about it?",15Jan2020,1

431,"Do you know Americans spend over 1 billion dollars a year on personal development? I think personal development information is some of the best information out there because it gives people multiple solutions for their everyday lives. Personal development, also known as personal growth, teaches people techniques that they can use in any situation. A personal growth plan is also important when it comes to self-study because any individual can tap into their human potential for improved results in all areas; spiritual, intellectual, social, and physical. I especially enjoy the scientific studies about percentages, scientific studies, statistics, and techniques that relate to those studies. My favorite book in personal development is “Think and Grow Rich,” by Napoleon Hill and if you read it, you will find a confidence formula and a persistence formula. The confidence and persistence formula are powerful formulas that work because they keep you focused on moving closer to your goals every day, no matter what else is going on in life. You could use these formulas to move with a confident persistence toward your goals and the universe will allow them to be manifested into your physical world at the perfect time. An important note do not put a time limit on your goals because if they are not reached when you think they should be reached you will probably give up on them. Do not do this because no human is that intelligent, only God knows the right time your goals are supposed to be manifested. Make a commitment to your better life, read, study, know this information, live it without ceasing, it’s a more freeing way to live, know that your goals will be completed in due time. For example, I recently have been faced with a few blocks, since I started studying this information in 2015, delays on some short-term goals, but I am pleased with my persistent progress for their completion. Today, I can honestly admit that it is easier to stay organized in my current affairs, with help from these developmental techniques, compared to past efforts. Self-discipline is a main personal development topic and when it comes to the subject of self-discipline people often struggle in the areas of faith and forgiveness. We must reconnect with our higher power, attend church regularly, study the bible, and make better choices every day, for an increase in the faith and forgiveness department! Did you know research indicates that self-discipline is more important than IQ, in predicting academic success. I believe it is more important than IQ because anyone can be intelligent with a high IQ, with enough study but it takes a special person to have the right attitude. Statistics show that most of the success in business is built around attitude. Yes, attitude is everything and since I started studying this information in depth, my self-discipline is better, along with a more positive attitude, continually studying this subject every day. It is very important to allow more positive information into your conscience mind from self-training sessions, if you want to get more positive results and reach future goals quicker. Shut off the flow of negative information from your mind and only allow positive information in! For example, I stopped watching and listening to the negative news, listening to negative music, watching R rated movies and I turned my vehicle into a mobile university, always listening to self-improvement CD’s and training audios, to reprogram my mind with the right information, advancing unconsciously toward my ultimate success! One great personal growth technique I like to use is; think of a positive response for every negative thought. Sounds easy but not as easy when practiced, this mental exercise will make you feel uncomfortable, mentally and physically tired in the beginning, if you are not doing it regularly, but the results are incredible. For example, in my past, I had a problem with having faith that my goals will not be reached, due to negative programming. I also struggled with forgiving others and myself for past mistakes that would probably cause some people to be crushed inside emotionally and give up on life. Now, through the information taught in these programs, I learned how to turn every negative thought into a positive one because I know the positive thoughts are the truth, to an incredibly magical future. Life is what you make it and the person who eventually wins is the one who thinks they can. To be honest there was a time when I gave up on my life, I did not think I could win and my productivity was zero. I did not want to do nothing, I did not care about nothing, and that is exactly what I got, nothing. That was around the time, I really had enough of me, I was sick and tired of feeling sick and tired. I think it is important for people to reach that low point in their life, understanding those miserable feelings, before they can start progressing forward. I knew there had to be a better way, I really started to open my mind, using my energy toward finding that better way. You see the personal develop information is not going to present itself to you on a silver platter, you really must be searching for it and want to find it, it’s like gold. The first time I found it was back in 2003, when I got involved with some network marketing stuff but not that serious about it, just kind of snooping around, getting to understand the basics with a company called Excel Communications where I was able to reach the rank of senior representative before it eventually went bankrupt. Then, I kind of got away from that type of business and continued working different jobs but always having that passion for the multi-level marketing, network marketing structure. The good news about these businesses is they all have some kind of personal development leadership training ingrained in them. The first personal develop book I was introduced to back during the Excel Communication days was, “Rich Dad Poor Dad,” by Robert Kiyosaki, which I of course push to the side, not reading it until years later, that is one of the reasons why I didn’t do as good in that business as I should have. It’s funny to me the way I did not want to have nothing to do with personal development or anything positive back then, my mind set was not in tuned and you have to have the right mind set in order to be successful. Well, to make a long story short and get to the point, after that I started with a company called Vemma a few years later, where I heard about Bob Proctor from one of the Vemma members doing a training. Bob Proctor is known as the master thinker and that is true because he introduced me to a whole new world of thinking, if you are going to study anyone, I recommend you study Bob Proctor. I connected the dots, my eyes were opened, I finally saw the light, and understood I found what I was looking for, I found the better way! They talk about this in the book, “Think and Grow Rich,” they say there is a secret all throughout the book but you must read it a few times before it jumps off the pages at you. Well, I knew that I found the secret, as soon as I heard that information and I started digging into the information, going all the way back to the roots of the personal development industry, all the back to the industrial age, the early 1900’s. Since that time, it has been like an obsession of mine, I can’t go one day without listening to or reading this material, it’s like a drug, I’m addicted to it, the more I read I find something else and want to read more, it’s like the never-ending subject. I suggest you start a self-growth plan as soon as possible, it will be the best decision you will make, it will make your mind clearer, help you know exactly what you want, you will know exactly how to get there, your confidence level will go up, you will feel like the energizer bunny, producing and creating great material, like its someone else in control, you will feel comfortable in all situations when you practice the techniques, you will know your purpose, and you will want to get work done. Our potential as humans is limitless, it’s just a matter of drawing it to the surface. To help you understand what I mean, today I have an insurance license, I am on all the popular social media sites, with my own WordPress and YouTube channel, operating 3 businesses simultaneously, with a list of goals to accomplish. If you would have told me I would be doing this before, when I was making zero progress, I would have thought you was a person with dementia or something. I was the most insecure, idiot, the good news is that was the past, I never want to go back to that place, most people don’t after they see the light. If you don’t believe me or what I am saying here, just google success stories about anybody, they are all pretty much the same, like mine and it could be yours too. God bless and I sincerely hope all your wishes and goals come true! World Peace!",15Jan2020,1
432,"SO, backstory. I work at a golf course, used to be shit, new ownership, the owner is the most involved passive person I’ve ever met. I’m blonde, have killer sales, I bartend, I cook, I do it all there. I really don’t get paid shit. My tips are my essence. Long story short we hired on a new older lady, after 4 who were crazy, she was semi normal &amp; I trained her. There is only 8 employees including me. My CC CHECKS were getting smaller and smaller but to be fair I generally ask for cash and it’s snowbird season. I realized something was up when numerous customers told me what a great manager I had and how well she built the place up. She’s only been on for 3 months maybe Regulars began telling me she was really trying to have me booted out. Ignoring better instincts I bit the bullet. The owner hates how direct I am I think I make him nervous, though he holds me to a higher standard, the other lady though fusses over him like a baby, I’m sorry I can’t. This man told me I’m not married because I don’t put bellpeppers in potato salad. NOW TO THE MAIN ISSUE I NEED ADVICE ( evil plan, secret fbi surveillance plan, WWJD plans) I WANT THEM ALL. 
I did not receive a credit card check this pay period. I knew I had tips. I asked for the tip fill out sheets for that period. THE CRAZY LADY CROSSED MY NAME OUT IN PEN PUT HERS CLAIMED THE TIPS AND THE OWNER GAVE IT TO HER. I PROMPTLY went and tried to calmly communicate with the owner about these discoveries, I mean really I want my money dude. He barely let me say anything, just gave the usual face of dismay when being up anything remotely important and said we will discuss it another time. He’s avoided me since she’s not fired and 245$ has gone missing on her drawer??? Like are they screwing? But this is CLASSIC for him. Another employee was caught on camera stealing beers from cooler. This is after I’ve been yelled at for not knowing how to count and told that was why the numbers were off for 2 months. NO ACTION TAKEN. No Christmas card, no bonus, nothing. This crazy lady employee has a long list of Aliases, which I discovered with a little digging. WHAT DO I DO.

The apartment is on a cul de sac, residential road. Of course there are still people driving around, and one street down is a somewhat busy one.

437,"Hello, folk. Please, talk to me, I would be happy for any word right now.

I have been a good student (3.6 out of 4.00) through my life, until I started my Master's program in Germany (as an international student). I studied for long 4 years instead of 2, passed all exams (most of the grades weren't good), but failed my thesis.
I still have a chance to write second thesis, but it seems like I have to write it in 2.5 months at most. Now I don't know if I should try to write it or not.
I am afraid that an incomplete degree will scar my CV for the rest of the life: it is a failure after all. On the other hand, I don't know if I will be able to write the second thesis: I failed my first one due to some mental block in my head and my procrastination problems in general. I would come to the library and do anything but the thesis. It felt as if I was rock climbing, and got afraid of height and I was just frozen and not doing anything. I tried reading books on procrastination, I went to a coach for almost a year, and I went to psychologist for 2 years. Nothing helped. I don't see a reason, how it would change for the second thesis. 
Right now I am working part-time on a job in my field. I could ask my boss if I can stay there without my Master's degree or not. I don't think my chances at other companies with a failed Master's are good. My career is extremely important to me. I really like intellectual work, and I certainly want to have a decent life quality. On the hand, if I don't get a job, I won't have my residence permit any more, and I will have to go back to my mother's place, and it is not an emotionally beneficial place to be for me.
I also have a boyfriend, but I don't want to depend on him for the rest of the life, this is just my thing. I really want my career.

Thank you for reading until here. Have a good day.

So, my question are mostly the consequences of a failed thesis. I still haven't thrown away the idea of the second thesis, thought.

Basically, I (18M) have this little voice in the back of my head, which I’ve heard isn’t that uncommon, that always brings me down when I try to do things.

For example, I always try to trust people. But when things go wrong, that little voice in the back of my head makes me think it’s all my fault, and makes me feel incredibly guilty, and as an effect worthless and a nuisance to others. 

Another way is that sometimes I want to reach out about my problems, but it always makes me think that I’d just be bothering people, or that they would shun me (or in the case of my father and brother make fun of me). I’m embarrassed that I’m having the problems that I have because of it.

442,"So me and my partner have been dating for around 6 years now. We started dating when we were in our late teens. He had a high school girlfriend and they dated for about a year, two years before we got together. So to me, as much as I respect that he has an ex, it’s no biggie because it was a short term high school relationship. There was no ongoing friendship after the breakup. 

So to get to the point I will have to explain some background. There is about 5 years between my partner and his older sister. She has always taken a liking to his ex and I felt like I was never really given a chance.. I have no idea why (although I know for sure that the rest of his family really like me). For example when I first met her, she was visiting from interstate and was staying at my partners parents house. I happened to have stayed over. My first meeting with her was in the morning and she was still smashed from a night out. On the same morning my partner and I walked across the park to the shops and there she was sitting on the swings with his ex girlfriend. By this time they hadn’t dated for like 3 years so I thought it was strange. I’m not sure if she was still wasted by this point...surely sobering up but she had the audacity to shout out “Hi *my name* from across the park. My partner was furious and told her how disrespectful she was being towards me when we met her back at home. Since then I’ve just never felt like I’m good enough in her books to be with her brother. She has never really made me feel comfortable and she clearly still has a relationship with his ex, which in a way makes me feel slightly annoyed and threatened (even though I try not to feel like this it is natural). She has never openly been rude to me but I can just tell by her attitude that she has never accepted me. It’s so awkward at events. How do I overcome this feeling of unacceptance? I have tried going out of my way for her on a few occasions but I don’t want to do that anymore because I just feel like she doesn’t deserve it.",15Jan2020,1
443,"RANT (cut to end if you don't want context) :

I have online friends, we all live near each other, we met for the first time 2 weeks ago.

Around the end of 2019, one of my online friends (We'll call him Daniel) who I wasn't really that close to (he was best friend with my other  friends) started sending me really creepy messages, like asking me for pictures of myself or what I was wearing etc. I told some of my friends but we just thought past it. 

A couple of days later, Daniel posted an embarrassing conversation that I had had with somebody on a group chat involving me, my friends and my online friends (there were around 50 of us), and when I confronted him, he acted like nothing had happened. I told his best friend (Who we'll call Bob) about this and Bob told him to stop texting me (I don't know what he said, but it really scared Daniel). 

Now that Daniel had stopped texting me, I thought this was all over. It wasn't. I then found out that Daniel was telling my boyfriend that his friends like me as more than a friend, which they don't. Daniel then proceeded to try to convince my boyfriend that I like one of my online friends, which I don't.

Now at this point, I had blocked Daniel, and he had blocked me too, but I couldn't let this go on any longer. I got my boyfriend to put me in a group chat with Daniel so that I could talk to him, and I basically told him that what he was doing was cruel and that he should really back off.

After I sent this he said ""At least that dare is done"".

Now of course I was confused and angry. Who would dare somebody to do this? I spent the next few days struggling to think of who it could be, only to fail. 

Around a week later, Daniel texts me saying that he has proof of who dared him, and I don't believe him- why should I?

He then sends me a screenshot of a text conversation with one of my closest online friends (Call him Zane) who was best friends with Bob.

The screenshot showed that Zane dared Bob to do inappropriate/rude things to basically ruin my social life, and I'm raging with anger. This entire time, I've turned to Zane for help and it turns out that he was the person who did this?!

446,"My spouse recently got out of the navy and decided he wanted to go back to school and get a degree in something else while working a part or maybe a fulltime job, as he doesn't like what he did in the Navy. Then he got  a job offer for a job that would pay 80k+ a year, plus other perks (like a company car, paid vacation, dental/health/vision for both of us etc). He decided he'd just do that because the money was too good to pass up, so he dropped out of school. He was nervous about the interview but he nailed the first one and they wanted to fly him to HQ in another state for the next interview.  


3 days before the second interview he called them and told them he didn't want the job. He decided instead that he would just get a slightly above minimum wage job working with troubled kids (something he has no experience in, he doesn't even like kids) he will make slightly more than what I make (I make $12/hr, he'll be making $13-$14/hr)  between our two incomes, we'll be able to scrape by and might be able to pay off a small amount of our substantial CC debt.  


We had been planning to buy a house and pay off our debt relatively quickly with the 80k/yr job. Now we're considering moving back into a studio apt to save money. I'm also picking up a second full time job, which will essentially elliminate any free time I have. (Job one 30ish hrs a week 10pm-6am, job two 40 hrs 1pm-9pm)

I wanted to be honest because I could trust her and so I told her, and she just out of nowhere changed, like her persona changed and she told me stuff like “let’s just be friends”, “idk I’m gonna be an actress / model and I can’t be talking to someone that did that”, “please just leave me alone” then again she would say “let’s just be friends” not that had me hurt bad because I’ve told some people I trust and they were cool with it.

Later on after a lot of talking she would be strange and started saying stuff like “let’s just be friends and if it’s the right decision or we are made for each other then the path will guide us 😉” and with all these winky faces too and honestly I just freaked out after she said all that.

I (18F) have a crush on a guy from my Spanish lectures (18M). We travel by train together weekly and chat a bit about school and other random stuff now and then.

So we have a vacation coming up next week, which lasts 3 weeks. I don't have anything to do during that 3 week period and given that our hometowns are only a 30-minute drive away from each other, it's not even that crazy of an idea to do something together during that 3 week period.

I just wanna know why this is happening. I started doing coke last year late February/early March? Almost a year now. At first it was just every other day or a few times a week but after a couple months it progressed into a daily habit. I’ve now been doing it every single day for about 9 to 10 months, besides a few days here and there in between and it was only because I either didn’t have the money or dude was out. I hadn’t even thought about this much if at all up until today when I heard someone bring up the numb feeling it gives you. We all know coke is known for its numbing effects. But now looking back I remember when I first started, it numbed my nostrils, my entire sinus cavity, my throat, my mouth, everything. And due to this numbness I felt like I wasn’t even breathing, even though I knew I was, but my nose was so numb it didn’t feel like it. Also because of the back of my throat being so numb I would constantly gag because I guess it numbed my gag reflexes. I don’t wanna make this too long so I’ll just keep it at that but that lasted for awhile and slowly subsided after about 4-5 months until eventually maybe 6-7 months it just stopped all together. Now I get absolutely no numbness whatsoever. No matter how big of a line I do, nothing. Not in my nose, not in my throat, not in my mouth even if I rub some on my gums it just doesn’t happen. And I know it’s not a different cut because I’ve been going to only one person this entire time and even if the batch is different this happens no matter what batch. And even if I go a week without and do some, it still doesn’t give any numbness. I’d imagine even if I went a month possibly a few months, it would still not get numb. I’m just wondering why this is. I know I’ve built a tolerance to the drug but I’d imagine that the numbing effect has no correlation to tolerance? Anybody ever experience this, or can explain why this happens?",15Jan2020,1
453,"My 26 year old ex (let’s call her Charlotte) was molested by her brothers and cousin for 14 years, from ages 3 to 17. One of her brothers lives in another state, as well as her cousin, but her other brother lives about 5 minutes from her house. That brother starting molesting Charlotte first, when she was 3 and he was 18. They see each other almost every day. How she can do that after all he put her through I will never understand. He’s married and has a stepchild and biological child, ages 5 and 10. He and his wife smoke weed and do drugs around their children, which is a whole different problem. The entire family knows that and has done nothing about it. Charlotte and her brother’s parents know Charlotte was molested, but they don’t believe her and call her crazy and problematic. They’re just in denial, which is so incredibly messed up. Anyways, while Charlotte and I were dating, her niece (his biological daughter, let’s call her Grace) had lots of problems. In case you don’t know, there are several signs of possible child abuse - stealing, sexual activity, acting out, etc. So Grace has shown all of those signs, among others. She’s stolen from stores, money out of people’s wallets, various items from her family, and was found showing her privates to another child at daycare and they were touching each other’s privates. Of course those actions could be totally benign, but knowing her father molested his sister for several years is a big warning sign. Anyways, I wanted to tell someone about this, whether it was someone in their family or child services, because if God forbid Grace was being molested I wanted to save her. But Charlotte begged me not to because she said she couldn’t go through that. I found that to be incredibly selfish, but I didn’t want to rock the boat because she was already really abusive to me. So I just dealt with the guilt for a few months. Then i broke up with her and I finally called child services. I couldn’t live with myself knowing that Grace might be being molested. They got all the information they needed, and I don’t know exactly what they did about it but one day Charlotte asked me if I’d reported him so I know something happened. I denied it because I was genuinely afraid I’d get hurt or something if they knew it was me. Her family is really messed up, they’re the most prejudiced, judgmental and cruel people I’ve ever met. They have like 10 guns and I was afraid they’d track me down or something. That might sound paranoid, but trust me when I say that would not be out of character for them. Anyways, Charlotte told me her family was falling apart and would never be the same, and I said I was sorry, but I mean I did what I had to do. If there’s even the smallest chance this child is being abused, especially by her FATHER, I had to do something about it. Was I in the wrong?",15Jan2020,1

460,"Well i dunno if this is supposed to be in this part of reddit as i'm still new but i'm looking for some kind of advice or atleast some form of reassurance that what i'm experiencing is normal. My daughter is 3 years old coming on to 4 very soon and she's a normal happy child, very well behaved and very very clever for her age. (I know most people say this about there kids but she actually is trust me).   


Lately she's been coming out with rather disturbing creepy things and by that i mean almost downright weird and messed up,normally followed by laughter. i just see it as childlike innocence and that she doesn't understand it's wrong so i just tell her it's not funny and that those things aren't nice, my girlfriend however finds them massively unsettling and believes i should take her to someone to find out if there's a deeper reason for this behaviour. Not saying i'm raising a future serial killer but wonder if there's some mental health at play (if possible at her age).  


Here's a list of some of the things she says and does:  


When getting the local bus to take her to nursery and going under a train bridge ""That's a bridge for the train isn't it? The trains going to crash and fall into the water and all the boys and girls are going to die"" Followed by laughter.  


Randomly just out of the blue ""I want to play with the dogs, can we play with fire""   


When waking up in the middle of the night ""My mummy said there's monsters under the bed, They're my friends""  


She also obviously has baby dolls and stuff like most girls for her age and she likes to play a game where she basically beats the sh\*t out of them, smashing there heads into the table, throwing them across the room and so on.  


There's other things too that are often fairly weird/unusual but i'm just wondering if this is normal for a child of her age with an active imagination or something i should be worried about and look into further.  


Also might be worth adding that although me and her biological mother have split up and have done since she was just a baby, she has two very loving homes, spoilt rotten and a big family that love her.",15Jan2020,1
461,"If anyone has time, I would really appreciate someone reads this &amp; judging by what I have wrote can diagnose me with what they possibly think I have.

The emotions I can mainly feel are anger, rage, fear &amp; anxiety.

feeling fear makes me angry &amp; depressed because I don’t feel powerful.

I want to feel powerful &amp; in control.

If someone is to disobey me I would react in a angry way

I don’t feel guilt if I were to do something wrong, I simply do not care. The only emotion I would feel is fear because what if I get caught &amp; then I would feel shame.

I literally don’t care about anyone, I only care &amp; feel empathy for my mother and brother. She has raised me &amp; I grew up with my brother so I am only able to feel love, care, empathy, guilt, for them

I desire a lot of attention. When someone doesn’t look at me I get depressed, when someone in public doesn't recognize me I feel depressed. I want attention. If I get no attention I become depressed &amp; if I get attention I’m happy &amp; my self esteem is great.

I feel like I’m very good looking &amp; that every girl finds me attractive. I believe I am a 9/10.

I wouldn’t have a problem raping, killing, hurting someone as long as I don’t get caught.

anxiety is a problem for me and I hate feeling it. I usually feel it physically but in my head I am not really worried or thinking of anything negative. I just feel it physically and it sucks.

i have beaten up others before (punched, kicked put in severe condition) for fun because it makes me feel good.

my father left me when I was little &amp; I don’t care. People are suppose to feel sad but i simply don’t care.

i would not care if something bad were to happen anyone besides my Mom &amp; bro

i really really care how others perceive me. Sometimes I just want to give up the act, kindness &amp; treat everyone rude &amp; hurt others physically.

I have low self esteem, I don’t believe in myself, I don’t know who I am, I have self doubts, I am insecure, I am very self conscious.

i am unsatisfied with my personality so I emulate move characters I idolize. I wear clothes they wear, talk like they do, act like they do &amp; I obsess over them &amp; become them.

466,"  

Sorry for the long post – TL;DR at the end.

For those of you who don’t know – misophonia is a disorder where certain sounds can trigger severe responses like rage, distress, and/or fight-or-flight. 

Almost two years ago, I moved into my first apartment. I thought nothing of the transition because I was blessed with quiet neighbors. However, in the early fall of last year, my two quiet neighbors were replaced by two noisy neighbors. My next-door neighbor has three dogs that bark, on and off, all the time. The walls are already thin, but they bark right by her front door, so the noise leaks even more. It is agonizing knowing that there’s nothing I can do about it half the time when it's during the day and nobody's home. These dogs bark every time someone closes a door, every time I flush my toilet, every time they hear any voice from anywhere. They may bark for 20 minutes, then quiet down for 20, then bark 20 more, on and off for 16+ hours at a time sometimes. I’ve left her notes and confronted her face-to-face about a month back. When I confronted her, she said, “I think they only do it when I’m not there” (as if that makes it OK), but then immediately contradicted herself. I mentioned that they were barking well past midnight last night. She asked, “Are you sure it was last night? Because I was home.” I told her that yes, I was sure, I even had it recorded. When I told her she needs to do something about it, she said (very snottily, I might add) “OK, got it.” Then, she passed me on the stairs and slammed her door as hard as she could like a bratty 12-year-old. She really showed me.

The neighbor below me isn’t as bad, but maybe once a week will play pulsing music until as late as 3AM. Other times, they crank up the music for their morning 6AM shower. Again, the walls and floors are thin, and they’re playing it so loud that I can make out the lyrics. This one is a fan of Lana Del Rey and Drake. I've tried turning up my TV as loud as it will go, just to drown out the dogs and the music for a little while, but a fully-cranked TV obviously isn't any better, so I stopped.

Two days ago on Monday, I finally went to management for the first time. I’m non-confrontational and I hate making waves, so I kept putting it off. Once the trigger noises were gone, my resolve melted almost immediately. But these episodes of trigger noises are now so often, have so little time in between, and are coming from all angles. I’m embarrassed to say that my voice was shaking the whole time I explained the situation to management. They said they would call my neighbors and to come back in a week if it persists. They know that I have recordings and logs of all these noises if my neighbors dispute it. However, it is now 1:15AM Wednesday morning and my next-door neighbor and her boyfriend have been playing loud music, stomping their feet to the beat, and scream-singing since 9PM. This isn't the first time either. How their neighbor below them hasn’t complained is beyond me. The barely-muffled beats are bad enough. I banged on our adjoining wall for the first time tonight, so hard that my hand still hurts. They didn’t take the hint. I cracked a bit, and I worry that these little explosions are going to become more frequent and more intense. My passive aggressive is gradually shifting to aggressive. I just can’t believe how inconsiderate they are. I called the police on them for the first time tonight too, but the police didn't show up. I understand that noise complaints are of the lowest priority. I’m just hoping they keep some sort of log, even if they don’t stop by. I have a feeling I’ll be calling more often. I have to say I’m disappointed though – I was hoping a visit from the police would be a wake-up call for them.

It may sound like a “Well, that’s just apartment living for you” scenario, but it’s been about four or five months of constant distress because of this disorder. They don’t make accommodations for these types of things. I don't want to be coddled, but am I wrong in thinking that all this noise at all these hours is unreasonable? If there isn’t a trigger noise already happening, then I’m just waiting for there to inevitably be one, usually within the next hour. It seems like my only guaranteed quiet hours are maybe 4AM to 6AM. I’m not spared on weekdays. I can’t vent to anyone I know. My boyfriend and my parents are aware of the situation, but because they don’t have misophonia, they don’t understand the depth of the distress. I’ve been spending a lot of time in my car, crying it out or just passing some time. My ears are killing me because I’ve been wearing earplugs or headphones several hours a day for the last several months. Usually, I can still hear it through them. I can’t afford the fancy noise-cancelling ones, but I’m saving up (suggestions for which headphones are appreciated). However, I’m on-call overnight at least once a week and need to be able to hear my phone anyway. This night is one of them. 

It’s almost enough to make me want to move back in with my parents. Almost. Does anyone have any other suggestions? My lease isn’t up for another four months, but I worry this will be an issue anywhere I go. Fuck me, I guess.

TL;DR – I struggle with a disorder that makes me super sensitive to certain sounds. My new apartment neighbors have been making these sounds in abundance at all hours of the day and night. They haven’t responded to any efforts to get them to quiet down. I can’t ever escape these sounds in my own home, and I’m stuck here for another four months at least. What do I do?",15Jan2020,1
467,"I got fired today from a job. I’ve worked for a week and a half at the place. At first, I thought it was reasonable, since I wasn’t really doing a good job and wasn’t meeting deadlines. But when discussing with relatives, they say that it is equally the fault of my supervisor and the workplace. I really need some input to see whether I should be beating myself up over it or what I should take away from it. During the period of time, I made five mistakes (that I know which contributed to the final decision).

1. On the first day, I was ordered to create a file for evidence and correspondence for two people. I was ordered to follow an already made chronology document to get the order right, as they wanted me to do it chronologically. So, I searched up the names and compiled the documents. However, what I didn’t realise was that they wanted me to print out all the documents in the folder, as they were all related two these two individuals (one of them was the client). I think it was my mistake for not clarifying properly before starting the task. Because of this I wasn’t able to complete the task by the second day, which was the deadline.
2. Another problem I had with the aforementioned task was when I was ordering it chronologically. I was ordered to follow the chronology document which had dates for documents. I did so and ordered it accordingly. However, some had the date of receipt of the document instead of date it was created (these could differ drastically). I ordered it based on dates on chronology. I did end up asking about this at the very end, and found out to order them on the creation date. But, by then I wasn’t able to properly do it as I was following the chronology and I was already past the deadline.
3. I wasn’t able to meet a deadline for a task which was scheduled to be completed an hour after the email was sent. It was a simple formatting task where I was instructed to number paragraphs. I encountered troubles logging in, as I didn’t have the password, but after that I started the task. I finished it off and asked my supervisor to check. The supervisor instructed me to change numerous things like justifying the text, moving things around as they had been moved when converting the files, making small changes to spacing as some paragraphs were spaced a bit more or less after the conversion. I wasn’t able to implement these changes on time and was thus not able to meet the deadline. The boss said that they completed it in less than 5 minutes. I am a bit sceptical that these minute details were needed or that it required this level of detail, as I don’t think these changes could have been completed in that time frame. The supervisor was CCed so they knew about the deadline and they would have known if these were needed.
4. When ordering chronologically, I used the date on the front of the email or report after being reprimanded for the chronology document. However, for some emails, they wanted me to order it by the date the emails were initially sent instead of by the date on the front, as they were just forwarded these emails. So, the important date was the date which the initial correspondence between parties was sent.
5. I remember one more mistake. I was ordered to make a “spine“ for the file afterwards following a powerpoint sent to me by email. I took this very literally and just made a simple folder spine label for evidence and correspondence, as the powerpoint didn’t mention anything about a spine. But what they meant is that they wanted the document to have a piece of paper with the appropriate title (following the guide) glued onto the spine of the folder. I redid it, but was reprimanded as the paper was sticky taped on and some of it was going over the side. After another attempt, it was done properly. I think it was my fault, as I found examples elsewhere, but it was an easy fix in the end.

These were the mistakes I made during the past week and a half. Were these mistakes reasonable? I need some feedback from an external party, as I’ve been feeling mixed. On one hand I feel like I could have been more competent, but on another hand, I felt like I wasn’t taught well. This was in a legal role, for people still studying at university.

476,"Hi everyone.

I'm currently desperate for an internship, but at the same time, I don't want to apply for positions I don't like. A little bit of background, I'm currently a communication student. I need to do an internship in order to do my thesis. I'm currently having a massive burn-out with my study, and I don't want my internship to add to my problems. GPA-wise, I'm doing very fine. My grades are wonderful, I even got a 9/10 for my last exam. However, when it comes to internship, it's just a complete mess.

I've been constantly applying since November. The official start date of the internship should be February 10th according to my university. So far, I really avoid HR internships because I'm not exactly a people person. I prefer working things on my own, even though I can work with other people. Mainly, I apply for marketing and copywriting internships. 

Yesterday, a recruitment agency called me. I applied by emailing an associate there. The associate posted on LinkedIn saying that the company was looking for an intern. Since there were no positions mentioned, and the post was shared to me by a friend, I emailed the associate. I also mentioned in the email that I'm interested in marketing. 

I talked to the caller, and he explained what the internship position entailed. It was a working-placement (meewerkstage). The available position is in the financial department, and my daily job would be to call candidates and also interview them (with guidance, of course). I wasn't interested, but the caller invited me to the office anyway. I agreed to it, because why not. 

That recruitment agency was the first one to call me since i started applying for internship. Tbh, I don't want to take it. But my deadline is soon approaching, and no other internship has called me for interview. I want to decline the offer, but at the same time, i am so scared of not getting an internship. The thing is, if i don't have an internship, I cannot do my thesis. i might graduate late, which i cannot afford  financially. 

So, I'm asking for advice on how do I deal with this? I really appreciate the call, and I'm going to visit the company to discuss with the caller about the internship. But i think i'm going to decline the offer. However, no other companies had called me and I'm so scared of not getting an internship on time.",15Jan2020,1

479,"Hello Reddit,

I have been really struggling with my mental health game over the past year and it is tearing my wife (26) and I (24) apart. The worst thing is that I don't even think she notices, which I think is probably for the best. I am not saying that she doesn't know that this is a big issue/problem, she definitely knows. But I think have shut down to her and am beginning to resent her. Not being able to talk about my future dreams with her because we aren't on the same page is killing me. I have no one to talk about those things with (one who can help accomplish my goals, ie family).

Anyway, when we were dating my wife was on and off about having kids. I have wanted kids my whole life, she knew/knows that. Before we got married she said she wanted to have kids. We talked about baby names and rules and discipline etc., and so we got engaged and married a year later ( 2017). Shortly after we got married, she changed her mind to a maybe.

My wife's parents got divorced a year ago (2019) and her desire to not have kids is stronger than I've ever seen it. She is confident she doesn't want kids.

We saw a counselor because we were struggling to deal with this; he said to wait until some of the ""craziness"" (with her family) has gone down and talk about it again. Well, periodically I bring up kids just to see where she is standing, and it hasn't been ""I'm still thinking about it"". It's been ""I still don't want kids "". It's been 6 months since we have seen the counselor. 

We are both christian (any biblical advice would be great) and know divorce should be out of the question, so what other advice is there...

486,"Hey. I'm just gonna get straight into it - my husband James was raised by his father since his mother walked out on them when he was just 4 years old. At the time, his dad and his mother's grandparents went to court to see who would get custody - his dad won and that was the last time anyone seen or heard from anyone on the mother's side. 

Side note: According to James' dad, she (his mum) had another son shortly after James, who she also abandoned with the father. We have no idea who he is or where he is, so a major reason why James tracked his mum down is to find out more about his half brother.

Fast forward 24 years, my husband is now 28 and wants answers. We found his mum on Facebook. We messaged her, she blocked us from adding her as a friend. From her Facebook, we gather that she is engaged now and getting married in March, she has two more sons who she kept (surprise) and they look happy which is good and she has lots of other family members on Facebook too. So, James messaged a few of them and all messages have been ignored.

There's not much to do at this point, is there? I mean, it would be great if she would just let him know about his other half brother (although now he apparently has 3) and she just doesn't want anything to do with him. I doubt she's told her fiancé about her child abandoning past, but who knows. Is there anything we can do? Any advice is appreciated.

Of course, we understand that she'll probably never reply and we'll just have to accept that. It just sucks seeing James so frustrated, he deserves answers at least.",15Jan2020,1

488,"Yes it’s selfish. I don’t know if it’s in humane, but let me give you some back story. 

4 years ago I woke at all hours of the night to a blood curdling scream. This happened a lot over 3 days. Every time she goes into her “episodes” we can anticipate anywhere from 10-25 seizures maybe more spread over at most a 3 day period. Vet gave us medications that slowly progressed from 1 pill twice a day to 5-6 pills in the morning and evening and another 8 over the day. We can guess that her episodes come every 3-6 weeks. 

The meds did a lot... until we ran out. Yes it’s entirely myself and my family’s fault for not having the meds stocked. 

I hate to think that I have to put down my sweetheart, but I’m writing this on the second day of cleaning piss, shit, and saliva from around the house. I love my dog, but I hate doing this every month or so. And before anyone jumps and says “Well maybe you shouldn’t have gotten a dog.” Well maybe you’re right. But we didn’t know she was epileptic until she was 3. She’s 7 now. At this point I can see her even when not having her episodes. She’s exhausted. I don’t know how good her quality of life is now vs another 3 years of this.

I spent around 3 hrs both way home- work. Which has been really tiring. 


Then I finish work around 16.30, I noticed there isn’t any bus going after 16. Unless you order it via the app, otherwise the bus won’t go. The order has to be made 2 hours before the departure. Either I went home early, or I walked to the bus stop. 

I will be working there for 6 months. I don’t have much experience of driving, not having a car. All of the colleagues live in opposite direction, so not possible to ask them for a ride. 

I have walked before to see how far it is. It literally took me 30mins walk in the mud and grass via short cut.

He's playing music all day and most of the night, the music is insanely loud some sort of rave techno crap. The bass is so loud. I've been trying to get him to turn it down, first few days I would just use an umbrella to knock on the ceiling to signal him to turn it down,no results. Then for a few days in a row it would happen as late as half one in the morning I'd run up and rang his doorbell, he'd just ignored us. Called the landlord and he intervened and the end result is that he wouldn't be as loud from the hours of 10 pm to 9am. It lasted for a few days and then back to the old routine. 
He's getting really cocky about it now,every time I'd knock on the ceiling to signal him to turn it down he'd just amp the volume even louder.

502,"I know you could say, “because you let them”, but it never seems like they’re using me at first. They all come off as genuinely nice people and interested in me. But then in the end they dump me because they’re not in a position to be with me, either because of their life circumstances or they already have a girlfriend or whatnot. 

I don’t know why I attract such men. I would say I am and come across as a strong and opinionated person. So I know it’s not a weakness of personality (although I do admit I’ve feigned or genuinely acted a young, silly girl sometimes. But perhaps that is because I am a young girl). 

I’ve also been told I’m beautiful by many men and women throughout my life; I don’t know if this is why I always seem to attract strange or mentally unstable men. To be honest, I don’t even know if it’s truly the case that these men were users or not, or if I’m just sad because of how things ended. But it’s happened too many times now to be a coincidence...I think there’s an epidemic amongst men where they can’t express their emotions, or they don’t get enough validation/attention, so they find women to fill that role. 

I’ve had two of the guys that have used or mistreated me, apologise for their action. One hasn’t apologised at all however, and it’s driving me absolutely crazy. He hasn’t given an explanation as to why he led one me on, or even a “sorry, I’m not interested, leave me alone”. So I’m perpetually left in the dark. I guess it’s I fee  on this way because of how strongly I felt for him. I really liked him the most, out of any man I’ve ever met. I just don’t know if he led me on and emotionally cheated with me (and another girl) on his girlfriend because he was in a new city and lonely. Is that a legitimate excuse? Is it the real reason? I guess I’ll never know. It sure does help writing everything out, though.

505,"tl:dr - do you think a confrontation/heart-to-heart talk is necessary for all situations? 

i have been having problems with a workmate due to various small incidents over the past months that has slowly built up my dislike for her (let's call her Cathy). i would say i am a relatively easy-going person all these years and even if i don't get along with someone 100% i wouldn't show it and just let it slide and work perfectly fine but this is the first time where i can't even face her or talk to her normally anymore. 

initially i thought i was the only person in the group who isn't getting along with Cathy, but i have realised that half of the group also experienced similar problems/issues with her as well (after some discussion, unfortunately, which i do realise and admit is not the best or nicest thing to do :/). however, recently she has been impacting me quite a bit (I have anxiety + depression) and i don't know how to live on/work with her for the next few months. 

Cathy and I were once pretty good friends outside of an academic setting. as time went by, more issues arose during academic setting and we naturally distanced due to our differences in views and the way of doing things. Cathy, too, is not in the best place mentally (has depression), and I was told by a groupmate today that her condition was getting more severe as she was upping her doses. 

obviously, as someone who is going through mental illnesses as well, i can understand that she is going through a lot and is having a hard time balancing everything. however, at the same time, her actions are affecting me. even if we're not close anymore, i do hate to see/hear that she's going through a rough time, and i started to wonder if part of the reason for her worsening condition could be because of me (and the other people who dislike her as well).

a friend suggested that i should confront her, not in the way of ""blaming"" or listing out her faults obviously, but just have a talk with her...and so i just wanted to see if anyone has any advice on how i should move forward with the situation. should i have a talk with her, and if so, what/how should i phrase things so that i don't worsen the situation (i have no idea if she's suicidal and that is probably the thing that's holding me back from communicating with her at the moment), or alternatively, should i just try and chill out and let things slide and move on with life...

512,"Hi everyone. I would like to ask if I shouldn't be mad at what this person Han did. This is because he told me he did nothing wrong. I feel like he is gas lighting me and the seriousness of what he did, mainly because he targeted my emotions rather than physically hurting me. 

I met Han in university. from the first time i met him, he suddenly started turning up everywhere i was when i was in uni. This didn't happen before I met him. I thought at first it was a coincidence so I ignored it. Then he started turning up in places like near where I catch the bus far away from uni. So I kind of got the hint that he liked me and was following me around. Bare in mind, never once did he try to talk to me that was why I thought it was all coincidental. And I was like, ok this person likes me so I started liking him back. 

After sometime I mastered the courage and messaged him on FB something like 'Han, I keep seeing you everywhere.' He read the message but never messaged back. Suddenly a week later his private FB profile, he put a FB public photo album of him and his new girlfriend Stephanie. And he put all their photos of them dining out and her driving his car and saying stuff like ""even our initials match my angel"". Never did Han message me back. So i took his actions as an act of brutal rejection, and I felt bad about it for awhile. But I got over it and met a new guy who was pretty cool and we are friends until this day. 

So I thought it was over. But then a year later, Han tracked down my yaoi on fanfiction (he tracked down my google account with my name). And he started reviewing my fanfic story and he really didn't like the story. Chapter after chapter he was voicing his opinion on how ""nefarious"" and manipulative the characters were. At this point I guess even though I still felt bitter about his brutal rejection of me, a very tiny part of me still liked him. So I changed my yaoi so that the characters weren't so ""manipulative"". But then out of nowhere he started saying stuff like ""kill yourself"" or ""fat virgin"". And it just seemed so mean and disrespectful.

So I stalked his FB to see what his deal was - and he posted on his private FB page, a public a photo of him and a girl Nameun together. He had moved and made sure to make it public that he moved on my birthday (he knows my birthday because it was public on my FB).

So I googled Han and wrote on his public blog he writes articles on about random topics. I asked why he was writing stuff online on my yaoi. Then I messaged him again on FB. And he said, don't post on my blog, my girlfriend doesnt like that.

Anyway long story short, later after I angrily harrassed him online and called him some nasty stuff (I couldn't help it), he said that he had wanted us to be together. But he said that he didn't think I should be upset by the stuff he did because it wasn't a big deal and he wanted us to be together. Nameun and Stephanie were his fake girlfriends even though Stephanie really liked him. He basically used Stephanie to be his girlfriend then dumped her after a few months. Apparently he was mad at me because I wasn't doing anything for us to get together.

Obviously, I had lost any attraction to him at this point. He didn't seem like a likeable person anymore. Also, because he was trying to make me jealous with Stephanie and Nameun in the past. Like he wanted me to prove to him that I liked him, even though he had a girlfriend. Which I find kind of sickening.

But I was just angry (and I'm still angry now) that he said he did nothing wrong and that I shouldn't be so upset and there should be an us (i.e. for us to be together). I feel like this person is slightly sociopathic. I would like to have someone's perspective as to whether he is not and what he did wasn't bad even though he intentionally provoked jealousy.",15Jan2020,1

514,"Hey /r/advice!

As this involves some personal and sensitive information, I'm using a throwaway account and I'll also be as vague as possible, keeping the needed information in as this is crucial to good advice.

So, here goes:

I am a developer. Following a burn-out at my previous company (company A), I decided to look for new employment but in the same field. I got some offers from different companies and at the end of 2019 I changed jobs to one of these companies (company B). After changing jobs I noticed some huge differences between my last job and my current job. The colleagues are a lot less talkative and social. There isn't much of funny conversation between colleagues and so on. The job in itself also feels a bit like a step in the wrong direction. At my previous company I was responsible for building an in-house system, helping colleagues, etc. Basically there I was a lead developer, here I'm just 'one of the developers'. I just cannot find myself in the systems that are in place here, making it very hard for me to get motivated when working in these systems..

Also, after being tackled by a burn-out some time ago, I find it very important to feel at home at work. Which is also something I don't really feel here.

Now, when I started working here my superior came with the idea of contacting company A as they were phasing out support for the technology I work with, asking to migrate some projects from A to B. I told him this could be a potential source of revenue, so that's what he did.

Now, a couple of days ago I got a new offer from one of the companies I previously talked to, which is pretty interesting. It's better money, the projects seem more fun and more satisfying and it's only a 5 min drive from my house. This has left me in a very awkward situation, as company B has just met with company A and they have agreed to migrate projects from A to B, as A currently doesn't have the time or manpower to support these 'legacy' projects. But now I feel like a jack-ass because company B relies on me and my experience with A's projects to work these 'legacy' projects.

So, I'm coming here for advice: what would you do? If you need any more information before being able to give \_legit\_ advice, let me know and I'll provide you with it asap.",15Jan2020,1

(Back story). we are going into year 11 ( I’m Australian it’s the second last year of high school before collage/university)and it’s definitely harder then previous years your grades mean so much more and you need good grades to get into a good university 

Her reason for the break up was she is trying to deal with stuff mentally (I knew about) and that going into year 11 is going to be more stressful and she feels like it’s better for her if she isn’t in a relationship 

But my question is am I an ass hole to think that it would be better if we were together cause I could help her or if you just have any advice I would appreciate it

Also just quickly I don’t feel comfortable talking to her friends about it cause they are also some of my best friends and it feels weird also This is sad but this would have been something I would go to my mum about but unfortunately she recently passed away",15Jan2020,1

518,"I am in my last semester for my Bachelor's degree. It has taken me a long, long time to get to this point since I have been paying out of pocket.

With that being said, I work full-time as a systems administrator and have just gotten promoted, so I am working more hours than ever before.

I am taking 4 online courses this semester (I usually take three at most). I needed one elective, so I chose a information security course and was really excited about it until I saw the course.

The professor wanted a discussion board post to be posted weekly with an additional 3 posts in response to others. Each of these posts have to be done on different days of the week from each other, be 200 words, and have to have at least two references to receive full points with a grading rubric provided to be able to get your full 10 points on each assignment. The having to respond on separate days seems like it will be a stressful requirement to fulfill, especially given that all info sec classes that I have taken in the past have incredibly time-consuming labs and J have the most amount of time and am the freshest on the weekend (and even then have to sometimes work into the weekend, too).

There will be weekly chapter readings and labs every four weeks. These are okay, but the discussion boards sound like assignments from hell. Additionally, the professor considers ""lecturing"" to be sending walls of text of an already complicated subject, instead of lecture videos.

I reached out to him on what the format of the course is since I don't want to go through another course as a visual learner where the professor just sends walls of text on complicated material. He told me that there will be just a few videos that are short and that most instruction/lectures will be delivered through text.

I am considering dropping the course since it is my final class and the material seems to be a combination of professor laziness and busywork and going for a different class like sociology (checked and I have taken most of the IT courses offered this semester that I qualify for already). Should I do so?

Also, should I try to find a way to politely tell the professor that I really looked forward to the course, but having of be mostly text-based is less than optimal for me as far as retention and grasping of the material goes?",15Jan2020,1

This can often entail moving tables and heavy objects around, carrying large buckets of ice up from storage, and carrying heavy trays of dishes from one area to another. I am not particularly strong but I have never had back issues and I tend to watch out for my back when I go to lift heavy objects or I get help.
I have only worked at my current job a few months now but my manager generously granted me a week off to travel last week. On the flight home I was trying to sleep in my cramped airplane seat and by the end of the flight my lower right back was hurting very badly. Since then, I have taken back pain relief medicine about once a day, put hot and cold packs on my back, and done various stretches recommended to help lower back pain.
My pain seemed to move from the right (on the first day) to the centre of my lower spine. Some of the pain has been quite intense and sometimes throbbing.
Yesterday I was back at work for the first since my vacation. At first the pain was bearable but by the end of my shift I had to leave a half hour early. I am in again this morning and I have to get ready for work in less than an hour but I have been up since 2am because my back has been throbbing and I have been unable to sleep.

526,"cw rape

genders and ages undisclosed for anonymity, you'll see later why. all of the people involved are close in age and in their 20s.

around the time i started dating my bf, a friend of mine let me know that a friend of his told him that she was raped by one of my now bf's best friends, a girl that's pretty well-known around our area, and she has a lot of clout. my friend couldn't tell me anything else about what happened and i was starting to feel some intense feelings for him, so against my maybe better judgment, i tried to forget about it and never brought it up.

one of the reasons i was able to brush it off was that it seemed so much like an unlikely story. i know there's no profiling of who could be a rapist, and the fact that his friend is someone with some kind of power doesn't help. but she's always been a feminist voice against anything considered abusive and wrong, especially politically. but now that i've been dating my bf for months now, and things are super serious, i've actually met the friend in question and gotten to know her well. she's actually really great and generous, but i know that still doesn't mean she couldn't have done it.

i guess one of the reasons why i'm posting about it is because i know it's against my principles not to confront it. but she and my bf are pretty much ride or die friends, and their whole group is really vocally against violations of consent too. i feel like i missed the window to mention it when it might become detrimental to our relationship--or worse, theirs. i also don't even know a lot about the situation in the first place, but it's starting to feel wrong to at least not tell him.

anybody got advice? should i forget about it because it's none of my business? or if i should bring it up, any notes on how to without causing conflict??

527,"Met a guy who confessed his feelings to me a couple of days ago and we've been flirting on and off for a few months. I'm sort of on the fence.


We kissed for the first time after he confessed his feelings and although it was some of the best kissing I'd ever done, all I could taste was cigarettes.


I'm not a smoker and have never been around smokers. My country (Australia) has pretty stringent laws about where you can smoke (cant smoke on footpaths and have to be 5 metres away from a shopfront/cafe/restaurant/shopping centre entrance) so I don't really encounter smokers much. That's why I found it so noticeable and jarring tasting it in his saliva.


I feel everyone is entitled to do what they please but I don't want to get too involved with this guy as I don't think I will ever get used to the taste and I don't want to fall in love with someone who might not be around in 15-20 years.

528,"So it all started in 11th grade, when this guy from my grade send me a fried request on facebook. I noticed him looking at me during breaks. I accepted it and asked him for his name since he used a fake one on his profile. We started messaging, getting to know each other and at some point I got quite flirty with him. For some reason tho, probably because we're both super awkward, we never talked in person. I asked him if he wanted to hang out during the 2 week break ahead of us.

At this point you should know, that I'm apparently very easy to manipulate, because I somehow managed to end up in a relationship with some other dude over the 2 week break. This new guy saw the message from guy no.1. (See, I was very vulnerable back then and had no confidence what so ever.) So the new guy forced me to immediately end every contact with the first guy. And it was very awkward I was like ""sorry I can't meet up mith you, I have a boyfriend now, please don't hate me!""

The relationship with new guy lastet about 8 months. Wasn't very plesant. The new guy was very toxic, and thanks to new friends I've made (he forced me and the friends I had since year 10 apart, so he could controll me more easily.) at some point I had the currage to dump him. The night after said dumping, I went out with my bestie, we got very drunk and she ended up looking the first guy up on instagram (using my phone of course), liked a couple of his old pics (creepy much) and send him a message asking how he has been. So the first guy and I started talking again. (My friend does that sometimes, but usually I don't mind)

That summer I met a girl, who I thaught was incredably nice and sweet. She seemed a little clueless and kinda treatet me like her big sister. She always talked about that guy she had a crush on, never mentioning a name at first. 

Me and the guy talked on instagram here and there. 

As the girl I became friends with learned I somewhat frequently talked to the guy, she revieled that he was her crush. That, dear readers, was the tipping point. From that day on I noticed how obsessed she was. She started asking about him all the time, even tho it was clear, that the guy and I weren't that close and she too would talk to him at school from time to time. Aparently that wasn't enough. That same summer I started seeing someone, but VERY low key. We mostly met after school, witch lead to me, spending less time with this girl.

At this point I had no clue what was happening, but If I hung out in the city after school, I was being whatched. Sound surreal, I know. The girl and I hung again one day, we went to the lake, and I stayed at her place that night. We had some wine and it got very late and she got very weird. She started dating one of her guyfriends. Not because she liked him, but to make herself seem more desirable to others (she literally said that).

She told me about how she dug up increadably old pictures of her crush (who I thaugt she'd lost interest in, since of her new relationship) online, how she took pictures of him durig gym class and so on. She and her lunatic best friend even waited for him a the train station to follow him home (fortunately they missed him) and they didn't manage to locate his house by comparing his posts on instagram to houses in his town. I should have left at that point, but I was in no condition to drive. She went on, telling me about how she sometimes stands in front of the dudes house she had her first kiss with, staring up at his window. 

Then she asked why I recently started spending so much alone time with the guy I started seeing that summer. At first I was confused about how she could possably know about this, since we kept it absolutely private. 

Long story short, she blackmailed me into asking her crush out (first, to see i he was single, socondly so I could bring her) or she would tell everyone about my love interest and me. I did it, since I don't care what that dude thinks of me, and because I didn't want my guy to be mad. The girls crush declined my offe, as he has a girlfriend. I was glad to hear about thar, since thar meant I wouldn't have to go an a date with him. The girl send some stupid message about how my ex was a dick, whishing him best of luck with his girlfriend. 

After she embarressed me like that, I ended the friendship.

I ended up in the same class as the two in final year... bummer

Time has passed, people have left for university and I started dating someone else. It's been a few years now, and i think, the girl that guy dated (idk. if they're still a couple) told everyone about it. I'm getting shit for somethink that I never intended.

I am hoping someone here has had something experienced something similar. I am 23(F) for reference.

I cannot understand why, out of nowhere this has happened to me. She does not seem concerned that it is becoming recurrent. She told me it just happens when a gland gets blocked. But I just don't understand why suddenly my glands in my nether regions are betraying me like this? Am I doing something wrong? These cysts are painful, itchy and uncomfortable.

I have to struggle every semester working multiple part-time jobs to pay for my accommodation and school fees. In the past few weeks, I have been searching here and there for a way out. And recently, I got to meet my father's close friends. They are now currently working for a company called ATOMY. For those of you who don't know, ATOMY is an MLM company based in South Korea. I did my fair share of research on this company before and they claim that they're not like other MLM companies and that they focus more on quality products for a cheaper price (not really cheap) and their customers (down-line). My parents are a part of the business too and are currently making good money. I have also met other people who are making good money at this business. They told me that I only need to work for 1-2 years to become just like them. 

My father's friends have been forcing me to go to the seminars but I am very sceptical about them because of how they present themselves. The seminars are just a bunch of people talking about how hard they had life before and how ATOMY changed their lives bla-bla-bla. Anyways, I went to the seminars for quite a number of times and they were extremely exhausting for me. I had to sit down for more than half a day listening to people mumbling about how awesome their company is and how they can be successful just like them. I went there just to make my parents happy and think that I am actually going somewhere.

At the end, I did think about working for the company abroad seeing so many of the people that I know making a lot of money from this business. So I told my gf (21F) about my plan and she obviously was not happy of the idea of me leaving her to go for work abroad.

Planning a session with 7 people was hard enough with out. However, this particular problem has been solved with the new group chat. 

B) two people in particular use the chat to talk about their daily lives or friendly-argue about unrelated topics. The most recent have been What horrible history song is the best, scholarships for school, and what school has taught them. These conversations can go on for hours, with just the two of them. That fact they don’t talk privately about this in their own chat (we use messenger) at least after half an hour of no one else has joined in is infuriating and, I believe, disrespect for the rest of the group because it is a great disturbance if the chat isn’t on silent. 

C) this happened very recently, but two members of the chat (one from above and one unrelated) decide to talk about how sleep was for the week at  TWO to THREE IN THE MORNING. While I was awake at this time, this did disturb my attempts to sleep; and I find this aspect the most disrespectful of them all. 

Now, I understand I can solve ALL of these problems by simply muting the group chat. However, by doing so, I can and have missed important messages that have/could have caused me to almost miss a session, or something of similar regard. Additionally, I have been called out for muting the chat (“where’s (name)?” “Probably has the chat muted”). And finally, when I try and look for important information, or anything DND related I may have missed, I have to scroll through hours of non-related messages. 

I have talked with another member about these issues, and she Too finds B annoying, however she was included in C. I could bring this issue to the dungeon master, but she is one of the pair in B, and I wouldn’t want to upset her since she is my dear friend. And I am hesitant bringing my grievances to the chat as a whole, because I don’t want to come off rude and harsh from being upset over little things. 

I’m so sorry this was so long, but I wanted to write  this as clearly as possible. Any advice would be deeply appreciated. Thank you.",15Jan2020,1
559,"Some info:
Im 20 years old (f) and have been going to college for 3 years now. In these 3 years I have switched majors a lot. Because of many different reasons (didn’t interest me, depression,...). Now I’m at a point where I’ve had enough. I have been studying for 3 years, still in my first year and on my 4th major.  The major I do now doesn’t interest me and I only studied because I wanted a degree. I really don’t know what the best way is to tell my mother this. Because it wil really come as a shock to her since everytime she asks about school I just said everything was going fine. How do I break this to her?",15Jan2020,1
560,"Basically, we were both drunk and it was me, my girlfriend and one of her good friends in my bedroom, he wasn’t supposed to be there but I guess he just wandered in without thinking. As my girlfriend turned her back for a bit to talk to other people at the party, this boy pulled my boxers juuust enough to see my dick. I didn’t think much of it at the time because I was very drunk but I’m finding it so hard to just be around people now.

I don’t know what to do, the worst part is, this boy is in my college class (around 15 people) and I see him so much, he was also close to my girlfriend so the fact that he would do this to me drunk or not is sickening, it’s really effecting my studying since I’ve had to leave class a few times just to breathe.

I’m an anxious person so I try to avoid confrontation and I also don’t want to affect his studies since, well, I don’t know I just feel guilty if I did do that. Please let me know what I can do next. I feel awful.",15Jan2020,1
561,"Since I was a kid I have been pretty obsessed with arts, painting, music, photography, all of that. I wanted to be a graphic designer but that was not a ""real job"" for my parents, so I ended up as a teacher at a high school with 23 years old.

I try my best at teaching but I don't have the character needed for the thing, I live in a Latin American country and kids are not into the study, so teaching is pretty though and you need to practically force them to learn, is hard for me as I am pretty democratic and want them to be more autonomous not just copy-paste machines, I do believe society needs creative and critic people who can think out of the box and be disciplined, but majority are not into it at all and it makes me feel frustrated most of the time.

When I was in my last year of college I started to produce music ( I did just for fun, because I love music, I can play a lot of instruments I learn on my own, even I learned English on my own so I can understand better info sources.) Right now I am making three times the money I earn from school out of music and I just started noticing all the things I left behind for working on school, I don't paint anymore (as I don't have the time), I've lost interest in astronomy (space is another of my obsessions), I can't skate anymore (which I did to keep my body in shape as I am really bad with other sports), lost contact with a lot of friends and the list goes on, when I get back home I am just tired and with a lot of school work to do at home. 

I know that working at school I will have a ""secured economy"" but I don't want to be a slave all my youth to have a pension on my late 50s to then pursue my dreams, I don't even know if I will live that long or if I will be still interested on the things I love then. I know I'm a bit young still so there is a lot of things in this that I can't see as I don't have enough experience in life, but I can't ask my parent's advice because the will push me into the ""be a successful teacher thing"", I need a neutral advice. 

Right now I am single (no kids), never used drugs or alcohol (my only addiction kind of thing is videogames which I managed control as a kid and buying musical instruments, I am still working with this one), I am teaching in high school and producing music on my free time, but I believe that just producing I will have more time to do other stuff I love to do.

564,"So a bit of context:

I have been employed for about 1 year and 1 month at the company I work for (construction). During the initial hiring process I took a salary lower than what I was previously getting paid at another job. I expressed this and they guaranteed me a salary reevaluation at 3 months (which I got and was brought up to my old salary).

Over the course of the last 9 months I have been working a T&amp;M job with 100% of my time spent in the field (the position I took was suppose to be 70-30 split office-field). As such my company has not had to pay my salary (10's of thousands of dollars) for this time and in fact makes a percentage of my wage (I am hourly out on this job).

I have been working consistent 60 hour weeks despite the original position being a standard 40.

Should I put off asking for a raise because of that initial salary reevaluation?

Is a 3-4% raise too much to ask for in this scenario?

566,"I know that's a lot to unpack. 

Basically, I started getting close to my sister's ex (D) months after their break up. She fell in love with another man, broke up with D, he was heartbroken, skipped town for a while, came back, asked for my help with a work project. We grew pretty close pretty soon and then the inevitable happened. We hooked up a few times and decided to give our relationship a chance. Some of you might call this karma, but literally that very week I came to find out he had lied about something very major. I don't want to go into details, but he is involved in a serious situation. I've always known about it but the way he had presented the story to me painted him as the victim. What I came to find out is that he's the one that has done a lot of harm.

I cut him out of my life altogether as he is a bad person. I walked out on him, blocked him everywhere, I even changed my routine up because we kept bumping into each other ""on accident"".

Then I started feeling very tired. I thought I was coming down with a flu and I wasn't feeling so worried about my period being late because I thought it was normal due to all the stress I had been through with D. By the time my period was already a week late, my breasts kept getting more and more sore so I finally caved and got a test. It was very positive, two lines right off the bat. I called my ob-gyn, they had me come in later that week and confirmed it with a blood test.

I shared the news with my mom right away and she was so supportive and overjoyed. My mom and sister both know D and I had been spending a lot of time together but neither of them know anything happened between us. My mom gently pressed for details but I told her I don't want to talk about the dad and she respected that.

To make matters worse, I've worked it out and I'm pretty sure I got pregnant the night of my sister's birthday party, when she last saw D and I together. We were celebrating at our friend's bar and D showed up because he knew I would be there and I was avoiding him. My sister obviously saw that he was there and that he had come to see me, which upset her. I'm worried that she'll work out the timing as well when she finds out I'm pregnant. There had been some conflict between my sister and I because she didn't like us getting close and she suspected he was using me to get back to her or something. She has now started a relationship with the man she left D for, though.

There is no doubt in my mind I'm keeping my baby. I don't want D to be a part of the baby's life because he is truly a vile person. I don't really want to tell anyone D is the dad for that reason but also because I wouldn't want my sister to feel bad about it. Especially now that he isn't around anymore.

582,"Didn't think I'd get super personal on here but, I guess there's no shame in asking for help.

I'm a student or at least I hope to be in my second year of college. A lot of traumatic things have happened to be within this last semester from being threatened by a group of students, dealing with a bad breakup, losing friends, losing my dog of 12 years, taking care of family, and just dealing with being Bipolar.

I've been hospitalized twice this year. I wasn't expecting this last couple of months to go like this.

I had to take a leave of absence from school (it's a long story) it was either that or tank my GPA so on the last day of the semester I broke down and did it.

Turns out I lost a good chunk of my financial aid and I have about a week and a half to figure this out and enroll in classes for school. The thing is I hate it here, I'm enrolled in school only because I don't live at home and my parents are only supporting me financially because I'm in school. I can't focus/concentrate as I get incredibly bored in my classes I did okay first semester but my GPA dropped after I got a D+ so, I'd really need to buckle down and focus to boost my gpa but now I'm behind a semester.

I thought about dropping out- I really did but, the thought of going home keeps causing me to have extreme mental breakdowns- home isn't the best for me. The hospital isn't really a good choice for me as I have no intention of harming myself and all they can really do is tell me to take some meds. Also, my friends don't really get the issues I have with school. People think that being a smart kid means school is an easy feat but, it's not- I've been good on tests but, I've always hated school from super young.

I'm honestly scared. I'm just a kid quite frankly and I'm expected to have all these answers and solutions but, I didn't expect this to be this hard. If my parents don't find the money I have to go home and I don't have any work experience so finding a job is going to be damn near impossible. I'm not rich and I have two other siblings in college that my family supports. If I remain in school, I don't know if I can buckle down and fix my gpa- I really hate it here.

I'm no Steve Jobs, if I drop out I'm fucked I'm a Political Science major not a Computer kid, my talents are merely that of writing and debate. I won't invent the new Facebook, I'll be flipping burgers at McDonald's (if they even hire me).

587,"Hey guys so this will be a long story.
I met this guy off if grindr and we hit things off really well. We decided to start hanging out and we ended up really liking each other. Eventually after a couple weeks we decided to be exclusive. We both have a mutual acquaintance named bob. I found out through bob on snapchat that chris(my boyfriend)  is supposed to pick up bob from the airport new years eve night and they are supposed to stay in a hotel together. 

Mind you these two had hung out before and had sex prior to me... so I asked chris if he had plans on new years eve and he admitted that he was going to pick bob up and stay with him. To which I was pissed and voiced my concerns. They both claimed that it was just two friends staying together. I told chris that it was either me or bob and he cancelled his plans reluctantly stating that these plans were made prior to our commitment. Why would you get committed to someone if you had plans to stay with another dude? So times goes on and we start really falling for each other. So one night I'm playing games next to chris and see him open his phone... to which a guys Instagram appears. He immediately clicks on a random post on the guys profile and then closes his phone. I found this kind of odd so I asked him who it was.

 Come to find out it's a past hookup that he keeps in touch with to talk about vague things like politics and they are supposedly really good friends. He finally tells me it was a 3 way hookup and that he has no interest in pursuing anything with this man. He tells me that he has multiple ""friends"" that were past hookups... to which I make it know that this is uncomfortable. I tell him I'm not sure I can handle him talking to past hookups. So a day goes by and I'm still uncomfortable as guys will just randomly text him and I have no idea who the fuck they are, and now it could truly be ""anyone"". We eventually talk it out and he says he can give up the recent hookups but he wont give up the ones he has known for 10 plus years as they have formed strong friendships.

 I'm not sure if this is still acceptable or if I'm just being a dick. We literally just met a couple months ago... so who am I to be telling him to give people up? He treats me really well and I have his house key... but I'm not sure why if your with me youd need the attention of these hook ups? Why is it so difficult for him to give up even the most recent ones? With the way things went with the airport night, trust was broken as he didnt even tell me about picking up bob... said he was to much of a pussy to tell bob goodbye... and to much of a pussy to tell me about the situation. So I'm kind of just left here always thinking something is going on behind my back no matter how hard he protests that its not. I'm going to college soon and whether or not I go in this town or back home depends on chris. So I need to make a sound decision to stay with him or not. I'm not sure if this situation is the place to put my foot down but I'm not sure if I can be with someone who talks to past flings, and doesnt even tell me about them. What should I do? If you need more information just message me or ask.",15Jan2020,1
588,"Okay so I overthink a lot but currently I’m on break from work and school so I have A LOT of time. 

Usually during this I play video games/learn new stuff for tech wise/hang out. To keep me busy. 

My family thought I was depressed for a time because I’ve legit been doing nothing. Usually I am doing something. But I feel like there is nothing else to learn tech wise, all my friends I don’t feel like hanging out, I just feel like cuddling with my friend and talking with her. Idek what about I just enjoy her company. 

For some reason I don’t feel like doing anything. The only thing I want to do is hang out with my one friend which is a girl. But we already talked about everything together and the drive from me to her is 40min. So it wouldn’t be fair for me to ask her and sometimes she just is busy so we can’t hang out. (Not sexually just hangout.) 

I’m normally doing something but all I’ve been doing was lay down in my bed all day. I binge watched so many shows too. I overthink literally every little thing there is. Mostly with the girl. I think she hates me, she doesn’t want to hang out, and I know this isn’t the case. We usually text a lot but when I say there really is nothing to talk about there isn’t. So our convos is either her starting it saying how was your day or vice versa. She already told me how she felt about me. But me overthinking is just stressing me out. 

I hate spending money so when I do spend it on food or something I think (is this worth it?) when in reality why tf do I think that I’m hungry of course it’s worth it. I’m not poor or anything, I’m also not rich but I have money to spend on food. If I’m with someone I care about and they say there hungry I will spend it in a heartbeat. 

Even now I have absolutely nothing to do. I might go to this party Saturday but I’m not even excited about it. Like the only reason I’m even going is because they invited me and I don’t want to be the only one not to show up. He usually doesn’t invite a lot of people over. Just some friends and family. He lives 50 min away from me and it’s snowing that day so it’s gonna be annoying. I have to buy him a shirt today. 

The only thing I’ve been looking forward to not even gonna lie is to hang out with this girl. We might go to the movies Friday and Saturday she might go to the party. 

I’ve had this problem of overthinking for almost all my life I’m 20. My father I noticed has the same problems. Overthinking things that are completely simple and just stressing over it. Me and him both have been trying to get better but how do I just stop thinking about things. It’s normally not this bad when I’m in school and working because I don’t have time to think about things. 

I told my friends and they told me to find something to do they even offered hanging out with me. I go to the gym but I just don’t feel like going (laziness), I’ll learn this program but I don’t feel like doing it, I don’t feel like playing video games (nothing to play), I’m just bored so bored and the only thing I genuinely feel like doing is cuddling and talking with that girl. 

Why don’t I ask the girl to do that. We already kinda made plans for the weekend since she works all week. Also Well she just seems like she doesn’t want to hang out as much lately plus she lives far so it isn’t fair. Idk her mom so I can’t just go to her house. I’m sure if I text her something is stressing me out she’ll want to know what since I’ve helped her a lot in the past. 
But I don’t feel like telling her the only thing I look forward to is hanging out with you. I don’t want to “force” us hanging out because she feels bad and Cause that’s gonna put stress on her I feel like. Since we haven’t been hanging out as much lately she might think it’s her fault.

I dropped out of college because of the paranoia/anxiety and I’m currently trying to get a job. But damn. I just got out of a 45 minute shower and whilst in there I was thinking about how unhappy life is and how much better it would be to not be here. I just want to parish and not worry about everything everyday from the way I place my hand to what I’m going to do today to jobs to what I want to eat. I just want to disappear but I can’t say that to anyone because I’m scared they would admit me back to the hospital and I really cannot do that again. It drives me insane. I hate the way I’m living life and I’ve tried desperately to change my thinking patterns and the way I view life but it’s like a never ending cycle of feeling incomplete and incompetent.

591,"Hi everyone, I would love some really solid advice and opinions here. I have been working full time since I graduated college in May of 2018. I was comfortable, maybe have some young female spending habits I can clean up a bit. I ended up picking up a second job this past fall in October. I was only supposed to be working weekends but they started scheduling me Wednesday through Sundays and working doubles on Saturdays. Needless to say, this was a lot but I was managing it. I've given up a lot of things that helped keep my mental health in line, working out being one of them. My eating habits plummeted too as I've been too lazy to actually want to cook. One thing lead to another and my past issues with a specific ED have resurfaced. For over a month now, they've been at full force and it scares me. I know I need to get help. On top of this, I've had three to four ""problems"" with my manager incorrectly scheduling and basically screwing me over. The first was on New Years when I picked up a girl's shift and I wasn't scheduled to close but an hour before my shift, they told me I was closing and I ended up having to stay three more hours than I was supposed to. The second was this past Sunday was when I was supposed Hostess and was told an hour into my shift that I was now serving and was expected to have all of my serving clothes and apron. When I said I didn't because that wasn't what I was scheduled to do, I was reprimanded. Lastly, the same day, I had requested off and was approved the week prior to have Wednesday (today) and Saturday off.  My manager scheduled me to work every day and I confronted him about it to which he said I requested Thursday and Saturday off, so he fixed my schedule. I said how I needed Wednesday off because I have a mandatory business meeting I have to attend and that was the day I had been approved to have off. Regardless, it ended in disappointed texts sent on both sides and I settled for rushing out of my meeting and going in late today. I 100% decided to put my two weeks in but now I'm just thinking to say fuck it and text my manager and quit today. That feels very crappy of me but I have too many negative things affecting me and I feel disrespected by them. I'll never use them as a reference nor plan on going back there so should I really care that much. What do you guys think?

601,"Let’s start off by saying I work in Utah. 
I drive for a third party logistics company for Amazon (I deliver packages) 
When I got hired at the end of June 2019 for $15. 
My schedule is 10 hour routes 4 days per week. 
They promised to pay $150 per day no matter what time I completed my route. they call this the “roll up”, and in return I do what they call a “rescue” and what that is, is when I have finished my route I go and help someone who still has many packages left.  (This was not mentioned in the job description when applying, and in the orientation so I know it’s not part of my job)
Once apon a time my boss told us at a stand up meeting we have every morning “we roll you up when you do a rescue and fill up the vans everyday you return” 
and I’ve done all that everyday since I’ve been with this company. 
they have also been rolling me up. 

BUT NOW they are implementing the “no roll up” 
And have not taken away the 10 hour routes or the “rescuing” thing. 
Which means people (like me) who get done with their 10 hour route in less than 10 hours is now subject to less pay when they promised a 10 hour route will be paid $150 per day. 
I cannot remember what I signed when I got hired but I know it was somewhere along the lines of a promise to pay $150 per day for a 10 hour route. 

Also, they have not made anybody sign anything in which the $150 per day promise will be taken away. 
I’m not familiar with laws surrounding labor but I believe they’re breaking a few. 
I will ask for the papers I signed when I got hired after today’s shift. But as far as I’m concerned I don’t have a to do anymore work outside of my own route such as the “rescuing” system they have.? I KNOW I NEVER SIGNED ANYTHING SURROUNDING THAT 

If anyone has advice of what I should do that would be appreciated. 

It’s very upsetting for the people who get their route done in less than 10 hours.

602,"
My friend and I met in college. For many years I had considered her my best friend. Full disclosure: I am a guy, but we'd never been involved romantically. After college we remained close, despite living in different cities. She was in my wedding party (as the only groomswoman). We used to chat on Google Hangouts every single day, about anything and everything. I don't have this kind of relationship with anyone else except my wife. She was the one friend that I could open myself up to about anything and I thought we had a very special relationship. 

Something happened around three years ago though. I noticed she stopped responding to my messages as quickly and would start giving very terse answers. Instead of chatting every day it became once every couple of days, then once a week, then barely once a month. It got to a point where any attempt I made to have a lengthy conversation failed after a couple of exchanges. A mutual friend was getting married and we would both be attending the wedding. I thought it was an opportunity to reconnect with her, but instead I spent the whole weekend talking to her boyfriend instead while she seemed to avoid me. It was apparent to me that I had been replaced by someone else who she got along with. They'd chat and make the same jokes that we used to make and seeing that really made me angry and depressed.

After the wedding I kept trying to talk to her on occasion, reaching out to discuss shows that we'd both watch, current events, or even just to catch up. Anything really. Sometimes she'd respond and we would have a nice conversation like we used to, but every time I think I've made some progress the conversation would just die again. She never initated any contact. We are both in a group text message with some other friends (including the person I think she's replaced me with) where she is very active, but never seems to respond to my messages.
 
At this point it seems like our friendship is dead. People drift apart over time, I get that. But I thought our bond was stronger. I truly miss having a friend that I could talk about anything with. I've thought about reaching out to talk about our evaporated friendship but have avoided it thinking it could only make things worse. But at this point there doesn't even appear to be much left to salvage. Last night I typed up an email to her going over all this and did not know how to end it. I didn't want it to sound really dramatic or make it seem like I'm trying to guilt-trip her into responding to me or force her to talk to me again. I don't know if I intend to send this letter or if I can even finish it. 

I don't know what to do. I miss my friend but it seems like she's moved on. Should I try to reach out or will that just put the nail in the coffin?",15Jan2020,1

She will pop in occasionally but that’s hard to predict when it will happen. I love my job. The only reason I’m leaving is because I have an internship starting in March, for which I will have no time for work. She knew this hiring me, but again that was two years ago. I’m giving her a month notice because I want to give her plenty of time to find someone else before I leave.

She’s definitely one to make her presence known, actually meows at you when she’s hungry, and it’s odd how I haven’t seen nor heard her at all? She does get kind of shy and hides but it’s typically in the bathroom we use or the other bathroom with the litter box in it. However, she’s not there. We checked all the rooms, opened all the doors to see if she simply got trapped in a room, still no sign of her. All of his cats are indoor/outdoor cats but during the winter they all stay inside. They do not remember seeing her go outside at all either. 

They did say a friend of my boyfriend did bring his dog around Sunday night and she went to hide but I don’t think they have seen her since. She hasn’t been down for food which is really out of character for her. She was sick not too long ago, however she had been to a vet, given medication, and she did get better. We do know cats go into hiding when they’re about to pass.

610,"Hi there,
My roommates and I have an awkward situation that we are unsure on how to proceed with. 

We are 3 grad students, and we live in somewhat of a townhouse. We have neighbors on both sides of us, the neighbors on our right also have neighbors on their right. Our neighbor on our left is at the end of the row and only has us as neighbors. 

We are faced with an unfortunate situation. Our neighbor to our left has VERY loud and aggressive sexual activities with his partner/girlfriend/fuck buddy. He is also on a different schedule than us students, so sometimes it happens late at night (ie. last night at 2am). 

Myself and my one roommate share a wall with this neighbor. Where my room is located, I don’t always hear the screams and slaps and spanks (unless I’m trying really hard to hear) but from my other roommates room, you can hear it all loud and clear. I’m also a heavy sleeper so I sleep through it almost every time. 

This is starting to mess with my roommate. This morning she came downstairs teary eyed. She says it affects her mental health and the second she hears the moaning start she is automatically put in a bad mood. 

Any advice on how to handle this? Banging on the wall doesn’t seem to do much and we re nervous for confrontation. We don’t know this neighbor too well and are a bit nervous telling him we can hear him having sex that also sounds like an exorcism.",15Jan2020,1

614,"Hello! So recently (end of last week) I was offered a job that I'm really excited about. I've been quietly looking/applying for jobs for the last 6 months, but my current employer doesn't know that. I was going to give notice this week, as soon as I sign paperwork for my new job, which would give my current employer about 3 weeks notice. For the position and field I'm in, 3 weeks is a little on the short side but I have my start date for the new job already and it's the best I can do.

Unfortunately, that all just got more complicated because I came down with the flu. So I'm out of work for at least the next couple of days. My question is whether I tell my boss about my resignation when I get back to work, even though that'll be even less notice, or if I tell him via phone/email. I say email because I'm not really able to talk very clearly right now with the coughing and sore throat.

It felt like it was going to burst, but it goes after a few minutes, so who cares. Then after a while, yesterday it happened of both knees. It is PAINLESS just a very tight pressure and so far only when I stand up from sitting. I sit in a normal sitting position usually, but I like to cross my legs too. Now today my knees felt very mildly sore. I get clicks in my hips and knees sometimes when I walk. I have a few bad habits that might be aggravating/causing it. I either sit for prolonged amounts of time, throughout the day just sitting, OR I do high kicks and other leg extensions without any warmup, with cold limbs in esp now it’s winter. I used to stretch often and I could do the splits, but ive been really lazy and stupid and my stretching and kicks are probably damaging my legs.

Hello

Well, few days ago I met a cute person. I was interested in a conversation so much that I might have come off overwhelming a bit. While this person was neutral, I was able to see her talking to the other person sitting next to for longer conversation than did with me. While I was trying hard to keep a conversation with her, she seemed to want to speak to the other person who obviously seemed more confident in his body language. The reason why I could tell is because he was easily putting his hand on her arm or shoulders gently in a friendly way. I was never able to establish that much confidence to touch someone. Unless I really dont care how I come off to them, then yeah. 

So how do I maintain my confidence or at least not show so much interest in someone while I am deep down very interested? 

How do you play it cool, give hints and at the same time enjoy the company of everyone at the table without giving so much pressure/importance to the specific person? 

How do you let go?

We've been friends for over 5 years. The last two years he started making mad with stuff he said. People who hanged out with him for over a week always asked me how I could not go angry when hanging out with him. Bob during class usually monologues,no not just monologue always make noise. He even plays with his pens on class and makes noises. He is 17 dammit. The most irritating part is that he a guy who gets closed off to his house for ever when not being at school is like hey Jonathan have you seen the store on x street, actually I know you don't go out so you probably haven't. When he says something like that you can't imagine how irritating it is. Also always when I say I go out with friends he is like oh who is that friend and asks me if they're real? Is he stupid or something? Even when I tell him to come out for a walk or something he always says no with the reason being taking a break. On reality he doesn't really have many friends if any outside of me and two other people on school. He knows this but refuses to say it. He is also quite delusional believing that our class is made of people who all close friends which is something not true, just a coincidence that small groups of friends ended up on the same class. He would know that if he came out. He also is very jealous of my achievements which is something other people commented too. Whether be it a better grade or a better pc he would be jealous. Even when I am hanging out with other people he would just come and try to get my attention. He also believes he is not a mortal and that he is the strongest in the hole neighborhood. There are more but this is already a lot. Oof sorry Bob but I needed to get this out. Today after having a lot of pressure because this hole week we write 2 exams every day and by family problems I had a lot of rage inside which I controlled pretty well. Then comes Bob and does some of the above and I finally broke, shaking by the rage. I stopped talking to him for today without giving an explanation. I am also not planning to talk him until the end of the week until I finally have time to relax again. I am really asking for more in general advice. Is he really a good friend or not? Did I do the right decision or not? Am I the bad person? Thank you for taking your time to reply on this and I will be sure to reply for you if you need more information or just to say a thank you.

623,"So before Christmas I had about 3 weeks of exams for all my subjects as mocks for the real ones in June.
I did well in all my subjects. In my German exam however I got the highest possible grade (basically an A**)

This is because the weekend right before my exams I printed out and did the papers from the year before as revision. I marked them and did quite well (equivalent of an A).

 Then when I got to my exams the papers we were given were the exact past papers available freely online. I obviously remembered most of the answers from when I had already done the papers.

This meant I got a grade I didn't really deserve. When I got my results last week I gave them to my mum and she was happy but also shocked I got the highest grade possible. I'd been getting one or two grades lower in previous exams. 

I'm worried sick that a) I haven't told her I'd already done the exams and that's why I did so well
and b) feel like I cheated myself

Tomorrow evening I have parents evening and I'm worried my teacher will tell my mum I 'cheated' or similar.

625,"Throwaway account btw

Basicly i started using a camsite about 6-7 months ago when i was in a dark place feeling very hopeless of dating a girl again. Now about 2 months ago i met this girl on the site and we seemed to hit it off right away. Since then we have been talking alot on snapchat.
Shes american and im from the EU, shes 23 and im 21. Shes told me almost everything about her life, her real name, we have talked about her daughter,her struggles with family and the conversation feels more like im talking to a close friend. We have talked so much on snapchat we even got the golden heart thing and have kept it for a few weeks now.

Recently shes talked more and more about how she wants to meet me in person. So far ive made up excuses that i cant do it cause i still live with my parents and such and she has respected it so far.

On the camsite shes not a big camgirl. I dont think ive seen her have more than 4k followers on the accounts shes made. She doesnt even have a steady schedule to be on the site, more just when she can. 

So yeah like i said before shes been wanting to meet me. And i cant stop thinking how great it would be to meet her but also i feel like why the fuck would she ever want to meet ME. But what makes this hard for me is that shes said shes willing to pay for her own flight and stay if she were to come to my country. She doesnt have alot of money, she doesnt even have a apartment of her own so her buying her own ticket and stay feels to me like she actually wants to see me and not like any scam. 
Also something that bugs me is that shes said all this and you might think ive been donating to her on the site like a madman but the truth is that if she were to come to my country the flights and the hotel stay would be more than ive donated to her since i found her on the site.

Yeah basicly i dont know what the hell im supposed to do. I dont want to lose her by denying her if her feelings are more than just for the average client but i also dont want to get scammed if i were to say yes to her coming.

626,"For over about a decade, I’ve been the person to make those jokes about how ADD I am. I don’t think it started as anything other than me being 11 and trying to describe that I’m forgetful and have trouble focusing on one thing that actually matters. 

After a couple years, I began to actually feel like it was a struggle and not some minor quirky inconvenience. By the time I was 14, I was still saying it as a joke because I figured maybe if I said it enough someone would help me. 

When I was 15, I asked my mom about testing and she said that when I was in kindergarten there was a paper sent home for kids to get tested. She said none of the symptoms fit me, and dismissed it. 

By the time I was 17, I was asking my friend with severe ADHD if he thought I might have it. He told me probably not, and said I’d know if I did. A year or two later, he told me that maybe he was wrong, but that gave me no comfort. 

At 20, my roommate who is studying social work and psychology said her “recognizing mental illness” type course lead her to believe I might actually have it. It kind of came as a relief. 

But now, I’m obsessing over it. Do I have it? Can I fix it? How do I get help? What if they think I’m just seeking stimulants as a college aged student? If I don’t have it what’s wrong with me?

I just started trauma therapy, but they refuse to diagnose any clients so they don’t stigmatize survivors. I’m going to talk about it next week with my therapist, but I feel unable to stop thinking about it. 

I know I’ll have to seek help from a psychiatrist, but I don’t have the money to pay out of pocket. I don’t have health insurance now, but I might get some soon. However, it will be my parents insurance, and I’m not sure I want to let them know I’m getting tested because they both seem to believe I don’t have it. 

I’m pretty sure this is all a rambling mess, but I’m hoping someone might see it and know just what to say?",15Jan2020,1

630,"To give a little bit of context, I graduated from the local equivalent of high school last year. I got okay grades, because I was attentive at school, but didn't study on my own time. 

•Then I completed the conscript military service that lasted for six months. 

•After finishing the military service, I went back to working at McDonald's where I had worked for two months before the military service started. 

•I quit last October, because I started to feel like my life only consisted of McDonald's. After a couple of weeks, I landed a job as a cold caller for makes appointments for different firms. I did that job for 9 days and absolutely hated it and quit. 

I'm 21 years old, and I don't have energy to do anything productive. I've listened to tons of podcast episodes, watched YouTube &amp; Netflix, worked out casually with a friend and sometimes played video games. 

I haven't really been looking for jobs even though I should. I'm really good at teaching, and I like teaching and learning new stuff. 

I finally decided a couple of days ago that I want to become a teacher, and the entrance exam will be in May. I've got plenty of time to work and do things until then, but I don't have any energy. I feel exhausted doing nothing, and I can't get myself to focus on a single task for a very long time.

How do I get my energy, enthusiasm, grit and so on back and actually get shit done and feel motivated?",15Jan2020,1
631,"As it says in the title, I'm a 23 year old male.  I'm living at home with my parents right now, which normally would be perfectly fine for someone my age, except for the fact that I feel like I have no prospects whatsoever in life.

I graduated college last May, and I always felt like college was the one place I was truly happy for long periods of time.  I was living with friends in a city I loved and studying subjects that I'm passionate about and looking back, as stressful as school could be at times, I never once felt out of place or unhappy with my situation.  Of course, that couldn't last forever, I had to graduate at some point (no matter how much I didn't want to), and here we are.

I hate the idea of a job.  Call me lazy or entitled or whatever (I've heard it all), but I just can't stand the idea of selling my time to someone else and giving up the freedom to do the things I want to do on my own time.  It doesn't help that literally everywhere I go (online and in real life) I only ever hear people complaining about their jobs, and the consensus I've seen is that work sucks, especially when you're my age.  I worked part time for a while after I graduated, but the job was draining my mental health (there were a lot of problems with the job itself, beyond my own issues) so for the past 2 months or so I've been unemployed.  

My long term goal is to go to grad school, so I've been working on getting all my applications in, but I'm not super confident about my chances just yet.  Even if I get in, I wouldn't be going until the fall, and I'd need SOMETHING to do until then, which is what scares me.

Every job I come across on job postings looks absolutely soul crushing, and every job I feel like I'd be interested in is either way outside my experience level or wouldn't at all be a reliable source of money.  My degree is in English and Philosophy (I know, I know, you don't need to say it, again I've heard it all before) so I don't exactly have a list of jobs lined up for me.  I've always loved the idea of being a writer, but I don't really have the self discipline for that, and even if I did it's not like there's a lot of writing opportunities to make money right now.  I like the idea of freelance stuff, because having a boss and a set schedule still feels weird to me, but again that's not easy to get into and I don't really feel like I have any marketable skills to sell.  I'd love to travel somewhere, but I can't really afford much in the way of travel right now, and that still wouldn't really solve my problem.

I just don't know what to do.  If I could make money writing science fiction stories or filming videos or reviewing movies I would be ecstatic about it, but there's really no money in that stuff, at least not that I can see.  At least with stuff like that I'd have the opportunity to be creative and feel like my own person.  It just seems like that's never really an option.

I don't really know what I need advice on, at least not specifically.  I just don't know where else to turn and for all its faults, reddit's been there for me before, so I figured I'd give it a shot.  Let me know if there's any clarification you need, and thank you in advance",15Jan2020,1

637,"I'm guessing questions like this get asked here quite often, so apologies for that.

I'll be turning 23 in two months and pretty much ever since I finished high school (my country's equivalent of it, at least) I've been working insignificant, depressing part-time jobs (retail, stocking, etc.). I've always had the intention of going to college/university and get a degree, then find a job I like and start my life. But I simply don't really know what I should apply for.

I'm really interested in researching and analysing media (especially movies/tv, video games and social media) and in politics and social issues, and the impact those things all have on individuals and on society. I also really enjoy history and art. I'd love to help people in my job in some way. I'm really introverted and quite anxious around people so social work would be hell for me (and people's personal issues would get to me real fast), though I like the idea of that kind of job. I like researching and analysing phenomena and making arguments (but not debating, I can't think on the spot). I secretly dream of becoming a video essayist or do video commentary (similarly to YouTubers such as Lindsay Ellis, Tiffany Ferguson, Sarah Z and Jack Saint), but I know becoming successful on YouTube is extremely hard and that being able to support yourself off of that is even harder. I think I may still try my hand at video essays, but as a hobby, and then see where it goes.

At the moment I'm becoming kind of interested in sociology, but I don't know much about that. Are there similar fields? And I have no idea what kind of jobs would suit me. I come from an uneducated background and am not really familiar with the job market and careers in general. If I'm really honest, almost everything just sounds lame to me. What kind of studies and job fields should I look into with my set of interests?

My 15 year old sister and my mom keep fighting, they have a lot of arguments over petty things, but my 15 year old sister is being extremely mean.

She called my mom's nose big and her weird, then laughed at it.

She told me this, but apparently she made a seperate google for mom and put bookmarks like how to lose weight and stuff because she knows mom's trying to lose weight.

My sister keeep saying stuff like I hate you and that mom is abusive, I admit she did slap us when we were little, but she was raised in a house that did things the same way even a bit more extreme, and she always apolgized if she hit us( which was not common) when angry, and it's very common in asia, some parents literally beat their children with rods, our father did have that done to him.

She's also doing this while mom is literally sick, she ranted when she was stressed that she just wants to leave te house sometimes, but my sister right there said, ""I can't wait"" and acted all excited.

what do I do about her, She's nice to her classmates, she gives all her snacks out to them ( which mom buys for her)

I seriously don't get what's up her ass sometimes, she's so rude to our mother all the time, I don't get her reason either, What do I say to her?, we're on good terms but she's been ignoring me now because I told her off for being a total jerk.",15Jan2020,1

644,"I have always been played with emotionally/romantically. The only time a girl ever told me she had feelings for me when she was in a relationship with another guy. The other times they just act like they like me and then suddenly make a 180 and just leave me crushed, since i've already been invested in them. Now i've met another girl who i liked, but then she told me about her past, her father got murdered, she got raped as a kid etc... when she got older she got kicked out of the house and started to live with her boyfriend at the time. They realized they weren't satisfied and decided to have an open relationship, which is when i met her. 

Since i was already invested in this girl, i decided to just keep contact. It was so nice to be with her, i started to think this was too good to be true and i even told her. Ended up giving her my virginity and before her birthday a week and a half ago, her boyfriend got jealous of her being so close with me and decided to go back to an exclusive relationship (even though he still fucks around), since she is basically at his mercy (or she'd end up on the streets, though i have promised her i would pick her up and would even pay for her rent or let her live in my place), she swore on her dead father that she was serious with me and even was prepared to end it with her current bf. I told her not to make any hasty decisions. Now she seems to have made a complete 180, ignores my texts, saying im playing a dangerous game cause her bf reads through her phone and she 'cant' text back, even though she told me she would be free this week, since her bf started working again. instead she uploads videos on her story of her holding her bf's hand while he's shifting gears with the caption 'real love is shifting together &lt;3', seemingly just to fuck with me

2 days ago, when she ignored me after i asked if she wanted to meet up, i just told her 'well, thats clear, ill just end it here, thanks for playing with my emotions', which is where shit hit the fan. I told her how she swore on her father that she was serious with me and is currently just playing with me. She started to threaten me and saying i should leave her dad out of this or 'i was gonna see some shit', even though she brought her own dad into this shit. The fight kept going a bit and i fucked up at the end by saying that no matter what she told me, she'd still have a special place in my heart, which she also ignored.

Now im just fed up with constant failure and heartbreak since this isn't the first time at all that shit like this happens...

I feel like just deleting her and having some self respect, but then again, im not sure if she actually cares about me and is just in a fucked up situation etc... And to be honest, since she's my first, i actually want to keep having sex with her as well, since i loved it and don't think i'd want anyone else. What should i do?

Thanks in advance.

PS: she did break it off once, to which i didn't reply, but she ended up saying she HAD to say it cause her bf told her to

My fiancée (29) and I (28) are getting married in November this year.
We both work stable jobs, (Beautican and maintenance) in Northern Ireland and have been saving money for some time for the wedding.
Unfortunately just before Christmas, our house got broken into and several items got stolen, amongst them was a decorative wooden box with a little lock. Inside this box we had all our wedding stuff, receipts of deposits, hotel details and cash savings.
Our home insurance has agreed to cover the material items but can’t cover cash as it can’t be proven to be an actual loss (small print of contract).
80% of our weekly income is now going towards the wedding after children and house bills are looked after. 
Even with the 80% we’re still falling short of target which is why I’m asking for ways I/we can boost our income.

But now, I feel terrible.
My teacher has a really good relationship with almost all of her students, but I keep screwing up around her.
Here are a few examples:
There was a project where we were labeling a specific item and I used a synonym for it. She was speaking with the class and announced that my friend and I had both labeled one thing wrong (I didn’t know what exactly she wanted us to label it since she never told us). She advised us to change it before she took off points and gave my friend sometime to work, but when I began, she called me out and said “We are working on THIS now, not our projects.”
Another time is when I went up to her and asked her a question after, asking everyone at my table and the one next to it, only to receive a “you shouldn’t have to ask me that”
Today, I came into her class earlier than I expected. While we change classes at 11:05, I was there well before that. Her students will come in whenever and sit down in the comfy chairs we have. I went inside and was listening to her lecture for less than a few seconds until my teacher stopped and looked at me. She asked me what I wanted from her, and I responded that I was just early and wanted to listen. She told me that she was in the middle of a class and I needed to wait outside.

Hello! I have a situation in which I’m seeking opinions and advice, as I’m not sure how reasonable my gut reactions are on this topic.

My husband suffers from severe depression and anxiety; while there are all kinds of reasons, one of the more difficult ones that I perceive is that he is an only child between parents that seemingly despise each other, so he was the really the “glue” between them growing up. He has had to mediate their own fights, and neither of them really have any hobbies but him. They both obsess with his childhood, constantly telling me stories about him as a kid and voicing him as a kid (his mom will seemingly tell stories just to be able to say “mommy” referencing herself). So over the last few years, he’s really worked on recognizing these issues, talking to a professional, and even confronting it when necessary.

His parents also had him very late in their lives, so while I’m older than him, my parents are younger than his. Anyway, we see his parents usually once a week for shabbat dinners (his family is jewish) as well as his uncle and grandmother, but neither him nor his parents consider that “spending time”. It’s more of an obligation. I sort of get that, but it’s frustrating to spend 2 or more hours a week with them that “doesn’t count”, on top of setting aside every Friday night for it. 

This last Friday, he and I weren’t feeling well so we didn’t go to shabbat dinner. Yesterday, my husband was texting for quite a while before he informed me that both of his parents were bugging him about seeing him, saying that it was weird not to see him for such a length of time. I said it was unhealthy that it’s a requirement they see him on a weekly basis, but he thought it was just weird for them because they’ve grown so used to it. That being said, the bugging didn’t stop – his mom even offered to buy us groceries so that we’d hang out (he said no before I could). 

He’s done a pretty great job bucking some of their unhealthy habits towards and I am proud of him for how he’s been molding his relationship over these last few years. I’m worried that I’m overdoing it, becoming over sensitive to things they ask for, as I feel like I’m constantly on the hunt for their bad habits and behavior with him. They are getting up there in years (his dad is 73 I believe, and his mother 65), and he’s starting to worry that he’ll regret not spending time with them when he had the chance. I said that was a fair point, but that it was vital he make sure it was never at his own expense. 

So I’m wondering what you all think on this – am I overly sensitive on this topic? Is it reasonable for parents to semi-demand to see their adult child once a week?",15Jan2020,1
650,"Today in class we were doing a tedious group assignment and  we were all joking around said that maybe we should fake the results and our teacher heard my joke about it.

I just sat in the back for the rest of the class on my phone since I didn’t have access to the actual assignment in the back. Not sure what I should do. I’ve never had a problem with this teacher before and it was really surprising when she got so defensive and angry at me about this.

Should I email her apologizing? I just left class without talking to her. I’ve got no ill feelings towards her I’m just not sure if I can repair the relationship with my teacher so she doesn’t think I’ll be bad talking her behind her back and thinking I don’t like her.",15Jan2020,1
651,"Right now I attend a college for baking and pastry (most people just generalize culinary arts though). 

I had moved down from Bachelor's in the sciences since it was way too out of my league. I moved down to generalized Associate's for applied food studies. And yet it is still difficult for me, mostly because educational settings have never been good for me. 

I know my way around the kitchen, I know what it is I need to do in order to land the job I'm going to be in. I'm passionate about this career and know it is the right one for me. 

But to pay just about $53,000 a year for the technical things I could already know or learn from a hands-on job? I don't know. 

It is an accredited school and one of the very top (if not the top), however it is draining the life out of me. It is making my depression slowly creep back up. If I have more than 4 absences I automatically fail the class and am required to retake it next semester. I constantly have to be in business professional attire. I've now been put on academic probation because my GPA was terrible first semester. 

School. Just. Isn't. Me. 

And yet I could very well disappoint those around me by making the decision to drop out. I could have an adverse or excellent outcome from doing it. If I make it to my next semester I could be academically dismissed if I don't make it to their requirements. 

I don't know if college for my field of work is the thing I need to be successful in my future. I'm confused and need the opinion of others to see what direction could be the right way to go. 

Nobody's answers will be the final decision, that's obviously for me. I just want to see what others think or have to say about it. So, what do you all think about the situation?

652,"I am an instructor for a taekwondo school. I have been associated with this taekwondo school for 10+ years. Over the years there have been squabbles between the Owner (8th Degree Black Belt) and other black belts. Some resulting in people leaving.

Recently the school started holding more frequent instructor meetings. Which the Owner does not attend anymore. These meetings devolve into a growing list of complaints about the Owner.

Such as:
Being uninviting to parents and students
Stopped teaching classes
Growing passive aggressive behavior

The head instructors bring the notes from these meetings to the Owner. Resulting in the head instructors receiving the backlash, and tension between all at the school. This has brought about students and instructors beginning to leave because of how uncomfortable the atmosphere is.

654,"Pretty much the title. I am moving into a sharehouse with 4 other people. One of my new roommates is a good friend who just broke up with her boyfriend of 2-3 years.

A bit of background for this story:
I moved out of my hometown early last year. 
She is currently living there.
She is generally a flirty person, and it's how she interacts with people, and has done so on a pretty consistent level for the entire time I've known her.

When I went back to my hometown for Christmas, I really reconnected with her, and noticed an increase in the amount of affection she was directing my way. 
She was complimenting my hair, my beard (this one is less strange, it's new to people in my hometown), my independence (told me that she admires that I think for myself, in juxtaposition with another friend of ours who in a lot of situations, goes with the flow, and doesn't REALLY contribute ideas to our conversations) 
She took opportunities to be physically close to me, more so than I've ever noticed before, petted my hair, lay on my lap and generally was affectionate. 
BUT. 
No matter what happens this girl is going to be living down the hall from me for the next year if not longer.
She is notoriously flirty in general conversation, to the point where a mutual friend expressed that he felt for her now ex-boyfriend, and respected his ability not to read into her flirtyness.

Am I reading into this? 
The logical thing to do is bury my feelings and stay as friends, not risk the great relationship we have. 
But I obviously don't want to do that because since noticing these things, I have developed a crush on her. 

Should I ask her out
OR
Should I wait and see, keep an ear to the ground
OR
Be charmingly sneaky and coyly ask if she likes anyone, hopefully getting her to admit she does and share her fears about dating this person (ideally me)
OR
Give up and bury my feelings in the sand?

And if any of these methods work, and I could start a hypothetical relationship with this girl, should I? We'll be living 20 feet from each other for the foreseeable future, will overexposure simply ruin the relationship before it has a chance?

And if the hypothetical relationship ends badly, will that be a problem in the house? And will I be ok to lose her as a friend? (no)

And will this hypothetical relationship create friction among the other housemates (I don't expect advice on this bit just kinda thought it and now it's worrying me too) 

TL;DR
I like this girl, who just got out of a serious relationship, and she's moving in with me soon. Should I risk our friendship and ask her out?

655,"I (17F) have been very close with my ""original"" friend group since we met last school year. However this year, one of my original friends, A, introduced me to M and N. C, my *best best* friend, is taking college classes like a boss so she isn't at school most of the day. O, my newer friend, also takes college classes and won't be here either. 

A, M, N and I ate lunch together every day last semester, but it was a little weird. If I didn't feel like talkingz our group would be completely silent. I'm not really friends with M or N, and A....

Well, there are a few things, but essentially A tried to set me up with someone who emotionally manipulated me (plus he did other shady stuff before we met that she didn't tell me about)and then questioned *my* judgement and trustworthiness when he shit-talked me (spreading false rumors!!!) after we stopped talking (plus her general demeanor is just...kinda super sensitive for no reason). M is lowkey homophobic and straight up mean to me and others. N is on her phone all the time and never tries to engage in conversation. Actually, none of them ever try to engage or show real care unless I'm being all energetic and comedic.  I always make an effort to ask about if they're okay and listen openly, but I can never get the same back from them.

So I've essentially made the decision already to cut them out of my life, but I don't know how to do it. I've been eating lunch with C and O, and once they start their classes tomorrow I'm okay with being by myself, but A and M have already started grilling me on why I'm not sitting with them during lunch. I don't know how or when to tell them I'm done being friends...because I honestly am 100% done. They're not good for me and they don't seem like they care about me at all. But they think I'm funny and entertaining, and I know that it's gonna be difficult avoiding them since they always try to be near me. 

Any advice is appreciated! Thanks :)",15Jan2020,1

So basically I’m 17 and my sister is 18 and we’re fed up with our insane parents controlling our every movement and thing we do. It’s gotten to the point of them removing our doors because we get no privacy and having us on life 360 24/7. I can barely move without them breathing down my neck. 

So we’ve decided that we’re going to go to Canada in the summer for “vacation” since the rest of our family live there and we don’t plan on coming back.

My sister and I have jobs and are saving up for the trip and the funds we plan to use while we get on our feet. 

The trouble I’m having is that we have debit cards under their name and they can cancel them at any given moment which makes it impossible to use our money. Another thing is that we’re not sure what documents to bring just in case. We’re dual citizenship so we can freely travel to Canada. 

What should we expect when we get there?
What should we bring?
Etc.

663,"I posted a similar post elsewhere, but I'm also going to put this here.

I've been throwing myself at college for the past few years and it's gotten to the point where I can't successfully keep myself from dropping classes or straight up giving up and accepting failure. I go into each semester thinking things will be different but burn out almost immediately, I have zero enthusiasm or drive to succeed anymore. I've hated my major since I transferred, but nothing else seems worth majoring in, none of the classes I've taken have interested me in any meaningful way. I hate having to commute everyday and how much gas and toll money I spend just getting to class. Maybe I just lack self discipline, but this sucks. 4 years I've been going and I have nothing to show, I feel like a failure and like I have no future. People I graduated HS with are already graduating, and my parents are wondering what's taking so long. I fantasize a lot about disappearing up north, but I have no friends, no contacts, no job, and a shitty car, so that sounds like an incredibly bad idea, but I have no ideas anymore.",15Jan2020,1
664," 

After graduating college in May of 2019, I was excited to start working at a large healthcare company not far from my hometown. Everything seemed rosy, as the job was close to me, aligned with my past experiences, and paid fairly well for an entry level position. 

I started in early June, and on my first day, it was to be expected that I would be taken through the process documentation and be educated on this position by my Manager. This was the case, but in speaking with the man I thought was my manager, he was actually an external consultant who owns his own company, but has written all the process documentation for this position of my department that he only works part time in. He spends about one third of his time in my department, and does not work in my building, or really even in the town my building is located. The rest of his time is split between several other departments and when he is dedicating time to my department, his Skype shows he is busy and in a meeting and he cannot respond to IMs or phone calls. In addition to that, all of the process documentation was written by him, and my actual Manager is so far removed from my work that she cannot answer any question related to my processes whatsoever. This has created significant confusion and several hours of me just sitting around and waiting for the Consultant to respond to IMs or return my calls to get the answer of a process related question while unfinished work is waiting to be done. 

In addition to this, the previous analyst who held my position fell very ill and was forced to take about a month out of the office in the time where he was supposed to be educating me on his duties. In the time he was out, work was left unfinished and I was forced to reconcile many weeks of his duties. This made me rely entirely on the Consultant, who has made it abundantly clear that his time is too valuable to waste in educating me. 

To make matters worse, the 10+ processes that the Consultant has written were last updated sometime around 2 years ago. In a continually evolving and dynamic workplace that this company prides itself in being, things have obviously changed immensely in the 2 years and most, if not all of the processes need to be redlined, edited and reviewed by another Legal Firm externally contracted and not in my building, or even my state. This has resulted in several 1 hour calls that I must coordinate between the Consultant, the outside Legal Firm, and my Manager to redline and present the documents to. On these calls, not much work gets done, and almost the same conversations go on between my Manager, the Consultant and the Law Firm on how the processes are out of date, and what needs to be reconciled next. I feel no work actually gets done in this 1 hour per week call and the processes will stay stale for the remainder of my time here. 

My Manager still expects me to fulfill my daily duties, in addition to taking on the very large project of updating all of the process documentation with the help of the other parties involved. Needless to say, my first job out of college has been a fucking shitshow. I’ve applied for a job at another company and have been offered the position for a program at a much better company starting in June. Although I’m usually very excited for new opportunities (especially one that would allow me to leave such an awful current job), I can’t help but feeling like I’m leaving my current company high and dry to find another entry level analyst to fill my role (that likely will be in the same boat as me). I feel my Manager and the Consultant will shun and scold me for finding a new opportunity that will be much better for me mentally and professionally, and it will create a hostile work environment for the rest of the time being here. 

Normally I know it’s common to give 2 weeks notice, but this is not nearly enough time for the company to find another analyst and get him up to speed on my duties. I’m considering telling my Manager now, which will allow me to pass any knowledge on to the new analyst to ensure a smooth transition for when I leave. I’m worried giving notice now will make a very uncomfortable work environment for the next 5 or so months, and with my Manager constantly mentioning the budget, they’d never pay 2 analysts for the next 5 months. Likely meaning as soon as they find a replacement and he gets his feet wet, I’ll be fired. 

Part of me wants to do what’s right and give notice to the company sooner rather than later, and part of me want to say fuck it and give the regular 2 weeks because this job has done absolutely nothing for me and I feel I don’t owe them anything. 

Any advice you could give would be greatly appreciated.",15Jan2020,1
665,"  My thoughts are kind of everywhere so I'm sorry. Recently I've had some, what seems to be repressed memories coming to light and I'm completely freaking out about it. I legitimately don't know if this is normal or not so please please tell me Im wrong and that Im overthinking this if you think I am.

 

I have a few male first cousins, and I am extremely close with all of my first cousins in general. They are all like brothers and sisters to me, and I am one of the youngest out of them all. I remember these things happening when I was younger but only recently did they resurface...For simplicity's sake, there are 2 cousins involved. There is A who is 29M this year, and there is M who is 26M this year. I'm 23F this year.

 

When I was in middle school (grade 8), M and his family had traveled from the home country to move to my country permanently. We all had separate rooms, and I had my own of course. The odd thing is........I distinctly remember several nights where I woke up thinking someone was in my room but went to sleep. But then one night, I very clearly remember waking up and looking at the mirror across from my bed. I thought I was crazy but I saw a reflection of a guy. I panicked a little and quietly said ""...Who is that? ....papa?"" Silence. Then I asked again who it was and then realized with confusion it was M. The weird thing was that he was completely crouched over, hidden at the foot of my bed. The only reason I saw him was because of the mirror. I asked him what he was doing cause I was confused and he didn't say much, just said he was ok. I was worried thinking he was sick, and he wouldn't get up. I asked him several times if he was ok, did he need something, was he feeling unwell, Why won't he get up? That one stuck out....he would NOT stand up. He just said he'd get up in a minute but for me to go back to bed. I was so.....confused. But I went back to sleep and I forgot it ever happened. But recently it came back up and I......Am I crazy? I can't imagine any reason he would have done that except.....yenno...*masterbating* I guess? It makes me want to vomit to even say that but his behaviour was just so.....odd???? and the fact that he refused to stand up or get up, he was so evasive and seemed a little panicked when I had awoken. That makes me wonder about the other nights I heard someone in my room and I......was it him those times as well????? And was it really just innocent? But what reason would he be in my room in that position, HIDING FROM ME and REFUSING TO GET UP at 2:00 in the morning???  
 

The other thing that I think triggered this has to do with A. A is not married and is a bit on the awkward side. He's got a lot of pressure on him and he's a good guy at heart but.....there are things he does that I don't know if it's normal or not, but makes me incredibly uncomfortable. It started around highschool. Whenever id go over if no one was around and he would come into the same room as me (often the kitchen) hed give me a hug from behind......but hed always push me into the countertop. It made me extremely uncomfortable to have him that close and....well, I mean, his whole front was on my whole back if you get my flow and it made me feel weird considering we arent super duper close or anything. Or, other times, he would give me hugs but seem to linger for a bit longer. Or, at times if I come over I'll go to his room to say a quick hello and give him a hug but if no ones around sometimes he would pull me down onto his lap. The thing is, this was very prevalent for a short while, as in, he did it all the time when I came over or he came over to my house....Then it stopped for a while when I went off to uni.

&amp;#x200B;

I think what triggered all of this and the panic I'm feeling about it is, just 2 days ago A had failed a very important test he needed to pass for his career. He was super glum and I and his sister (my cousin) had decided to surprise him with some food and drinks he likes. When I came over and said my hello, he was in his room. Immediately......he pulled me down onto his lap and held on to me. I felt acutely uncomfortable and just sorta did that thing where you smile and laugh and change the subject and sort of just did my best to stand back up and tell him to come down cause we had a surprise for him. I'm 23, and he's 29.....this can't be normal right? I just have this nagging nasty disgusting feeling I can't shake. I can't stop thinking about these incidences over the last few days and its been triggering a bit of a depression because....it can't be right????? It's not like they were molesting me....were they? Am I overthinking this?

&amp;#x200B;

It's driving me mad. I need some perspective here and I don't know if I'm crazy. There are more incidences like these, and id love to share but I just don't know what real and what not anymore and I want to cry.",15Jan2020,1

667,"I replaced the alternator in my car back in October. They said my battery from Feb 2017 is still good at the time.

Lately when I've started my car, I've been having electrical problems despite the engine starting right away. Sometimes the glass won't go down. Sometimes the dashboard warning lights all stay on when they normally just turn on and off after starting the engine. Sometimes I hear a long clicking sound after starting the engine before the dashboard updates my RPM/speed/temperature meters.

The headlights and heater always work just fine. 
This only happens the first time I start my car in a day of cold temperatures. If I park for a few hours after it fully heats up on the morning commute, everything works when I start it back up in the evening.

668,"I know, the title contradicts itself. I feel really bad about this situation. This person who rubs me the wrong way, just so happens to be my own mother.   I feel extremely guilty and hurt that I am so easily annoyed by her. It feels like betrayal. She's my own mother. She's had her cruel moments or her lose her cool moments for sure. Yet she has been more sweet than cruel the majority of the time. It really tears me into two directions. Excluding the traumatic moments aside and the repeated behaviors, there's no reason to feel this way. 


Her mannerisms are completely mundane. Sometimes she'll sing goofy, high pitched and off key for a little bit. That'll annoy me. Some people would find that adorable. Or she'll take her hand off the steering wheel and point at the ocean. For some reason the way she repeatedly points or waves her hand towards my window will irritate me. Or sometimes it'll be the goofy, corny, jokes she'll tell that I don't find funny. Most of the time I'll try to force a laugh and try to manage a smile of appreciation. Yet sometimes I just can't do it. Sometimes she repeats them over and over if you don't respond. 


Other times, it can be the way she just stares at me when I'm looking down at my phone. Or the way she sounds when she gets irritated. One time I felt annoyed by the way she was half assed dancing while she was cooking breakfast for me. I always get irritated when she starts talking at me, to where I can't get a word in. I dread when she gets overly hyper and excited. The last time I visited her, I realized I couldn't stand her for fifteen minutes. This was the first fifteen minutes of us seeing each other, after not seeing each other in person for three years. I feel like such a cold, heartless, monster. There has been times when she seemed genuinely tender, nurturing and loving. Why don't I like my mom? 

That's part of the reason I don't call her as much. Or go to visit her out of state. I feel disgusted and angry when she asks me to send pictures to her. Of me, my family, ect. I've tried being tolerant, patient and just enduring the visits or calls. I just can't do it anymore without going insane. She's stopped buying the excuses. She's become more demanding, adamant, and pushy about me coming to visit. I don't see a way to tell her the truth without crushing her. Even in the nicest tone, it seems heartless.

Hey guys I don´t know what to do?:

In 2018 I moved abroad with my grandma to Uruguay and it sucks, Uruguay doesn´t suck but my experience here does, it´s really boring, i don´t like food, I don´t have almost any friends and my relationship with my grandma is bad, she´s helping me with the home and food but coexisting is almost impossible, but the only good thing about this place is that i can Study in college whatever i want for free and there are no inscriptions you just sing in and that´s all.

I always wanted to study Medicine, my mom is a doctor and i would love to work with her and I know that that would make her so happy and make worth all the sacrifices that she did for keeping everything working but at the same time I don´t really want to be here and i have the oportunitie to go to Spain but i would not be able to study medicine, i could study anything else but medicine.

I would like to live in Spain because is 100times more developed than Uruguay, i have a ton of friends over there, i could live by my own and do a lot of things and it´s really probable that my family moves there in a few years BUT i´ll not be able to study Medicine :C.

679,"So I'm trying to figure things out. I know it's my decision to make and I have to go with what feels right to me, but I was looking for some help to understand myself better.  

When I was younger for a small amount of time I was attracted to the same sex. I was attracted to boys too but I think I was really into girls. I thought I was a lesbian at like 10, but I grew out of it. Not that I'm saying sexuality is a phase, but I kind of just considered myself straight.  

I experimented with girls but it was simple stuff like kissing and other minor things. I used to play boyfriend/girlfriend with my girl friends and ""sex"" was a part of it, but it really wasnt ""sex"". Just touching and making out.  

In general for most of my life I was attracted to girls, but never had the want to act on it. Maybe it's just admiration.  

I love guys, all of my relationships have been with guys, when I see myself getting married I see a guy, and just in general I love and favor guys way more than girls.  

I watch lesbian porn, but I heard alot of straight girls do.  

I've looked up how to tell if you're into the same sex and what I read based it on if you can see yourself hooking up with the same sex.  

I've thought about it and even though I fantasized about it, when I pictured it as if it was happening right now, I wasnt into it.  
Like if a girl was with me right now and the big moment was going to happen, I felt a little weird. Not grossed out, but uncomfortable.  

Every once in a while there will be a girl who stands out enough that I get a crush on.  
2 actresses, and 1 girl that comes into my job.  
There was a few times I talked about this girl and I felt weird and uncomfortable about it.  Like saying ""she's so hot"" out loud was weird. Or ""I have a crush on her"" was weird.  

I think it's possible for me to fall for a girl, but it would only be a specific type and a specific situation. And I would still want a boyfriend because like I said, I want to marry a guy.  

I think I'm open to exploring this, but my question is if I feel uncomfortable talking about girls, or flirting with girls, and cant vividly see myself with one, would that be a sign I'm not into girls?  

I know theres a spectrum and there doesnt need to be labels, I know you can be straight with bi or gay exceptions, and I know sometimes straight girls get attraction confused with admiration, but I wonder why I'm so confused.  
I'm open to maybe testing it out, like hooking up with a girl to know for sure I guess, but theres questions with that too.  
Like I would be so nervous and I dont even know how to flirt with girls and I think I would feel awkward.  So if I'd feel awkward, that means I'm not into girls but like to admire them?

681,"TL;DR My coworker’s girlfriend thinks it’s my fault he got a bad performance review and has been hostile towards me in the several months since. How do I remedy the situation without bringing personal drama into the workplace?

Backstory: I work for a large company in a very small department. Before I started it was just my boss Annie and my coworker Dave. Annie’s office is in a different part of the building so it was pretty much just Dave unsupervised and he developed some bad work habits (taking extra long lunches, extra breaks, spending a lot of time goofing off, etc). They don’t affect my work so I don’t really care.

Since I started Annie and I have become pretty close and a lot of times she feels comfortable talking to me about people we work with. (I want to emphasize that professionalism is very important to me and I make a point to NEVER contribute to or share any gossip she tells me). Eventually I found out she knows all about Dave’s habits which was surprising since she’s not often in our workspace.


Anyway, our mid-year performance reviews came up in June and Annie confronted Dave and told him to get his act together. Because she’s never around I think he assumed I must have told Annie what he does because afterwards he was kind of cold to me for awhile but everything seems fine now. EXCEPT, he’s dating a girl, Julia, who works in a different department but the same desk area as us and since that review she has been very hostile to me. We see each other a lot and she gives me death glares, when I talk to her she will make eye contact with me and then completely ignore me, and she’s even done things like close a door in my face if I’m going through after her. (Keep in mind this is a woman in her mid-thirties).

684,"Hey everyone,

I'm just going to put it all out on the table. (There is a short TL;DR at the bottom).

Four years ago, my family found out I was trans. Shortly thereafter, my life became a living hell.

After they made it clear they were going to send me to ""conversion therapy"" and had a plane ticket ready to go, I knew it would be within my best interest to go back into the closet and tell them it ""wasn't true"". 

Following that day, my mom called it the ""best day of her life"" and they even celebrated with cake, candles, and a fancy night out.

Since then, I've had to constantly hide who I am and live under this guise of being something I'm not. When I was in school, this wasn't too bad to deal with since I'd be out of the house most of the time, and I could easily change into different clothes once I got there. 

Now, things are different.

I've graduated with a Bachelors of Art in Art and a minor in English and I'm always home. 

My skills and experience are next to none. 

I don't have much of anything to show for my four years of college because my mental health and anxiety were at all time highs (thanks to gender dysphoria), so my record of being there isn't stellar (I do have a 3.3 GPA, though).

The biggest issue of this is - the only way I can finally move out of my family's home and begin transitioning is if I get a job that will allow me to be financially stable and have benefits (ie. medical, dental, vision, etc.)

I've thought of everything under the sun to apply for, but every time I've had experience in it or did freelance work for it, I realized it wasn't a good fit.

I've considered:

* Graphic Design : Working with the Adobe Software doesn't come easily to me and despite being an art major, the learning curve of graphic design is daunting. I've tried my hand at freelance work, but it feels extremely soul sucking.)
* Teaching : I don't do well with kids and/or teenagers despite really liking them. I've worked at a summer camp before and it wasn't a great experience.
* Copywriting : Again, another soul-sucking career. I don't really find a lot of gratification or happiness from writing marketing materials and/or copy to manipulate and sell something to someone.

After dipping my feet into each of these positions and realizing I'm not fit for or am hating the work, I'm finding myself completely hopeless because I feel as if more and more my opportunity of employment is going down the drain if I can't find a career that I'll be happy in.

I know it may seem dumb, but being in a job that I feel happy and fulfilled in is *extremely* important to me. It's almost as important as transitioning and being myself.

That said - I have several options left, and there are pros and cons to each of them.

1) Go into technical writing. The pros? It's a lucrative field with benefits and one that I can possibly get into quickly with my background in writing (although, I'm not 100% tech savvy). The cons? I'm worried it's going to feel soul-sucking. I don't have any experience in it and don't have a portfolio.

2) Go back to school. The pros? Get either another bachelor's degree or an associates degree that can help me get a legitimate job. I'll feel like I have a sense of purpose again and I'll be out of the house. The cons? I'll be stuck at home for another two and a half years, maybe three and that's a *major* con and I feel that any more time here and I'll lose it.

3) Go to a coding bootcamp. The pros? I'll be able to learn and go into a growing, lucrative field. It'll get me out of the house. Most programs are only three to six months long. The job prospects are only growing. The cons? It's extremely expensive. It's a big learning curve, especially since I've never gotten into programming before.

4) Go into college admissions/advising. The pros? It's an easy entry job in that the major experience you need is a bachelors and a familiarity with how college works. I'll be helping other college students. I empathize with the confusion of not really ""knowing"" what you want to do in life and I can leverage that to help others. The cons? It doesn't pay extremely well. There aren't many job openings for this position, especially with where I want to move. If I do chose this path, I'll most likely have to stay at home for a year or two since there are several openings in my hometown. 

5) Figure out another career path I haven't thought of yet. 

I'm really struggling with this and I could sincerely use some advice. 

Do you have any suggestions on what I should do?

Or maybe any ideas of other careers I can consider?

**TL;DR:** I've graduated college with nothing to show for it and a useless degree (Art). I'm stuck at home having to constantly be something I'm not and hide who I am (extremely transphobic family). My only way out is to get a job that pays well and that has benefits but my options are running out and I'm growing thin. Any suggestions or advice?",15Jan2020,1

690,"Me (24F) and my Fiance (24M) have set a date for September 2021, and we have already selected our wedding party. The issue is, I have a girl (24F)  I still don't know whether to include in my wedding mainly because we simply just aren't that close anymore, but also, she (lets call her Sally for identity's sake) cheated on a mutual best friend of ours (lets call him Jake), who is going to be the best man and officiate our wedding ceremony. Sally has always been a little ignorant, but I think it's because of her upbringing. She and Jake (25M) introduced me to my fiance 5 years ago, and since then she has always held it over my head that if it weren't for her, he and I wouldn't have met. She sort of ""claimed"" the spot of MOH, even though I had asked my sister to be mine. After leaving Jake for multiple flings, she still tries to contact my fiance, claiming they were best friends and they chat all the time. My fiance doesn't want her anywhere near our wedding, because of how badly she hurt Jake. I'm now realizing that I might not want her there either, because she was a horrible friend to me back in high school (making fun of my background, belittling choices I make, and just in general being really rude in front of my family and other friends)

Recently, Sally had asked me if I had selected my wedding party yet, and I didn't respond immediately. This is why I'm here. Do I explain to her that I have already selected my wedding party but she is still invited? Or do I not invite her at all? I really don't know what to do here, I'm not exactly a confrontational person, and the only reason I'd want her there is because she did have a hand in introducing me to my fiance. Our guest list is relatively small, less than 80 people and mainly family. As far as our friendship goes, it's more or less of an ""online"" friendship. The kind of friendship where you like each others photos on instagram, and chat maybe once every few months to catch up.

691,"Some background, I'm a 20F currently at uni but at home I live with my mum, gran and younger sister (11). 

(Sorry in advance for the long wafflely post) 
My parents have been together for about 22 years and are still currently together (but not married) and have 2 children together (myself and my sister). My dad was married and divorced before he met mum and has 3 adult children (all over 30) with his previous wife.

My dad does not live with us as he has his own house in the same town as us (that the youngest of his elder 3 lives in) and because of work he lives abroad and visits us once or maybe twice a year for about 2 weeks at a time. 

Around Easter last year my mum left her laptop at home so he could Skype and talk to me and my sister while she was at work, after he didnt call for a while I checked Skype to see if he was online and saw that my mum had some messages from a woman who had my dad in her profile picture. Being naturally nosy I looked at the conversation and realized that he was in a relationship with this woman and had 5 children (between about 15 and 6 years old) who she claims are all his and all carry his surname (my sister and I do not). From looking and the conversation and talking to my mum after it looks like she knew that he had been with other women while he was living abroad but did not realise the full extent of this relationship, however, the other women (OW) appeared to have known about us for a while and seems quite comfortable with my dad being in both relationships. 

When I spoke to my mum about it she explained that she never knew about him having other children but the reason we never visit him abroad anymore is because she feels embarrassed taking us into the same apartment that all these women visit him in (to really salt the wound, a few months after we visited he invited OW and family over and basically had the exact same holiday again. Same restaurants, parks etc.). 

After he found out that OW and my mum had spoken he disappeared from all forms of communication for a month or so but he has now spoken with my mum (and visited in person) and they are working things out as they go along. 

I am the only one of his children that knows any of this. I feel like I should talk to him (and my mum has advised that I do) but I don't even know how to start. My dad and I are not very confrontational people and with him being abroad most of my life we don't have the most open relationship. This among other things has taken a toll on my mental health and it probably is best to just talk but I don't know how.

My friends told me that he said stuff like ""I'm a horrible person"" and so on. He told them that he felt this way because he didn't do the things he told me that he would do. I was OK with this. It really didn't bother me, but it looks like it bothered him a lot. The only thing that bothers me is that he feels like he is a bad person.

But... 2 weeks ago, we got tangled up... and since that, he changed in our relationship.. he no longer said ""I love you / I miss you"" or something... just some hearts, and nicknames (sometimes) 

I told him about the fact that he had changed, but said no, that he didn’t said ""I love you"" at all because he didn't feel the need and it meant nothing if we said it too much, I was so anxious about that and in fear to broke up with him..

Backstory: In one way or another I found myself on this robo call scammers phone list. I would get daily or every other day... or sometimes multiple times a day... robo calls... which would ultimately connect you to a live person (the scammer). I tried so many things, but one thing I heard was to just answer and connect, talk to them and waste their time repeatedly... so in doing so i did connect to a scam caller and I was asking him who he works for, what company he represents, and a callback number when he just flipped and cursed me out and hung up. (that's how I know this is scammers 100%)

Anyways, that was unpleasant. Months go by and I'm trying other things... anti spam apps... anything my local verizon store can recommend. Nothing really helping at all.

The calls repeatedly come in from different numbers, all probably spoofed.

Finally, fed up and on a particularly boring morning with nothing going on. I answered once again and connected... This time I would curse THEM out first!!! the gnastiest I could possibly be... I connect waited a minute or two until someone picked up and they were babbling their scam offer line, I said something to the effect of ""*You know what? f\*\*\* you! You lousy pathetic piece of sh\*t. Karma is a b\*tch and it's coming for you mother f\*\*\*er!!*"" and then I hung up.

A day went by and no call. The next morning another spam call... I connected, waited for them to pickup and start their scam line, and then cussed them out again... this time really going after the fact that this is how they are trying to make money and they are garbage individuals etc.... cussing them out a second time. and hanging up.

Hello. I’m a 22 year old male in uni at the moment. I have dated in the past but due to personal reasons and decisions and time commitment to classes and work, I’ve never had the chance to have sex with someone. It is a little embarrassing that I am 22 and I haven’t done it yet, but it’s also my fault and I accept the decisions that I have made.  

The reason why I bring this up is that now I’ve been dating this really wonderful girl and we both believe that It is heading into something more serious. We had a conversation not too long ago that she would prefer not to have sex with a virgin and prefers someone with experience. I hesitated to tell her my truth and we just went about it.  

She has waited to have sex with me and she wants to do it when she’s ready, which I respect fully. I am ready to lose my virginity to her, but I am afraid she will not like it when she finds out.  

I really like her and I want something serious with her. What should I do? Should I keep it to myself and just wing it when the time comes, or should I tell her immediately or before we have sex?",15Jan2020,1
704,"I am lucky to work at a university and have been pursuing my master's part-time through a university tuition waiver program. Once I finish my last class this semester, I plan to move to a different city to join my boyfriend who moved there earlier last year for a job opportunity he could not pass up. Before he moved this has been our plan: for me to stay and finish school and then join him. I am currently on the job hunt but have not accepted an offer.

I'm just torn when I should tell my boss my intentions. It's possible he has an inkling this is coming but I'm not sure. I work in a pretty small unit and he is aware that I have a longterm boyfriend who moved last year. He also knows that I'm finishing with my master's in the spring. I've been working in my position for several years and I am the only one in my unit who does my job. Things can also run a little slow at a university and I know it's possible that it may take more than two weeks to find a replacement. I feel a bit of guilt leaving after finishing my degree (although there's no amount of time that I have to stay after completing my degree at my institution without paying back). As my supervisor, he had to sign off on giving me permission to receive the tuition waiver so I think that's adding to my guilt.

There's are also several events coming up at the end of the semester and an event coming up this summer that is important for someone in my role to attend and involves buying a plane ticket, registering, and booking a hotel. I don't want to get to the point where he asks I do any of these things knowing that I'm leaving.

I'd be more than happy to stay on as they hire and train my replacement. But it may not be possible to have both of us employed at the same time the way budgeting works. I have a pretty good relationship with him but I'm nervous he may take me leaving negatively. 

When I've discussed this with friends and family, many of them say that I don't owe anything more than two weeks. 

Sorry if this was a bit rambling... Really what I'm asking is when should I tell my boss that I am planning to leave my position in May? Should I tell him when I've accepted a job offer or just give two weeks notice? Any advice is appreciated.",15Jan2020,1

I have a part time job right now and it is awful. This is my 4th job, and I got this one because my dad is a sales manager here. Basically what I do is I run parts to technicians in the shop. The people I work with tell me what part to grab and who to bring it to.

Thats what my job *should* be, anyway.

What actually happens is these people tell me to do shit like “hey xyz can you grab this paper off the printer for me” when its like 10 steps away.. “hey will you grab a case of water and put it in the fridge for me” *out of something* “just have xyz do it, no big deal”

It is a big deal. I run parts, Im not your fucking servant.

Usually these technicians bring their parts to a wall where I usually hang and then I put them away from there. Well, there are a few technicians that don’t do that, but rather call ME to come to THEM and take them back for them. Well, they asked me to take some parts back literally 1 minute before I got off work. So I took back what I could, but the other parts required either multiple people, or I needed a dolly because it’s too heavy. I figured I’d get it tomorrow.

Well guess what, that technician, along with the others that call me to come to them, complain to my manager that “the fact that he ignores us is like him telling us to fuck off” so he told me to make sure I do what they ask. Literally I have never not done that. But now I actually do want to say fuck off to them.

Whenever I am out of sight, the people that tell me to run parts will literally holler my name and then say something along the lines of “where the hell were you, dick?” The dick part is a joke because we fuck around but it’s still humiliating. Because I can’t do shit about it.

Whenever there aren’t parts to run, I’m supposed to be doing busy work, which is basically always, hence the fact that I have time to make this post. But guess what?! That requires me to be out of sight. And whenever I’m in the middle of doing something, they tell me, quote, “fuck what you’re doing, I need you to run this”.  I feel like anything I do here is of utter unimportance. 

My job isn’t even a job. It’s miscellaneous, I’m an accessory. Before I had this job, you know who had it? Nobody. Because my job is fucking pointless. I can’t even think for myself around here. They literally call me over and then tell me “dont go anywhere I’ll need you to run stuff” ok then call me when you fucking need me, not when you WILL need me.

My ex boyfriend, looking out for me, told me about what she said—but asked that I do not say anything about it because that would start conflict at his house with his brother.

I tried to approach my friend and ask her if she still wanted to be my friend. 

I said “when you are around me, you act like you are always annoyed or just genuinely don’t want to be friend, but you don’t want to say it because it would hurt my feelings. I don’t understand what has changed. You used to always make time for me and now I see you are blowing me off a lot.

This is absolutely not in his character...but apparently it was. He said all he saw was red but he’s ashamed and has no excuse. He apologized a couple of times sincerely (not over doing it by crying or begging bc he knows he fucked yo and nothing would take us back and fix it) I stayed the night we didn’t touch eachother...I cried to him “what am I suppose to do?” And he said “whatever you need to, tell whoever you need to, I deserve the punishment) and the next morning he was dressing for work and sat down beside me on the bed and promised me he would never do it again, and vows if he had a second chance with me, he wouldn’t fail.. in my past experience with him, he is a quick learner and when we fix issues in our relationship, he’s was the one telling me to ease up and that he’s safe with him and that we were on the same team. He taught me patience and love and respect so it blows my mind what happened lastnight. He said he was gonna tell the girls in his family and they were gonna cry. And he’s not begging for me to stay because he knows loving me, is letting me go and knowing my worth. He apologized once more this morning..but I don’t know what I should do...mind you he (was) such a good man to me, when I would yell he would calm me down (all of the 6 months) and tell me we were on the same team. I’m just so confused because I KNOW that was out of his character but it doesn’t justify it and I will never know if it will happen again until it does....I said”how do you know you won’t lose control again” and he said “I learn from pain, you touch a stove, you don’t touch it again” but he it already happened and I don’t know if I could ever forgive him or love him the same again......",15Jan2020,1
711,"Here it goes,


I recently accepted a new position, I live in the US,  I haven't taken a vacation in 7 years, I'm 25, that's 7 years of non-stop work, anxiety and grit. 

Back last November, when I was still at my previous company I booked a three week vacation extending over the holidays if 2020, the company shuts down for a week, so really I'd just be taking two weeks, that company also has unlimited PTO. 

Before I accept position at this new company, I ask some current employees if the company shuts down during the holidays for a week and they said yes. So im thinking I'm good to go.

First day I arrive in the office and cordially state to my supervisor 11 months in advance that I will be taking a 3 week vacation. She tells me that the company does not in fact shutdown and that I can take max 1.5, weeks with only one week being paid.  

At this point I need advice

I would like the advice to follow along this criteria:
- I need to get paid while I'm this trip( this is how I planned the trip)
- I will be taking the whole three weeks, no BS shortened version

I also don't care about anybody who feels like they are in a worse position than me. I know Reddit is full of people waiting for the moment where can be like ""Oh well I didn't take a vacation 10 years...blah blah blah...your entitled'. Good for you, cudnt care less.

THESE ARE THE ONLY REQUIREMENTS, IF YOUR ADVICE INCLUDES SACRIFICING ANY OF THE ABOVE POINTS YOUR ADVICE ISNT USEFULL FOR ME.

Im not going to go into my opinions on US vacation policy. Don't have the energy.

Few ideas I've thought of already:
- purposefully making my self redundant/sabotaging the company so I get laid off for ""circumstances beyond my control"" like a redundancy. Then collect unemployment for the 3-weeks/month I'm gone. 
- having one of my doctor friends give me a medical note for 3 weeks off 
- quit my job shortly before 

My default option will be the first. Let me know what your advice is, assuming it meets my criteria.

Thanks!",15Jan2020,1

We really got along and would spend the whole day together if we could, at the same time my girlfriend and her boyfriend were there as well. But for whatever reason I was always so excited to see her and found everything she said interesting and funny, but became bored whenever my girlfriend would say something. Anyways, I know I sound like a horrible person but the more time we spent with each other the more I fell for her and I don’t know exactly how she felt but one of her friends said she “sensed” she felt something similar (she hinted that she told her). Whenever I was with her I felt like a kid again and everyone made jokes that we were split up at birth because we always thought the same thing. Anyways eventually we said our goodbyes and I thought it would be the end of it. Me and my girlfriend moved back into our apartment (been living here for over a year now) and she went back to school with her boyfriend on another continent. We’ve texted here and there but nothing crazy and it’s been nearly half a year now and I still think about her. There is literally no way ever it would work out because of our relationships and the huge distance between us but I still can’t stop thinking about us being together. I really do love my girlfriend and we get along so well it’s crazy, we very rarely argue or fight and got through an entire year of living with each other which I think is impressive for how young we are (18-19). Anyone who knows me knows that I’m a very rational person and pretty much never make emotional decisions so I’m at a loss for why I feel this way. Of course anytime something bothers me I tell my girlfriend but obviously I can’t, and all my friends are too close to her. 

I just wanted to know if anyone’s ever felt something similar or ideas on how to overcomes this? It’s really disrupting my day to day and I hate it. Any suggestions would help, thank you!",15Jan2020,1

The guys has absolutely no work ethic, has been recently talking down to everyone, and now has been making jokes about me behind my back. Everyone has been telling me about all the jokes. 

I have never tried to be a jerk, and because he is my senior worker on my shift, I expect more out of him, and expect him to help guide and show other less experienced people how to do our work. But it's hard to expect a whole lot out of him when he never even shows up for work. 

He keeps trying to give me ""tips"" about how to be a leader. And no one else seems to have any qualms about how I lead my people. He is the only one.

715,"Hi (M19)!

TLDR:
While being autistic as young I was more wanted but with age became less and less to the point that nobody wanted/wants (by their own will, the teacher forced them since I was left out) to work in group assignments with me which takes a toll on my confidence. 

What can I do to become someone others want to pick as their assignment partner or am I fricked 4 lyfe? (Pls read for more context below)


More context:

When I was young I was diagnosed with autism but that made me one of the most popular kids at school it gave me a feeling that I was wanted around everyone close to me. When I got to middle school I was in a special ed class til high school. During those years, I was always left alone in group assignments and it was only me (unless the teacher forced one to be with me). Even tho I got to a normal class in high school, I was still the only one left alone in group assignments, and this made a toll on my confidence. 

Now in college, it’s that time again and I’m still probably gonna be left behind alone (or with one that doesn’t want to work with me), I’ve also all these times asked others if they were interested to work with me but they’ve always declined (except the poor soul that still has to work with me because the teacher forces it too those times which still made me feel left behind)... 

I know I’m not bad looking, (or so I hope at least) but I don’t know what else there can be that could be wrong about me since I’m only looking to be picked by someone... not all and that there shouldn’t be any problems at all when there’s so many (approx 100) in my college class.

Basically, this question  is looking for what I can do to become more attractive as an assignment partner (or is it the start of me becoming an incel).",15Jan2020,1
718,"Hi, I've been with a girl for about a year now and being with her really is a lot of fun.

I do my best to give her time. I stay at their house every Saturday or Sunday for 2 or 3 days. We spend time together, play games and do what she wants. But when I go home, I always have this tremendous expectation from her that I chat/call her. Our chats/calls can last for hours on end although some are no continuous (i.e. I might need to eat, go to the bathroom etc.). When I wake up I have to chat/call her and she expects me to check up on her after doing some stuff etc.

I brought this issue already to her but she keeps on doing it. Whenever I tell her about the issue she would go ballistic! When I told her I need some time for myself she pursued not calling  me and giving me the passive aggressive treatment. I tried telling her how it feels to not have time for myself but she always says that it is part of a relationship's ""communication."" It seems that whenever I bring up the issue it gets 180 deg. turned back to me. She would make it feel like I've abandoned her when I always emphasize that I love her so much.

I've grown tired of arguing with her. Now, I simply do as she says, but I'm not feeling good about it.

 I'm a person who isn't really into texting or calling (introversion I guess). I'd rather spend face to face time with someone. But I am also a person with a lot of interest in woodworking, astronomy, and I have University. It has gotten to a point where the conversations are only happening for the sake of it. Most topics have already been exhausted. And now she's complaining that I am not interested in our conversations.

I want to be with her. Aside from her ""clingy"" nature, she's a very great girl and jives with my somewhat unorthodoxed self. What I said above might be biased against her but I still feel as if it is too much, IDK.

721,"I won't get too into what happened in my childhood, but different things happened that severely impacted the way I feel towards men. I can be super into a guy but as soon as he shows any indication that he wants to be physical with me I'm immediately turned off. The only really enjoyable part of sex is knowing that I'm making the guy happy, otherwise I don't really get anything else out of it. I've only ever been with a couple people, and none of the ""relationships"" lasted longer than 2 months. 

The moment a guy starts making physical advances I just shut down and let it happen, I think mostly because I think it's what ""should"" happen even though I don't feel any real connection to what's going on.

I like the idea of getting married to a guy and having kids someday in THEORY, I love kids, but when I actually think about it the thought of actually living with another person, being intimate with them every day for the rest of my life, having a human being grow inside of me, it's absolutely terrifying. I don't feel lonely living alone, but my friends and family say it's just because that's what I'm used to. 

My mom says I'm just picky and eventually I'll find a guy and settle down and have kids, but also that I can't expect to immediately feel a strong connection to a guy until I'm with him awhile. 

Things just feel so forced, but I know it all stems from what I experienced as a child and the different feelings I had from 14-19. I don't think I'm gay since I'm also scared of the idea of being sexually intimate with a woman.

728,"I am a sophomore in college and have lived in an apartment with three other girls since my freshman year. There, I met my best friend, with whom I developed a really close relationship almost instantly because of all the things we had in common. 

Last semester, she confessed to me that she had been fooling around with MY male best friend (who is also our neighbor), and everything was fine up to that point. At the beginning I felt slightly betrayed, but after a while I just let it go, and everything returned to normal. Or so I thought. 

After she confessed that to me, I went to talk to him. He explained everything and told me that he had been thinking about ending things with her because she was clearly falling for him and he did not want that. A week or so later, he called me saying that he had talked things with her and that everything was over. 

She called me as well, and seemed slightly chill about it. My male best friend, since he had ended things with her, required more of my attention (he lives alone) so I gave it to him. Soon after, my best friend started hanging out more with this other girl we live with, whom she had criticized SO MUCH (because the girl likes to party a lot) and had even alluded to her being a slut (because she was hanging out a lot with my best male friend— and she is also kind of promiscuous). 

One night, after the other girl had an unnecessary break down about this other guy (she was just being dramatic), my best friend tried being supportive and whatnot. I told her to stop being there for her because she only wanted attention (it’s not the first time she did something like that) and that she would get over it. I also told her to stop trying to help people that fucked her over (the other girl had talked shit about my best friend a few weeks past) and she began ranting, saying that everyone in the apartment (including me) was toxic and that we all had shit. Then, I told her that she could not compare that girl to me because, despite that I do have issues, I had known her for an extra year (the other girl moved in past August), and she knew that I would never betray her. Instantly, she said that I couldn’t be sure about that (which is bullshit) and started talking about this invisible barrier she has made to hide from everyone (which is also bullshit). She also stated that people I HAVE NEVER MET have told her how the apartment we live in is a toxic one and whatnot. 

That last bit confused me greatly, because how can someone that has never visited the apartment think so lowly of it?

And then it hit me. 

She’s playing the victim and talking shit.

This is not the first time people have confronted me about the things that happen where we live, or made a comment about it. Hence, I have come to the conclusion that she has a lot of faces. 

I even talked to my male best friend about it and he said that her toxicity is the main reason he could never see her as a woman and had to end it with her. He also said that he doesn’t want to be associated to my best friend ever again. 

She changed a lot— and honestly, I’m unsure if it’s directly related to my male best friend not reciprocating feelings, or if she had been like this all along. Now she goes and hangs out with the other girl (they are constantly getting drunk together) and has made a lot of comments about wanting to lose her virginity this year. Mind you, the girl I befriended was basically a saint— she hadn’t even had a first kiss yet. She still is a 4.0GPA student but her personality is so different now that I really wish I hadn’t met her to begin with. 

And honestly, after all this mess, every time I see her messages or even think that I have another semester left living with her... I get annoyed. I was planning on talking things through with her, but at this point, I am convinced it’s not worth it. 

Am I being too judgmental? Should I try confronting her? Did I misinterpret this entire situation?",15Jan2020,1

She then proceeds to say how the dog is the only one who one won't leave her. I'm taken back at this but go along with it. She continues to praise the dog while I try to go get my keys. She then complains about how I'm leaving and how we're all so eager to leave her because we think she's crazy. She compares me to my mother and uncle (which I see as a huge insult.

I stand there and listen to her continue to berate me and compare me to my mom. After she's done, I go get my keys. Before I leave, she stops me. Tells me that I better not screw up at school or she was going to make sure I get sent straight home and go to the local community college. I apologize for what I said and she gives me a stiff hug.

They are both in their mid 50s and just recently went thru their second divorces... and are now on the dating scene for basically the first time in their entire lives. They’ve both been in only 3 relationships (including the high school sweethearts that they did not marry), and both got married the first time when they were 19 and immediately got married after that... so no time in there to really “find themselves” until now. 

They have kind of been “wingmen” for each other except my mom doesn’t really need a wingman. In the words of the BFF, men just come straight up to my mom and in my opinion, it’s all about confidence. However, I think the average man may find my mom more attractive. Either way, BFF is pretty discouraged about this. I can totally relate. My sister has always been the hotter, taller, skinnier (and blonde) version of me so I’ve always been overlooked by men but I could care less. But the best friend is adorable, funny, witty, and super smart. She just doesn’t put herself out there and quite frankly after a 30 year, terrible marriage doesn’t know how and doesn’t really know her confidence. 

What do you do you tell the woman that feels a little less than her best friend/wingman? That may feel less attractive and less confident? She really wants to date for the first time in her life but she’s really discouraged by the entire thing.

737,"My story- I am 19m going on 20, who grew up in a terrible town full of mostly terrible people. Riddled with drugs of all types and people of the worst kind. Though of course there are still good people here and there. I was blessed and fortunate enough to be born into a loving and caring family, free of drugs (for the most part) no bad divorces, we always had enough money to get buy. I’ve had a good family life. When I was little I was always surrounded by the kids my family knew and were friends with, so of course by the time I got into middle school I was eventually well associated with those who were less fortunate in my area. I eventually became very good friends with a lot of them, I wasn’t snobby or looked down on any of them. Eventually as time went on into my high school years I had a very very small set of friends. One of my best friends by this time was Johnny, he’s the same age as me. He was about as poor as you could get. His family lived in the poorest part of town. Not only the poorest but the most drug riddled area. They were surviving entirely on the welfare system, food banks, and his fathers drug money. This continues to this day. In terms of social life there’s nothing around here. And I when I say nothing, I mean nothing but drugs. Most of the women are back woods whores whom I do not associate myself with. (we’re in the south btw), and there’s no long term stable jobs. My life has been a train wreck for a few years because I’ve had no clue what I’m going to do in life.

I was at one time a die hard American patriot, but not as much now. Now to my friend. I’ve tried to help my best buddy get out of his correct predicament. He’s way worse off then me. He’s clean of drugs thankfully, He’s pretty obese, has no money, no social life whatsoever. He doesn’t come out of his house except once a week if that. And even then he doesn’t walk more than 10 feet from his house. And he has no intention whatsoever of trying for a better life. Although he’s my good friend he’s also the laziest person I’ve ever met. He wants everything done for him and blames ALL of his problems on anyone and anything but himself. I offered to hang out with him and teach him some new language skills and even offered to pay his way to Europe with me. But he won’t even pick up a pencil or paper. The only thing he’ll pick up is a gaming controller. I’m at a point in my life where I don’t think I can go on dealing with people like him. This town I’m in is on the verge of taking my sanity. I wish I could explain how bad it is.. I live in a pretty nice neighbourhood on the outskirts and I still can’t even take a walk or jog without stepping on at least 3 heroin needles. (I’m seriously not exaggerating.) Here’s my main question- Should I just worry about myself and leave this place in the dust, never looking back. Or try to help my best buddy who seems to want change but is not willing or is too lazy to help himself? I really need to good advice. 

Thank You.",15Jan2020,1
740,"I’ve went to planned parenthood already, every planned parenthood in my state is covered by my insurance except exactly one, which just so happens to be the one that has abortion services as well. I went to get an IUD but they couldn’t put it in me without an ultrasound due to my cervix shape. The only one with an ultrasound happens to be the one clinic that provides abortion and is conveniently out of network for my insurance. Every place I’ve called (PCPs, OBGYNS, and women’s clinics) say they can’t get me in for at least 2 months. 

I am honestly freaking out. I need a long term solution for birth control as me and my fiancé do not want kids at the moment. We use condoms but I feel safer having a second method in place as well. I can’t afford out of pocket birth control so if anyone has any advice to give I would greatly appreciate it, no matter how small or big that advice may be. Thank you so much in advance",15Jan2020,1

All I want is what I need

Some walls and a roof to myself, its contents consisting of simply the essential amenities (a/c, plumbing, electricity), even if it were confined to a closet's scale, with a job to fund it, one requiring as little time and effort as possible so as to spare me time and energy for my hobbies and interests which would, themselves, require little funding (and are also something I wouldn't want to financially depend on) , fueled by a simple healthy diet.

Is this viably achievable without catching myself in the conventions of adulthood (Debt, ""The 9-5"")?

I've looked to alternatives (Tiny/Van homes etc.) but they all depend on the what cannot be certain (breaks from ""Johnny Law"", generous land owners, climate, road security, accommodating jobs, manual maintenance) all of which would never leave my mind

I want it cleared for what really matters: my health, my relationships and my happiness

How do I achieve this? What jobs should I be looking for? Should I give “the alternatives” another shot? What do you think? What. Will. It. Take?

Thank You!",15Jan2020,1
743,"Some back story- my SO and I have been together for over three years now and I care for him very much. He has told me in the past that he used to struggle with anxiety really Bad and that a past relationship of his caused him to develop a really bad panic attacks. He doesn’t really talk about his past much and I am not one to pry information out of people. 

He’s also a very proud hard-working man who I’m not sure if he’s comfortable sharing very vulnerable details about his mental health with anyone really. And for a while I thought he was maybe just a more reserved person About his feelings. But now I’m starting to worry that something caused him to not want to be vulnerable anymore.

Lately I’ve noticed that he doesn’t do anything. Over the past year he gave up one of his biggest hobbies and passions in his life which was photography. He’s so stressed out over work that he comes home tense every day from it. He was playing a lot of video games but even now recently he kind of just lays in bed. And I’m really worried.  

One time I wanted to have a conversation with him about this and I texted him if we could talk tonight. And I’m an idiot and that just turned into him having a complete panic attack throughout the day and when it came time to the conversation I tried to just make it seem not as serious as it was because I didn’t want to go into the conversation with him already tense. So I kind of just change the topic up the conversation to me needing to vent about something that happened at work that wasn’t even that serious. 

The thing that really started to make me worry that his anxiety was getting really bad again, was we were cleaning out the room and I found an old prescription bottle for Xanax. A medication that was prescribed to him maybe 5/6 years ago. There were only two pills in it and the pills were kind of crushed. I just said “hey I’m throwing this away these look old. “ and he kind of panicked. He yet kind of snatched them for my hands and put the two pills back in the bottle. I asked him if he thinks he would need them. And said that if he feels like he needs them we should try to get him a new prescription because these two don’t look safe to take anymore. And he kind of just didn’t say anything and took the bottle and put it away somewhere. 

I looked at this as some kind of emergency panic attack back up plan that he needed to feel safe. I don’t want him to take those expired Xanax pills Because they are just super old and look like they got wet at some point. And I want him to maybe see another doctor about getting a new prescription of something. 

He comes home from work so tense and stressed that I don’t want to just bombard him with this conversation. But I also don’t quite know what to say I want to help him and remind him that I would never judge him. But also remind him that if he is struggling being open about your problems won’t make me right away. 

So I need help figuring out when and how to even start this conversation. We normally have Saturday afternoons together and Sundays off together. But then I would kind of just feel guilty about ruining one of our weekend days. We have a good communication in a relationship, and I’ve talked about my own mental health struggles with him before. But he’s always asked me about myself and my problems because I don’t think he’s comfortable talking about his own. 

I deal with my own mental health problems and I’m not very good at helping others with their’s. I’m also really bad at picking up on social cues and body language. So I am kind of spiraling myself because I don’t know how long he’s been struggling and if I’ve just been completely oblivious to it. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated.",15Jan2020,1
744,"Hi guys so I just got this little composter and need some advice on how to get started. I live in a small apartment with a really tiny back yard. 

I was wondering if you could give me some advice on how to get started since I live in Arizona. I have a couple of questions I'll post down below

Is it possible to throw dirt in to start it with some twigs? I have a bag of dirt unused so could I use that instead to Start? 

What are some items beyond a Google search that I could throw in? 

What are items that are not something to throw in besides dairy products and fat? 

What are some good ways to prevent it from Stinking? Or to reverse a oops just in case?

Is there any larger buckets I could use that would be a alternative, like say a storage tub with holes drilled on the lid? 

If I can't get worms, is there other stuff I could use to help speed the process? 

Thanks in advance. If you have any other ideas on what I can use as a alternative for a larger compost that can fit in my tiny backyard that would be welcomed. Or food I can throw in. Thank you!",15Jan2020,1
745,"Hey reddit,

So recently I picked up a nannying job for a family with a 9 year old who has severe ADHD and behavioral problems. In and of itself, this is no issue to me, just a part of the job

What I need help with is trying to get him to do his homework. His mom gave me 1 job with him, and that's doing his homework as soon as he gets home. The first day, I got him to do it after about half an hour of wheeling and dealing. Yesterday, however, he wanted to play on his switch when he got home. I took it, because it's his mom's rule  that hw has to be done before any electronic use. This led to an hour of screaming and crying and me just leaving him to cry himself out. At that point, I had to leave for another obligation, so I have no idea if he ever got his work done or not. 

Obviously, this situation isn't tenable. I can't (and shouldn't have to) deal with an hour of crying every day just to get him to do 10 minutes of homework. Reddit, do you have any tips I could use to try to help with this? Opinions of parents of children with similar issues would be especially valuable.",15Jan2020,1
746,"So recently my dad and wife took a period of separation after almost 10 years of marriage and were on the rocks of divorce. While this is bad for them, it's such a positive event because of how shitty she treats him and mentally and emotionally abuses him. Now, at first he was like ""yeah it's 95% pretty much over"" and now since they've been talking I've asked him periodically if it's 100% for sure over and most recent he's said is ""its up to her"". I'm unsure if that means its her decision to file for divorce because she started the want for separation. Or if that means he wants to get back with her but she has the ultimate say. That's the answer I'm afraid is true. The wife is a problem also in the fact that she literally hates my sibling and I as his children. There's way too much back story to back that up but it is what it is. Following the decision for separation he made a new bank account, stopped payroll from entering their joint account, took his name off all the bills he could, and finally changed his passwords. Unfortunately she means a lot to him so her words I feel could win him back because of how emotionally and mentally toxic and manipulative she is. I told him I was gonna be seeing him in person in roughly two months and he was gonna get himself set up at a hotel somewhere for a fresh start by then. All of these comes down to the part where I need advice... This is truly the best decision to get him so much happier and not nearly as depressed as he was. How do I convince him he doesn't need her, that there's better matches for him out there and he **can** live without her? The small bit of back story was needed to understand the reasons behind the situation. Any advice would be appreciated xoxo

747,"Good evening,

first of all - we have two houses, one where we live most of the time and one where we spend our holidays for two weeks twice a year. My uncle (brother of my father) and his wife have the spare keys for the second one, so they can have access to it in case of emergency. 

So basically my mom accused my uncle and aunt of stealing diverse stuff from our second house. It began last summer, where my mom noticed that a blanket‘s missing, which isn‘t that much of a deal. Then some bags for cosmetics were missing, which were not quite cheap. And then a pressure cooker, which my sister bought with her first paycheck for my mom. But we eventually brushed it off.

Fast forward last winter holidays we visited our uncle and his wife. My mom noticed that the same pressure cooker, which got lost, stood in the kitchen of our relatives. She didn‘t say anything, because she didn’t want to create an uncomfortable atmosphere. We visit them quite often during holidays and each time my mom noticed more and more lost stuff showing up in their house. She knew what was going on.

Fast forward again my mom encouraged herself and told my dad about this. Of course he brushed it off as a coincidence. When things heated up my dad straight up told my mum that she’s lying and that she should’ve told him the day she noticed. Now he wants to directly confront my uncle and his wife.

I really love them, but I guess there’s no way around it? Is there any way to ask them, without them thinking that we would hate them?",15Jan2020,1
748,"Back in late 2018, I got harassed by a coworker. This wasn’t his first time getting in trouble for it, although with the other times, it was different scenarios. It got so bad once, the courts were involved. I was scared the first day it happened. After that, I went to my manager. He did nothing. The next day I threatened to go to HR, but said manager forced me to talk to the manager above him. Since I was assertive about it, they finally had HR contact me. They didn’t do anything. They’d make excuses and ignore me, pretty much. Guess what? That prick sill has his job. That messed with me. It’s now 2020, and it’s been bothering me, and now that there’s a situation involving me havin to go to EAP. Part of it has to do with that situation. HR got a hold of me. I brought up it up, saying how that’s part of the reason why I feel the way I do, because no one listens. I got smart with them, and they still had no answer. They just turned it around on me.

750,"Like the title says I’m 26 years old, unemployed, and my life is heading nowhere. I had a job as a medical scribe earlier in 2019 and I hated it, mostly because it was a lot of work for minimum wage. I’ve also worked retail and I hated that as well. I told myself when I quit the scribe job this past summer that I would use the time to study for the MCAT and possibly look for a job that I might actually like. I have don’t neither. 

I told my mother today that I might not end up applying to med school and she freaked out. It’s like she only wants me to be a doctor for bragging rights. Tbh I probably wouldn’t have gotten in anyway with my 3.0 undergrad gpa. I told her that I had a job in the hospital and I hated it. I saw what the doctor does all day and it’s a lot of boring paperwork. Plus, I find hospitals depressing as hell. She asked me what I’m gonna do instead and I told her i don’t know yet and that I might go back to school or I’ll try to get a research position and she freaked out even more. I can’t win. Truth be told, I don’t really have much confidence in what I can do if I don’t go to medical school either.

I have social anxiety and while I can somewhat fake confidence to an extent, it’s really difficult for me and it drains every bit of energy from my body. My anxiety is so bad that I didn’t even have friends until I met some at the retail job I had 2 years ago. I eventually dropped them from my life because I decided that hanging out with them was emotionally draining and I didn’t really value their company. I’ve never even had a girlfriend and the first girl I’ve kissed was a girl I met for a hookup off bumble about a month ago. That was a disaster (to put it lightly, my anxiety made me unable to “perform”).  Not really looking for advice on this right now, since I know I probably need to get my life sorted out before I can think about sharing a life with another human. 

I don’t know what I’m doing with my life. My job prospects with a bachelors in biology are far and few, especially since I didn’t put any effort into getting lab experience as an undergrad. My anxiety also makes it hard to sell myself in interviews, especially for non lab jobs, such as consulting jobs where interpersonal skills are must. 

It’s all very exhausting to think about. I mean what am I even doing with my life? I have nothing to look forward to, no money, I’m 100k in debt from an education that I basically squandered. I would honestly kill myself if I didn’t have my family’s feelings to worry about. 

What do I do? Do I go back to school and get a masters degree in something unrelated? Do I keep trying to get a job? Do I bite the gullet and please my mom by taking the mcat and applying to med school?",15Jan2020,1

752,"When I was a junior in HS I got addicted to this online game. 

I was a horny teen (gross) and I  started talking to this guy who played my character's father. 

He was 40 and lived in another country. I was 16 or 17. His wife died of cancer a few years before that. I have no reason not to believe this given the convos we had and the photos he showed me. 

Fast forward to us having an online relationship outside the game. Then he planned to visit. He asked me if he should pack condoms. I say yes.

Legally 17 is of an age to consent in several states (not mine). I didn't tell anyone. I went to the hotel and met him. My parents thought I was staying at a friend's house. 

To sum it all up, we kissed, ate food, and during this time I realized I had no actual feelings or attraction to him. My addiction to the game had warped my perception of things.

So I pulled the ultimate dick move. I told hm I was going to the car to get a jacket. I drove home. 

The next day I called him and said.. sorry? I don't even know what there was to say. I spoke to him months after that when I reached out to him to apologize again.

It's been over 15 years. I started thinking about all this again. I want to know:

- was I the jerk?
- was it ok for him to try to be with me? Given the age gap
- should I try to find him and reach out to him? 

If so, what do I say? Now that I'm 31, and he could be a dad, I kind of just want to ask ""what the fuck were you thinking?"" I also just want to talk about it. My memory is fuzzy. 

TBH I already found him online but I can't find his real email, can't be sure of his name, and I can't yet find any way to reliably contact him. But I found his locked Twitter profile, and some random accounts under his game handle. No response yet when I tried to message.

Should I put this whole saga back in the closet and just forget it and move on?",15Jan2020,1

I ignored it because it seemed like she was becoming more sexually curious and I had gone through the same thing in high school and I always wished I could explore without anybody bothering me. So if i heard anything that sounded like it I’d put my earphones on and everything was fine. But I thought she would eventually “calm down” or get better at hiding it but if anything shes getting bolder and doesn’t even wait until I “fall” asleep. Now I feel like I waited too long and if I told her to stop I don’t want to feel embarrassed about the situation because then she’ll know that I knew all along. 

Im weird with privacy and things involving sex so it gives me more anxiety than I’d like. I’m scared to even start this conversation and I really want to brush it off but it makes me super uncomfortable. It’s like hearing your sibling do it AND you’re in the same room!

me(24M) a good friend (25F) and a couple other germans from my uni will be attending an american (state: wisconsin) university in the 2020 fall- and 2021 springsemester. As tuition fees are what they are in the US, we were told that we can save some money on rent, if we try to find living arrangements off campus and maybe share an apartment with americans or fellow german exchange students. However, we would need to be safe to have some kind of accommodation in the US before crossing the atlantic, since as soon as we arrive in the US classes will start. 

We would really appreciate some advice and tips (feel free to message me links to websites), since we have no idea how renting (especially fixed-term/temporarily) works in the US (regulations etc) and what websites we would have to search on.
We would be very thankful, if you have any experience you could share: 
what to look out for, what some redflags are and how to go about the process of interviewing and contract-entering with the future roommates or the landlord from 4,300miles (6,900km) away.

760,"So basically I’m just looking for insight, if this seems normal. 
My son is 5 and started kindergarten this year. All has been well, he enjoys it. Some background on my son, he’s very sweet, listens to me well, I have always said I hit the baby jackpot because he’s just been a very easy child to deal with. 
Now when he started school his teacher felt he needed some additional help with things like learning to write, read, etc, so he has a helper that comes in and helps him and other kids. Absolutely great! 

Then she felt he needed to see a speech pathologist. I didn’t really get that one, I feel he talks completely normal for a 5 year old. But sure! Why not. Speech pathologist came and determined all was well. 

Then his teacher asked if a physical therapist could observe him in gym because he had trouble jumping rope and didn’t always want to run laps... okay.... I mean he’s 5, I remember not always wanting to run and he’s never jumped rope before. 

Now she wants him to be observed by a psychologist at the school because he needs additional prompting, is usually the last to line up and “do things” 

I’m all for it whatever is good for my son but at this point I’m like, really? Learning wise, he’s doing fine, per his teacher. I just know my kid and don’t see him having this many issues? When I talk to him he doesn’t really know what I’m talking about. 
I’m not against it per se I just feel like it’s unnecessary? But I also recognize I’m not his teacher and I don’t see what he’s like at school. Does this seem like a lot for a kid in kindergarten/school in general or could my son actually be this “difficult” for his teacher?",15Jan2020,1

762,"I (27M) am engaged to my fiancee (26F), the wedding is set late 2020. We've been dating since 2011. I wish I could give a reason for why I'm where I am today, but to be honest, it feels like I floated here. I know early on we were crazy about eachother. Every time we were together it was like a chemical reaction going off and there was no stopping it. College happened, we hurt eachother, became codependent. After college issues persisted. About a year ago I proposed, and shortly after realized what was really going on, and began working hard at breaking our codependancy.

There are a lot of questions I still dont have an answer to. What do I want to do as a career? Do I want a family? Do I need/want sex as much as I thought I did? What kind of friendships do I want? Do I believe in marriage? Do I even believe in monogamy?

Lately I've been freezing up on the stupidest and simplest things. I'll take 2 hours to choose a restaurant for a date. Today I've spent over an hour mentally deciding if I want to rock climb tonight or go to a meetup event and meet new people, and still haven't decided.

While spinning in my head, I've been trying to keep a straight face and act as if I have a clear direction forward. Recently I've been so in my head, I haven't been able to be present with my fiancee, friends, or family. It's gotten to the point where I can't fathom what I will do each evening, and will often spend a lot of time in silence. To make this less weird I've been working out, rock climbing, and running a lot so that I can just focus on a task directly in front of me and not go crazy. I haven't felt sexual desire towards her or anyone for a couple months now. I used to want sex multiple times a day, every day. The only times where I break out of my head and am in the moment with her is when I'm drunk. I struggle a lot with the concept of time. Why hang out for 30 minutes with a friend if we could hang out for 8 hours? Why hang out at all? Why not see eachother every day? Why not see eachother once a year? Should I build okay relationships with 10 friends, or build deep ones with 3 friends? It's all temporary either way.

She's amazing. She's attractive, loves me like crazy, is career driven, and has a passion for life. I used to put her on a pedestal. Now that I've taken her off of that pedastal I still appreciate her, but am able to cut her a lot more slack mentally. I realize now that all of this is on me.

I want to raise a family, one day. If I could grab a magic wand, I would undo time, break up with her 5 years ago, and go back and focus on being an individual. I could do this marriage thing, but I want to have a solid foundation and to be able to invite someone into my life and intentionally fit them into it. Right now I have a person and am trying to build a life around it. I think I might just go crazy if I don't break out of these mental loops.

My lack of action is only making this weirder and harder with time. We've seen a couples therapist. I guess we could go back? I hired an accountability coach for building self discipline, I could somehow use him? I'm seeing a personal therapist right now once a week.",15Jan2020,1

My coworker asks if I can handle it but I said she should probably be there because we are presenting to a group she is assigned to. I say that to her and things start to get weird. We are going back and forth what seemed likely calmly about what the group does and who the group is assigned to. She kept saying it's ""our group"" not ""her group."" Eventually things were getting too confusing over text so I decided to call her. She didn't pick up but called back about 20 minutes later. I try to discuss on the phone what we were discussing via text when I notice her voice is raised at me. She is sorta of yelling at me and seems angry. Which made no sense because I was just trying to figure out the plan. I call her out for yelling at me by just saying ""dude chill out. I am just trying to have a conversation."" Then she goes off at me, yelling even more, saying it was dumb for me to tell her to chill out because I should know that telling someone to chill out/calm down is not the way to deescalate someone. She threw some F bombs in there, I didn't even get to say anything after I told her to chill out. She just yelled, cursed and then hung up on me. I was really caught off guard because nothing I said should have caused her to react that way. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right after she hung up on me, I text her:

""NAME, that was so so rude of you to talk to me like that. I got on the phone trying to have a simple, calm conversation with you but as soon as I got on the phone you your voice raised at me. My understanding was that you had taken LIST OF GROUPS (by choice), and then some of the other little random groups. It was just a few months ago that you had taken the GROUP NAME HERE. I assumed you also had GROUP NAME HERE. I am not sure why that was so upsetting and if you disagreed you could have said it calmly on the phone to me. Instead you raised your voice for no reason and dropped the F bomb. If you have something personal going on this morning that’s upsetting you, I am happy to take the lead on this presentation. But don’t just dump it on me with no explanation and an attitude bc you forgot about it. I did not deserve that attitude at all. And you are right, saying “chill out” to someone who is clearly upset is not the right decision but your attitude completely caught me off guard as when I picked up the phone that was not what I was expecting from you at all.""

&amp;#x200B;

This happened Monday, obviously now it's Wednesday. Wednesdays are our office days so I knew I would see her today. I absolutely hate drama so I made it a point to stay away from my desk and book other small offices to work out of. I had a feeling she wouldn't apologize considering she had 2 days to respond to me. For the most part I have been away from my desk but there have been a few moments I had to go to my desk. She said ""Good Morning"" and I said ""God Bless You"" when she sneezed and that was about it. I had a meeting with our boss this morning and I asked her who had this ""group."" It turns out it wasn't actually assigned to anyone (it's very small) but we talked about it and she understood why I thought my coworker was assigned to the group. We decided I would take this group and another small group that my coworker had. I don't mind and I am glad this is now clarified. I decided to let my coworker know and to try and clear the air, I would write her an email. So around 11:45am today I sent this email (apologies as it's pretty long and I am deleting any identifying info):

""Good Morning NAME,

I think there was some major misunderstanding and I want to clear the air about Monday. Being the obsessive, anxious human I am, I have thought a lot about our conversation the past few days. Iam much clearer with my thoughts in writing hence this email. 

My View of Events:

On Monday, I got to LOCATION and saw on my calendar that we had this presentation with the GROUP NAME I had clearly forgotten about. I texted you, because for the life of me, I couldn’t remember who the GROUP was and what they needed from us after being out for so long. You asked if I could handle it and I definitely could have, but in my head I thought you were assigned the GROUP and figured you should probably be there too so they know who they are emailing when the time comes.

Why did I think you had the GROUP? You have the GROUP and recently took the GROUP too (I think?). Once I was able to remember what the GROUP did, I thought they were considered GROUPS since technically that’s what they are.

We did some back and forth trying to clarify what the GROUP was and who had them over text. I figured it would be easier to work out who had who over the phone but at first you didn’t pick up. When you called me back I tried to have a conversation with you about who the GROUP was and who had them. Then I noticed that your voice was raised at me which was super confusing since I thought we were just having a normal conversation. When I realized that your voice was raised, I tried to get you to calm down. Of course I know saying “dude chill out” is not the way to get someone to stop raising their voice at you…but in the moment, and of course being completely caught off guard, those are the words that came out of my mouth. Please understand that when I got on the phone with you, I didn’t understand why you seemed angry with me.

For the life of me I cannot think of what I could have done to deserve the yelling, cussing, and hang up. Especially from a colleague. One that I respect and enjoy working with. It was honestly really hurtful. I am having a hard time letting go of the fact that you treated me so poorly, and then ignored me when I tried to talk to you about it.

I apologize if I said something to make you feel disrespected. I mean it with all my heart, I was just trying to figure out the plan for the presentation. I wasn’t saying anything purposefully or knowingly in a disrespectful way. Perhaps you were annoyed with me for thinking you had a GROUP assigned to your caseload when you didn’t think you did?

Today, I asked BOSS who had the GROUP. She didn’t know off the top of her head so we pulled up the GROUP POC document. Turns out no one was assigned the GROUP. She asked me if she could assign them to me as well as the GROUP. I mentioned that I thought she had assigned it to you a few months ago, but I was happy to take it anyway. So now you know, I have taken the GROUPS. I meant no disrespect by implying you had them. I legitimately thought you had them, as mentioned in Paragraph 3. So I apologize for getting that wrong, however, I feel strongly that even though I got that piece wrong, I did not deserve to be yelled at, cursed at and hung up on.

I know this is a long email, and you probably aren’t even thinking about Monday. I just need to clear the air and not feel awkward holding in my feelings sitting next to you. If you would like to, I am in Room # from 11:30-1:00pm if you want to finish this discussion in person. I am really not great at confrontation so I’ve kind of just been trying to hide. I think this is why my thoughts via writing are much more clear than in person during confrontations. However, I would be more than fine to talk in person with you once you’ve read through this.

END EMAIL""

She hasn't responded and I know she saw it as I had to go by my desk and she was on my computer. We are never THAT busy. I now regret sending that email. And I am ticked. I have given her 2 opportunities to apologize or at least explain herself. We are professionals and we aren't friends. I am not sure how she can possibly think it's okay to treat me that way, especially in a professional environment! On top of that she is almost 20 years older than me, and she is acting like a 13 year old. 

Does anyone have any advice? I don't want to tell HR or my boss because I don't want to me known as the office tattletale. Plus it would just make things even more awkward if I got anyone else involved.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR; My coworker yelled at me, cussed at me, and hung up on me for no good reason. I've confronted her via text and email (2x) and she hasn't given me any explanation or apology.",15Jan2020,1
765,"My family and I moved into our current apartment in Austin, TX last April. Everything was great up until about 2 months ago. A family moved in upstairs and it has been absolute hell ever since. We have a 5 year old daughter and a 7 week old daughter. The day after we came home from the hospital with our youngest is when they moved in. At first we gave them the benefit of the doubt and figured all the noise was from them moving furniture or something, but that wasn’t the case. Every day from early morning til sometimes as late as 1am, their kids are running back and forth through their apartment. They stomp so heavily that it shakes our walls, light fixtures, and fans. Initially we called 311 to report the noise since we didn’t know what else to do. They sent officers out a few times but nothing changed. We’ve been working with the assistant manager in the apartment office, and she has been in contact with them, telling them to keep it down, etc. But of course nothing has changed. It’s to the point where it’s unbearable to be home and we don’t get a moment of peace in our own apartment. Our 5 year old is in kindergarten and can’t get to sleep at her bed time, and our 7 week old can’t nap properly from all of their stomping/running. Also worth mentioning that there’s a language barrier so we can’t just go upstairs and talk to them ourselves. We’ve never had to deal with a situation like this before and at this point we’re considering breaking our lease and moving elsewhere. Any advice is appreciated!",15Jan2020,1

769,"My entire department at work was shut down and we were all laid off without any notice this morning.

There were only eight of us, plus two managers, and our job required us to work in teams of two all day so we all were very close.

(She works in a bar)

Her drinking goes like this, weekly shop 2-4 bottles of wine, that she will drink in that one night, 

After she finishes work she might have a glass of wine or two while waiting for me to pick her up, but she will also bring home 1-2 bottles of wine like 4 days of the week and drink them that night. 

If my dad bring home any type of alchohol, she will drink it in the night. For example dad bought home a 16 pack of corona from a bbq he went to. (Mum doesnt even like corona) she drunk 10 of the 16 bottles in the night. 

All together i think she drinks 5 out of the 7 day week (waking up with hangover or even still drunk sometimes)

What do you guys think is this a major issue? Or normal? I dont drink so its kinda hard to tell if its an issue or not. 

Do you think its time to get her help?

I asked my friend, ""you sure u wanna bring him along?"" ""Its his choice, I'll be in the middle if things start up""

778,"Hi all, I’m a sophomore in college feeling very lost and on the verge of mental breakdown. I applied to transfer to 1 school in the fall (should have applied to more) and then turned it down when I got in because I didn’t feel ready emotionally/mentally (panic attacks before I was supposed to leave) and wasn’t 100% sure about going because it’s across the country in a state I have never visited, doesn’t have a traditional campus, and I’ve heard from many people that it is difficult socially. Now I’m back at my original school feeling miserable as ever and regretting my decision to stay, although I know it was the right decision at the time, mentally/emotionally. I’m so scared that my mental health is just going to deteriorate throughout the semester. What should I do?

1) call the school I got into and ask if there’s any way they can re-enroll me 
2) ask the school I got into to defer to fall and then go home for a semester 
3) ride it out where i am right now and then reapply to transfer to more schools in the Spring
4) go home and do CC for a semester while also reapplying to transfer schools (this would save a TON of money which is great especially because if i had to take an extra semester at a new school it would be fine, and I could go back to the old school if I didn’t get in anywhere).

779,"I am 30 years old and got my associates in arts degree back in 2015. I hit some major depressive episode during my degree and let my grades slip and got a tons of Cs  and 1 D. 

I registered for disability services as I have schizoaffective  disorder because I was having test anxeity so bad I was getting psychically ill and having problems focusing on the exams. It was granted for my last semester and I did okay (I did get my first D in my last semester because our sociology teacher had favorites and put your grade down to lowest possible grade if you dared to question  her material which tend to focus on ""whites are bad"" mentality. She was removed the next semster when people got video of her class and sent it to the deans office.) My grades aside from the D did turn around but I got a 2.81 GPA after the massive depressive episode. Lowest the school and program accepts is 2.8.

I have wanted to go into medical field all my life. Medical stuff fascinates me and I currently work in a hospital as a transporter for inpatients. I gained interest in ED and Radiology (specifically sonography) however the progra. at my school is a points program where you have to get so many points for a chance to get into the program. We do have to get our CNA 1 class before we are allowed to compete for the radiology program. They take in account 6 classes all but 2 I have already completed (one is a pre req for that class) , TEAS and NA completion. 

I already have 4 Bs and an A in the classes Ive already taken. If I make a B in the A&amp;P and an 81% on the teas I will have 113 out of 129 possible points that puts me on the low even of a chance of being accepted. The program has gotten people as low as 103 in the program but that was the lowest the instructor could remember being admitted.

Again if I do all that there is a chance I will not even get into the class. Because they only accept 20 students at a time. Right now we are looking fall 2021  when I would be qualified to be able to get into the class.

I am scared because I hate making decisions for myself. Ive always had some sort of guidence.  I do not want to start something if there is no chance of me getting into a program because I feel I wasted a ton of money in the long run.

I'm freaking out because my dad has been such a piece of shit lately (maybe even my entire life) and he's always trying to take control of everything.  He acts like he's in charge but now I can see how fucking weak he is.  

Any help would be amazing, he noticed I wasn't my usual self and I was extra upset today.  Should I explain what I saw to him?",15Jan2020,1
794,"For a good couple years now, I've been served sketchy advertisements. The most common (and the reason for me posting this) is one that reads ""play GTA V for free on android."" The channel has one upload from ten years ago, seemingly a wedding video. Then, one week ago, this video, which is served as an ad. This isn't my first encounter with something like this - It's usually GTA V, but I've seen ones for Fortnite, (before the Android port, if there even is one) Battlefield, Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, and even Red Dead Redemption 2, a very recent release that pushes the limits of modern consoles and PCs.

Anyway, this is concerning to me because I have multiple young siblings who enjoy games. The links provided are always super sketchy, and more often than not use a strange link that directs you to  URL different than the one specified. I can only assume that this is some kind of spyware,virus, or malware. Even if, somehow, this were totally legit and GTA V were able to be played on a mid-range Android device like mine (It almost definitely isn't) they are still advertising a method in which a high-profile, full-price game can be acquired for free. That's Piracy. Regardless of your opinion on Piracy, people who don't take precautions can and will face jail time or fines. I'm worried because I know just how gullible children can be about downloads. I was a child in the 2000's and killed multiple laptops by downloading things like this. 

I understand that it is the responsibility of the user to spot and avoid ads like this, but with context, this is 2020. The Internet has changed, and YouTube is one of the ""mainstream"" websites that can and will be accessed by younger users. These ads, whether or not they are legitimate, are harmful, and they should NOT be shown on such a prolific website with so many younger users.

TLDR: YouTube is serving potentially dangerous advertisements for sketchy and/or illegal services. I can only choose to ""not show this ad."" I cannot report the video itself. What can I do?",15Jan2020,1

799,Me and my boyfriend broke up about 2 weeks ago. I obviously told him that we could still be friends because I want to be in his life because he still is important to me. It wasn’t a bad breakup at all. We broke up because he is going away in a few weeks and I’m not about long distance relationships. He keeps on messaging me and I reply when I can. I don’t reply very fast because I don’t want to give him false hope but then he gets mad and tells me how bad of a girlfriend I was and that it’s my loss not his. He is basically manipulating me to talk to him even though I don’t want to. Every time I go out with friends he wants to join me so I kind of feel like he is obsessed with me. Now I know breakups are hard. I’m also hurt. But it was for the best to break up. I’m not ghosting him or just straight up ignoring him for long periods of time and he still spams me when I don’t reply to his messages fast enough. I don’t want to block him because that’s just going to give bad vibes and I still want us to be friendly. I’ve been telling him nicely that we shouldn’t talk as much but he doesn’t get it.

I go to court and pay any extra fees ontop of the rent I had already paid by the time of the court hearing. I'm still living in this same apartment so obviously I wasnt evicted.

804,"
I’m not really sure where to start, so sorry if this isn’t really well written. I’ll give a bit of background and then work my way to where I’m at now. 

Throughout high school Ive always been reluctant and scared of what the future holds for me. For a very very long time I didn’t feel like I was ready to grow up yet. I just felt unprepared, not mature enough, and like I didn’t have my shit together, and felt that I just didn’t have what it takes to pull myself together on my own. It overwhelmed me to the point of inactivity, not making phone calls or appointments in my own, etc. 

I graduated hs in 2017 and went to my local community college for environmental science, because it was an area of work I felt like I should do.  While I am still very passionate about environmental issues, I wasn’t doing very well in the science aspects of it. I don’t really think I had the motivation and drive it takes to do my best in those classes. This kept me in that overwhelmed, scared-of-the-future state. It took me a few semesters of just not feeling the motivation it took to do as well in those classes as I could’ve to finally change my major to a gen ed type program so I could explore other passions. Art, literature, and writing are things I’ve been interested in my whole life, and I took a drawing class last semester with the best art teacher I’ve ever had. 

Everything was starting to shift. I felt the motivation and drive to try my absolute hardest and improve and unlock potential in myself with each assignment, I started getting to class earlier/on time because I wanted to get a head start on the assignments. I felt the way I wanted to feel towards a major. I had always kept art as a side thing, because I know it’s competitive and potentially harder to make a living with, but even then I’ve had art opportunities present themselves to me in unexpected ways. I’m now coming to the understanding that this is my calling, this is what I do and this is what I’m supposed to do. I feel confident in my abilities now and the potential that lies in there as I learn more, which is saying a lot for me because I usually lack confidence in all other aspects of myself. For the first time in YEARS i feel an eager but nervous excitement to start growing up and moving on to the next level for myself. And by finally accepting that this is what I want to do, I’ve felt a great sense of relief. 

Now my time at community college is starting to come to an end. I guess what I’m asking is, for people who may have experience as an art student or in an art profession, where should I take this next? I do want to begin majoring in art. My interests right now lie in working in art with how it pertains to storytelling. Besides just hoping to one day make a name for myself and sell my personal pieces, I’m interested in getting into storyboard/concept art (not necessarily animation) or graphic novels. I’m wondering what the next step would be and what type of schools/programs I should look into. I live in Maryland if that helps. I know how to research colleges in my area and stuff, I’m just looking for some insight from people who are studying art or have careers similar to what I’m looking for.",15Jan2020,1
805,"I'm not an amazing writer, so just a heads up. Looking for some advice on what I should do.   


I have had an online friend for about 5 years. We're both girls with a bit of an age difference. We shared similar hobbies and became friends through that. I have always thought of her like a little sister to me, and I would often try to be supportive and encouraging when she struggled. Much like my sister was for me. Our friendship started off as just sharing hobbies, and talking about stuff we liked, but after about a year I noticed she was struggling with emotional issues. She had past traumas hurting her and family issues (the family issues are still happening but have improved quite a bit thankfully). I love supporting friends and giving advice. I'm generally a positive person, and being caring and motherly to people is just natural for me. 

My friend needed the support, and I felt good giving her emotional support and advice. This continued on for about two more years with increase in frequency. She would vent, I would listen, and then I would try to work with her to find a solution. I slowly realized that not every problem of her's had a solution, and that I couldn't just cheer her up with encouraging words. It was hard for me to learn that, and I eventually just tried to let her have time for herself. Maybe she needed to work it out for herself. The issue was, she would go insane if I didn't message her. I would spend time with my boyfriend (now husband) for the weekend and would be left with a novel on discord from her in return. Mostly just her ranting about being lonely, and bored. I felt guilty leaving her alone, but my boyfriend is my family... and I want to spend time with him too. 

Around the fourth year of our friendship I realized that all of our conversations revolved around her, her issues, and why she was sad. Even if the topic was about something completely different, she would soon turn it to be about her problems. I felt sad for her. Her issues had to be pretty bad for her to always be reminded of them. My positivity was starting to drain though, and I had suggested a therapist for a long time, but she finally got one. I thought this would help us both, and that now we could talk about positive things to help cheer her up or maybe change her focus. Sadly, that's not what happen. The rants continued, the venting continued, her neediness for my attention continued, and I just couldn't handle it much longer. It makes me feel awful thinking and saying that though. She's the one with the actual issues, why should I be giving up? I still feel guilty about it.   


Being the older one, and being the more stable one, I never really talked about my issues with her. To be fair, I never really had issues (very grateful for this), but there were times when I felt like I wanted someone to talk to as well. I had always had friends that listened to me and I listened to them, but this friendship had been so one sided for so long. It was just me listening to her. There was a point where I had gone through some medical issues (It's a pretty emotional thing for me still and I want to keep it private but she knows the details), and I had told I was going through medical stuff and I was emotionally not in the right place and I needed time to myself to heal. I was clear, and honest. Despite  me telling her this, she simply ignored my feelings and complained about me not being on to hang out with her. That destroyed me. She completely ignored my feelings and immediately made it about her. This isn't the only instance she had done this, but this was the most hurtful instance. I had made an effort to move on from this, but after this, I noticed that she often cut me off or blew off anything that wasn't about her.   


This year has felt like the melting point of this friendship, and I have often question if it's really even a friendship anymore. I have a hard time wanting to listen to her anymore, and I know she really doesn't want to listen to me. None of my advice is ever listened too, and I feel it's just a means for her to feel like she's getting attention. I might be jumping to conclusions, but it's hard to care knowing nothing I say will mean anything, and that she's not going to care about me. I am hitting a point where I want a break. I want to just step back, and not have contact with her. I worry though. If she has a melt down from me being gone for 2 days out of the week, what will happen if I don't talk to her for longer. I have always encouraged her to talk to others and to not just have me as her only friend, but it's all in vain. I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm being a baby and that my issues aren't as bad as her's therefore I should put up with it, but the other part of me thinks that me being around might be making her worse in a weird way.   


I had tried setting boundaries with her. I told her that any abusive language to herself wasn't allowed, and that we needed to try to keep topics more positive. I didn't mind her telling me about her day, but she has an impossible time separating, self hate rants, depressive rants and general conversations about her day. She just always brings it back to her issues. I want to help, I have tired to help, there is just no motion with her. It's always about her, her issues, and why she can't change. I care about her a lot, but my emotional state is struggling too.   


Should I continue talking with her and trying to mend things? Is that an in-vain effort? Should I back out and take a break for a set amount of time? I just don't know what to do, and I still care about her, and worry about her, so I just need some advice.

806,"Warning\*\*\* typed this out quickly so please ignore any grammatical errors

I started my first job out of college eight months ago at a small startup company. I was the first business development employee behind the CEO (John), the COO (Jason), Head of Product (Steve), and our team of six outsourced developers. Things ran smoothly in the first month until I realized that there was some tension between the CEO and the Head of Product. They started to get into these petty arguments about our product road map and how pretty much every deadline was artificial. These arguments started to blown up into verbal arguments that often led to the Head of Product leaving the office for many hours. I just kept my mouth shut and never involved myself. 

That was until Steve and Jason started talking poorly about John behind his back. Every time John left the room, Steve and Jason would question his leadership with sly remarks like “he’s not fit to run this company” or “he’s such a f\*king joke”. As they started to feel more comfortable with me around, they would ask for my input on all these confrontations that I would always try to stay out of. 

4 months into the job, I was ready to get out of there. I thought that this would be a great learning experience, but it turned into something completely different. I was never recognized for the work that I was doing. Jason, my direct boss, was a glorified Account Manager with the title of COO. I was doing all of the work for him and he would take all of the credit. Whatever… I dealt with it and didn’t bitch about it to anyone. 

One day in the office we had a meeting to discuss a new feature set for our software. It was me, John, Jason, and Steve. We were all sitting there talking about this feature set and when John asked Steve a standard question about the a feature set that many of our clients have asked us to build, Steve started laughing and said something like “We probably can’t get that done for another year”. This really pissed John off and they got into another petty argument. While I silently sat there listening to these cry babies, I noticed that Jason and Steve were clearly talking to each other in a private Slack channel. It was obvious and John clearly knew what was going on. 

The next day, John took an online meeting with one of our clients on Jason’s computer while Jason was at a coffee shop interviewing a potential Head of Sales. John started to snoop around and saw Jason and Steve’s conversation from the previous day. I didn’t even notice what John was doing because we all have the same laptop. Anyway, John went to the coffee shop and fired Jason on the spot. Boom. Crazy shit. Jason comes upstairs to the office and immediately says to me, “John just fired me and Steve.” I shit you not, I said “haha you guys are just fucking with me”. I thought it was a complete joke. 

What John read between Steve and Jason was detrimental. John actually showed me the conversations and everything they said about John was pretty awful and led me to believe that these idiots deserved to be fired. Not only that, but they were bashing me for my financial modeling skills (I suck at excel and I’m not ashamed to say it). As I was leaving work that day, Jason called me drunk. He was saying some pretty nasty stuff about John and he told me that I should “get out of there as soon as possible” and to not work another day for “that megalomaniac”. 

The next day was a Saturday and John told me to come into the office for an emergency meeting. During that meeting he asked me if I spoke to Jason. I was advised by my dad to tell the CEO everything that Jason said to me. My dad told me to look at this as an opportunity. I trusted him, and about a week later I was assigned 8 new accounts and I got a promotion/raise. Good thinking dad. 

For a few months, it was just me and John. We started working out of his apartment and things were great. I started to adjust to being on the client facing side of the business and I became very close with many of my clients. I began to really enjoy coming to work every day. I no longer had to listen to Jason and Steve bitch about John and I had absorbed all of Jason’s business. During that time, John and I started to get very close. We would often grab a drink after work, he would vent to me about his girlfriend issues, and we would discuss the future of the business. 

As things started to level out, John told me that we needed to hire a new COO. Fast forward a few weeks later, we hired a new COO (Michael) and John made him a co-founder of the company. Michael was a well-established, successful entrepreneur who previously founded a company that went on to sell for over 30m. Soon after Michael joined my company, I started to grow as a young professional. He was so smart and so willing to mentor me. I had no complaints until just a few weeks ago when Michael started to vent to me the same way that Jason and Steve would. 

Just to provide you with an example of this “venting”. We had a potential investor that wanted 20% of all revenue for deals that he would have sourced. This dude tried to big dick us and John was having none of it. This interaction led to the potential investor texting Michael saying “I like you, but I don’t think that John is a good leader of \[x company\]”. Michael then shows me the text message while John was in the room. So dumb. John then pulled Michael out of the room to tell him that it wasn’t appropriate for him to show me that text message. Fair.

.

.

.

Fast forward a few weeks later to yesterday. I was having a great morning. I had just given two product demonstrations to two new clients of ours and I picked up a CHICKEN NUGGET SANDWICH for lunch. Like what? Crazy stuff. After lunch, John told me and Michael that he had to leave the office a little bit early to catch a flight. He was meeting a new candidate for the Head of Sales position in Houston, TX. As soon as John left the room, Michael flipped a switch and started venting to me about John. Why do people think its okay to talk poorly about others to me? Michael was saying some pretty fucked up shit but I just sat there and listened to this 42 year old cry baby. Some of the things he was saying: 

\- John comes from a background of money and it impacts his leadership style. 

\- He hides things from me about our clients. 

\- Sarah (a freelance web designer who was building our website and quit halfway through) is a c\*nt. 

\- 100% client churn rate is fucking ridiculous 

\- John is giving our investors fake revenue projections. 

After an hour of him venting to me at around 4pm, I told him that he should consider bringing this up with John and to be transparent about the way that he feels. He said that there’s no reason to bring it up with him because people don’t change and that we will just need to hire a great team around John. 

I decided that I needed a break, so I stepped out of the office and walked to a nearby café. While I was ordering my coffee, John called me to ask how the product demonstrations went with our two clients. I told him that they loved the product, but they made a few basic and necessary requests before they would sign onto our service. I told John that we should talk to the developers to add the requests to our (artificial) product roadmap. John sensed that I wasn’t in a good mood and asked me what was wrong. I mentioned to him that we have no sense of timeline from our developers for when products will be built out and that I’m frustrated because I keep making empty promises to our clients. I ALSO mentioned that Michael feels that you’re not being transparent about \[x deal\] and \[x deal\] and I think you should talk to him when the time is right. I told him to not bring it up right away because he’s going to know that I was the one who told him. 

Next thing you know, I receive the following messages from Michael: “Did you speak with John about our convo just now?” “He just called me about it” “Yoo”. Keep in mind this man is 42.

Maybe I shouldn’t have said anything but I thought it was important to get passed this roadblock of people talking poorly about others behind their back. Its not conducive to a transparent and collaborative work environment. 

I sent Michael the following reply: 

“I did not just go and tell John everything that we spoke about. In fact, I phased it around me being upset with the lack of communication from a product road map standpoint and how a lack of communication leads to a lack of collaboration on all fronts. I also mentioned to him that you guys should speak and get on the same page about \[x client\] and what’s going on with Sarah. 

I am at \[x company\] because I believe in our mission and I believe in John as a leader. He's the one who hired me and I am willing to roll with the punches as he grows as a young CEO and I grow as a young professional.

With that being said, I was having a productive day, my energy was high, I had just had a solid meeting with \[x client\] and you came in guns blazing talking about how Sarah is this and John is that. If you want more transparency then say something to him.

Keep in mind that I've been put in a compromising position before and I'm not comfortable with it.”

809,"I’m kinda freaking out right now because I’m pretty worried

My close friend’s parents are like hyper-Christian and always have been. My friend grew up being very Christian as well, but moved away from it in recent years, and it’s been really good for him. There is/has been a lot of pressure on him already to go back to the religion, but I guess today it came to a head.

My friend and I both attend a private alternative school, non religious. This school has also been really good for him. It does have a hefty tuition, however. 

My friend is also pansexual and transgender and until recently has had several suicide attempts and struggled heavily with self harm. In general he already struggles with depression constantly. On top of that he was also recently diagnosed with a very serious chronic illness that’s gonna give him ever-increasing chronic pain, among a lot of other things. His parents have been really reluctant to let him transition and also really really don’t seem to understand the extent of his chronic pain. 


I don’t know the full details but apparently today my friend’s parents have told him that he can’t attend this school anymore unless he becomes a Christian again, otherwise he’ll go to public school. I don’t know if this include detransitioning and being “straight” or cutting off nonchristian friends but I’m worried that it could. Regardless, it will require him to hide a large part or all of his true self/expression for several years. He says he can handle faking it but I’m not sure if I believe him, especially if it’s potentially to this extent/for so long.

I feel that I should reach out to his parents to show concern about how this is bad for him but I also don’t want to alienate myself from them.

Should I reach out to his parents, and if sowhat should I say?
How can I otherwise help him or give him advice?",15Jan2020,1

812,"TL;DR How does one go about dealing with parents who have shown you that they don’t care and don’t love you? What are some ways to cope and accept that?  

Long story short, I have major mommy/daddy issues and I just started therapy for this. I come from a family of 6, I’m the third child. My dad was never around growing up because he was always working. My mom was a great mom when I was young. Then my parents divorced when I was in 7th grade. My mom completely checked out and “left” me. She wasn’t there for me physically or emotionally. She left me to raise my two younger siblings (2 and 7 at the time) and spent her days and nights gone from our house with my older sister. Lots of manipulation, physical and mental abuse, and no emotional support from either parent. My older sister was physically and mentally abusive towards me. My mom, and dad, did nothing about it. 

After high school, I got married and I went to work for my dad. My dad treated me like I was worth nothing, and there was a lot of manipulation and harassment from him. I told him that I wished we had a better relationship, and he said that he has never seen me as a daughter and that he only sees me as an employee. I no longer work for my dad and we haven’t talked since.

Since high school, my mom and I have barely been in contact. Every time I try to talk to my mom about what had happened in the past to let her know that I’m hurting inside, she plays the victim card and says that I am blaming/judging/criticizing her/it’s my dads fault. 

I was in a really bad car accident 6 months ago and suffered a bad concussion and neck/spine injuries, and thankfully nothing had been broken. My husband [30 M] was there for me but my parents weren’t. My mom said that because I wasn’t dying, she didn’t come visit me. I asked if she could take me to the hospital the day after the accident, and she said that she had a doctors appointment herself and couldn’t take me. My husband and I had to take an Uber. 

Since the car accident, I have never felt so alone. My husband has always been the person to be there for me, and has always tried to support me in the ways my parents failed. I am so lucky I have him in my life. But I feel so hollow and empty, and the car accident has made me realize that I have no one. Any tips/advice on how to deal with parents who just don’t care and don’t love you? I know that therapy will help, but what am I supposed to do until therapy helps me heal? I think I’m depressed and I’m losing my mind.",15Jan2020,1

Anyway I got distracted by a Plant that I wanted for a while, and suddenly my bus was in 4 minutes, and I still hadn't got the tights, so I briskly walked grabbed the tights and ran to the self-service checkout. Where the machine decided not to work properly and a customer service assistant started talking to me, and I made my bus by literally seconds. Any way was talking to my partner this evening about the plant and lunch and my day, and he asked me how much the plant was. I couldn't remember so went to check the label and realised it was 10£, this was weird as I only paid £17 in total and I know that the tights are 4£ and had grabbed two packs. Now I can't find my receipt anywhere I don't know how much everything else was, but I have a feeling I didn't pay for something unless there was a deal on. What do I do? I am feeling so guilty and like there will be a photo of me in the shop saying shoplifter do you know this person.

My job is to run program evaluations, write grants, manage program budget, know and comply with all state and county laws, rules and regulations, make decisions on behalf of the Executive team, provide training, retention and recruitment, among other similar tasks.

My boss instead has me doing the following:
1. Making reservations for her meetings
2. Emails me asking to grab copies she just printed and bring them to her, even though her office is closer to the printer than mine. 
3. Emails me to bring her coffee from the lobby, which is approximately 20 steps from her office.
4. Tells me to keep her on track with timelines and remind her to send emails.
5. Tells other staff members to give me the things they want to order online and that I will do it for them.

These are just a few things. A couple weeks ago, after I wrote our Annual Appeal and was gearing up for it to be sent out, she came into my office in a huff exclaiming, “The printer CANNOT be low on toner. Please remember that.” To begin with, I had no idea the printer was low on toner. Secondly, it’s not my job! We have a Tech onsite who is a full time employee with us.

My fiend of almost 10 yeas has her birthday soon. I bought her a ring (not very expensive, but still more than I’d usually spend). We haven’t bought each other gifts in a few years, as she’s become a tad distant after moving away to university, which I guess is understandable.
She’s basically been the only friend I’be ever really had, but she’s pretty bad at being a good one.
Last year, I tried to meet up for her birthday and give her a gift. I tried calling her like 100 times. When she finally answered, she laughed and said she’d only just woken up and she was hung over. I’d waited 2 hours for her already so I just went home. On my birthday last year, she only wished me happy birthday a couple days after, like she’d completely forgotten. 
On top of that, whenever I’ve given her gifts before, she’s generally just been careless/unappreciative of them.
Do I just take the ring back and get her something cheaper? I thought getting her something nice would be a nice thing to do for her but the more I think about it the less I want to give it to her.

823,"
I’m 20. I just got back from a 10 day vacation to Orlando, FL. With an friend who is not my friend anymore. 

We weren’t exactly all that compatible to begin with and had prior fallouts and set up boundaries and kept trying to make it work over the years but I’m kinda over it. 

I thought the trip went well apparently she thought otherwise and sent me nasty messages and blocked me after the trip. 

Oh well not much money was lost on my part. It was pretty much a gift paid by her parents and all I had to do was bring spending money. 

And that was also my only “friend” who wasn’t really a friend because we would rarely hangout. I guess we are in different parts in our lives. She’s newly engaged, has a job, getting ready to move out, almost done with therapy, weaning off meds, has other friends, has her own car, looking to start going to college...me on the other hand, going to start seeing a doctor and going to therapy soon, no job and can’t keep a job, can’t keep friends, emotional/mental roller coaster, pretty much my parents Maid (they make me clean a lot around house and yell when I do things wrong), no saved up money, no car, never had a boyfriend, no other friends (I bullied a lot of people in high school and no I’m not proud of it)

Anyways, now that I am back at home I am back  to sitting in my house day in and day out. I haven’t had a job since I got fired in October. I’ve had 4 jobs this year and got fired from every single one due to low performance, bad moods and fallouts with coworkers. My parents drop me off/pick me up from jobs but now they are suggesting I focus on myself and getting the mental help I need (medication, therapy, raise my self esteem etc). Because I’m just going to get fired again and my resume is already trash. Both of my parents have masters degrees and work constantly. We live in a fairly nice house. 

I go through phases where I’m up and happy and must spend spend spend or must do something and have a high sex drive (masturbate a lot to put it bluntly) appetite goes up and I engage in abnormal/risk taking behavior become childish/obnoxious/attention seeking, don’t follow rules and I also go through periods where I’m very irritated, all I want to do is sleep, barely eat, lash out on everyone, cry randomly and say mean and nasty things (become super defensive)

I do not have a car to drive at the moment, and I’m not on any insurance. I have like $7 in my bank account. Parents just put me on their health insurance and want to me to seek mental treatment, they think I might be bipolar/borderline but I always have hard times getting along with others/ I’m very rebellious and stubborn/ I guess I do have age regression sometimes when I’m down and I can’t keep a job or go to school. My grades were terrible in high school no matter what help I received. I don’t know what I want to do with my life and I can’t think about it, I’ve never been able too, I get very frustrated and overwhelmed. 

My doctors appointment is an initial intake appointment at the psychiatrist on Jan 24th. But what I usually do is watch movies/YouTube , play mario kart, sleep (a lot), play with my dogs/cats, if it’s warm go for a walk around neighborhood, broadcasting apps, or clean whatever my parents want me to clean. Designated cleaning days are Tuesday and Friday and my parents give me an entire list. They don’t pay me either. They say you live here free of rent, I’m paying for your food/health insurance and phone bill, the least you could do is work on yourself and clean my house. You are irresponsible and my room constantly looks like a hoarders room (I always struggle with keeping things clean) so maybe this is their way of trying to get me to be responsible? It’s not really working but whatever if I do it I don’t have to listen to their mouth run.",15Jan2020,1

830,"Hey Everyone. I could use some new perspectives on this issue, I'm not really sure what to do.

So my house was a little culty growing  up. Not religious but very, very controlled. (To give you an idea, I was not allowed to shave my legs, wear make up, at times choose my own clothes, have friends, or go anywhere unsupervised... at age 21.)  I moved out three years ago and have just finally come to terms with the fact that what I thought was normal was in fact abuse -- verbal, physical, and emotional. 

However, I left behind a sister who turns fifteen today.

I know that she isn't being beaten, they were always much gentler with her than they were with me. But some weird things about the situation that concern me:

1. She has very limited contact with other people, she does not go to school. She is barred from interacting with the rest of the family. (Basically all she has is my parents now.)
2. My parents are our way or the highway -- I left because I was unhappy and as a result they have cut me off 100%, despite the fact that I have apologized for leaving and adamantly pushed for a relationship with them for the past three years.
3. Last year, I went to the only place that I knew she would be at -- she attends a yearly kids summer camp (her only avenue of socialization) so I went to visit her and make sure she was okay. Her reaction to seeing me was so extreme (just bawled and wouldn't stop) that the police officer who stepped in filed a report with social services out of concern for her mental health. Also, ahead of time my father called the camp to ask that I be detained if I went anywhere near her. (Luckily, I was friends with the police so they knew I would not harm her or anything.)
4. She has posted some odd stuff on social media under a fake name. My mother monitors her accounts so I cannot send her a message there, but she is really obsessed with having a guy rescue her (like the disney princess vibe) and I worry about her in the adult world making bad decisions because she is insecure. She posts things about anxiety and depression as well.
5. I am 100% positive that my parents are bad mouthing me to her. They made me feel like my extended family was crazy and abusive while I lived at home -- now that I'm out I can see that that is completely untrue but I can see them doing that about me to her.

So all in all, my options are:

a. send her a message on social media to check on her, but risk that my parents will see it and barre her from social media from this point forward.

b. write her a letter and leave it on my parents door -- knowing that if they see it first, my sister will never see it.

c. contact social services? emotional abuse is very difficult to prove.

d. do nothing and wait until she is 18.

e. other ideas you may have???

I would like to help her, but I worry that stepping in might make things worse. It would also cement my relationship with my parents forever as nonexistent -- they would never understand or forgive me. (Not that they talk to me now but still.) Is it worth stepping in? Do you think she needs help? What would you do if you were me?

Including a jobs workplaces - I’m also worried about attending meetings/interviews, business, acting even and whatnot. Anything professional scenario really that might exist in my lifetime. 

I am hoping makeup will work on me, but I don’t know much about it. Would I have to cover my entire hand? Or just the size of the tattoo? I know a bandaid wouldn’t be ideal as it wouldn’t look professional,

Would I feel comfortable? How would I wash my hands? Will it be noticeable? 

I’m mentally overwhelmed by it, full of regret but also full of admiration and respect of the tattoo. I think it’s great, it has meaning, just wish I thought harder and perhaps a different location.

For a while, things got better, The medication was working, my grades were getting better,  and I loved talking to my psychiatrist, but suddenly, she got much more aggressive towards me exclusively, she had a lot of family from her side argue with her frequently ever since I can remember, and that really never stopped, even after the incident and stuff, she would randomly lash out at me for the dumbest things and go into my room exclusively to either beat me, or insult me for not getting out of my room often, and it' s been like this for months already, I hsd never really talked back to her, untill she started to call me the most disgusting things I've ever heard and saying that I was just like my father and that I was ""fucking insane"" for wanting to spend my free time just in my room, playing videogames with friends, even then the one time it really hurt was when she was screaming at me at the top of her lungs for not taking the medicine the second she gave it to me I said 'Calm down, don' t be crazy I'l take it in a sec, just let me finish this match' and she got stupid mad and said things like 'Well I'm not the one going to the psychiatry and taking antidepressants everyday like a fucking sicko' and trying to force my sisters to take her side and 'prove me wrong'.

I was hoping I might run into Person there to patch things up, but Person is avoiding me now. Person has also left our group chat, blocked me from their Facebook, banned me from their internet discord server. Pretty much everything that can be done to sever the tie between me and Person has been done by them. 

The last party that was thrown by our Mutual Friend was New Year's Eve. I slept over at Mutual Friend's house because the drive is very long. When I left, I accidentally forgot some of my things (hat, scarf, ect). To be honest, after thinking about it, subconciously I might have been nesting-- leaving something of me behind in the city just so I know I could come back at some point. 

Mutual Friend sent me a Facebook Message a few days afterwards that read ""You forgot your stuff here. I'll mail it back if you give me your address. Hope you are having a fantastic 2020 so far!"" which seems completely benign. 

I want to reply with something that ranges from ""Don't worry. Just keep it. It doesn't matter. Person doesn't want me in the city anymore, so I'm moving on."" to ""Please keep it there because the thought of me not having a tie to the city hurts me a lot, just keep it so I know I have a part of myself there in the future.""

She has trouble sleeping at night and just spends all of her days sleeping. She eats maybe one meal a day and it is usually fast food or something my brother brings her. She does not cook for herself. She does not do laundry. She only showers if it is absolutely necessary. If I come home, she will shower and get dressed so that we can go to lunch or do something. I have made her doctor's appointments. Her doctor put her on lexapro but I do not think she still takes it. She is very skeptical of any medication, even to treat her post-partum depression in the 90s. 

She broke her kneecap a couple months ago because she is so frail but is pretty much recovered. She is struggling to pay off those medical bills and will not let me make her a colonoscopy appointment because she doesn't think she can afford it. She's been saying for years that she is going to study and get re-certified for the job she had before she became a mom. She won't do it, but it would be the perfect solution. She needs an income and people to be around. I have to push her so hard and do things for her if she is going to get anything done. This is exhausting and feels like a Sisyphean task.

He stays up until 3-4am every night, and sleeps until 1-2pm every day, then he repeats this - every day. It has been about 7 years of this pattern

He has only held jobs for around 4 months maximum, and he ALWAYS has the same story: the boss was an asshole, the coworkers were assholes, the boss won't pay him ""what they agreed to."" I can't listen to him talking about jobs anymore, because I know it's just a rehashing of the same pattern. I've heard it too many times. 

I wouldn't get involved with his life, but it is starting to effect me. He explodes verbally and attacks my mom a few times per month. The week before last was yelling at my mom because she was ""making too much morning noise,"" and this was at Noon. The week after that, he yelled at her for closing his bedroom door at 11am. He was mad because closing his door ""suffocated"" him. 

I'm honestly worried about his mental health. I'm totally OK with weed smoking, and I smoke almost daily, but I have a job and a pretty good head on my shoulders. I worry that him being perpetually high is fucking up his dopamine levels. 

When he talks, he is usually irrational. He says his life sucks because others have ""stolen his ideas."" He tends to trash talk others and his tone is generally very abrasive, negative and pessimistic. This is why I assume he is depressed. Hurt people hurt people. 

I've tried to get him to start counseling, even to the point of lining up a great therapist who said all my brother needed to do is call and schedule the appointment. My brother never called. 

I'm at a loss. My mom is so desperate that she's considering selling the house because she thinks my brother will always mooch and be horrible like this. She has felt like she is having a heart attack the last few times he was yelling. We are all at the end of our rope. 

What can we do about this grown adult man-child? He has grown marijuana in the past and is constantly fighting my mother because she won't let him grow marijuana illegally. It's so confusing because he seems charming and smart sometimes, so I know he's not totally crazy. 

Why can't he just find and hold a job? All the siblings are concerned that we just need to burn this bridge, and if he continues to freeload once my parents pass, we will just evict him from the family home. In the future, we would not be willing to pay the mortgage/his rent so he can continue this pattern of him playing video games and smoking weed and not even TRYING to improve his life. 

Please help with any advice you have, I'm really worried that he'll be stuck in this shitty loser pattern forever and the siblings will be forced to take parental roles with him forever. 

Thank you.",15Jan2020,1

851,"A bit of background before I get some tips on how to follow.

I've been with this nice girl for about 8 months now. We met online, playing videogames. We used to spend nights playing any game coop. 

Eventually I went there to visit her. I did it twice last year. 

Everything was good, spending time with each other until the last few weeks from last year.

We started spending less time playing together even though I let her know about it.

Then the messages started getting less and less often.

We got into more snags in our relationship.

Recently, she deleted every picture from us on every social media app of her (facebook, instagram).

Naturally I confronted her about it and asked her if she wanted to end our relationship.

She told me that she still loves me but she said need some time alone (this must be cue for a break-up).

I don't know what to do. I feel the right thing is to break up but despite all that, she says that she still have feelings for me.",15Jan2020,1
852,"Umm yeah, basically what the title says, I cannot bring myself to do anything related to schoolwork at all anymore. I'm 16 for context. I used to be an all 90s kid in school, always had my work done and always did super well on tests. Yesterday I found out I am failing Grade 10 Academic English, and I don't care. I already had guessed that I would be failing, since I had not handed in a single assignment all year. My other classes aren't quite as bad, but still only like 60s, which has never happened to me before. I have never studied for a test in my life, and I still get very good marks on all my tests, like 85 or higher. I lie to my parents about how I am doing, and by now I don't even think about it, lying is just a habit. If the work is something that can be completed in one class, there is no problem, but if it is something that requires a bit more work, I will just pretend it doesn't exist. Somewhere deep down I know how wrong this attitude is, but I just can't bring myself to do anything about it. I will play video games for hours on end, but even when I'm not playing games, I will just do anything other than my work, like reading Ready Player One for the 10th time. I am slowly going insane because of all this, and I hate myself more and more as I sink deeper and deeper into a hole that I am digging myself. I don't know if this is the right sub for this, but oh well.

I have googled it but I am rubbish at this kind of thing and dont want to delete it forever- google says the only thing we can do now is erase his data to unlock the phone. I dont know if he had a backup or anything and we deleted his email account and phone contract so we cant verify anything.

855,"I'd like to say I'm 80% over her. We dated from June 2018 to February 2019 and had a really nasty, very public breakup that culminated in an infamous Twitter war between her friends and mine. She said some very awful and slanderous things about me in a long series of tweets where she threatened me in numerous ways. I was heartbroken when we broke up but after that I felt glad we had and I lost respect for her.

One day on a vacation, I walked the beach by myself during the sunset and looked into the sky and realized I didn't miss her anymore. I didn't miss what she brought to the table, her looks, her personality, but one constant was I missed her presence, I missed having a girlfriend.

But life since has been very lonely. I have been single since and not for a lack of trying. Happy couples I see all the time on social media and in person destroy my spirit and forces me to compare them to my ex and I. I've done online dating, tried to find a girlfriend at my college, I'm admittedly trying to fill the void very desperately but I miss the affection she brought. I want a girlfriend again for companionship, for the most part.

I went on anti-depressants for my obsessive need to find a girlfriend and extreme jealousy of others who were fortunate enough to have one. They have helped me significantly since, even though I occasionally have spells (it used to be a daily issue). 

But I'm still talking about her on a daily basis, dropping her name in conversations or telling old stories about us. It's annoying my friends and family. I still find myself looking at a photo I saved of us on a date any time I get lonely and use it as a comforting tool of sorts to remind myself I'll find someone again, but it's only rewinding to the past. One good thing is I never look at her social media, mainly because I'm blocked on them all, but also because I'd admittedly be terrified to see if she has a new boyfriend or not and I'd like to live in a world where I don't have to know it.

2020 is a year I'm trying to better myself and focus on my goals first before hopping back into the dating world, but I just can't leave her in 2019, it seems. I want to stop, but it's easier said than done. Any advice?",15Jan2020,1

858,"Throughout high school I developed this bad habit of crazy over sleeping to the point I just sleep when I’m bored and wake up with headaches in the middle of the night realizing I haven’t eaten anything the whole 
day

I’m pretty sure it started with my depression as I used to be depressed and sleep the days away to prevent any social interactions or use it as a way to “recharge” myself from the long day of talking with people, I also experienced horrible sleep paralysis in the past which would prevent me from falling asleep but have since over come that to an extent that it won’t keep me awake at night, I just get nervous and go back to sleep 

Now in college I come back home around noon, eat a snack, do homework and sleep until the next day and still feel so tired, it’s a problem I’ve tried to fix before by keeping myself awake and sleeping at a schedule and distracting myself with hobbies and a job but it always has me tired throughout the day and passing out as soon as I make it to my room 

What I’m concerned about is how it’s affecting my mental state, currently I’ve been oversleeping heavily for the past week cause of my winter break and have been falling asleep from 4 am - 5 pm today just happens to be lucky, I had a breakdown last night over something stupid and I guess the oversleeping has made me very emotional and I just feel like I’m missing something in my life.

863,"Hello all, 

So to give the title some more meat, I'm 21, and very soon to be 22-year-old Brit who is wondering if getting a Customer Service Apprenticeship at the museum I currently volunteer at is a good use of my time, or if it would be better for me to find a job that actually pays a more reasonable wage. The Apprenticeship in question does come with the perk that I'll be a Duty Manager at the museum and I can imagine that it will look good on my CV, but another part of me feels its a waste of time at £3.90 an hour, 9 to 6, 5 days a week. Especially once you factor in that I'd have to spend about 15 pounds a day on transport, which since I live with my mum is the only expenditure I have to worry about apart from lunch costs, but it means a 9 hour day will earn me about 20 pounds. On the other hand, if I get a job I could find somewhere local, thus cutting down on travel costs, and help pay some bills on the house, helping my family right now.

The other worry with the apprenticeship is that the last person who did it was treated as a dogsbody and was always running around doing whatever management told him to do, and as soon as his contract was done, he got the boot with little ceremony. According to others I've talked to they only did this to him because he was totally unsuited to the position and couldn't be trusted with any real responsibility, which to be fair could be true as he forgot to lock the doors to the place more than once, among other things, but still, I worry I'll end up as he did, and with very little to show for it.      

So my real question is that after 18 months as an apprentice will I find a better job or even start at a new place as a duty manager than just working hard for the same amount of time? Thanks for any advice, and good job if you managed to read the lot!",15Jan2020,1
864,"I’m a freshman, and the way my school choir works, there are different level choirs depending on how advanced you are. All freshman start in what I’ll call “choir level one”. My teacher recently offered me and one other girl to move up to “choir level two” next semester. This is a pretty big deal, as we’d be the only freshman in the class, and this doesn’t happen often. However, it will greatly change my schedule. All my friends have first lunch, and I’ll be moved to 2nd. I’ll loose my only class with my friends in it, which conflicts with that hour. I also don’t know if it will be too much for me to jump in, as they already know a song that they will be singing throughout the year and I would have to learn it mostly independently. That being said, if I want to make it to the most advanced choir, this would probably help a lot. My older sister has 2nd lunch as well, but she’s a senior and so won’t be there often.

865,"Hello. My name is Barry and I’m in high school. I’m gonna start here. All my life i realize I never really had friends. Acquaintances, maybe but never people to hang out with after school or people I share interests with. Or people that actually fucking like me for who I am. It all started with this girl. She was pretty and I wanted to date her so I started talking to her. Everything was going good and she liked me until everything got weird and drama started because of the fact that her friend at the time (who is a boy) went up to me and told me to back off. His name is rodrigo. We went back and forth with confrontations for about a week until for some reason he went up to me one day and stopped it. He showed a different cool side to him and I liked it. So the girl thing ( the girls name is Annalise) stopped and was no longer a problem. I then started hanging out with rodrigo cause he started to make an effort with me. Along the lines I met his best friend Adam. Keep in mind, these guys have the same music taste as me and a similar personality, they were a lot like me and very attractive and fun to be around. I remember when I first spent lunch with them and their other friends, I walked to my class with music blasting in my ears happy as fuck!!! I thought to myself “I finally found my people” We hang out for about two weeks after, going to the mall and stuff. Then drama erupts. Annalise starts dating rodrigo and says “if Barry is in your life, you aren’t in mine” because of previous drama. This broke me. However me and rodrigo and Adam were still in terms. We still talked in secret and discussed how we would get over it. I then became great friends with Annalise and fixed the whole thing. life is great again, we hang out for weeks going to plazas and dancing in parking lots. I felt like that one lonely character in a movie who finds his friends and his life changes. Then I meet this girl through the friend group. Genesis. She is pretty and we hang for a week straight with the group after school. We were getting touchy while all hanging out and long story short I decided to ask her out the last day we hung out. She said yes but then said we should keep it a secret cause Annalise wouldn’t want that. I said she should know so genesis told Annalise and Annalise twisted it and convinced genesis to not go out with me. Out of desperation I continued to ask why and why to genesis. She said I’m sorry it’s not for the best and ended it there. I was broken but said ok. I then find out, after winter break, everyone stops talking to me. No texts no calls nothing. They leave me on read. (The only people that are cool and still texting at this point are me and Annalise.)  we are still cool because I still liked her and a friend and didn’t care. After a week of being depressed and not knowing why they dropped me I call out of desperation and Adam picks up. Rodrigo talks to me in a mad tone saying I ruined everything and said genesis was “uncomfortable” over text when I was asking why we couldn’t be together. He calls me selfish because of that and hangs up. Adam just doesn’t want to be my friend I heard after that. And genesis hates me. I became very very very depressed and felt so alone. Every time I see them at school I think of the great times with them and how much love I felt. I might even be gay for rodrigo. My life is a mess and spiraling out of control. I feel alone so alone. I’ve tried so much and nothing’s working. I’ve tried to talked to rodrigo and he doesn’t want too. I need help fuckers. When I was with them I felt noticed and felt like somebody. I want it back.

866,"So I just got back from my second interview with this marketing company that is roughly 1:15 to 45 min from my house. What they have told me Is I could potentially be making quite a bit of money but I have to travel around the Dallas/Fort-Worth metro. Which I do not like having to go to random places everyday for work I prefer set a office or location to work at. So basically I’ll be those people setting up a table or booth at stores or events and asking for a donation or something related to that and most of the money I will be getting as payment is commission. Which can be iffy starting pay is anywhere between $500-$1000 a week but I currently get paid $13.50 at my current job and I work 32-40 hours a week and pay is guaranteed.

He acted fine, like nothing happened then next test that is meant to be open note, he announces we can no longer use notes and have fifteen minutes to study thirty vocabulary words. Keep in mind, this is a hard quiz where he gives you about sixty words (30 of which aren’t used) to match up to situations. The problem is, he says to use the chapters and take notes on the vocab (vocab includes people) not to just write the definition but context, events around them/it and do our own research. So my friends and I all have packets among packets of work. We get these quizzes a few times a month so we try to be as prepared as possible. But this also meant we had NO way of getting a good grade on this quiz. 

So anyway, me and my friends bombed it and today he announced we have a quiz with no open notes for now on bc of the ppl that cheated (keep in mind it was a small group of ppl). We have to study the same info and he only gave us two days to prepare (as he always does). I tried just studying the definitions but that along with the groups of people is too much to study for.

Idk what to do bc my friend had a civil conversation and she said kindly that he shouldn’t punish the whole class and he claimed he wasn’t. He said if he was punishing the whole class he’d fail everyone. So anyway, my friend and I are looking for advice because I haven’t even finished taking notes and I know I’m not going to remember all of it. Any help on what we can do?

During this time I end up living in a hostile, close to homeless and I slip into a deep depression which then turns to suicidal thoughts.

Then I have these dreams of her jumping the bridge exactly where I planned to, 3 nights they lasted and on the third I saw her corpse and her eyes practically ripped through my soul and it still haunts me.

She knows none of this and I think maybe if I told her at least some than maybe she could help, or maybe I make her feel even worse or scare her or maybe she doesn’t even care about me anymore, maybe I even drive her there and all I can think about is helping her and I can’t live with myself if I cause her anymore pain because she is honestly the kindest, best person I’ve ever met and I don’t know if I can tell her and be selfish even if it could save my life.

873,"I knew him for years, but I realize now I only knew the version of him he chose to befriend me. I trusted him with another friend of mine and I learned yesterday that he was incredibly verbally and emotionally abusive to her. They aren't connected anymore, thank goodness. All my memories of him pushing people's boundaries, always escalating disagreements, his talkative charm, and overwhelming presence...they fell into place with terrible clarity.

And he invoked my name to make her feel alone. She had a meltdown telling me everything because she was afraid I would side with him.

He must have some kind of moral code, even if it's having control vs. losing control. He has lots of friends and connections. He's heavily involved in our local community. He's kind and helpful and playful talking to people in public. I replay all the times I was alone with him, sharing our fears and dreams, coaching each other through difficult times. Was all of that a lie? What else has he hidden from the world? Does he care about the the pain he inflicted? Is he capable of remorse? Is he capable of redemption?

I can see in hindsight how unhappy he must truly be with himself, and how desperate he was to control something in his life. Terrible childhood and adolescence, disillusioned with his career prospects after college, he fell in love and got his heart broken, hated the only full time job he ever had, got fired from it because he didn't follow orders and lost his temper with his boss, constantly on the edge of poverty, scraping by now doing work he likes better but it's all part time jobs. Maybe he's learned his lesson. But I'm sick to my stomach of how he treated her. He hurt my friend. He killed the version of himself who I was proud to call my friend. I hate that he's added to the pain he survived instead of processing it in a healthy way. I hate that he'll still dance around town peddling his ""good guy with shit luck"" redemption arc. I hate that he's more likely to protect his reputation than stabilize his mental health. I hate that he'll eventually tell people a story where he's not to blame for everything bad that's happened to him. I know intellectually that he's on the road to possibly ruining his own life.

Now if you happen to recognize yourself in the following description, please don't read any further. I really want to make this present a surpise.

&amp;#x200B;

Some infos about her:

&amp;#x200B;

\- She is turning 21

\- She absolutely loves cats despite not owning one herself (got her a little cat figure as a lucky charm once and she was super happy)

\- She loves rap music and techno. She goes to concerts and parties often and enjoys them a lot.

\- She makes quite a lot of short trips to other countries, so I thought about getting her something for her travels, but I just have no idea what people could use at travels

\- She is a good artists and has made some nice drawings. However she doesn't really seem to draw a lot anymore lately

\- She doesn't really like reading, so nothing book related

\- She loves watching comedy and (especially comedy) series like Family Guy

\- She doesn't really like cultural stuff like visiting castles or art galleries, but is up for out of the ordinary crazy stuff (like a super crazy museum e.g.)

\- She owns and drinks a lot of tea, however I already got her a teaset for her last birthday, so that's not really an option

&amp;#x200B;

I would really appreciate ideas on this, thank you in advance for any advice! =)",15Jan2020,1
877,So I have an amazing girlfriend that treats me amazing and I treat her great also. But I feel like I make her worry about me with having previous depression and anxiety. So then I worry about her worrying about me. And its like a perpetual cycle. What do I do????,15Jan2020,1
878,"Here is the situation I am in: I am home schooled no GED yet. My family is pretty poor, Section 8, food stamps, etc. Now I want to get a job but if I do some of my wage would go to rent in addition to section 8. Also my mom's  food stamps might be decreased because of a wage being made, so I will have to buy food too, and most nights I go to sleep hungry because food prices increase but our food stamp allowance doesn't. Along with all the other bullshit I will probably make like 60 to keep a week, after paying all the other bills that we are behind on. Also I have no driver's license and would have to ride a bike to work. I've applied to several store but never got any response.

Anyways, any time i bring him up my parents get mad. One time we were at an airshow and the national anthem came on. I stood up, hand on my chest and but i guess the angle made it look like i was sitting bc my dad came up and said, in the coldest voice imaginable, ""just because your boyfriend is a communist doesnt mean my daughter will be too."" Ir something along those lines. 

Just remembering that is enough to put me in tears and i hate it. Probably one of the worst memories i have so far. I dont understand why my parents hate him so much when i like him so much. I really have no idea what to do.",15Jan2020,1

882,"My fiancee was told by her doctor that she needs to eat more fish (I'll not get into the details other than its a health reason). Problem is however she's always had a hard time eating any kind of seafood due to the taste and texture, fish and shrimp especially.

I want to be a good man for her, and especially more so since I want her to be happy and healthy (no one likes to be sick) so I want to cook her a meal that she can eat, that has fish in it, but she won't be able to tell.

Any help, recipes, or tips for masking fishy flavors, textures, etc. would be helpful and more than appreciated!",15Jan2020,1
883,"Let me start off by saying that this is not easy to write or post. I have an extreme aversion to social interaction, and have recently been diagnosed with autism, OCD, and ADHD. When I was a kid, I had frequent episodes where I would shut down and wind up sleeping for days/weeks in response to negative social situations. When I was awake during these episodes, I would have very limited cognitive function, namely only enough to get food and use the restroom.

I am currently 28, and finally got what little diagnosis I have by paying out of pocket to go to OHSU and requesting it specifically, but they weren’t willing to diagnose anything more specific. Unfortunately, while I have made an enormous amount of progress in trying to overcome my issues, I am still unable to do most things involving other people. I can’t understand people when I’m not speaking with them in person, so I can’t use phones. I don’t have the ability to handle situations where people get aggressive or approach me outside of my expectations because I shut down uncontrollably and lose days of my life. When I experience these shutdowns my sleep cycle goes sideways and it can take weeks for me to correct it. The fear of shutting down also tends to trigger panic attacks when I’m aware that I’ll be in a potentially uncertain situation.

I’ve been living with my father for several years now, and have been subsisting entirely on his generosity, but it’s completely unsustainable. In about a month, there’s a good chance that we’ll both be homeless because we can’t pay rent. I have tried applying to social security for disability benefits, but they don’t seem to care. They also didn’t seem to read the application, where I specifically mentioned that I cannot communicate via phone, and that all phone calls should be directed to my father. My application was denied because I couldn’t take their call. We even went as far as to try to work with Heatherly Disability Representatives, but they’ve been non-responsive and have done nothing to drive the process, effectively wasting the last 6 months.

I genuinely don’t think that I can hold a job, but I’ll be on the street if I can’t find some way of pulling my weight. Given my conditions, that’s effectively a death sentence.

How do people with debilitating conditions survive? Am I missing something? Is there any type of work I could do that doesn’t require a strict time commitment or use of a phone?",15Jan2020,1
884,"Just some context to preface what's currently going on: I worked for a company for about 5 years and in the 5 years I worked closely with the company owner's husband (who also worked at the same company as its co-owner). We worked together often and he'd often buy me lunches and we'd hang out during lunch breaks and would get into conversations not specifically relating to work (things like exercise, school, hobbies, etc) and all this I was fine with up until I quit the company. His wife completely stopped talking to me after I left (I believe she has some sour feelings towards me) but he continued to stay in contact with me after I left the company. We would meet up occasionally for lunch to catch up and talk and he wrote me a letter of recommendation for me to get into graduate programs relating to the field and has mentored me with some oft he in's and out's of the field. All of this I was fine with up until a few months into our lunch meet-ups did things get kind of odd. 

There would be moments where his wife would call him to ask about something (work and/or home and family related) and he would ask that I not speak so she wouldn't know that me and him were together. I asked once if she knew about these meet ups at all and he responded with ""she doesn't need to know"". Which really weirded me out but I figured that perhaps it was just easier if she didn't know so I didn't ask or think about it further. A few weeks pass and he starts to ask about my tattoos and my plans for getting future tattoos (he only knew about them because I had mentioned I got my first one earlier this year and I was excited about it). I didn't think that was too weird either considering it seemed like a normal question anyone would ask but what really made me cringe was him asking constantly, week after week, ""when are you getting your new one?"", ""you should let me know when you get your next one so I can go and watch you get it done!"". 

Another comment he made was wanting to meet up to go on a run sometime so he could ""see you (me) in your workout clothes"".

I could literally go on an on about the weird comments and texts I have been getting from him, he's asked to meet up again for lunch but I really just do not want that and frankly, would like to not see him ever again. My question to you all is this: I'm not sure what to do and how to go about this. I want him to STOP talking to me, I feel like I owe NOTHING to him with how uncomfortable he is making me but I feel like if I tell him to stop asking me about my tattoos and to stop texting me because it is making me comfortable that this will stir him up to ask questions and to pry which I feel like I just don't owe an explanation. You're creepy and you're saying some really creepy things and my instinct is telling me to get as far away from him as possible. 

My fiance says I should just tell him to stop texting me but my best friend says I should just continue ignoring his texts (in hopes he will just get the hint and stop). What would be the best thing for me to do without stirring up too much drama?",15Jan2020,1

886,"I’m nearly seventeen and have always been shy. I remember participating in sports when I was younger and even then I was a little reserved. For maybe six years I’ve floated by and rarely talked to people other than neighbors, /some/ teachers, my parents, and a group of troubled girl-friends in middle school. Over the last year Ive grown out of these friendships to focus on school (they are into partying.. sex.. stuff along those lines - things you expect teenagers to like.) Now I have no friends in school and am close to getting my license . I stress out about everyday situations.. reading in front of class and approaching teachers, cashiers, and older students that I don’t know. However I feel like I’m friendly and I know Ive done nothing wrong.. I’m not embarrassed of how I look. I think I’m average and I talk regularly! I just freak out about certain interactions. I’ve gotten better along the years. However.. it’s time for me to get a job and I’m freaking out. I feel like I’m so inexperienced compared to everyone else (even though i’m glad I don’t do the things they do). I feel like I’m not old enough to be doing things alone or talking to adults without being perceived as a baby. I’m not scared about working, more so about going into an establishment and asking the workers for an application. I’ve done community service for school and served ice cream to kids and adults before and had no problem but I feel as if I’m in fifth grade.. when I’m definitely not. It’s weird. I don’t even know what I’m rambling about. I just want to know I guess.. does everyone go through this? Is it just growing up? I always worry about casting myself in a certain light in front of people. I never want to look rude or ungrateful so I sometimes keep to myself. Which comes off as awkward, quiet, or weird. I’ve definitely missed out on things that would’ve benefited me due to how nervous I get as well as how people would view me. 

I’m sorry this was all over the place. I just want a job and to feel my age. Although I’m far more mature than other people my age.. just inexperienced in life and very nervous. For example I never party and am in college classes. My parents know of my nervous streak and they simply respond with a laugh, “don’t be stupid.”

Again, I’m very lucky to live the life I have and have the freedom I do in my house - even though I never use it. I don’t want to seem ungrateful for the things I have. It certainly could be a lot worse and I’m aware.. I just feel trapped.",15Jan2020,1

My kids think the father walks on water and refuse to believe he's capable of lying, they've told me that numerous times. So, naturally they have grown up believing these lies told to them. Last night there was a nasty incident over the phone and they essentially (the 3 of them) told me the kids won't go to counseling with me because they don't trust me and I don't ""admit to the lies""...

891,"My lovely boyfriend is having a really tricky time at the moment - his grandfather has been slowly deteriorating with dementia, and due to a recent unexpected fall is expected to pass within the next few days. This is absolutely devastating for the family who are very close and really care for one another, and especially my partner as he has had a strong friendship with his grandfather (as well as taking an active role in his care).

As somebody who has never experienced grief before, I am really unsure of how to be supportive. I am supposed to be moving from another city to live with him (in his house) from next week, but can imagine that two major life changes could become very overwhelming (however, I equally don't want to back away when he may value the comfort and support). Also, he has a very close family around him and I do not want to be an unwanted distraction or intrude on their grief. 

However, I also know that he is a staunch optimist and likes to look on the bright side of life; he is always the first to find comedy, humour and distractions for the people around him when they are going through a rough time. Should I take this queue to be lighthearted and aim for distraction, or should I be more forthright? Is there a good way to make sure that I'm supportive when he needs it, but not stifling or intrusive? I desperately don't want him to feel like he doesn't have an escape as I know he struggles to be surrounded by sadness, but also don't want to avoid the topic altogether!

Is it best to be normal and continue with moving plans, or give him a little time and space to breathe and continue his normal routine? It will be the first time he has ever lived with a girlfriend and I am sure that he has had some worries already anyway (though we have definitely honest  and productive discussions about these), and this could potentially be a bad time!

&amp;#x200B;

Tl;dr: I am about to move in with my boyfriend who's close grandfather is expected to pass away shortly.

915,"Background: I'm 25, male, and I live in NYC. I lucked out and got an internship at a top production company right out of college. I worked my way up to associate producer and then, last May, I quit. I was treated like crap, paid a laughably low wage, and received no benefits as I was a ""freelancer"" despite working there full-time for 3 years. It got three promotions out of them. It was time to go.

I had an incredibly difficult time finding a new job. I decided to pivot to the advertising world, which has more opportunities in NYC than the entertainment industry.

In October, I was offered a job as a producer for an ad agency. I couldn't believe it. I had only been an AP for a few months before quitting, so I was essentially skipping an entire job level. And the pay was *literally* 3x what I had made at my previous job. The job was presented to me as a ""freelance at first"" gig that would eventually turn into a full-time job with benefits. I loved it...until I didn't get offered the full time job. I had honestly never experienced such humiliation and disappointment before. (I later found out that four people had ""tried out"" for the same job before me, so that agency obviously wreaks of bullshit and ultimately I think I dodged a bullet).

Today, after *eight* months of unemployment and (not including the month at the ad agency), I was offered a freelance gig for a few months. Not ideal, as I'm almost 26 and need a job with benefits, but it's a producer position for a cool ad agency. I just had a call with them about my responsibilities and frankly, I'm terrified.

This job sounds pretty intense, with a quick turnaround and high expectations. I do not feel qualified for this position, but I can't fathom the idea of turning anything down. In a general sense, I have confident in myself. I'm intelligent, creative, and I can learn whatever I need to learn. I can solve any problem. That's what a producer *does*.

But what if I show up and have no idea what I'm doing at all? I know that they saw my resume, and I don't feel that I misrepresented myself or my level of experience...but I technically only have *one month*of experience working as a producer in advertising. I learned a ton, but I don't feel that it's enough to hit the ground running at this new gig, exactly.

There are a million reasons why I should and *must* take this job, but all I can feel right now is pure, unadulterated anxiety. It's a high-level position with a ton of responsibility, and there's roughly a 50% chance I'll have no idea what I'm doing. I know that, to a certain extent, everyone experiences these concerns when starting a new job, but I think it's a definite possibility that I may be unqualified for this position.

917,"So a few days ago i made this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/emi8bt/teachers_advice/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
And since then my teacher informed me i would be his TA for the 2 classes with him. No big deal right? Wrong. Today he asked me if i had my license and i told him I'm only a few months away and that i have a car but asked why. This man wants me to be his actual TA. I'm a sophomore!! I feel like he's starting to expect to much from me and I don't know what to do he even told me he's looking at internships for me. This guy hasn't even been our teacher for a month,  Please help!

918,"Thanks in advance to those who read this and provide feedback.

I'm in my last semester at uni. and I have two competing job offers for post-graduation employment at my feet right now and would seriously benefit from some outside perspectives and advice on which one I should consider taking.

Obviously ya'll aren't going to be able to determine what the perfect move is for me as you don't know me or my circumstances to their full extents, but I'm hoping that even if you can't confidently recommend one offer or the other that you'll be able to point out some ways in which I might go about discerning which one is better.

I'm trying not to give too many personal details, but if you need specifics just ask and I'll see what I can do. I currently live in the KC area.

The first offer is from the company that I currently am working at. I've been interning at this company since summer of July 2018 going part-time during school and back to full-time during the summers. I am an hourly employee at 22$ an hour which will transform into a salary of ~$74k with a $2500 signing bonus should I decide to go full time. This signing bonus does come with the drawback that I have to stay at the company for one year following the payment of the signing bonus to me under penalty of having to pay the entire $2500 back to the company. 

The second offer is from one of the FAANG companies out in the Bay Area, but it isn't for a regular full-time position. Rather, this is a contractual position that lasts for one year with a ""high"" chance of being converted into a full time employee at the end. This position offers $118k in salary with full benefits and at the end of the one year I will receive bonus of $15k regardless of whether I convert or not. The company is also offering relocation benefits as well. Should I be converted to a full-time employee my take home pay will increase either through a straight salary bump or through salary + stock.

I have zero doubts as to whether or not I would be converted to a full-time employee should I choose to take the second offer, which makes the decision seem rather obvious on paper if all I were to consider is take home pay and benefits, but there are other factors that I am considering and these are the factors that I need ya'll's perspective on.

**Cost of Living**: The Bay Area is obviously going to be at least 3x as expensive to live in as KC and if I were to try and live within walking distance of my would-be office it probably be around 4x. Are living expenses going to be so bad that they turn the $118k into something equivalent to ~$74k in the Midwest?

**Commute Times**: This one is big for me. How far should I expect to be living from my office space in the Bay Area? Right now I have an average commute time of 30 minutes which is more than acceptable, but if this were to jump to an hour+ in the Bay Area, that would be close to a deal breaker.

**Quality of Living**: How good is life in the Bay Area? Is there diversity? Are people friendly and easy to get along with? Is there plenty to do when it comes to leisure activities?

**Opportunity**: How much opportunity would this job afford me",15Jan2020,1
919,"I think I first noticed this when I went to an amusement park a few years ago. 

Life just doesn't feel the same. I don't have that joy I once had, that wonder and excitement of life. I don't walk outside on a brisk fall day and take a deep breathe and feel that star light up inside of me as I think of all the wonderful opportunities the future has to offer, Christmas morning is nothing more than a time when people purposely go into debt and live in stress just to make people feel good temporarily and the thought of tomorrow is just more stress and weight on my shoulders. 

The only way I can escape this temporarily is by convincing myself I live in a fantasy where after I graduate college I'm going to travel and love my job and have all this money and happiness. My girlfriend lucky keeps me grounded making sure I stay in touch with reality. So at this point I can't live in fantasies anymore.  

At this point I feel like I'm rambling, I think its cause no-one I ever talk too understands and I'm just trying to get it out. Smoking weed doesn't even open my eyes anymore, anti depressants don't work. Finally I've just accepted what everyones said: ""What you're feeling is maturity."" and ""This is just growing up."" I just wanna feel it again, I wanna chase it until I have it. This feeling is what I lived for, its what kept me happy. Please someone tell me what this is, tell me how to have this feeling again. Please. Thanks all in advance.",15Jan2020,1

It was getting later and later and she was falling asleep but keeping herself awake until eventually she said “To be honest I don’t think the bed is big enough, it looks really small”. I’m not sure if that is considered body shaming but to me I personally felt extremely bad about myself. Her boyfriend and I are roughly the same size and they both fit fine on her bed so when she said that I felt very bad about myself and my self esteem lowered. I further on slept in the lounge room because I just didn’t want to be a burden. I’m not sure if this is considered body shaming but I felt personally hurt.",15Jan2020,1

So I have this water bottle that looks like a torch in Minecraft where it opens up at the flame. Today, I get this weird gut feeling in the locker room. My friend wasn’t here today so I just assumed it was social anxiety. But, there were a huge group of boys blocking  the row of lockers where mine is. I felt suspicious and honestly thought my water bottle was going to be targeted, so I put my water bottle out of view of the group. 
   Then, I come back to the locker room and someone says “Oh my god! Your torch!” I see my water bottle is missing and check the rows of lockers before telling a gym teacher that my water bottle was stolen. Then, I check the bathroom and see my water bottle floating in the toilet. I told the teacher and he said he would get it and for me to come back tomorrow. I didn’t tell him about the group but I definitely can identify them. I don’t know if I should identify them tomorrow or try and get evidence or how to get evidence. What should I do?",15Jan2020,1

926,"This all starts with me being friends with a kid my parents don’t really like all that much. He has quite the reputation at my school but all that aside I believe he is a good person and an even better friend. I cannot dent the accusations about the things he did because I started doing them too, skipping school,    stealing from shops and many more stupid things. 

My parents have not forbidden me from hanging out with him but the tend to limit me from doing so, and that had led me to our joint decision of sneaking out. It worked out well and we had no problems and lots of fun just listening to music and drinking soda, so a few weeks later ( last weekend ) we did it again and for a lot longer, we even snuck back into my house to play video games together. But I’ve been invited again along with another friend and I’m skeptical because I know if I keep doing this I’m going to get caught or get into some problems and I’m already on thin ice for a lot of things. I’m supposed to meet them at 11:30 in his house which mean I leave an hour from now. I scared to go but I know I’ll have fun, as well as the fact that I’ll be letting him down again as I’ve already made up excuses to get out of the past few nights. 

And discussing this with him wouldn’t work out very well because he’ll just brush it off and say I can always stay it his place if things go south like previous times, so here’s my final questions: should I sneak out? And Should I just give it to him straight or make up an excuse again? And should I keep agreeing to these things?

I hope this will be answered soon before I have not choice but to go, thank you for your time.",15Jan2020,1
927,"So, there is this cute coworker that is in my graduate program. In the past which is about 9 months ago, I unsuccessfully asked her out on a date. I got nervous and the words just couldn't come out like I was asking out a girl for the first. I could tell she was visibly uncomfortable and she knew what was happening, so I understood she wasn't interested and mentioned we were cool. I was incredibly embarrased and nothing happened after that. We eventually both got over it and moved on. Honestly, I thought it was for the best since she is in my program and we have common friends and if something did happen between us it could result in a messy breakup.

Fast forward now, we were both at a seminar in my department and I accidentally glanced in her direction and was not trying to check her out. She caught me and now believes I was which wouldn't be a big issue, but she is acting very aloof around me now and seems uncomfortable. Should I even bring this up with her or should I just drop it? I don't want to harm our working relationship, so I'm a bit worried that she might think that I am trying to get with her again when I'm not. I have to interact with her on the reg and I just don't want there to be weird feelings between us.",15Jan2020,1

930,"I hate my job.
I graduated college in May, I accepted a position at my current job shortly after. I started the job in mid to late August. The thing is, I absolutely hate it. When I was going through school I kind of knew that I wasn’t going to like this career, but I stuck with it so that I could start earning money. So now I’m in a job that I really do not like. My job is stressful, especially since I just graduated and I’m fairly new to it. I’m stuck because I don’t know if I’m just nervous about making mistakes and because Its seems like I don’t know very much. Or if I genuinely just don’t like the job. I’m in a position where my work is paying for me to get my bachelors degree and I have to stay there for at least a year or else I’d have to pay back a lot of money. But I just feel totally miserable every day. Even on my days off, the thought of going back into work just haunts me and I don’t get anything productive done. I want to travel more and have a more productive and organized life with more hobbies and interests. But again I just feel like I can’t/don’t want to do anything because I just hate my job so much and it just consumes my life and mind. After im in this position I may have the opportunity to go back to school (if that’s what I choose) and advance my degree. The job I’d be able to get, if I decide to go back to school pays a lot more money. However, I’m not sure I’d like that job (even though people in my family love it). So then I’m also stuck making the decision about going back to school and making a lot more money or if I should just stick with the degree I have now and just switch jobs in a year if I still hate it. Just asking if anyone else has ever had a similar experience about hating their job and what you did about it!",15Jan2020,1
931,"Context: I am female, and I was having a conversation with my sister the other day about children. I told her that should I choose to have children I’d much rather adopt over having children of my own. This is mainly because I feel like if there are already plenty of children out there who are in need of loving parents, then why deny them that chance. Also, even just thinking of being pregnant always leaves me grossed out and terrified. I understand for some people it’s a beautiful experience, but I cannot imagine myself  being happy in that position.  My sister believes that I shouldn’t deny myself  the chance of having children of my own flesh and blood, and says it’s selfish of me to want to adopt instead of having biological children. 

I guess I’m just trying to figure out whether I need to change my views a bit, or if it’s okay for me to continue believing that.",15Jan2020,1
932,"
I have always had issues with myself but over the past several months it feels like everything has piled on at once. I can’t do anything anymore it feels like, I tried going back to the gym yesterday but I didn’t complete the work out because I just couldn’t motivate myself, I had been trying to learn to sketch and I enjoyed it but now I can’t bring myself to practice it anymore, the only thing I’ve been able to keep up is my diet.

 It feels so pointless to try or do anything because I know that nobody wants to be with me. I have tried everything in my power to give myself some appeal but none of it works, I thought maybe it was because I was overweight but I’ve lost 80 pounds and still no one is interested in me. This hurts so badly because I worked so hard to get to this point and what was it all for? Just to be healthier alone? I don’t care about being healthy or being fit, I just want to have the opportunity to have some chance at finding somebody who feels like I’m worth their time. I wish that somehow I could articulate how defeated and demoralized I feel when I see myself in the mirror every morning, I have grown to absolutely hate myself.

I feel like an insane person because it’s almost all I think about anymore, no matter if I am hanging out with my friends or playing games or whatever these thoughts are always in the back of my mind. When I daydream in class I’m lamenting over how ugly I looked before I left my dorm. My friends always tell me I’m an attractive guy and that they can’t understand why I have so little success but I can’t help but feel so irritated when I hear stuff like that. Obviously I don’t try to express my frustration but i just feel like if I were anywhere near even average somebody would want me.

I’m just at the point where I think about suicide quite a bit, I would say at least twice an hour. I don’t think about plans for my future life anymore or daydream about stuff I’ll do when I graduate, it feels silly to pretend like I don’t know how it’s going to end. I have no resources to reach out to for this, I’ll never be able to afford therapy and I don’t have people in my life I can talk to about this. I thought about asking on r/suicidewatch but they definitely don’t promote any help.

I feel like this is it, like no matter how hard I try to improve my situation that I’m just screwed regardless. The only things that have been keeping me going is drinking and weed, I don’t know how else to cope with this. 

If you made it all the way through I appreciate it, any advice is appreciated.",15Jan2020,1

He threatened with kicking me out of the house for that, and to stop paying my college (college being the only thing I use his money for).

I was given a list of rules including telling them where we would be going and knowing info about the guy.

So I told him that hes finishing his GED online and then going to a local community college before transferring to my university. This did not sit well with my parents as they want me to date someone at my same level of education. They said I could talk to this ""friend"" but discouraged me for dating him. So I havent we've met up for coffee and we have watched tv and have just talked and played cards. However he invites me to meet his family this weekend as they want to make sure I'm not like a drug dealer and want to see the girl their son is seeing.

I was ecstatic as this was completely new and very exciting. So I called my dad and told him and was immediately shot down saying well whos this guy. I told him it was still the guy from before and he said that would be bad as I shouldn't get to serious with him. I didnt argue as I was taught to never talk back said ok and the topic was changed. After hanging up I was crushed this guy isnt bad I see why they are worried but I am happy. I get this could be hormones or excitement that omg this is my first date but still.

946,"Slight cross post from r/AmItheAsshole. I've been deemed NTA, so now I'm looking to get some advice on how to go about this... 

 I've been in my loft for a year, signed a 2 year lease in 2018. I love my place. It's located in a Garden District community of a nice little artsy side of town in my city. The loft was originally listed as a 2B[r/1Bath](https://www.reddit.com/r/1Bath/), 850 sqft for $950. When I went in for the tour, I noticed the entrance into my apartment is a quaint area. You'd really have to tiny home this place in order to fit a living room, dining table, etc. The loft upstairs is what my landlord was considering to be a 2nd bedroom. Since the stairs leading up to the loft take up so much of the space in that room and it lacks a door, it looked to be better suited as a small living room. So, I told my landlord it would just be me and asked him to please drop the price to $900 for a 1Bdr/1Bath. He agreed and said that the price would increase to $950 the 2nd year (this year).

My landlord is a great guy. He commends me often on being a great tenant. I pay my rent every month 2 weeks early (usually between 20th-25th). I am quiet and self sufficient. It's been a great year in this place. In December, my landlord sent me a copy of our lease and asked me to please re-sign. I had already submitted payment for January's rent at $950 as agreed upon. I asked him if he wanted me to modify the lease to include $50 increase and he said yes. I have yet to do this. What's holding me back is the house (HOUSE, NOT LOFT) across the street from mine just came up for rent. The tenants lived there for 6 years. Although the sqft details aren't listed on the zillow post, it's evident from the photos that it is much larger than mine by at least 200 sqft. Included with this rental is a 2 car VERY SPACIOUS garage, fenced in backyard, lawn maintenance, and pest control. It is a 1bdr/1bath listed for... $900.

Ideally, I'd like to text my landlord with the link to this zillow listing and ask him to keep my rent at $900. I just don't know how to word that. Are there any landlords on here that can shed some light on how you'd like to be approached with this question? I would HATE for him to get irritated by me asking.

955,"TL:DR - I have had my cat for twelve years, he is unhappy with the attention we give him and have the chance to rehome him to a friend.

Hey reddit!!  My husband has agreed to rehome our cat if the consensus from reddit agrees. Our twelve year old cat Caesar used to be a everything to us, but after having kids, grad school and a demanding career as a director we can’t keep up. The cat has started using our bed and various parts of the house to do his business.... we took him to the vet and he is fine - it is behavioral which I am sure is linked to the pathetic amount of attention he gets. We have one other cat who is vicious and wants nothing to do with him. We can’t rehome the other cat because she is mean, Caesar is a great and sweet cat and I think would adapt well.

My brothers neighbor and best friend wants a companion for his cat and would be thrilled to take Caesar - and even gives treats before and after work. He is a single guy who adores his cat. 

My husband has said how terrible it is to rehome him and that he is a member of the family. I feel that as long as Caesar has a good home it is fine. He can come home if he doesn’t adjust well. Has anyone else done this and did it work out? Thoughts?",15Jan2020,1

The post consisted of him saying “happy birthday baby” (he’s a complete stranger by the way) uncomfortable, I tried to be funny and say “I’m no baby I’m 19 lol” and he said “it’s just the way I talk sweetheart I’m sorry” (a previous conversation before my birthday showed that wasn’t true) and I said “ohhhh boy haha” and then he cursed me out and told me to “grow the f*** up” I really hope he didn’t see the post and got triggered to do this.

957,"This last year I have been a bit of an asshole. I have flirted with a lot of girls, and I have been two-faced and impulsive. I have let people down, and I have been insincere. I didn't intend to do all this, I was a good guy and genuinely believe I still am. A heavy divorce with an emotionally abuse and selfish father, left my mental health in a really bad place. After struggling with severe social anxiety, I thought I had overcome it when I started studying in another city. Everything was going well until I got into situations that ""triggered"" a deeply rooted insecurity, by meeting old and new bullies causing all those painful emotions and anxiety again.

In a way to protect myself from this, looking back, I kind of created a persona that was almost rid of emotion entirely, with a lot of anxiety and emotions, but functional. I ended up hanging out with people that were not all that great, and in the process I acted and behaved in ways that I never wanted to looking back, but still did. Now that I am ""recovering"" from that persona by going to therapy and doing a lot of self work, I am starting to realise all the things I have done and the I have behaved. People around me are starting to see the real me, and everyone seems to not want me around, or talk to me.

\- I have flirted and made girls think that I was interested in them, when in reality I wasn't really

\- I have blamed my mother who was always there for me, for my insecurities. She was always there to help me and she has protected me from my father who could treat me poorly growing up

\- I have treated other people poorly, and I have been selfish and not been a good friend

\- I have friends that I don't want to be around anymore, because of the way they act and behave, and they are making me a worse person

&amp;#x200B;

Did I ruin my social life and relationships? I still haven't fully recovered from what I struggle with, anxiety etc, also anger, but I am getting better, and seeing all the things I have done is making me disgusted with myself.

961,"This might be a long one, and for that, I am sorry. I'm in probably the worst place of my life right now and am barley hanging on by a thread. I've never been in situations so terrible and so stressful before and I have no idea how to handle it. 

I wanna start out by saying, I'm a 17 year old female, I'm very emotionally unstable as it is. I've been diagnosed with bipolar, and then I was told it wasn't bipolar, it was something called major depressive disorder, with anxiety disorder as well. I have a lot wrong with me that I simply cannot afford to get help to cope with it. And to get this out of the way, I had insurance that paid for it all once, but I had to be put on my father's insurance about a year and a half ago, which would no longer cover any expenses for therapists and psychiatrists. I do not have any ways to cope with anything I'm going through.


So now that's that's said and done. 
I worked in a factory for about seven months before I quit back in September because its absolutely horrible and factory work just really, really depresses me. I quit not only because of that, but to be able to spend more time with my boyfriend. I stayed with him almost constantly for about three months afterwards until I got into a wreck with a police officer who ran into the side of my car as I was trying to turn. I made a really, really stupid decision to drive without a license or insurance, and it backfired on me, horribly. I got my car impounded and can't get it out until I get insurance on it. It's been about three months now and its close to 2,000 dollars to get it out and I don't have the money to go to drivers ed, pay 400 for it, wait six months, and then get a license and insurance. I had to go back to the factory and just started two weeks ago, they wouldnt let me start until all the holiday vacation was over. On top of that, I had to stop going to school because I thought I'd have to work full time. They're keeping me there, but using work as my credits/classes, hopefully that makes sense. But they want me to start normal classes back up this Friday and that on top of work, and on top of the debt I now put myself in, I'm extremely overwhelmed. 

It didn't end there. To make a long story short, I just found out my boyfriend cheated on me. He admitted to doing it around 20 times, he wasn't sure how many there were. I'm still in shock and it's been about a week since I found out. He broke up with me twice before, both times around the same month. Each time he said he was just really sad and didn't want to be with me anymore. Turns out, he said he was so sad because of what he did and he just didn't want to put me through it anymore, so he just left. But eventually he came back of course. 
I honestly still don't know what to do or what I want. I'm in agony right now, I'm so stressed out. I'm in hell right now. 
I love him, but I can't look at him the same. Of course nothing's the same. But even still, I just want it to work out, somehow. He says he hasn't done it since before he left me the last time and he never wants to again. That he's changing and wants to get help, he's making an appointment with a therapist this Friday. And I haven't found anything that even comes close to him cheating at all in his phone, where I found out in the first place. And trust me, I'm like the FBI when I search through his phone. I leave no stone unturned. Of course I always ask for permission to look too, I don't like being sneaky about it. 

I know I'm young, but I want this to work, so bad. I've lost almost everything decent in my life because I've given up so much for him and to be with him. He's the last thing I wanna lose. I genuinely don't know what I'd do if I did lose him. My life would almost be too worthless to live.

I just need some advice on how to keep going, how to get myself through the days anymore. I'm so beyond miserable at work and I have all this time to think about how much hes cheated and it just eats away at me. All I can do is stand there, for eight hours and just think and think. 
My life is in pieces right now. I just need something to keep me going, anything, at all. Any advice or kind words would be appreciated more than anyone knows.

963,"TLDR; cross-posted from r/relationships- my best friend doesn't like my boyfriend and I'm not sure if I should confront her about it.

So I have been with my boyfriend for 5 years and have known my best friend for 3 years. My partner has been nothing but supportive to me the past 5 years and I never talk shit about him to my friend. My bestie got dumped by her boyfriend two years ago and has a new girlfriend as of recently. Beginning a few months ago, my bestie would make comments about my partner saying that she thinks he doesn't like her. I told her that he has never said anything bad of her to me (which is true) and that he is just a quiet person (which is also true). I am an extremely warm person which my best friend has acknowledged and said she requires from people, and my boyfriend is definitely not the warmest person but he is also polite. I am bisexual, and since starting to see her girlfriend, my bestie has been making lots of comments about how I should explore my sexuality and how she wants me to experience being with women. I have told her many times that I would never throw away my healthy relationship for exploration, but she continues to make these little comments.

I talked to my boyfriend about this recently and he said this it sounds like she is projecting him not liking her onto him, ( AKA when really, she is the one who doesn't like him). I think he is on to something, but it has also been bothering me that my friend is so unsupportive of my relationship. Even when her last boyfriend was pissing me off by how he treated her, I never told her what to do or to break up with him. 

Should I confront her about this? I am finding it hard to be excited about her new relationship when she is shitting on mine and I feel like it's hurting our friendship.",15Jan2020,1

970,"Lately I’ve  (F16) been feeling really anxious even when I’m at home and sometimes I’ll just burst into tears for no reason and it feels like I’m drowning in my own confusion. 

I think a reason for this weight that I’m feeling is caused by this boy (M17) at my school who keeps harassing me. I’ve known this boy since middle school and he used to date one of my friends and we were pretty good friends back then. 

Long story short he broke up with my friend to date another girl and this caused my friend to completely break down for weeks. Of course I “took her side” in this conflict and he has told me the reason he hates me is because I ‘abandoned’ him. 

I regret never really reaching out to him, but he had a group of friends to fall back to while I only had my friend and a few other people. I’ve always suffered from low self esteem and never really bothered to take a step back and put myself first. 

Now back to present day, he will occasionally glare at me, bump into my shoulder if he walks by and even throw up the middle finger at me. I don’t know who to confide in because it’s been 4 years and he still tortures me. Last year he went as far as to post our private messages of me ranting at him because he kept harassing my friend (his ex). To make matters worse, my heart is racing while I’m typing this post because I fear that he will read this and harass me further at school. 

Today he made me panic so much I had to leave school early and now I’m in bed in tears. I don’t know what to do anymore and everyday feels like such a struggle. 

This whole situation + school work has put quite a bit of stress on me and like I mentioned earlier, I’ll randomly crawl into bed and bawl my eyes out for hours on end over small things. I never feel at ease anymore and I’m frightened that one day he will physically hurt me at school. I’ve expressed my desire to transfer schools but I’m scared he will lash out at my friends if I leave, and my parents believe this matter to be nonsense. 

It’s hard to get out of bed these days and I have no encouragement to do well in my studies. I’m just trying to hold out until I can graduate and leave.

972,"Splitting bills is extremely uncomfortable for me. I once was at brunch and some acquaintances requested to split off their portion of the bill because they had cash. I put down my card for the rest of the bill and the cash payers had the audacity to ask me if I tipped for the whole bill, after we had already left the restaurant. One got upset because she was a server and we under tipped, but no one communicated that they did not have enough cash to cover their share of the tip.

Money is a pretty awkward topic among my friends, as we live in a very expensive city and I make more money for my age than most. I often front bills depending on the occasion and my relationship with the person and assume they will repay me with another favor or a dinner when they do make money, etc. Not a big deal. I don’t, however do this with rideshares or anything like that. I have started to hang out with a friend who I still don’t know super well and I know struggles financially. I covered the Uber’s because she “didn’t have service”. She stayed at my place after a night of drinking and we ordered Postmates. She drunkenly fried up her fries on my housemates cast iron skillet with a plastic spatula on high heat, which is very dumb. I was already asleep in the other room at this point. My housemate was understandably upset to find her spatula melted the next morning. I let the friend know she had done this and she agreed to pay for the replacement. The next day, I Venmo charged her for the replacement ($20) plus Uber’s ($30) and postmates ($20) which I laid out in the request. She texted me to ask if the charge included drinks so she acknowledged it, and I said no because we all bought 1 round and were even. 

It’s now been over a week and she did not reply for 2 days and then texted me about something else when I reminded her. I make it pretty clear that I am not miss moneybags for my friends. I am still pretty frugal so this is not a small amount of money. I don’t want to harass her as I am 99% sure she just doesn’t have the money, which IMO she should be honest about and not go out if she’s broke... Venmo also has a credit option which I feel like is a lot better than ghosting a charge even though it’s a 3% fee. What do I do?",15Jan2020,1

 She has liked me since the beginning of this school year or about 5 Months. I didn't find out until early October and she has been getting a little colder since December, yet in class yesterday she was still as red as a tomato when we were talking. I've done some research on Mormonism and I understand that she is not allowed to date me and that likely why she has become increasingly distant rather than her choice. As a person in general I have a very strong logic-driven Identity and I'm quite extroverted and confident. However I've been stumped by this and I have grown sad for her situation. I've thought about all the self-inflicted shame that she has gone through just for having feelings for me. Her situation is about all I could think about for the past week. I want to convince her to at least give me a shot and help her express herself. I've also been thinking about the cost and benefits of dating someone who would need a fresh identity and who had been raised under a Mormon roof and would likely continue to do so for 2 years before most of the benefits would come. The benefits would be I'd be able to shape her beliefs as she would be in a vulnerable point in her life hopefully in a way that is beneficial to her and I and she'd likely make a great partner for having been in the church despite the baggage that would entail. Anyways I've thought maybe there is a 30% chance I successfully convince her out of the church but I would metaphorically kill myself if I decided not to try to get her out of Mormonism and she continued down this path only to find out later that I had the power to do so. 

How do I convince her that her beliefs aren't of love like she would likely say, would explaining shame*,* Us vs Them arguments, and other actions Mormons take which aren't consistent with being a loving human? would that alienate her? If so what do I do so she isn't alienated? How do I convince her that her beliefs are causing her to be inauthentic and is making her depressed? How would I utilize the fact she likes me to help her out of the belief with the above because she'd likely be more trusting, accepting, etc. 

If I shouldn't ask her out what could I do to still affect her path in life? How would I deal with the awkward situation that would make for me in a class where she sits right next to me? Should I still try to convince her out even if I shouldn't date her?

 If I should date her how far should I go to help her out? If I don't Join the church and she gets shunned from her family for dating me how would I go about helping her out? Do I just try to date her mostly online in our free time? How would I help her set a new identity without imposing my will onto her?

993,"hey reddit. i feel so weird typing this out but i genuinely don’t know what to tell my sister. today she told me that she touched her boyfriend’s penis today at school just because she wanted to...... yes. at school. this makes me beyond uncomfortable. it’s nice that she trusts me enough to tell me this, but i don’t know what to tell her. she’s now upset that she didn’t arouse him by what she did and she thinks that he doesn’t like her. since i’m her older sister (18), i feel like i should have some advice for her. i have never liked this boyfriend of hers as he has tattoos and does a few different drugs, so i’m not in support of her careless decision in the first place. what’s a nice way of me telling her not to be stupid without calling her a disappointment (when i am very disappointed). i know that this is a normal age to be sexually active (even though this wasn’t even that sexual haha), but she’s not emotionally mature enough to want to go further with her three-week relationship. 

tldr; my sister (16) touched a guy’s penis AT SCHOOL IN CLASS and idk what to do about it",15Jan2020,1
994,"Hi, 18F here who has no experience talking to guys pretty much at all. I’ve really only ever felt comfortable with talking to guys who are gay or very very friendly and outgoing. 

 There’s this guy in one of my classes who I think is cute. I don’t know if it’s me just being hopeful, but I kinda sorta think he might like me as well (I’ve caught him looking a couple of times in class and when I see him in the hallways I would say we’ve made eye contact from across the crowd a fair amount times, which is kinda unusual for me to do with anyone because there’s so many kids during passing periods). 

Anyways, I’d really love to go up and talk to him, but I don’t really know how to without being too upfront about it. We’re not even at the same table in class, so I just don’t know where to start. We did sit at the same table briefly last semester (stupid teacher constantly switches our seating charts lol) and I’d try to talk to the table as a whole instead of just directly talking to him (I’d ask what colleges everyone is thinking about, etc, etc) but he’d rarely ever talk. He’s just pretty quiet in that class in general.

Now, I would love any kind of advice to be able to talk to him, but I specifically put this in both the AskMen and AskWomen subreddits because I wanted to have both perspectives. Thank you!",15Jan2020,1

997,"Our school is about to do the MMR vaccine and I still haven’t handed in my letter of approval because I’m so hesitant. I don’t know why I have it. I really can’t. But even just the thought of it makes me fear the hell out of me.

Also, don’t know about you, but I’d rather not have a panic attack in front of the whole class, which is what I worry about.

I’ve heard the tips like ‘oh, just do it’ and ‘it’s just a needle’ but it’s even just the thought of it stresses me. What should I do? I feel like everyone will judge me if I don’t do it.",15Jan2020,1
998,"When I was 13 my mother passed away suddenly. Of course this halfs our income. My dad has not adaated well and this has made our financial situation worse. We have 2 cars one sports car and a work van. 


We have 2 pets which we can't afford to take care of and now when one of the cats needs treatment he wont pay for it as its just ""delaying the inevitable""

I'm extremely upset by this decision. While I live with my dad I make £18.60 a week which my dad takes. I don't mind paying this but I eat one meal a day. This isn't a big meal and I am severely underweight. I sometimes beg for food from my work which I get but it's not enough. 

I've tried budgeting with my dad but he doesn't have it and doesn't recognise a problem. My brother who is 21 is in college and pays £80 a month to live at home and he gets fed whatever he wants. It's always a problem with me. I don't know what to do.

I could try getting a better job but I really don't know what to do. I don't even know what I'm asking for I just want my life to get better.",15Jan2020,1
999,"I lost my job this past summer where I had potential to make a lot of money and secure my future. It was just a job that I kind of found myself falling into, but it's my fault I don't have it anymore because I ended up dating one of my subordinates (who I am now married to). Long story short, everyone found out, and I was fired for it.

I'm not as mad about not having that job as I am that it really dawned on me that I was ready to commit to an unfulfilling job that made me miserable and now that I don't have it I don't know what can make me happy to get up and go to 40-45 hours a week.

I love computer hardware. Building computers and figuring out how to get it all to work and troubleshooting them and finally solving the problem is probably the only thing I'm super passionate about that I can see myself making a career out of, I just have no idea where to start.

Any suggestions for career ideas or how I can use my passion for computers?",15Jan2020,1
1000,Basically he invited me to come over and hang out with him and I wouldn't even give it a second thought if he weren't 17. He said we can just chill in his basement and chill which honestly I'd be cool with if he didn't live with his parents. We work together and I always try and take care of the newer younger guys at my job but it just seems kind of inappropriate to me to hang out outside of work. Especially alone.,15Jan2020,1
