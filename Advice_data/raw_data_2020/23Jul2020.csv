0,"I‚Äôve been playing with the idea of leaving soon after getting my physicians assistant degree (and I know some countries accept it). I just want somewhere with a higher standard of living. I grew up in Miami and moved to NYC in 2015. I like urban settings, but still not too far removed from nature. Nothing too rural. 

I loved the idea of moving to Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, Switzerland, or Iceland, but I don‚Äôt know any of those nations‚Äô languages so it‚Äôs not realistic unless I prepare for more studying. I can speak some Hebrew, so Israel can be an option. I speak a little Japanese too but I don‚Äôt see Japan hiring a foreign medical professional who isn‚Äôt fluent. Currently thinking about Australia. Or Canada. I haven‚Äôt done much research yet but thought I‚Äôd ask around for the heck of it.

I always hang out with friends or my girlfriend on my days off, sometimes I have multiple different things going on in one day. There isn‚Äôt a day where I don‚Äôt find myself doing something with someone. I found that being alone though I really don‚Äôt know what to do with myself. I have hobbies like, making music, playing video games, writing, drawing etc. but I‚Äôm not interested in doing those things all of the time, I‚Äôm more interested in just being around someone and I find it kind of lonely being by myself and I just don‚Äôt like it. I don‚Äôt know why, and I‚Äôve been trying to be able to be happy just doing my own thing by myself but I really can‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt know why though. Does anyone experience this?",23Jul2020,1

I don't have earplugs and a comfortable headphone to sleep with at the moment, so I can't put those on/in. My roommate games at night and idk what he does, murder is computer mouse or something but he ticks with his mouse on his desk and the walls are paperthin in our house. And I can't stand the ticking noise anymore. I do think it's unreasonable to ask to stop gaming, so I have to come up with a solition myself. But I don't know how to lock out noises. I am extremely fixated on the ticking noise and that makes it more unbearable. Can you guys help me get through the night?

6,"They say I spend an entire day on my laptop and because of that I am addicted and depressed.

They say I play video games entire day and I haven't played one in months. I know they don't make any sense but I still get upset. I mean all my books and my music is already available online, even my school assignments. They are in their 60's and they only know how to turn a laptop on and off, and how to bitch about stuff on Facebook.   

Today when I was cleaning I left a rag on the floor and they made a fuss about it. Apparently I should leave it in a plastic bag (I was going to use it again in like 10 minutes). Once they even complained about shoes on the floor.

8,"Theres this one teacher in my school who everyone says is a nonce.He teaches music and i assumed it was just rumours.Anyway for some reason every lesson he would tell all the student ""look after your balls"".He gave us all balls for activities which had nothing too do with music.Anyway it sounded really wrong when he said the balls thing but everyone just laughed it off and he proceeded too start talking more about the balls in a way he could not possibly be saying this unaware of how it sounded like he was describing genitals.I thought nothing of that aswell..

until one lesson he told all the students too lie down.Everyone obeyed.He told a few people they werent lying down correctly and moved them and touched theyre legs.He touched my legs aswell.Also by ""not lying down right"" he meant they werent doing it the exact way they were supposed too.Its not as if they were messing around or anything.

Idk if any of this other stuff is important but imma say it anyway

I go too an all boys school

People from other classes claim he did it aswell

Hes not a nice person

Lately though, I‚Äôve been having dreams of men, in a somewhat romantic way?? I‚Äôm really not sure. I‚Äôve been having them with the same guy where it‚Äôs just a dream where I lay with my head on a mans chest and I feel like I‚Äôm in heaven, it‚Äôs so calm and comfortable. I never see the mans face but I can tell it‚Äôs a man, I can feel it.

The person I currently have the most massive crush on is genderqueer, they have the body of a female but lately have been talking about wanting to transition a bit to be more masculine and fit their ideal gender and body type for them. I want advice on what these dreams may mean? When I wake up I don‚Äôt feel the same about the dream guy, but the way I feel in the dream is the way I have felt when i did the same with my crush.

I‚Äôm never going to be able to date the person I like because they are in a relationship with a guy and even though they say they love me I know I could never date them open relationship or not, my romantic feelings will have to stay to myself and I don‚Äôt know if that ties into it but please help me understand this a bit.

12,"warning: semi-explicit non-consensual below

hello. i‚Äôm a teen and female. my mother recently remarried (a year ago) and recently in May my step father‚Äôs family moved in with us. we were supposed to move to a new house in June but the construction was delayed.

my mother asked me if i would share a room with my step brother who is my age. we brought in another bed and it was actually fun for the first few weeks. we would play video games all night and talk and then fall asleep when the sun started to rise. we would wake up in the afternoon and have a late breakfast, i would always wake up after him, and then do it all again.

it was nice until about two weeks in. i woke up to him in my bed. i was foggy, so i asked him what he was doing and he told me he had a bad dream and just wanted to lay next to someone. i said ok i get that and i hugged him because he seemed really out of it. i didn‚Äôt know at that time he was doing something bad and acting that way because i‚Äôd potentially caught him.

fast forward a week and i wake up to him in the other bed in the dark taking pictures of his boner underneath the blanket. i know it because 1) it was a thin blanket, 2) he used flash, and 3) shadows. i said nothing and literally laid there in horror listening to the sound of him touching it and finishing and then (i assume) sleeping in the mess.

another week passed and i made sure any time i woke up i didn‚Äôt look around i just went back to sleep. he was super cool that week. didn‚Äôt wake up with him in my bed and when i did wake up once he was asleep. but. one day we stayed up really late doing basically acrobatics and stuff and he said if we push our beds together we would have more space to do it.

... i didn‚Äôt think anything of it.

long story short, we went to sleep, and i woke up üòñ to him rubbing it against me. and he kept doing it and doing it until it all came out on my lower back. he wiped it up with the blanket and then went to sleep.

i was mortified. and the next day i just floated in shock and was scared. i asked his dad to move our beds back and explain that we played a game and that‚Äôs why they were together and he thought it was cute (wtf???) and said he‚Äôd ask my stepbrother to move them back. he never did. so that night we laid in our beds still up against each other and i was honestly too scared to even ask him to separate them. i know i know that‚Äôs so stupid but i was afraid.

he did it again. this time i woke up with him doing it rougher and holding my hips. i could feel it even tho i wore really thick shorts to bed. the next day he told me the shorts i was wearing were really ugly and i should dress better if i wanted to be more confident. i was stupid and told him that i was kinda lonely and didn‚Äôt have a lot of friends and he clearly used that against me to try to convince me to wear something smaller to bed. i wore jeans the next three nights.

my mom caught me and asked why i was wearing jeans (our beds STILL together) and i told her i was cold. my mom thinks i‚Äôm dramatic and i was afraid if i said anything she would get mad at me for it.

so that night they put a space heater in the room next to my bed... in June... and I couldn‚Äôt wear jeans. I used the blanket to make kind of a dividing line between us and asked him when we were gonna move the beds back. he just made a joke about it feeling like a bigger bed and said he was gonna leave it. i didn‚Äôt say anything else.

he continued to assault me, each worse than the night before, for another two weeks. i finally went to my mom and told her everything and she told me i was probably having nightmares because the beds being together was flaring up my anxiety...

am i crazy??? anyways

she asked my stepbrother to move the beds apart and he did. fast forward to last night. i had been waking up every night to see if anything was going down and nothing ever was. but last night. i woke up to him in my bed doing it again. he finished, wiped me up with his blanket and just laid there hugging me. 

i whispered very softly, please. stop doing this. he pulled away, asked me if i was awake the whole time and i said yes. and then he made me promise not to say anything and told me he‚Äôd stop.

so that‚Äôs the story so far. i am gonna go to my mom again if it continues past tonight. but does anyone have any advice for how i can protect myself or even make my body less accessible? i‚Äôve thought about a onesie but idk? also, any advice for talking to my mother? she was so not believing me last time and i don‚Äôt really know how to convince her... 

any advice would be great. i left out a lot of the really graphic stuff. if anyone has any questions i will try to reply. he never stuck it in me at all. but he did a lot of things with his mouth and his boner. i just feel so dirty and like i need to do something but i don‚Äôt know what to do.",23Jul2020,2
13,"I‚Äôm on mobile, sorry for formatting and I may put some run-on sentences and improper grammar and such because I‚Äôm currently going though a lot of emotions, sorry.

So I am 17 and I live with my mother 36 and my father 46 and my sister 13. My mother is narcissistic and abusive to me she constantly belittles me by saying things like (this is going to be a copy paste as well as some new things that have happened from a previous post of mine on AITA)  ‚Äúthey manipulate me by belittling me at any chance they get, they threatened to disown me because I wanted to go to culinary school (now going into IT with my mother forcible recommendation) and just trying to always put me down when I try my best for example when I got my last report card for junior year I got a 3.7 (I take all AP classes) and they were angry that I didn‚Äôt get a 4.0 which frustrates me.‚Äù 

Recently (just a few moments ago) my mother screamed at me to come upstairs (some context my job is to do the dishes and tidy up around the house and send my mother pictures and I did that today and I took pictures of the tidying up I have done but not the sink completely void of any dishes all cleaned out and everything) so when I walk upstairs I‚Äôm immediately bombarded by my mother by her saying I did not do the dishes and that I‚Äôm lazy and pathetic. I look at the sink and it has inside of it: A colander, bowl, fork, and pot. I tell her that this was not in there when I went back downstairs after I had done the dishes previously and she said that I was lying so I go over to the sink and accuse my sister of using all the dishes (when making ramen she uses a colander and the pot and bowl had ramen remnants inside it, also my mother is cooking dinner, my father is sat at his table on his phone and my sister is sat at our table reading a book.) and she says she did not dirty any dishes and I said that she indeed did dirty the dishes because I heard the oven turn on (heard it light, it‚Äôs a gas) and my mother says that it wasn‚Äôt my sister because she put the colander in there. And I reply so you knew the dishes were done and still accused me of not doing the dishes. And she said to me (still screaming) that I need to get back downstairs with my ‚Äúbad energy‚Äù and I need to stop ‚Äúpissing on her parade‚Äù so I do and come back up when we have dinner and while eating she continues to rant about how lazy I am and when she says so tell me what happened and I start to explain and she interrupts me and I say I can‚Äôt even talk because you keep interrupting me (she didn‚Äôt like this one bit) and while her screaming at me about how disrespectful I am my father also starts screaming at me saying he‚Äôs going to beat the fuck out of me for disrespecting my mother and my mother is saying that she is going to break my computer (I have an extremely expensive computer with monitors, keyboard etc it‚Äôs an easy 5000 all paid for by me) so I finish my dinner (ignoring them) do the dishes and go down to my room to write this. 

So now that backstory is over what do I do? How do I move away when I turn 18? I don‚Äôt have anyone I can stay with so I have no option I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore I cry constantly because of how they make me feel and even me telling them that they don‚Äôt care.

We told our parents and showed them her picture and they are not thrilled. They have the outdated stereotypes about pitbulls in their minds, and they're worried about how she is going to be recieved by everyone else.

19,"TL;DR : my friend (let's call her Haley) is 80% certain she has ASPD, but she is afraid of it hurting people around her.

Throwaway because all mentioned parties know my main account.

I have a gal friend who I strongly suspect of being a psychopath.

Part 1 : Manipulation

Sometimes, Haley will do something blatantly manipulative and when I call her on it she will agree on all of the details of the event but insist that her thought process is different. Her story is always internally consistent even if it would require some unintuitive logic. This brings up the first part of my question. Is a psychopath capable of spinning such an elaborate fiction that she even persuades herself?

Part 2 : Relationships

To put it frankly, the girl simply cannot maintain a friendship. According to her, she ""falls in love very easily"". From my perspective, she will be calling people ""sister"" or ""bro"" within a week of meeting them, but 6 months later she will text me saying she hasn't spoken to them in weeks. Usually her current friend circle starts dropping off soon after her bouts of ""emotional instability"" (note the understatement, see Part 3).

To my knowledge, the only people Haley has been friends with for more than a year or so are myself and her spouse (call her Melissa), and even Melissa was entertaining the possibility of divorce like 2 weeks ago. I will admit that it takes a mother's patience to put up with some of the horrid things Haley's done and said.

Melissa says their marriage is on the rocks because of a series of emotional affairs. Haley and I often jokingly say she keeps me around because she wants to ""stay human"" (her words) and, to be honest, I can see how Melissa can see emotional infidelity with like half of her examples. 

Haley tells me pretty much everything and I call her on it when I think she's obfuscating. She doesn't really lie, but she does seem to have several ""versions"" of the truth at any moment, she often adds or subtracts details, and the only consistent factor seems to be the emotional impact her words will have.

For example, last month Melissa pointed out that her relationship with a guy (lets call him Peter) looked like emotional infidelity. Now, I ""knew"" for a fact that there was nothing there because Haley is pretty much the lezziest lez to ever lez across the lez. She can find men aesthetically pleasing, but if she isn't Platinum, she's damn close. One night, 2 weeks ago, she came clean and said she ""just realized"" she has a ""thing"" for Peter, maybe this is true and she's capable of crafting a lie so perfect that even she believes it. I, for one, do believe it took her 6 months to admit it to herself. I told her to cut it off but she ignored me. Somewhere around then, Melissa warned Haley, saying if Haley was lying about having feelings for Peter they were getting a divorce. 

About week later I found out that Haley told Melissa about her thing for Peter (see what I mean? Maximum emotional impact) and Melissa said it was happening, they were divorcing. However at time of writing, they decided to ""work it out"". Haley is still talking to Peter. I'm sure Haley did or said something to dissuade Melissa. I don't think Haley physically hurt Melissa (I've never seen her physically hurt anyone, she's kind of infamous for making herself look mean so people don't push her) but she almost certainly did something ""morally gray"".

Part 3 : Empathy

She simply does not experience it.

I was there when her father died. I was there when her mother moved across country. I was there when her childhood dog was diagnosed with cancer and was put down (she wasnt even allowed to say goodbye, she was at work). I spoke with her the day after Melissa told her that she (Mel) was raped by her brother. I was there when she learned she would never run again. I have only seen her cry twice:

1. At the ending of Final Fantasy X.

2. A week and a half ago when aforementioned spouse said they might divorce.

I've never, ever, seen her get to any excess of emotion with the exception of anger. She goes into unthinking rage when she doesn't get her way or when she believes she has witnessed ""injustice"". I think she sees ""injustice"" as an excuse to exercise the darker bits of her personality. That being said I have been her friend for so long because she is a genuinely kind person. Most psychopaths will make elaborate displays of their minor acts of goodness and generosity and so does she, but when most psychopaths will act utterly amoral when they think nobody will catch them and she doesn't really do that. I've seen her deliberately choose to do the thing that would help others, even at the expense of herself, when she thinks nobody is looking and then feign ignorance when people ask who just saved Metropolis.

She also doesn't seem to just ""know"" whats right. Where many people will just help others out of instinct, my friend often pauses with a completely blank, soulless look for about 10 seconds, then one of three things will happen:

1) (40% of the time) She will do the right thing.

2) (50% of the time) she will proceed haltingly with that same soulless look. It will then be a coin flip on whether she will do a good thing or be a total bitch.

3) (10% of the time) she will do something damn evil.

When asked about her process, Haley describes her morality in terms of code. She recognized in grade school that there is ""some sense"" that only she doesn't have. She said that since then she has been building an ""algorithm"" that tells her how to react, but she has to remember to ""turn it on"". I think the reason she can't maintain friendships is because everyone eventually realizes there's something fundamentally wrong with her, and honestly, it isn't very well hidden. Whenever her face expresses love or compassion, there's always something unnatural: she doesn't know how to simulate crow's feet, or the sympathetic smile doesn't reach her eyes. Her responses don't lack inflection like an autistic person, but they are repetitive and she always uses the same inflection. Sometimes it sounds like a computer is playing a .wav when she runs into new scenarios. Like, she will always respond to tragedy with ""Oh I'm sorry [sweetie/dear/love/etc]"" but the inflection and facial movement will have animatronic levels of precision.

She doesn't like ""true crime"" shows because, according to her, its too easy to guess the culprit. She does in fact have an uncanny ability to suss out the culprit (like 80% accuracy with zero training), and shes was absolutely insufferable when she pointed out that Trump was going to win the election by New Years 2016. She voted Bernie but she genuinely seems to still be happier that she was right than upset at all of his fucked up policy or his secret police (dont @ me).

About a week into her ""I told you so"" dance after the 2016 election, I asked how she was able to predict these things and she said ""we are both monsters, but I have the decency to feel guilty about it"".

Part 4 : Counter arguments

1. She has admitted that she feels nothing when people are hurt, but she's scared that her lack of empathy will seriously hurt someone. She's really been messed up since the divorce thing. Virtually nothing seriously frightens her, but she is always visibly shaken when someone tells her she did the wrong thing. It's weird to say, but if she's a psychopath, she is afraid of her condition and herself.

2. Whenever I read about famous or fictional psychopaths, they are always obsessively orderly or otherwise anal retentive. Haley is a frickin slob.

3. She does already have a diagnosis of autism and Narcissistic Personality Disorder. Though both are comorbid with ASPD.

4. If she has ASPD, the only people she doesn't have fooled is herself, Melissa's therapist, and me. According to her and Melissa, Haley's therapist doesn't see it. Primarily because Haley claims to high key dislike pretty much everything about herself and thinks she's pretty much a monster in sheep's clothing. I don't know if believe that, but I believe that she believes it.

So, therapists, councilors and other mental health professionals of Reddit. Is it possible for a psychopath to be afraid of herself?",23Jul2020,2
21,"I'd love some outside perspectives on a situation that's stressing me out a little!

Basically I'm exploring different career options as I'm currently only working part time and thinking that my current career isn't very viable. I've decided to go back to university, but before that starts I wanted to get my feet wet in another industry I've been toying with getting into (PR).

I found an online voluntary opportunity for an organisation which would involve working on their PR and comms. The interview went well and the company's work sounded super interesting. But, and this was my big mistake, I didn't specifically clarify how much they'd be asking of me in terms of hours, etc.

Now, I've definitely learned my lesson there, but on the other hand the company has been pretty vague on the actual work they'll want me to do. We initially agreed that there wouldn't be any work to do at all on the weekends, and that it would mostly be me promoting their current projects through social media, plus writing a report on their comms strategy. So it sounded like it would be pretty flexible in terms of timings for the most part.

But they've gone from asking me to do occasional posts throughout the week to posting multiple times a day, at different times to catch different geographies, and over the weekend too. I'll get emails asking why I haven't posted on a certain social media platform (like LinkedIn) that day, when I've spent several hours figuring out uploading multimedia content to Instagram, posting three times to Twitter, and updating the company's Facebook profile.

I've also been asked to join several meetings over the next few weeks, some of which are blocked for about three hours at a time, which is tough because I have my paid freelance work to do, on top of family commitments. Plus, they've given me some background reading to do on comms and PR, which has been informative, but it's a lot in terms of hours for a voluntary role.

I've told them I'd work on this report for them in preparation for a company-wide virtual conference in November, and kind of feel like it would be shitty of me to pull out early.

I'm considering telling them I need to pull back a little on the frequency of work, or just focus on one thing (e.g. social media), and promise a certain amount of input per week, but say it will be tough for me to do more than that over time.

But I also just kind of want to quit. I'm realising that this kind of job wouldn't be for me, although I'm wondering if agreeing to do unpaid work is almost always a bad idea because there's bound to be a sense that they shouldn't be asking too much of me unless they want to pay me, so maybe it's not giving me a good idea of whether PR is right for me.

Sorry for the long post. I'm probably being really stupid because I should have established in the interview how much they'd be asking from me in terms of hours, and now I feel like if I pull out I'll be leaving them in the lurch/giving up too easily.

Should I just quit completely or email them saying I'm happy to work on the projects I've already been given but am finding it tough to keep up with the current frequency?

\*\*tl;dr\*\* Currently doing an unpaid role to try out PR work, and finding it a lot more demanding in terms of time than I'd initially imagined. Should I just quit, as my instincts are telling me too, or stick with it a few more months while I have a lot of free time for the sake of getting the experience?",23Jul2020,1

23,"Hello reddit,

So there is this girl in my university who had followed me on Instagram like a year ago and I followed her back, we never really talked or chatted, not even on IG. She is just one of those girls you follow and exchange likes.

Yesterday, a group of my friends sent a short clip of a girl fingering herself (it was nothing serious, a random 1 minute video from a porn website, they occasionaly do so as a form of having fun). I watched the video as I was going to bed.

Over the night, i had many dreams, unusually. So one of those dreams included the girl I mentioned before. 

In the morning, I sent her a DM using a throwaway IG account I had, I just mentioned that I'm sorry I'm anonymous and that I had a hardcore wet dream about her, and that I hoped she was fine, since she was a bit distressed in the dream. I also mentioned that I'm sorry she broke up with her boyfriend (I thought they broke up, she didn't post his photos since a while). I wasn't rude or graphic in the DM, it was a rather short message.

A while ago, she replied saying that ""you think you are anonymous but you are not"" and ""You better fuck off before I get you in something you can't get out from"" and ""I didn't break up with my BF, you wish"".

I got a bit anxious tbh, I replied with ""I never meant to disrespect you in any way, sorry if you're offended, Bye.""

Then I got a bit more anxious, I'm not sure if she read my reply or not, but I unsent all the messages, blocked her, deleted the chat, and deleted my whole IG account, I don't really need it anyways.

The problem is, I don't want any trouble, I know the girl is rich, so God knows who she knows or what she can do (where I'm from, money does alot, and the justice system isn't that superb), but do you think she is bluffing? Am i overreacting?

Ps: I googled if someone can trace my IG account, turns out it's harder to do that if I signed up using an email only (which I did).

Ps: I know that was creepy, I know that. I just want some help. I don't know why I sent the message, I was just waking up and I fucked up. 

Any help is appreciated. 

TLDR: I had a wet dream about a girl, sent her an anonymous IG DM telling her about it, she gets offended and threatens to cause me trouble, I deleted the account.",23Jul2020,0

25,"I have missed a decent amount of work in the last two months, about 6 days. My dog died, and then my grandma fell and I had to take care of her after they put her hip back into place, and I went many sad sleepless nights mourning my dog who I had since I was 12, and I'm now 21. All while helping my grandma. Ontop of that, I got insecticide poisoning at work because bug spray somehow made it through my shirt and into my vape, and then I inhaled it. I today, just ate shit while walking my puppy, and skinned the top of my foot and rolled my other ankle really badly. I can barely walk, and my job is mobile, I walk almost 3 miles a night at work.

I called my boss, and got reamed. I was told ""this really is unacceptable and would not work, as youve already missed a lot of work"" I didn't know what to say, other than ""I know"" and he said ""I know you didn't try to roll your ankle, but you've missed a lot of work"" to which I replied, that I have had a lot of bad luck in the last couple of months, and that I really wasn't trying to make things hard on my co-workers or him. He said ""thanks for the call, bye"" 

I'm really not trying to be like ""feel bad for me"" towards him, but I feel like I do warent a bit of a pass this one time based on the circumstances. I've done my fair share of jobs as a teen where I would be irresponsible and not show up or miss a lot of days, that's really not what I'm trying to do here, I've grown passed that.

This is a family owned business and the money and is good and I like the job, 2020 has just been as shit for me as everyone else, and the last thing I need is to lose this job.

I don't know if he doesn't believe me, or if I should be handling it differently? I have gone to the doctor and brought a note each time I've missed work for being sick, just not sure if there's more I can do.",23Jul2020,1
27,Basically are school did Dofe and most of my mates signed up. For some reason at the time I did not really talk to them about doing as I wasn‚Äôt that interested but would have done it if I knew they were as obviously they would have made the experience. I did not sign up and the majority of them did. At this time I felt very left out due to the fact it was all they really talked about at school and always met up after school for Dofe meetings leaving me alone after school by myself on Xbox or whatever I was doing. As time goes by and are friendship group has formed into a more solid group all the members even if I wasn‚Äôt mates with them at the time have all done Dofe together and my other mates at the time who didn‚Äôt do it have left school or become more distanced from our new friendship group. I just feel left out like I have missed a massive part of our school journey and it seems like to me that‚Äôs all they seem to talk about. It just makes me really regret not signing up and makes me feel like I‚Äôm a less valued part of the group because I missed out on this big thing. I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm expecting people to reply to this but wondered if anyone has gone through something similar and how they dealt with it.,23Jul2020,2
28,"so there's this guy who asked for my Instagram a couple of months ago cause he thought that I was cute. a couple of days ago, he hit me up out of the blue saying he had feelings for me. I thought it would be okay just to talk to him as a friend. 3 days after we started talking, this fool LITERALLY introduced me to his whole family and told all his friends about me. The first day we hung out, without any permission, he grabbed my hand not knowing if I was okay with it. I backed away saying that I didn't wanna do all that cause that was too fast. A couple of minutes pass by and he kisses me on the cheek. I dissed the kiss and said he was going too fast and I wasn't ready for all that. He apologized and said he'll go slower. I asked him if he could walk me home since I lived kind of far and he agreed. As we were walking he had his arm around me and just tried to make me feel comfortable around him. We reached my house, and he asked for a hug goodbye. I didn't want to be rude so I gave him a side hug and this fool gives me another kiss on my cheek. later the same day, I confronted him through text about how he was moving too quickly and that I wasn't ready for what he wanted with me but even telling him this didn't stop him. He used his pain from past relationships to keep me around and openly told me that I make him happy. I was afraid of how much further this would go so I ghosted him. The next day, he sends me a video asking when we'd hang out again because he wants to see me. I constantly tell him I don't want to and that im not interested but nothing is driving him away. He keeps coming back and is still saying that I make him happy. the man is a literal psychopath, I don't know what to do.",23Jul2020,1

30,"So I texted my friend and he was being extremely dry. I asked him what did she think about our new marching band show? Which is Star Wars. Cuz I posted the reveal on my snap. And he asked is the show Star Wars. I said he‚Äôs correct. All he says was ‚Äúnice‚Äù I had a feeling this wasn‚Äôt gonna be good. 
Then I said I genuinely think I‚Äôm the only one that likes the show and I said that I don‚Äôt get how he never noticed the shoe cuz I hinted it to him multiple times. 
And all he said was ‚ÄúNah‚Äù 
It was a open ended sentence. So his short reply‚Äôs wouldn‚Äôt make sense if he didn‚Äôt try to answer it. Which he didnt...This makes me more frustrated then upset because it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm talking to a wall. So I had to basically had to ask him what part of my god damn sentence was he responding to. So I told him to explain what part of the text he is replying to. I asked him if it was that hard for him to do all that? He said ‚Äúidk‚Äù he doenst even start convos with me. The least he can do it act engaged. I‚Äôm doing all the work. It‚Äôs exhausting.  I feel like he doesn‚Äôt even wanna talk.
So I told him he‚Äôs a confusing boy. And he asked how. I‚Äôm not sure if he‚Äôs having bad day or what. But we both like the theme of the show, so I thought this would bring us together to chat. But he didn‚Äôt even try. So I got deep with him talking about it how he‚Äôs hard to talk to and understand. All he said was ‚Äúyea‚Äù  

And we are also sexting buddies. I thought he would be up for something. I asked him if he had any plans tonight. And he says he doesn‚Äôt.

31,"So I (32F) have had a situation happen a few times over the last year or so. I have a very good friend (66F) and she is in a long-term relationship (65M) She is like a mum to me, and she has been such a great support to me over the last few years. Her partner and I have always been pretty friendly with each other (platonically) in that time too. I'd like to point out too that I am gay and in a relationship with another woman, just to put it into perspective about how I am not interested in men at all.  


Anyway, about a year ago, I was at a coffee shop waiting for my friend to meet me, and her partner called to ask about something. He was just around the corner so he met me at the coffee place.

  
While we were sitting talking, I had a wardrobe malfunction (button popped on my shirt) and i told him to just tell me if it happened again, because i don't notice. He said he wouldn't, so he can take a good look. He told me that he had dreams about the 2 of us together, and how much fun we had. He mentioned a few times how he loved big girls (I am very overweight) and that I would have a lot of fun with him. I reminded him that he has a partner, my friend! and he told me that in the last 5 years they have barely had sex, because she had lost weight, and he found her unattractive. I told him I wasn't interested. A short time passed and my friend arrived and that was the end of that.

&amp;#x200B;

I decided not to say anything because at the time I had a bit of a crush on my friend (long story) and a friend of mine suggested that I check my motives- did I want to tell her because it was the right thing to do? Or was it because if she left him, she would be more available to spend time with me? I decided to just let it lie, and not say anything.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to last Friday. My friend goes out of town to visit family for a few days. Within an hour of her leaving, her partner calls me. He started by asking for some info from me, but then asked me if I wanted to come over and visit him. When I declined, he called me again 2 hours later asking me the same thing. I have a feeling that he wanted to at least try and hook up- but I can't be sure.

&amp;#x200B;

There have been a few little subtle incidents too, him patting me on the ass, getting a bit touchy-feely, sounding flirtatious (but not just the friendly, innocent kind) and I am worried that he is going to keep doing it.

&amp;#x200B;

But I am also worried that if I tell my friend, she either won't believe me, or blame me for my part, whatever that is. I have had that happen once or twice over the years and I'm worried about losing my friend. We have been insanely close.

&amp;#x200B;

So- should I tell my friend about what he has said? Do I risk losing the friendship? How should I go about telling her? I don't even know where to start.",23Jul2020,2
32,"So, my (29f) son (11m), well I finally gave him a phone. A friend of mine has a daughter the same age, and she‚Äôs had a phone for some time, she‚Äôs in discord etc. nothing out of the usual. My son is homeschooled, and he‚Äôs coming in to puberty, he‚Äôs also autistic but you wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell, one might would just label him as very easily side tracked or maybe forgetful, or if they‚Äôre annoyed with him possibly defiant (but he‚Äôs not rude or an asshole or anything like that). But that‚Äôs why I homeschooled him, he‚Äôs almost at a point where he can go back to school, but maybe one more year. (I‚Äôll put why at the bottom). So anyway, I‚Äôd like for him to be able to interact with more people his age you know (we live in a very small town, it‚Äôs considered a village in the south, so there‚Äôs not many friends here to be made as most everyone here thinks it heritage not hate, and they used to bully him at church and school). So giving him this phone, I put discord on it for him, added her, and then she shared some servers. Now, I know he‚Äôs taking an interest in porn, which fine. It‚Äôs normal. I did too at that age, but I just ran up my grandparents ppv back then haha. But in these servers, there are porn channels and porn bots. How far is too far? My concern is addiction and the wrong people in them but we wouldn‚Äôt know. She did tell him to ask me, but he lied to her and said I didn‚Äôt care. So not her fault, and I‚Äôve been pretty lax about him joining servers so he may have thought I wouldn‚Äôt care. I don‚Äôt want him to feel like all of his privacy has been invaded, but I also want him to be safe and healthy. He doesn‚Äôt know any of the people on the servers except one. I‚Äôd like to get him in better servers where he can communicate and not be bombarded with porn. Most of it is anime. And we‚Äôve had the sex talk. I wanted him to fully and entirely understand sex and how children are made so we can prevent him having children while he too is a child. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôll be having sex soon. But just in case. I‚Äôd rather be safe than sorry. And I‚Äôve been revisiting this conversation about once a year since the first time he discovered porn (was trying to find cartoons and bam, porn at about 5 years old). I just don‚Äôt know what to do you know. I want to be a responsible parent, but I don‚Äôt want to be so relaxed about everything that it hurt him if that makes sense. 

Why I home schooled him. So a couple years ago we put him in a program to help him. When he came back home, I put him back in school down here. Apparently there was talk amongst the teachers and his teacher was incredibly cruel to him his first day because his previous teacher told her he had adhd. She was yelling at him in the cafeteria, and yanked him out of his chair so hard his desk came with him. So after we filed a police report and a report with the school and I called cps, cps deemed her safe, she got away with it and started failing him. So I pulled him out before she could do anymore damage. Several parents were messaging me by the end of the day to tell me what their kids had told them because a few kids were excited to have my son back and had told their parents he was back etc. 

Anyway. How can I be supportive of my son?",23Jul2020,1

36,"Hey guys,

I (27F) feel like I‚Äôm definitely over reacting but at the same time I have a general anxiety about this and wanted others opinions.

Back in like 2004ish i was a stupid kid who played a lot of online multiplayer games. Classically this came along with 11 year old me having online friends and sometimes ‚Äúboyfriends‚Äù. I remember I used to tell people I was at least 15. One time, a dude convinced me to flash my boobs (my face was on screen) on MSN messenger, and he took a screenshot and made it his display picture. He also told me he was going to sell it online in games. Obviously 11 year old me was distraught by this and tbh I think it emotionally scarred me. 

I from time to time worry that the picture will come out. Even though I was 11, I‚Äôm one of those people who has looked pretty similar their whole lives after puberty lol. 

I worry that if I ever had any success and that person heard about it (I have no idea who he is) he would leak that photo of me. 

Do you think this is an irrational fear? Would someone have even kept a photo of boobs for that long? It genuinely makes me worried about having any sort of online presence. Technically it‚Äôs also child pornography so I‚Äôd hope he wouldn‚Äôt share it for that reason. I don‚Äôt know what to do to stop feeling this way and any advice to help me get over this would be great.

Also, obviously I regret this deeply and do not need to be schooled in the dangers of sending nude photographs.",23Jul2020,1

39,"So recently one of my friendships has come into serious question.

Ever since we left high school our friendship hasn't been the same. We rarely hang out, never call each other, rarely have conversations just between the two of us and it just feels like it's over. It hurts because I've never felt that connection with anyone else before, and now it's gone.

We met up in the park to discuss it (us and another friend) and the whole hour it was just her shitting on me and me taking it. To be honest, I agreed with 90% of what she said and I openly admitted to being a lazy friend, but I left the conversation feeling like I gave more than I got. She never tried to admit to anything she might have done wrong.

She's always been a toxic person. From light physical abuse to emotional abuse (dk whether it was intentional or not), she's had her fair share of faults. Yet every time, I was the one who ended up apologising. It was never her fault. She never took accountability. Shes admitted to friends being disposable for her. The other friend I mentioned earlier said that she had to go to counselling after our friend tried to cut ties with her after school (we've been friends for 6 years) for no good reason.

I'm sorry that this is a long post, but we're all meeting again soon to discuss things further and I want to stand up for myself more. I get flustered in arguments and I'm really passive and submissive. At this point, I don't want to be friends with a person who doesn't care to be friends with me, but I don't want her to walk all over me again as our possible last communication.

He is very consistent on what he tell me about him, the only sort of red flag I thought it was that I proposed for us to make some kind of snack exchange but he didn't wanted it because the ship would be very expensive (40usd, so it's indeed very expensive)... but now I got caught up wondering if he brushed it off because it would give me his name and address and he don't want to share those?

44,"First things first, I go to a relatively big school that I enjoy and I have a lot of friends and loved ones in the area. I am thinking of dropping out of the school for the following Fall semester, working a job with the university where I already have a foot in the door (culinary services) for about a year as I have a lease that I signed up for pre-pandemic and cannot be let out of, and then enlisting in the military.

A little about me - I've always wanted to join the military as my dad is in the Army and worked his way up to an Officer position from enlisted. In school, I've always been pressured into going to college because that is what everyone is supposed to do, and you have to go to college to have a good job. After I graduated high school, I felt an enormous pressure to choose the right school or choose the right major, of which I had no particular inclination on where to go. I had spent my youth aimless and carefree. I enrolled in this big state school where I under-performed, to say the least (about a 2.9 average GPA) and to get into the college that I wish to get into, I need a minimum 3.0. I am entering my junior year and, after several major switches that left me severely behind my peers, I still do not have the minimum requirements to even apply to the college. My major does not interest me, and it is tedious and difficult. I don't feel any passion for school, besides the hopeful idea of having a stable job with good income when I graduate.

The prospect of having another semester full of online courses drains me to think about - I am currently taking Calculus II and an introductory Physics class that I have not been able to keep up with. I rely heavily on Chegg to complete my homework assignments, and I have a midterm for my Calculus class tomorrow that I know I will fail. I have already missed two previous quizzes and several homework sets. I cannot do well in this environment, and the idea of having to do it again for the next 8 months makes me incredibly depressed.

I'll lay out my plan like this - I am currently receiving unemployment pandemic assistance (\~$760 a week) until the school reopens this September at which point I will hopefully still have a job with the school culinary services. I have about $5.5k in savings that I am saving for my $540/month lease with my apartment. I currently have no credit card debt, and my student loans are about \~$35k. I plan to work my part-time (hopefully I can get full-time if I drop out) job for the remainder of my lease, which ends in July next year, get in shape and focus on myself and my health and sanity for that time, and then enlist with the military. The branches that I look to join are either the Air Force or the Navy, but I'll take what I can get given my lack of initiative in planning my future. I need a reset button, and I'm wondering what all of you folks have to say about it..

tl;dr: 21 year old junior in college, not enrolled in the college of my major yet due to poor performance and lack of prerequisites, $5k in savings for a one year $540/month apartment, $35k in student loans. Looking to drop out of school, work for a year to focus on myself, then enlist with the military and go where the seas take me. Thoughts are greatly appreciated.",23Jul2020,2

Then, we talked for like a whole week, and randomly she sent me pictures of her, just so I could see if she was pretty, cause she told me she was insecure and had depression, the girls in the picture were pretty, so I started to suspect something was wrong.

Remember she told me she had depression? Well... one day she sent me a picture of a harmed arm, saying one of her closest friends had an accident and died, so she did this and then asked me if I could tell her jokes and spend time with her.

Later on, when I search the images on google, all were from pinterest, incluiding the arm one, but some were not, random pictures showing her dog and her garage.

When I discovered it, I snapped and told her to stop with this shit, cause she broke my trust in her, and she just read it, but never answered anything, not even saying sorry. She lived an eternity away from me, so it was already clear to us that we would only be internet friends, and I even tried to hook her up with a guy.

I know I should just forget this shit ever existed, but talking with her was awesome, and we had a lot in common, we talked all day for like, 4 days in a row... Should I just try to get in touch with her again? Or not?

54,"I'm a 14 year old guy, and my school closed down due to not enough funding. I dont live in a safe enough neighborhood to socialize too much, so that's not a choice.

I was doing pretty bad in online school. and since april,  I started to get lonelier and lonelier as the days went by. (my school closed down permanently in March, so I dont know which school I'm going to next semester.)

I had no life outside of school since all my friends were there, and we lived no where close to each other.

My question is, how do I have social life?

All of my favourite things to do alone, started to get boring, and everytime I feel an urge to do one of them, I suddenly lose hope, and stop.

I started to just consume media, watch netflix, youtube etc. Until I just stopped watching shows all together, I lost excitement for any shows I was watching, and now they're all boring to me.

I've tried to socialize on discord, nobody there, and theres no good way to do it.

At this point, I'm just laying on bed on the edge of tears because I'm lonely. I have no siblings that still live with my parents, and I want to talk to someone other than them.

I've never felt so helpless for this long. Theres nothing to do, nothing I want to do. I would kill for someone to be friends with or to talk to. 

I'm just a shell of a person now.",23Jul2020,1

I did not stop working once during COVID and never got a temporary raise or anything. I got a really small bonus once and that was it.

58,"I don't really know if this post should be here, if not the mods can remove it. 

In India, after you complete your MBBS, you have to write an exam called NEET PG, and depending on your rank you get different medical branches allotted to you, which you choose.

The thing is, I always was attracted to surgical side of Medicine. Performing surgeries, saving lives.
It was something I loved seeing and doing ( the few chances I got supervised suturing jobs.) But now the allotment process is over and I got Pathology.
 
It's not a branch I hate, I was actually really good at it in Second year. 
(For those who don't know, pathology is the place where all your blood work goes,  and all the tumors are sent here to assess whether they are cancerous or not).

But I have very mixed feeling about it. I'm happy that I finally have a career path and will start earning, be independent.
 I've already spent a year in preparations last year but familial matter had come up and hence wasn't able to give it my undivided attention. I thought I would give another year for prep, which would have my complete focus and dedication but corona came and things just got messed up.

This wasn't the branch or the life I had envisioned for myself. 
The seniors, colleagues and friends that I spoke to, are very supportive saying that I will fall in love with the branch when I finally join it. 
But I'm so confused. 
I always dreamed of having a stethoscope around my neck, but now I'm stuck with a microscope.

The next exam is in Jan, I haven't even started preparing properly, while people are already onto their 1st and 2nd revisions.

Since February or so, he has mostly stopped working out, and he eats like absolute crap. He knows he has gained weight and constantly calls himself fat and says he needs to lose weight.

He keeps telling me about how he works out in the mornings again, and is dieting to go with it... I don‚Äôt see any diet. He may be eating nutritious foods, but he is eating 3000+ calories a day.

He told me that for breakfast today, he had an egg omelette hoagie and two muffins from the gas station- that‚Äôs 1680 calories for his first meal! He is complaining about his weight every day and then wonders why he isn‚Äôt losing anything.

I have tried to explain this to him, but he just doesn‚Äôt get it. He thinks that because the hoagie didn‚Äôt have bacon on it and he didn‚Äôt butter the muffins that they‚Äôre healthy.

I have no intentions of continuing my studies and I can't see myself making friends with future co-workers (it makes me uncomfortable). So my chances of meeting new people with similar interests are very slim.

Loneliness has been getting to me lately and I know that it's not healthy to continue this solitary lifestyle.

What are the types of places/events where I could go by myself and talk to people without it being weird? What are the best ways to show people that I'm interested in building a friendship? How can I figure out what the problem is when a ""fresh"" friendship fails?

 Although it's easy for me to empathize with people, I have very little experience with face to face interactions. I often get weird stares when I try to participate in conversations, or I get so nervous I can't find anything to say. I know this is a common problem, but for me, it has evolved into a dreadful feeling of inadequacy and I can't pinpoint what exactly I do wrong in relationships.

71,"So, hi, I‚Äôm a 15F. This isn‚Äôt a recent thing, in fact, it probably started last summer or so. For whatever reason, my mom didn‚Äôt buy bananas for like a month or so until she did so on the request of my sister. So, that night, I ate a banana, because they have fiber and I was hungry, only to feel itching in my throat as soon as the banana slipped down. It felt really uncomfortable and I have eaten banana before without this happened. So I was thinking that it might be this particular banana or something. I told this to my sister and joked that I‚Äòm allergic to bananas now.   


I really didn‚Äôt believe that I was allergic to bananas that time, because I had a banana-nut muffin for breakfast the next morning and was fine. I didn‚Äôt touch bananas again because I was certain that the bunch of bananas were bad or cursed or something. I did continue bringing banana-nut muffins to school as my breakfast. Which is the reason why my mom doesn‚Äôt believe that I was allergic when I told her later.

Well, skipping forward to quarantine time, around late March, my mom didn‚Äôt go out and get much food, but when she did, she brought the bananas home again. This time, I didn‚Äôt eat any. But that night, after dinner, she made all of us kids (me and my sisters)  each have some bananas, because they have fiber and are a good fruit. 

I, remembering that experience, was like, no way, it feels weird when I eat it, I‚Äôm probably allergic or something. My mom pointed out I ate the muffins just fine and that I was overreacting, since I haven‚Äôt ate bananas in a long time so I wasn‚Äôt used to them yet. I think I smell some BS but my mom used to study to become a nurse and mom is mom so I ate some.

Oh my god, the itching got worse, and it almost felt ants were crawling all over, not to mention I couldn‚Äòt swallow my saliva afterwards. 

I never gotten any allergy before so I dunno if this is a valid reaction to bananas. Not to mention that I‚Äôm starting to feel the same reaction, though a lot milder, to those banana-nut muffins. So, is this an allergy? I really think I‚Äôm allergic to bananas, or am I just overreacting? The itching in my throat did died down afterwards.",23Jul2020,2
72,"I've lived in my apartment for four years. It's an apartment within a house. My other neighbors are great, however, this downstairs neighbor (who has lived in this house for 20 years) is constantly bothering me. He's retired and is home all the time. I think just lonely but it's getting ridiculous. For context, I'm a 28 yo woman and he's 60. He's also asked me out in a romantic sense before.

We share a staircase, so when he hears me leaving for work in the morning he'll often come out and try to talk to me while I'm just trying to get out of the house and get to work. Or he'll already be outside sipping his coffee essentially waiting for me to walk out. He has no concept of boundaries. I've made it really obvious with body language and awkward silences I don't want to talk to him but he'll continuously try to rope me into conversation. Sometimes I'll even just walk out and go ""hi I need to get to work."" And then he has this sad puppy look. It's quite pathetic.

Sometimes, he'll be outside when I get home from work (knows my work schedule) and AGAIN try to rope me into conversation. I hate having to make excuses like ""I have chores to do"" or ""I have to feed my cat"". It's gotten to the point where I get anxiety when I leave the house or come home because I'm worried he'll be outside. 

And if it was mutual conversation maybe it would be a little pleasant to have a back and forth. But no, he will go on monologues and tell me these intricate stories that involve people I do not know and situations I simply do not care about. I try to walk away, he keeps talking. 

Unfortunately, when I first moved in I was always really friendly with him because I didn't know how creepy/obnoxious he was. And I think that set a precedent for a while and now he just won't f*** off.

75,"I'm gonna just try to give the highlights. Hopefully thats enough to get some decent advice.

Long story short, I started talking to this girl back in august/September of last year. We started talking because she had a bad break up with her boyfriend (alcoholism, abuse, and all that stuff). We talked for about 2 months, i asked her out, she said yes, but then a day later told me she wasn't as ready as she thought to move on.

A month after that she started talking to another guy, and a short time after that she got back with the ex. I was pretty hurt by it. I started going to counseling. Other similar things had happened to me and thats why I decided to do counseling.

Anyway, the last time we said anything to each other was back in December. I heard nothing from her since then. Not a single hi, or anything at all. Now out of nowhere she messages me and says she's sorry for how things turned out between us and that she never meant to hurt me. 

I had to look and most of the pics of the guy are removed from her social media. I don't know how to respond. My go to response is ""it's alright"" but if im being entirely honest its not. She was the straw that broke the camels back and she made me want to seek out help.

I dont think there's anything she can say to take away the pain I felt, but i also dont want to hold on to any anger or anything negative.

Should I respond with my go to response? Should I tell her how I really feel? Should I reply at all?

I'm really really stressed out. Now I acknowledge, that some of my stress is because of the things surrounding COVID, but it seems like every time I try to get ahead or make my life better, something else happens or stands in my way. 

Right now I'm basically friendless. After my last breakup she took all of our ""friends"" with her. I'm still trying to be friends with her, but she isn't reciprocating the ""bare minimums"" that maintaining a friendship provides, but we still love each other. I'm an emotional crutch for her and I can't seem to get that in return. I feel like a burden to a lot of people now, and so my bar for making friends is SUPER low, even when half the time I know my worth. 

I'm failing to find jobs as a college student, I don't want to live with my mom forever but also with finding a job being so hard AND trying to finish school? Something has to give. Maybe I just needed to vent, maybe someone can give me an idea of where to start, since last year I've felt so much pressure.

81,"I'm gonna be a senior in high school next year.

I've had painful past situations, things that didn't bother me much in the moment it happened or really any time before quarantine, but have started to haunt me and make me angry the more I look back and think about it more. I've done so much dwelling on this crap, running the same script over and over again. Its mostly situations where people were mean to me and stuff like that, as well as failures, embarrassments, and stupid mistakes.

I feel that only some people do that, and others never do that, because they never have pain in their life, or any situation where people were mean to them.

Some times I feel that everyone on this planet can be split into 2 groups. One group, like me, have had past situations where they were victimized, and the other is lucky enough to live out their whole lives never becoming a victim of anything.

The origin of this thinking was because of this book I read, called American Kingpin. It is basically a biography about a guy named Ross Ulbricht who built and ran the Silk Road, a multi-million dollar black market on the dark web. It talked a lot about how Ulbricht's obsession with libertarianism was what drove him to work his ass off and create such a massive project. I'm not going to get into ethics and stuff like that, but no one can deny that Ulbricht was a really intelligent man.

However, it never mentioned in his biography any scenario where one person or a group of people were mean to him during his teenage years. Yes, Ulbricht had failures and mistakes, but those were things that he caused himself. It never mentioned in his biography any situation where someone or a group of people were mean to him, or him getting victimized in any sort of way.

I can look back on my life, and find many past scenarios where someone was a jerk to me.

Is my thinking true? Is it true that only some people get victimized and others don't?

I've made countless reddit posts about my past, and I've also talked to friends in school. Common advice I've heard is to ""move on"" and ""let it go"". A lot of people who I've talked to have said that to me. So I guess the next thing would be how can I actually get myself to ""move on"" and ""let it go""?

86,"
I manage an optometry office with a staff of 10 people. I just started this job last month but I have 6 years of prior experience. I am very disciplined and organized. My prior store was consistently one of the top stores in our region and I had very little input from upper management because I could be trusted to get my work done and meet sales targets. My new boss is extremely hands on to the point that she is negatively impacting my staff. She makes me change my staff schedules on 48 hours notice. I feel like this reflects poorly on my management because I am the one that has to communicate these changes. 

She also doesn‚Äôt allow me to communicate with anyone at the corporate level. It‚Äôs really becoming an issue. One example that happened this week was she told me that everyone on my team was getting a several hundred dollar bonus as our company‚Äôs way of thanking the employees for all of their extra work during covid. I confirmed that the 3 new hires I had would be eligible for this. My new hires never got paid. I was told I was not to speak to payroll. Then the following week my boss told me that she had been misinformed and that my new hires would not be getting the bonus. 

She tends to be very opposed to new ideas. My store is getting a new optometrist at the end of the month and I suggested that I call him and introduce myself to him before he starts and she shut that idea down. I am kind of at a loss because I have always been told by upper management that taking initiative and suggesting new ideas was a good thing, but this manager always seems to shut my ideas down.

Today one of my employees pointed out to me that my boss gets very defensive whenever I ask her questions. I have always gotten along with my bosses before (actually all coworkers) so I am just not sure how to deal with my boss now.

There are a few other examples of her interfering with how I run my store and my staff.  I feel like she undermines my leadership by constantly making me contradict myself to my team. Has anyone had experience with this? Any advice for how to approach this or should i just let it go.

Long story short, most people don't like his wife, but tbh I thought she was pretty sweet. However, that has changed recently. I kept seeing her post on Facebook shit like ""happy that bitch is out of our life now"" and stuff in that nature. I messaged both of them about it and they responded there was a bump in their relationship but it's all ok now. 

Additionally she was posting on her tik tok videos with captions like ""I'm single now"" and ""proud to be on my own"" so I was hella confused because they're married, but on Facebook I kept seeing ""aww honey, I love you"" and them tagging each other in posts.

So yeah,  pretty weird. Then, another friend of mine texted me he was concerned. He sent me a screenshot of the wife's tinder, the bio saying that her and her husband were in an open relationship. Knowing the husband, there are two options. 

1) He's kind of a pushover and is just placating her
2) He has no idea about it, and she's cheating on him
3) There's WAY more shit going on than I even care to know

I feel like I need to talk to him about it, but have no idea how to. Tbh, he knows a lot of people don't like his wife, and I'm afraid he'd think I'm just attacking her/ them if what's going on is actually the first option. So Reddit, I need advice.... what the FUCK do I do?

I got paid 16 an hour plus tips (normally +$200 on my paycheques) to wash dishes, learn how to make food, and eat food pretty much. My coworkers, specifically my supervisors/head chefs have been amazing and treated me very well throughout my time working there.

However, my home life has been deteriorating rapidly to the point where it is becoming dangerous for me to keep living here. I currently live with my mother (haven't graduated from hs yet), and she has become progressively more abusive. Over the last week she's gotten into the habit of hitting me. I finally decided to give up living here and I will be moving away with my father. 

This leads me to having to quit my job. I feel horrible to have to leave them in such an awkward spot as this time of year we are the busiest. They have also been somewhat mentoring me to be able to perform various chef related tasks and I feel as if I have wasted their time as I'll be leaving significantly sooner than expected. I'd like to explain my situation to them to hopefully have them understand (I'm sure they would), but at the same time I feel as if mentioning my situation makes me feel like I'm seeking sympathy or attention, and I shouldn't disclose my reasoning. Regardless, I plan on giving two weeks notice this coming Friday and do not know how to approach the conversation. Any ideas? Also, is there anything I can do to express my gratitude for how they've taught me various things and treated me?

Mark is me

So my entire life my dad has compared me to Travis when he makes a mistake. When Travis did something wrong it was ""why can't you be like Mark"". And that gave me a huge head like I was so superior. I hate hate hate myself for that

Recently whenever Travis would get mad or whatever at me I would shoot back at him with something or whatever. This got a reaction out of my parents and so I kept going. They found it amusing so for my superiority, I made my brother feel like shit. I hate hate hate my self. 

Travis was put in a shitty position on a job. He was pushed around a lot bc he was the youngest or whatever. He would also walk around with his own arrogance or whatever and he would talk to his elders with disrespect so he got some of what he deserved but let me tell you how fucked of shitty brother I am. 

I was the last straw. Those shots me and Travis made were common, but I didn't realize how fucking shitty he felt and I just added today. He got in a real bad spot and when he said something to someone else my dad told him to walk home. 

We talked for fucking 4 hours and Travis went off. He was clouded by his rage and didn't see what the parents were saying and it was just bad. I fucking hate myself because even if i didn't cause it all, I didn't help like a real brother should. I was a A FUCKING CUNT and I hate myself for it.

99,"i‚Äôm a 16 year-old girl and as the title says, i‚Äôm not sure if i am a maladaptive daydreamer or not but i think i might be and i was hoping maybe some of you could help me figure it out.
i read an article in which a woman with maladaptive daydreaming told her story, gave some examples and explained some other things. she said there are two types of maladaptive daydreamers: the ones who create their own stories and characters (whose daydreams are also more vivid) and the ones who daydream of celebrities/characters who already exist. i relate to the second type. i‚Äôm always daydreaming about celebrities (always people i have a crush on) and i can stay HOURS (i‚Äôve stayed 3 whole hours) just making a whole story in my head, thinking of the details, the outfits of each character, personality traits, conversations, the important parts, etc. despite imagining the celebs, i obviously kinda make them my own characters, i shape them into what i think they would say or how i think they would act in real life but they always end up being different from the reality (obviously).
not only do i create an infinite amount of scenarios but i also get emotionally attached to the characters. it‚Äôs like i feel less lonely when i‚Äôm daydreaming about dating one of those characters and how everything would go. i start feeling like that‚Äôs real but then i remember that it isn‚Äôt and it just makes me so sad and numb and insecure and it makes me wanna cry (and sometimes, i do). it makes me feel like i‚Äôm ‚Äúlosing my grip‚Äù on reality. for a few moments, i forget that none of that‚Äôs real, it‚Äôs just my imagination and it ends up making me feel lonelier than i was before starting. it‚Äôs like a small world outside of this one, where i can go whenever i need and whenever i want to be that character that i associated to myself because it is the me i would like to be but it always ends up making me feel bad, at some point because none of it‚Äôs real. 
the woman from the article also said that she could stimulate herself sexually without touching herself. (please don‚Äôt judge me) but sometimes i do it too and i always wonder how in the HELL i can do it and it always makes me feel bad. (i‚Äôm saying this because i don‚Äôt know if people without maladaptive daydreaming can do it or not). 
i also can‚Äôt keep myself from daydreaming when i drift off but i can start another scenario whenever i want (if i do it on purpose, i will get distracted and start daydreaming about other stuff in the middle but i manage to go back). 
there are also other things that i can‚Äôt really remember right now but these are the main ones.

109,"This is a situation going on for a long time, and partially my fault for not setting a boundary or letting him think I always want to talk.

I am a huge introvert, and sometimes I can‚Äôt deal with constant conversations or else they drain me. Some coworkers I‚Äôm fine with, because I‚Äôm comfortable talking to them however others I rather just smile and walk by.

My coworker works in a different department but I see him frequently around the store. At first, we started talking just about normal things and end it off with smiling at each other each time we walked by. However, past few months he constantly stops to talk to me as I‚Äôm on my way back from my break. He does this with everyone, but I can only handle so much talk it overwhelms me. 

Every time I‚Äôm at my counter he comes up to buy snacks for his break, then proceeds to talk for another 5 minutes slowing up others. No joke every time he works and every break he has, he does this. I‚Äôm kind of curious how he is so slim based on how many packs of cookies he buys each day.... anyways I get he is being friendly, but him saying he is an introvert himself kind of boggles my mind considering how much he talks. few times I‚Äôve been late coming back from my break because of him. Or sometimes he stops to talk when I‚Äôm going home. I don‚Äôt like to complain much but dear lord let me go home. 

He‚Äôs made comments about my schooling as I said I‚Äôm not sure what I want to do yet. He gave me ‚Äúadvice‚Äù and said have fun then work my ass off, not to worry about school. Trust me, it might‚Äôve worked for him but it won‚Äôt work for me. Then he has made comments about seeing my mom and I together at the store, and he even stops to talk to her when she is shopping (she gets annoyed by him too). I get being nice, but my mom has told me she tries to avoid him at all costs. I think he gets the impression that my mom is single (she is but kind of complicated) but it still makes me feel bad she has to sit through him potentially flirting with her. 

Few days ago I was really not having a good day (personal issue wise) and my social energy was at a all time low. I was going for my break and he kept saying hi to me and asking how I was, and I tried to give a simple answer as I browsed through my phone going to the staff room. He kept talking and then later after my break he asked if I was tired. I said yes, but that I wasn‚Äôt in the mood for socializing. He asked if a went out late last night and I said no. Then he asked why I was so gloomy, despite me telling him I just wasn‚Äôt in the mood. 

He laughed and asked if it was the customers or coworkers, then said ‚Äúoh I hope I‚Äôm not the problem‚Äù. I felt bad if I confronted him but honestly I didn‚Äôt know what to say. I said that I just in general was tired. There has been a few times he said things that made me uncomfortable, like him mentioning customers flirting with him or his dating life. Even said I can rent a place from him when if I move for school (he is moving to the same city next year as the school I might go to). 

I know it sounds like a small problem but every time I avoid him he is there. I just can‚Äôt stand there and talk for 10 minutes, he honestly kind of annoys me. I feel bad for saying that but sometimes I want to just do my job and go home. Plus, he shares way to much for being 50 to a 20 year old and I find it strange. I started taking breaks in my car to avoid him (even though it‚Äôs seriously hot in my car, I take my breaks as an opportunity to get away from people) 

TLDR; my coworker always talks to me no matter if I‚Äôm on break or not, and keeps coming through my till. He is nice, but over shares a lot of personal information and tries to dig more out of my life that I don‚Äôt wanna share. I‚Äôm not sure how to subtly stop talking to him and focus on my work instead.",23Jul2020,1

113,"My teacher hated my project and me (I'm in high school). Although I was privileged enough to have a laboratory at a prestigious NYC university, I did almost all of the work, brainstorming, and planning of my projects with only my PI's (not the teacher) occasional input/suggestion/review. Every meeting I would have with him, he would consistently comment that I was only doing this for college and would get annoyed that I did not physically print out my documentation of literary research, and rather typed on google docs. He did not give any advice throughout all the meetings and instead chose to insult me for being ""privileged"". After covid19 hit, I could not receive my data from the laboratory, so I began another project, which got published into some international papers (in which I credited him despite not even meeting virtually or emailing). I took this project and eventually lost at regionals (I suspect it for being too simple even though it was innovative I guess).

The issue occurs when I start talking to a few students in NY who made ISEF. One, in particular, told me that he lost his regionals and that I DIDN'T NEED TO WIN THAT TO GO TO NYSSEF. My teacher has been teaching that class for likely 10-20+ years, and a peer of mine went after my teacher told him. Meaning, he specifically neglected to tell me this not forgot. I had planned on using my highly complex project before COVID for NYSSEF, in which I may have had a chance to reach ISEF, which I dream of going to. That ISEF friend told me his teacher found him multiple competitions to apply to, in addition to scholarships and such that he ended up receiving.

I'm not going to let my teacher's distaste of me prevent me from losing out like I did this time. I was thinking that if I was able to team up with a student (in the same regionals), I could have a better teacher that way? I'm searching up for competitions and scholarships myself (I just found out about google science fair, sts, and others), but I really don't know any other ones. This whole ordeal just makes me salty, angry, and sad when I remember that I could've had a chance, but didn't have it because I was too reliant on my teacher. I'm a rising senior, so I lost my chance for ISEF to be an EC, but I still wish to pursue it regardless. Honestly, any advice about what I should do now would be amazing. Thank you.

**Edit**: The international science and engineering fair **(ISEF)** is or is one of the world's most prestigious science research and engineering competitions, is considered a massive outlet for organizations to scout/scholarships, and is also extremely fun. **NYSSEF** is the State level affiliated competition to ISEF (aka if you win here you get to go to ISEF).",23Jul2020,2
115,"Let me preface this by saying I know I am probably being petty here but it still kinda stings, and I wish it didn‚Äôt....

Long story short, I have 2 sisters, one full and one half from my Dad and stepmom. I am very close to my full sister, ‚ÄúLiz‚Äù and we do pretty much everything together. We have been estranged from our Dad, stepmom and half sister, ‚ÄúCarrie‚Äù for about 2 years now, it wasn‚Äôt one big thing, it was 25 years worth of small and big things combined. But, I can‚Äôt help but be irritated.

Carrie is 23 and has 2 young kids that are with my Dad (who is 66) 95% of the time. Carrie works two jobs and has admitted that she could quit one bit she would rather blow the money on alcohol, weed and the $100 it costs to fill her tank up with gas. So, she is either working or partying instead of spending time with her kids. Half the time, she can‚Äôt pay her bills because she blows through her money as soon as she gets paid. I know this because it‚Äôs a repeating pattern and extended family has filled me in. Oh, and just in the past 3 months, she has gotten a DWI and broke her back from a fall she took while extremely intoxicated, then she didn‚Äôt know how bad she was hurt because she was so drunk which made the problem worse. 

So this is where I am irritated. I don‚Äôt gaf what Carrie does. That is her life. But the reason why I am irritated is because my Dad and stepmom are always singing her praises over what a responsible person she is and how she is a fantastic mother. Half the time she can‚Äôt even wipe her kid‚Äôs faces after she feeds them, and when we were on speaking terms, my husband and I were buying groceries for her to make sure the kids ate. 

Meanwhile, Liz and I have both graduated college, do volunteer work, we have been recognized on a national platform for some work we have done, we bust our butts to get out and help our community. Yet, all our Dad and stepmom do is talk about what assholes we are. They have never once congratulated us on our accomplishments. Yet, all Carrie has to do is pick up her kids for a couple of hours and they think sunshine is coming out of her ass, I just don‚Äôt get it. We never ask them for anything, they pay all her bills since she blows all her money, and they have bought her several cars after she had wrecked them.

(Part 1)

As you all may know form the title, i have a friend that is kinda FOMO, but he's bad in socializing because the only thing he could talk about is games.

And lately we been going out for activities like canoeing and camping , I've been getting along with all the new people we've met, as well as my girlfriend who is socially awkward even gets along with most of the new people that she met.

But somehow i always find my friend being alone just sitting there being quiet and etc, we all have tried giving him an ice breaking session in terms of conversation (IRL or even in WA) but it seems to me like sometimes his conversations always cut short, or like his response are kinda half assed, i remember hearing it from one of the dudes asking if he's really interested in learning how to camp or not.

But somehow when we are having chill conversations in discord he would always randomly appear and try to talk smack to some of us and trynna stir up some shit. Or he would just come in and keep quiet and just leave randomly. Sometimes he didnt even bother to say hi or anything.

I dont know how to bring this up to him, nor helping him to carry the conversation up with the rest of the people around the group cus its like really hard. Its not like a one time try thing, I've been trying for weeks and months.

(Part 2 Same friend)

Im in my quarter life right now, and my friend is a year older than me. We've knew each other since college. He is a good friend when it comes to playing game and talking shit back in the college days. But since that day we've graduated things had kinda changed.

As you can see its been 3+ years since that day we have graduated, I've been working in my industry for 3 years now. And yet my friend is struggling with getting a job. which means he have been unemployed for 3 years +. We tried sending him multiple site which have high rates of job offerings but its always like he will be picky in terms of the working location at his convenience.

I know you all might say let the dude take his time, maybe he's planning something behind his head that you don't know. But we all have asked him like what do you plan to do? its been 3 years since you graduated and you're still unemployed. You're living off your parents now and instead of looking on how to sustain yourself you're still playing games not giving a shit about anything. And everytime this comes up he would get super defensive and then there would be arguments.

At some point he said he wanted to do marketing, at one point he said he wanted to open up an IT shop, and at one point he said **""if all else fails imma just be a sales man, i think im pretty good at it, but i just dont wanna do it.""**

**Please advice on my situation, idk if im being a shit friend or not, and idk if im doing the right thing or nah, i dont know how to help him, or should i just leave it and let society take its course and make him realize?**",23Jul2020,1
126,"Hi, I'm posting this with good intentions and if I'm acting out of line or I'm saying something wrong just let me know. I'm not good at expressing myself so I will understand if something is not clear or I accidentally said something in a hurtful way.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄãI would really appreciate answers from women of color. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, I just started talking to this black girl I used to know in middle school 6 years ago and I really like her. We never stopped being friends but we lost contact and stopped talking and now I want to get closer with her.

&amp;#x200B;

‚Äã

&amp;#x200B;

The tricky part is that I'm white and she says she is very close with her Nigerian heritage and I don't want to mess up a good thing because of the difference in cultures. I would like to have her in my close friend circle and hang out with her often and maybe even start a relationship with her but because of the different cultures I don't know if she would accept me or what kind of unspoken rules there are.

&amp;#x200B;

‚Äã

&amp;#x200B;

We are just talking about what we are doing for the weekend and some good places around town and I think it's going good. When should I end the conversation and still make her know that I want to talk and possibly do more in the future?

&amp;#x200B;

‚Äã

&amp;#x200B;

I want to keep talking to her but since we haven't talked for such a long time I don't know her boundaries and I don't want to seem clingy.

&amp;#x200B;

‚Äã

&amp;#x200B;

Is there some topics I should stay away from? How can I let her know I want to be closer with her and seem like I actually mean it? Is there any tips or pointers for how to get closer with her in person? Because of the quarantine and since we haven't talk in 6 years how do I even start to say that I want to hang out with her, will she think it's weird and decline?

&amp;#x200B;

Hello. I am a 42 year-old Belgian woman and normally live in Brussels. As my husband had to work,i came to Greece with my sons about 10 days week ago. We have been staying in a nice,luxurious holiday resort. I will directly go on with the incidents i have been experiencing as i am kind of worried here. Exactly 5 days ago,i was on the beach with my 12 and 13 year old sons. I was lying on the beach,reading my book as my sons were swimming somewhere i could see them and a group of teenagers(i think they are something between 17-20 maximum) came to the beach and perched themselves a few meters next to me. They spoke Greek among each other but i am not sure if they are all originally Greek because some of them were quite dark for someone from Greece. Because they I don't think they are I was a little bit disturbed because there few not many people on the beach then so they had a lot of space to sunbath and they still chose somewhere near me. Anyway, i didn't care and contiuned to read my book. 20 mins later,one of them approached me to ask for a lighter. I said i don't smoke and he started chatting with me. I was kind enough to answer his questions nicely and he offered my some beer. I turned down his offer and he left.

Next day, i went to the same beach with my sons again. As i was sunbathing topless(it was totally legal there) i heard the same group of guys. About half an hour later,i noticed they were all staring at me and one of them was holding his phone towards me. I am sure he was recording me,i swear. I could tell it from their face expressions as i caught them. In panic,i went to them and asked what the fuck they were doing. They kind of got anxious and did not let me see the phone. I told them i don't want to see them again and i don't think it would prevent them from hounding me.

Two days ago,i saw them on another beach and they were staring at me. At that point,i started thinking it might be something serious,or they might be up to something.

I saved the most important thing for last. Yesterday, i found out we were staying in the same resort with them as i saw them at the reception. I am kind of worried here and i'm thinking about calling the police. What would be the best move to make here? Contact the resort first maybe?",23Jul2020,1

145,"I got dumped just as this whole thing started with the pandemic by the first girl I ever got in a serious relationship(we only dated for 4 months) with.

She wanted to be friends after and I agreed but I would need some time where we wouldn't talk at all. So we went No Contact, stopped all social media contact and looking at her profile on Instagram. It's been 3 months now ever since and I've been trying to get myself back up to my old fun self, going through a few realisations, picking up new hobbies, connecting more with friends and doing things that I love. So yeah I know it would be a stupid idea to try to win her back and I've been trying to convince myself that it's completely over but I find myself falling into that trap of thinking about her and I try to distract myself from it.

147,"I‚Äôm going to try to make this post short.

I need advice. I have been trying to break up with my current boyfriend for a while now. I‚Äôm mentally ill (and they have been reminding me of it every chance they can) and I‚Äôm having difficulties just functioning as a person. I have intrusive thoughts and cannot stop thinking of harming myself. I have been hitting my head on things or throwing myself/just overall very violent towards myself.  Me hurting myself is their logical reason to stop me from leaving. I do not know what to do.  I think my options are to go to the hospital or to wait until he is asleep and Uber myself to a hotel. At that point idk what would happen since he pays for my iPhone that I would be using at the hotel still. I have tried to ask him what to do about my iPhone and who to give it to so it can no longer be a bill he pays, but he has never been able to give me an answer.. I am afraid of him. I don‚Äôt know if he is a bad guy or a good guy at this point. When I try to leave it feels like he won‚Äôt let me for more reasons than to save me from myself. I think I could easily sneak away from him when he falls asleep. I‚Äôm afraid of him finding out before it happens tho. I get extremely violent with myself, and in my last attempt to leave I bit his arm while he was pinning me to the bathroom floor. I feel afraid I‚Äôll bite him again  and I just want to make the right choice. I‚Äôve never bit anyone before- it felt like protecting myself. I hope that I didn‚Äôt make a huge mistake by doing that. It feels really wrong to me that I bit him, but I was pinned to the floor and I felt like I had to.

I know I should probably be in a hospital but I think my obsessive thoughts from my OCD are making the hospital sound like a monster from hell.

I don‚Äôt know what to do, I just want to be alone. I just want to get to the hotel so I can figure out what to do from there. So many factors make this a difficult situation. I don‚Äôt think anyone would read this if I listed all of the factors that make this a near impossible situation to get out of.

148,"Hello reddit! 
I‚Äôm unsure what to do so I figured I would come here.

This is the situation:
I‚Äôm a 17 year old girl, I have only ever been on one date and have never been in a ‚Äúreal‚Äù relationship before, i understand that 17 is kind of old to be so naive in flirting/romance but I really just I feel like I‚Äôm not ready and the concept of dating still makes me feel sort of uncomfortable, and school is my main focus and thinking about being in a relationship stresses me out in general.

Recently a friend of mine gave my number to a guy (18) she did this with my permission.
We have been flirting over text the past two days, but to be honest, I feel kind of uncomfortable and don‚Äôt want this to continue.

I am not very attracted to this guy, and this back and forth has been stressing me out even though that‚Äôs not any fault of his own.
I feel really bad because I think I have absolutely led him on and made it sound like I was into this, but I‚Äôve come to realize that I really don‚Äôt think I am.

I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say is how do I politely reject a guy that I think I have been leading on? I have been a willing participant in the flirting and feel really guilty for wanting to back-pedal but like I said it‚Äôs just been making me feel uncomfortable, I really just feel like I‚Äôm not ready for this.

Again, it‚Äôs not his fault at all and I think I led him on, I have never met him in real life.

What do I say? What do I do? I feel just awful about this, but i think it would be even worse if I kept acting like I was into him, like, that wouldn‚Äôt be fair to him.

Any and all advice is super appreciated!",23Jul2020,1
149,"*PREFACE: I want to preface this narrative by saying that I generally am socially anxious and anxious overall. I am definitely more on the sensitive side, which can affect how I see and communicate things, but what I have written is what I have felt, and I would like to think that there is some validity to that and my feelings.* *That being said, I would greatly appreciate people‚Äôs objective comments and advice regarding this situation (as objective as one can be). I have shortened this as others have suggested doing. Thanks for taking the time to read this.*

TL;DR: I \[25M\] have been having a strained relationship with my friends, and I am unsure if I should confront them and have a discussion about the various things they have done that have really hurt me, or if I should step away from the friendship. I have been picked on by one particular individual in the group, and the others in the group seem to turn a blind eye to it. There seems to be a double standard in the group where I am treated differently from the rest of the people in the group. I am wondering if I should step away from the friendship or if I should try to hang on for a little while longer to see if things get better. The pros are that these people have been my friends for a long time (7 years), and it is easy to have a conversation with them without trying too hard (e.g. we could start off by talking about pizza and the conversation can involve into an in depth conversation about pizza or move onto something else without pause).

I am having a strained relationship with people \[all 25M\] who I thought were my closest friends (we have been friends for 7 years), and I need help navigating it. For the purposes of this narrative, I am going to call the person with whom I have been having a conflict, X. The two other friends will be St and Sc. We (Sc, St, X, and I) have been together since high school. I have always enjoyed spending time with them. It was easy to joke around them and conversation flowed without much effort.

However, things have gotten tense between us. I think the tension mostly is coming from my end (i.e. I am tense around them), as a person in the friend group (X) has said hurtful things that really drove a wedge between us. This tension is also partially coming from the person who said hurtful things, as there have been times when I have told the friend group that I could not attend our weekly video calls. The video call issue has been an ongoing conflict. More on that later.

This conflict really started with me venting about some roommate issues I was having. A little more about me: I am definitely the more sensitive sort, I can definitely take things more personally than others, and I get hurt more easily, probably. To sum up my relationship with my roommates, I just felt excluded by them, and sometimes, it felt as though they were actively excluding me. There was this one time where I was invited to an outing, but then they ended up going without me. I was hurt, and afterwards, my roommates went on outings without inviting me. It also felt as though one of my roommates was deliberately picking on me. She would shoot nasty looks at me when we crossed paths on the train or in public. She would push past me in our home corridor without saying hi, etc. She snapped at me sometimes. I am not a confrontational person, so I never got to the bottom of why she treated me the way she did. Maybe my dislike and discomfort towards her showed on my face, and it rubbed her the wrong way.

My friend group (Sc, St, X) and I had weekly video chats to talk about how our lives were going and I would talk about my issues with my roommates. Looking back, I AM sorry that my struggles with my roommates dominated the conversation. I can understand if I was irritating if I was venting about my roommates all the time. However, I was going through a hard time and hurting. I also thought that it was okay for me to talk to my closest friends about my problems because I thought we were there for each other for these sorts of issues.

After a point, I guess one of my friends (X) just reached his breaking point as far as discussing my concerns went. He said something along the lines of ‚ÄúYou know, the next time I have a problem, I just have to think about how stupid other people‚Äôs problems are, like \[insert my name here\]‚Äôs, and I will feel much better. Hearing that really hurt, and I did not talk about my roommate problems after that.

Afterwards, X was incredibly rude to me during video calls. There were times when I would talk excitedly about how my day was going (e.g. going to a fun event), and he would call out my name. I would stop what I was saying and answer, ‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù X would answer, ‚ÄúNothing, I just wanted you to stop talking.‚Äù This exchange occurred during a good number of our weekly video calls, but since I am not a confrontational person, I did not say anything

X was rude to me in other ways. He would sometimes kick me out of video chats. This happened quite a number of times. There was also one time when I was saying goodbye to everyone at the end of a video chat and accidentally ended the video chat for everyone instead of just myself. I called everyone back to apologize about my accident/mistake. X kicked me out of the video chat. There were other ways X was rude to me, but I will not go into them here.

After a certain point, I reached my breaking point. After X was being a jerk to me again during a video call, I asked, ‚ÄúDo you take pride in being an asshole?‚Äù X was taken aback and asked if I was stressed. X said that what I said came out of nowhere. I said that part of it might have been stress, but that a lot of it was the relationship we had, and I cited the things in the past that he had done that really hurt me. I am paraphrasing of course, as this happened a while ago. X was apologetic after that, and he said that he did not want me to be resentful towards him. He said that if I had a problem, I should have said something. I felt bad for the feeling the way I had after he said that and thought that everything had just been one big miscommunication. We moved on from that for the time being, though there was still tension between us. In future video calls, he sometimes ridiculed me for not speaking out about my problems.

A few months after that, the friend group (Sc, St, X) and I met at Sc‚Äôs house. X again said something hurtful. I called him out on it this time, as I was trying to work on communication. However, X answered by saying that if I had a problem with what he just said, then what St had said earlier was also a problem. Basically, what X was doing was deflecting the blame onto someone else and essentially saying that I was making a big deal out of something that others would not even think much of. I asked if Sc had anything to say. Sc sat there uncomfortably and said that he didn‚Äôt. My issue with the friend group is that there is kind of a double standard in a sense. If I do not speak up about my issues, I will continue to be picked on by X. However, if I do speak up, others will deny it, deflect, minimize, and invalidate my feelings (i.e. make me feel guilty or silly for feeling the way I had). It certainly feels that way.

Sc and X are best friends. Whenever X was being unkind to me, Sc would never call X out if it did not affect him. However, once St (the other member of the friend group) made a joke that Sc‚Äôs partner did not like. When X, Sc, and I were hanging out the next day, Sc brought it up and talked about how it bothered him and his partner. Sc was quick to talk about being a respectful friend then. When St or X cannot make it to a weekly video call, nobody raises a complaint. However, when I cannot make it to a video call, every one is quick to give me a hard time about it.

Lately, I have felt backed into a corner. I am uncertain whether I should confront them or if I should have a discussion about ending the friendship and stepping away. However, if I stay, I am not getting the same joy that I used to get when hanging out with them. I do not feel comfortable speaking freely in the group anymore. I feel that every word that leaves my mouth is more material for X to ridicule me with. Is this friendship worth salvaging? Should I stick out this friendship for a little longer, call people out when I am uncomfortable with something, and if they are not understanding of what I have to say, leave then? Any advice?

I want to make good songs and make a revolution in the industry but it's so frustrating that I can't acomplish this academical side of music. I've found that forme to study music it's bullshit, that I actually need to learn music through songs that I like but I wanna move on faster on my proccess of learning. It's a fact also that there are musicians that know tons and tons of music theory and they doesn't have any records, any songs well known as hits, I know that this could be probably taken by: ''Music is money, I want money'' but it's not like that. I really love music, I want to be a good musician like people that I admire their work such as: Sting, Phil Collins, arcticmonkeys, sodastereo, cerati, luismiguel, and lots of more.

I've also think on being psychologist or coach instead of musician but I've thinking about that and I think that If I choose that path I'll betrayed myself. I mean, I really enjoy both paths because I'm very know that succed in music on a massive level it's ''hard as fuck'', and it's more a question of being on the right place at the same time (I've doubt about this because Internet exists today, so you know...) anytime, anywhere it's the right place.",23Jul2020,1

154,"This morning, after a couple of comments that seemed rather strange and somewhat creepy things to say on ones first day I googled my new coworker's name and found that he is a registered sex offender. I would like to preface this with saying that I am not someone that has ever done this with another coworker and I have zero interest in workplace gossip.

In 2007, he was charged with two counts of first degree sexual abuse involving a 12 year old child. He took a plea deal which involved the prosecutor dropping two of the four counts of first degree sexual abuse he was originally charged with and served 3.5 years in prison. He is now on the state's registry for life and is currently still on supervised release. We now are sharing an office that was previously occupied by only me and is probably 12'x12'.

I am uncomfortable with this new development, but we do not work around children and his position would not involve him needing to ever be in contact with children for any reason I can think of.   
I'm still figuring out how I feel about this on a personal level, as this is a very small 6 employee company. I am inclined to say that although this offense is abhorrent to me on every level, he served his time and is in compliance with the state registry and should be allowed to try to become a productive member of society again despite his past.

However, there is something else that struck me as strange. When he started this morning, his name was misspelled by our office manager on all of his login credentials and on his new business cards that were ordered. This person was a coworker at a previous company with one of my bosses after his offense and prison time and mentioned that my boss has always misspelled his name and that he probably just did it again. 

My concern is that he allowed his name to be misspelled on his intake paperwork to fly under a quick google search of him by our office manager and that he avoided a criminal background check because he is a former coworker of my boss.

I do not know whether or not I should voice my concerns - both personal and professional - to my boss and office manager in this situation. I work in a very conservative environment that I believe would lead to his ostracization and nearly certain termination if this information about him comes out.",23Jul2020,2

  But now she cuts our talks short. She‚Äôll randomly never answer me, leave me on read, etc. Tonight, however is what really confused me. She texted and said she took a nap.

I'm in the USA and my(30) girlfriend(26) is from Venezuela. We were already planning to get married because her visa expires on August 12. We just spent 2 hours trying to notarize our affidavit online because everything is closed because of coronavirus. We got it to work finally but then her phone was almost dead and the notary said we needed to charge it and try again. When we tried again, it wouldn't verify her identification because (I found out later) she hasn't been in the country long enough for different verification questions to be populated. We need to try again Friday. 

We had to do this in somewhat secret in a nearby park from her house because her host family is not really letting her leave because of coronavirus. 

Additionally, I'm afraid she might be pregnant because her period is supposed to come on Friday. We did something stupid and she let me finish inside her the day after her period. She says that she doesn't feel like it's coming and she's normally very regular and always feels very similar symptoms leading up to it. 

I'm a kidney transplant recipient and my children have a 50% chance to have the same disease as me. Also I don't make that much money and I can't afford a kid.

169,"I have a good relationship with both my parents but I have a better one with my Dad than my Mom. They never have been a ""perfect couple"" by any means. They usually get in fights or arguments a lot. My Mom really cares for my Dad but she never really compliments him about anything nor have I ever hear her say ""I love you"" in the past couple of years. I could tell my Dad was frustrated with the marriage but I always assumed he loved her enough to power through it.

A couple of years ago I saw my Dad text another person ""I love you"". I saw him do it many other times and noticed him doing cheater habits so I knew for sure. This obviously crushed me as my Dad is my hero and the thought of this perfect person cheating on his wife made me feel sick. I never knew whether to confront him about it cause I didn't want our relationship to change and I didn't really know how to bring it up. I also worried about him telling my mom after I confronted him. I knew it would break her heart and I didn't want to be the reason she found out. So I hoped that my Dad would eventually end things on his own and I wouldn't have to bring it up. I have since come to terms with my Dad cheating on my Mom and don't get overly upset about it anymore.

Fast forward to tonight. My sister found that my Dad sent someone flowers and she called him crying saying that she would never speak to him again. My Mom is in shock and isn't really saying much. When I've talked to her she's said that she doesn't know what to do next (work it out/separate/divorce).

I don't want my Dad to feel like our entire family hates him so I want him to feel good but I also want to comfort my Mom and make her feel loved. I really don't want them to get divorced because I don't like the idea of my Mom being alone in her 50s getting an apartment by herself. I feel somewhat responsible for this since I did not confront my Dad in the past years I've known. I know this was poorly worded but any advice on how to handle this would be greatly appreciated.

Edit: Also thought I should mention this. My sister moved to a new city so she isn't home to talk with either of my parents about it. She blocked my dad on everything. I recently graduated and was planning on living at home for a year. This is also terrible timing with the pandemic going on.

I never expected him to spend money on me. The only time he did was play for went to eat fast food. Now granted his parents are well off. He is a lucky guy. They got him his own car, and he still has not moved out and he is almost 30. But I never expected anything from them. But suddenly he has been talking about owing someone money. He says they threatened to go to the police. He also says his bank was looking into suspicious activity. He has changed banks twice due to suspicious activity. But swears he is super careful about who he gives his bank info to. Now suddenly his bank is saying he can never open a bank account anywhere ever. For the rest of his life.

My wife is considering getting breast implants. She's in her early thirties, and she was very well endowed (36C-DD) but we have had 4 kids, and now that she's lost 30-40 pounds from her max (kids are hard on you!) her boobs have ""deflated"" (her words, not mine) and she's not super comfortable with them.  
I'm firmly in love and attracted to her regardless, and it's my opinion that she can do whatever she wants with her body. That's not necessarily what this thread is about. However, for anybody out there with personal experience with fake breasts: is it worth it? There's obviously a financial cost, but also a potential health downside.

184,"So we rent our residence and my dad uses one room as a home office to do paperwork, make calls, and schedule appointments. Every time we moved, we filed the change of address form for the business certificate for the home office, then let the landlord know. Each time, all our new landlords said was OK. Things are different this time and we're not sure what we should do.

We moved recently, signed a one-year contract, so after moving everything into the house and cleaning up, we filed the change of address form for the business certificate for home office and let our landlord know. Now our landlord is calling my dad a liar, saying he should have told her that before moving in and he shouldn't have hidden that kind of information. She's saying that he will get her in trouble, because she doesn't claim rent as income and doesn't file taxes for it, but my dad having a home office will have the government involved, IRS will look into her financial records, etc.

So my dad asked why she didn't tell him that she doesn't file rent as income, to which she replied that it is none of his business. Then My dad told her that the business certificate for the home office is under his name, so it shouldn't affect her like that. All the utilities are under his name now and we already filed the change of address forms for IRS, USCIS, DMV, USPS, etc so the fact that we are renting is already available to the government, so why is having a home office is such a big problem? So after a long phone call, our landlord told my dad to meet her tomorrow and to bring a copy of the form so she can take a look.

So the things I would like to know are:

A. How does the renter having a home office cause the government to inspect the landlord's finances?

B. Were we supposed to inform our new landlord about the home office before moving? It wasn't something she asked (she asked about our occupation, which we answered) and our previous landlords didn't care, so we assumed it's just our own business to take care of.

C. Is it OK for a landlord to not file rent as income? Our landlord has a few other houses and does not file rent as income. Have we gotten ourselves into a mess? We didn't know about this until today. We already signed a one-year contract. have we gotten ourselves into a mess?

**EDIT**: We don't want to argue with our landlord about the legality of things, we would like to to resolve the home office issue in peaceful manner that makes both parties happy. With that said, what we would really like to know is:

1. Is having a home office something renters MUST inform the landlord? Isn't it our business?

2. How does having a home office affect the landlord? We're not sure how my dad's business certificate for a home office would cause IRS to investigate our landlord.",23Jul2020,2
186,"Sorry, this may be a long text. And I thank in advance to those who read this. Plus, in phone, so sorry about formatting. Aaand not native speaker but I hope you understand everything. 

Ok so, I used to have a friend, let's call her Liz. I met here when she was like 5 and I was 8ish. Our mothers became good friends and so did we. The only problem back then was when we were growing old, she always told everything to her mom so sometimes I'd got in trouble because of that. Like I kissed a boy, she'd tell her mom and her mom would tell mine. (Silly me, kept sharing secrets with her).

Ok fast forward to 2018. We still had contact although not as often as we used to and now we had some mutual friends. So it turns out we need someone in my job (I'll only say they pay me for each hour I work, so, the more hours I work, the more money I earn) and I decide I can give her a call, Liz comes, brings a resume (not experience working in a place like this nor a degree) so my boss is hesitant but I convince him, because I began in the same way some years prior. 

So, she gets the job. I'm super excited cause now we'll chat, spend time together and hang out again... Nope. She becomes friends with other guys (they are also my friends) but hardly ever speaks to me, at least not the way I expected. 

Time passes and she  also becomes friend with the new girl in charge of giving us our schedule (the amount of hours we were supposed to work), so, as they are super friends now, she starts working more hours than I do, and earning more money. (My boss decides who works more, and who works less... and I was supposed to be one of the first in getting hours. But this girl always ignored this kind of directions from the boss and prefered her friend (Liz) and her crush to give them the hours).

Plus, in our job we are supposed to work for people, and we have a system who arranges it randomly, but it can be changed manually by receptionists. So, I'd see I was having some people (I can see the names) and suddenly they were changed, and I would always attend harder people while the nicest people would go to Liz's place... 

Well, besides of that I started hearing how she'd flirt often with these people, that was not my business thought. Until she became close with Mark. Mark is married to Jess, and Jess is my best friend from work. One day she tells me that everytime Mark goes there to see her, he ends up talking with Liz. Then, once, she found a message from Liz to Mark which read ""Hey, come to (work) so you pay for my lunch"".

Well, it's obvious Jess was not happy with that and told me, she said there were more messages but she didn't want to read them. So now I was kind of fed up, and regretting having gotten her the job. Then one day my boss decided I need to move city to work in another branch and some of my co workers make me a small farewell party, Jess offers her house and we decide to have a barbecue...

There we are, hanging out, everyone sitting around a table and chatting while Mark's preparing food. The last showing up is Liz, she arrives late, says hello and goes directly to were Mark is. While we're waiting for the food, she starts eating a small piece of meat and drinking a beer, as she chats with Mark... I imagined Jess was upset but said nothing. 

That day I heard she stayed till 1am (I left at 11) and was kind of drunk. That's not of my business but her mom is super special with her, she doesn't even let her being in a car with other man... so I was kind of upset because I felt this was kind of hypocrisy. But as I said  this was none of my business. 

Well, then I told a mutual friend I was upset and disappointed and explained my reasons (what I wrote before, about the job and her attitude with Mark). And, a week or so before I ask Liz about something and she answers super different. I think my friend told her what I said... and since then we haven't spoken.

Now it's been some months. I don't like to have problems with my friends, and I was thinking on apologizing... but then I remembered why we don't speak anymore and think that maybe it doesn't worth it. 
I mean, I know we used to be good friends but I had my reasons to say what I said.

187,"I (F22) found a nice room to rent (2 bedroom apartment so me and a roommate who already lives there) and will be signing the lease tomorrow. The girl who rented it before me is leaving her bed with a mattress, a desk and a closet as well as a washing machine and kitchen supplies. I already saw everything in person. The desk is very basic, nothing special but fine. The closet is small, super old and horrible quality. Not cheap Ikea bad quality but way worse, and the bed is also extremely basic. She wants 500‚Ç¨ for her stuff. That's so much money for furniture that has essentially zero value. Like the closet I could just dump straight into the garbage. Even if you factor in the washing machine, it's not like she paid for it entirely, I'm not even sure she paid for it at all, it's likely been there a couple years. So it doesn't justify the 500‚Ç¨ either. The kitchen supplies obviously aren't worth 500‚Ç¨. The only other furniture in the apartment that isn't the roommate's is a super old small couch and a very rough looking old Ikea lamp, and a super old kitchen table with a few chairs. The girl is very sweet and I hate arguing but it seems insane to ask 500‚Ç¨ for what's essentially garbage. Honestly 200‚Ç¨ is the most I'd ask if I were here since the mattress is only a year old and the washing machine looked nice enough, but everything else you can't really charge anyone for. If she could lower the price even by 100‚Ç¨ I'd be grateful even though 400‚Ç¨ is still crazy considering what I'm getting for it. Any advice on how to approach the subject? Thanks.",23Jul2020,1

I met this guy last summer, and we hit it off well. We started going out together, and our friend groups merged. One night at the club, while everyone else left, me and him were still left at our table. He pulled me aside and introduced to me this girl. We started talking in the club, but the whole time my friend kept pushing me away from her (he was very drunk) and never said anything. Anyways, I was drunk too so the girl added me on social media and afterwards I left.

The next day the girl texted me, and we started talking. We'd talk everyday, even though it was just bits. After a few days (from that night), my friend called me to ask how I was and if I wanted to go out again. I mentioned to him, hey thanks for hooking me up, appreciate it. He immediately went like oh, that girl? I could tell something was off, and I asked if he was after her. He put it off jokingly, but I knew him well enough that he liked the girl - so I told him dont worry about it, I'll step off and wingman him.

I started trying to put the two together on a date, but the girl told me she didnt see him that way. Fast forward a few weeks, me and my friend are back at a bar. Theres quite a few of us (all guys, close friends) and my friend wanted to get a few girl friends to spice things up. He asked the girl but she didnt respond, (I didnt know he asked her) so I asked the girl and she agreed to come, and brought a bunch of her friends too. I told my friend shes coming, and hes like wow, I tried and she didnt even answer but (me) got her to come. Im gonna give up. I took this literally, as a sign that the light was green. So I started going for her.

We got together etc. Fast forwards another few weeks, me and him and two other friends are having dinner again before we hit the bars and club, and he asked me how things were with the girl. I told him yeah we hit it off and got together. He went quiet, and his friend gave him a look, checking if he was okay. I knew at that moment something was wrong. That night he kept 'punishing' me with shots, and I took them all without question.

I knew something was wrong, and he also began not replying to my texts.

I went back overseas (Im a uni student) in september, and its been hanging in my mind the whole time. Fast forward to december, where everyone goes back to where im from, (except me, I stay overseas for a whole year and return in summer) one of my friends said, Hey, I think he forgot the beef, he was asking to have dinner with you. This lightened me considerably, but I always wondered why he never messaged me himself.

Fast forward to a few weeks before summer (when I return) another friend told me that he was chill, but the thought that what I did as a bro was wrong.

Fast forward to when I returned: I messaged him, saying hey im back, up for a little get together once Im out of quarantine? (for those saying please quarantine yourself, Im from Taiwan and our country is done with the virus - those returning need only isolate for 2 weeks) He responded, but not after 'seeing my message"" for an hour or so. All he replied with was the facebook ""thumbs up"" emoji.

Thoughts?

I dont know if i'm able to salvage our friendship... does it seem like he's willing? I'm really paranoid and think a lot. We're both in our 20s. ",23Jul2020,1

So needless to say I get tired. My sister has two kids and one on the way. Because she‚Äôs pregnant, she‚Äôs constantly asking for favors and rides. She doesn‚Äôt know how to drive. I have to wake up early in the morning to drop her kids off at a babysitter and then drive her to work. When I come home, my mom‚Äôs usually awake and hands me chores to do. Every time I‚Äôm not doing something is apparently me just being a waste of space. Night time is usually  when I have the living room all to myself. Except for some reason, everyone just HAS to come into the living room. They don‚Äôt usually say anything or nag, but I pretty much just stop doing what I‚Äôm doing and wait for them to leave.

194,"This is just a throw away account. I‚Äôm just overthinking and cannot sleep so any advice would be very much appreciated!!!

I‚Äôve had a very difficult relationship with my mum and now that I‚Äôm in my early 20‚Äôs it‚Äôs really bothering me. I always used to think I was the issue but these same problems are not a regular occurrence in other relationship I have, such as friends, work colleagues or even partners etc. My father and I do not have these issues, although when my mum shouts at him and encourages him to ‚Äúdo something‚Äù to me, in the past it has led to violence. Nevertheless, my dad has apologised and I do not hold it against him, everyone makes mistakes when they are angry and he hasn‚Äôt laid a finger on me since. 

I‚Äôm not sure how much context is relevant for a post like this but I‚Äôll do my best in informing you all. I‚Äôm looking for some brutally honest and genuine advice. I don‚Äôt if I‚Äôm the problem or not but either way I really want to fix this issue. When matters reached other family members or I confide in friends, I‚Äôm often met with the avoid any triggers or encounters with my mum that may lead to her getting angry approach.

My relationship with my mum has never been good if I‚Äôm honest and although it has always been a course for concern, I‚Äôm growing more and more worried. My mum always describes me negatively and is always angry at me. 

I‚Äôve been trying so hard to keep my parents happy for the past few years. I put so much effort into my education and did very well, my job, helping out around the house like with the vacuuming and dishes, I give them money regularly, I always try to help and be there just for a chat. 

However, every time there is an issue in the house even if I‚Äôm not involved my mum resorts to insulting me. I‚Äôve noticed when my mum sees an issue or something that bothers her to the point where she‚Äôs angry she does not confront it. She‚Äôs very passive so I don‚Äôt even know if I‚Äôm the actually problem most of the time. I help but feel like I‚Äôm the issue. 

I was having an argument with my brother and he started shouting, my mum came in the room and told me to just leave him alone. I continuously told him to stop shouting because my mum would get angry but he just got louder and said ‚Äúno she‚Äôll get angry at you‚Äù. 

I asked her what‚Äôs the issue and how can I resolve it because you‚Äôre always angry at me. I don‚Äôt want to continue living with these issues because it‚Äôs bothering me so much. She shouted at me and pulled my hair, told me to get put of her face and leave her alone. I don‚Äôt know what to do about it because I cannot keep tiptoeing around my mum for the rest of my life. I cannot keep trying to seek her approval and feel like I‚Äôm not worthy of unconditional love. This feel strange to admit but I think I may have done something to my mum without my knowledge because she‚Äôs always angry at me.

197,"I (27 F) currently rent out and take care of my aunts house while she is living away in a different country. The houses on my side all have backyards that face a forest. 

My neighbour just came to discuss the fence that was bordering our property line and said they are looking to fence their entire backyard because they saw a tent in the woods the other day. They asked if I wanted to split the cost and estimated it would be about $1000 for our share.

It is 4 panels of wooden fence that in my eyes, dont need to be replaced. There is slight rotting in the wood in one of the bottom parts that is supporting the fence but otherwise seem in decent condition. But $1000??? That seems quite steep for a fence I dont even use or benefit from. We have a wooden fence around a hot tub, built all along the sides of the outer fence so really, the outer fence is just a marker for property lines. Also, replacing this one side will mismatch all the other fences along the house.

They are going to get back to me in about a week. I want to keep the peace with my neighbours, as a female living all alone, but also feels like Im helping the costs of their home reno because this fence isnt something Ill benefit from or need/want right now. Ive asked other homeowners and they all said $1k is way too much to spend on 4 panels of wooden fence. 

I asked my aunt who actually owns the place and she said no. Any advice on how to actually talk tothe neighbours and say no in a polite, respecting manner would be great. Also are there legal implications for me to say no to replacing a fence that both properties share??

201,"Currently, I'm 17, a high school dropout and a tafe dropout. I don't want to go back to either because both of them made me feel overwhelmed and like I was missing out on something bigger. School just felt like a waste of time and an obstacle keeping me from achieving something amazing.

I sort of see myself as a creative person. I like art, music, writing, I have hobbies that I want to pursue as full-on careers but my problems are that I lose interest too quickly and that I want too much. I'm the type of person to watch a show about a character who works at a hospital and then I'll want to work at a hospital until I watch a show about a character who's a private investigator, then I'll want to become a private investigator too. I struggle to stick to one thing because of my attention span. 

When I find a hobby I like I try to focus on it but then I lose interest and then I find myself another hobby and then the cycle continues over and over and over again. When I try to think of my interests as careers that's where I also struggle to figure out what I should do because I always ask myself ""Will I be able to do this when I'm older?"" It's like an athlete suffering a really bad injury causing them to have to retire too early, or a singer losing their voice.

I've tried to get serious about my hobbies (I tried studying graphic design at Tafe which was a mess) but I just end up getting depressed because I work differently from everyone else and no one really took me seriously. 

It makes me feel guilty because my parents buy me the resources I need for these things and then it only takes me a week to lose complete interest in it. I also am the type to lose interest if I'm not amazing at a specific thing straight away, or if I see someone who's better at the thing than I am.

Sometimes I wake up so horrified because I earnestly think I actually died. Episodes tend to happen in clusters, often being in back to back nights. Sometimes just the anticipation of something happening keeps me up, which makes me sleep horribly, making it worse.

I legitimately do not know what to do about it. It doesn't seem worth it to do a sleep study, because I can't know ahead of time if I'll have an episode or not. Does anybody have any experience with this and is there anything I can really do about it? I wake up yelling and crying. Last night I thought myself and the room was on fire and I thought I was burning alive.

He messaged me back one day, I did the classic ""I'll write him back when I finish this one thing"", and put my phone down. That was 10 weeks ago, back in May. Pretty soon thereafter I ended up taking a break from Instagram and social media in general and I never responded. I haven't been posting there or anything, because I deleted the app entirely.

211,"
I‚Äôm not sure where to post this, I‚Äôm mad, I want to rant, and I want you guys to explain to me or my dad why I think taking away my FPS games could be right or wrong. I am 13 years old and male, my parents are asian and believe education is above everything else

So backstory as to why he did it. My mom had pressured me to do my math homework when I said I would do it. She wanted me to do it faster and got really frustrated and angry because I was not really making progress. So she decided to make me do it in front of her and I felt really uncomfortable. I resisted her and that set my mom off. She went outside to grab a stick to (what I assumed because it happens every time) beat me or whip me with it. I was scared and from what I read here on reddit, I grabbed a metal pole from our fireplace and held it in a attempt to defend myself

My mom had never expected me to defend myself and took it as a threat. Point was, everyone started to shout and I thought it ended there. 

Turns out my mom told my dad about how to ‚Äúwas going to attack her with the metal pole‚Äù and my dad got really mad because it is bad to do that to your mom. He then set a punishment for me, which was to remove all my First Person Shooter games (because he blamed it was influencing my ‚Äúviolence‚Äù). I was angry and even finished all my math homework in an attempt to tell him to revoke my punishment but it didn‚Äôt work. For several weeks I thought that fps games were bad and he was right. It ate at me and soon I realized that there was nothing wrong.

Here‚Äôs the part where I explain that FPS is ok

FOR ME at least, I enjoy playing gun games and it‚Äôs become a part of me. I felt that it was SO unjustified that I can‚Äôt play it because it ‚Äúmade me violent‚Äù I can tell you that I‚Äôm not a violent person. I have never punched or hit my parents or friends. I play those games because it makes me relaxed. It‚Äôs a hobby and it‚Äôs fun to play. I make all A‚Äôs in my school and it‚Äôs definitely NOT affecting my life. When my dad took it away from me, I felt so restricted and frustrated. It just doesn‚Äôt make sense!! 

I only picked up that metal pole because I had wanted to defend myself from harm! Yet my dad called it FPS violence. How does it even translate? He also added that my in game character was flipping balisongs (knives) and that recently I was spinning sharp objects (a bread knife and a whip cream spreader and some steak knives, because I like to spin pens) and that it was the motive to pick up the metal pole. 


There‚Äôs clear evidence that I don‚Äôt get influenced from these so called ‚Äúviolent‚Äù games (more on that later) and that I feel I should play it. I‚Äôm just so frustrated. 
When I confronted him about it, he says that my mind was developing and that I dont see anything wrong with it because I‚Äôm young. 

He thinks that I will be a serial killer with guns when I grow up and that‚Äôs not true. 

It‚Äôs just a satisfying genre of game I that can play with my friends to relax and enjoy.

The games I play are not bloody. They are roblox FPS, Destiny 2 some CSGO occasionally, and apex legends. FPS which I think are a bit more violent than those games such as battle field and some other realistic games, I stay away from. 

I don‚Äôt curse at all in my household, and my dad is pretty strict about these things. He tells me a lot of things that are bad and that I shouldn‚Äôt do and that I agree with, but I strongly feel that FPS games are not bad. It‚Äôs just making me a lot more frustrated because my dad is restricting me of something that‚Äôs not terrible. I know what‚Äôs good and what is clearly violent and dangerous. FPS games are not that. This is totally unjustified and I don‚Äôt even know anymore. 

Can you guys tell me if I‚Äôm wrong and convince him that I‚Äôm not a violent kid and that I should play it? 

Or am I I‚Äôm the wrong here and that I am a violent person and that maybe taking those away will make me a better person. 

Thank you so much for reading this. I‚Äôve been waiting weeks to release this and I feel so much better now that you guys know what my problem is. Again I‚Äôm not sure if this is the correct subreddit to post in. Thank you and stay safe!",23Jul2020,1

My parents haven't even paid this phone off yet, its been less than a year, and she broke it... I can't get myself to tell them because let's we're pretty tight on money and my parents worked so hard to get her a new phone. It would break my heart to tell them about this - so I'm keeping it a secret.

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is is that she's never appreciative of the things my parents do for her - she gets everything handed down to her and doesn't understand the things my parents sacrifice to give her the life she wants.

&amp;#x200B;

She plans on finding a way to repair it on her own by using her savings. She has literally the exact amount ($200 to repair the screen), but I feel really bad for having her pay for it. Even though it was her own fault and she can be spoiled as hell, a part of me feels like I should help her pay for it since that's the only money she has and has been saving for years to participate in her Volleyball team at school. Also, sometimes I'm a really shitty sister to her so I feel like doing this would strengthen our bond a little more.

1. My mom has a Traumatic Brain Injury from when she was 11 years old and was in a wreck on a highway involving a semi-truck. She has never re-gained function in her right arm after refusing physical rehab for it. She has lead a very traumatic life with my dad siring two kids but leaving her for a man (in rural TN), and long before her lupus diagnosis it was clear that it had impacted her ability to think as a normal human adult would. She's held grudges over minor things, switched churches over the slightest inconvenience and in general has not behaved the way a rational adult would for most of her life.
2. My grandma is extremely conservative but has long-since retired with full pension and her long-time husband died a few years ago with his relevant life insurance (and so on) going to her directly, netting her a monthly income equivalent to mine.
3. I have two kids, one aged 6 and the other close to 2 years old. I am 26 myself. Even long after my baby mama &amp; I had both remarried, my mom &amp; grandma held out hope that we would get back together, mostly because I told them I was dating my future wife at the same time that I was making attempts at rekindling the relationship with my first kid's mom, which was true, for the purpose of raising my firstborn son the way I intended rather than indirectly a few days per week. I stopped a year or so before my second wife became pregnant but didn't overtly declare this.
4. When my now-wife was pregnant with our kid, I misled my mom and grandma by noting that I wasn't 100% sure that I was the dad because we had been broken up at the time even though I knew we'd had unprotected sex. I didn't realize until later the damage this would cause and in hindsight I should've insisted the child was mine until proven otherwise rather than the other way around. This caused a multitude of issues, not least of which was disdain toward my now-wife and dubiousness toward the baby we had together. None of my parents/grandparents seem attached in any way to the child I've had because of my decision to imply that it may not be mine. 
5. My first baby mama quickly entered a series of serious relationships with other guys, culminating in the one that she still hasn't married but has had a daughter with. Leading up to the primary issue, I have been roped into arguing with the guy, including two times where I allowed him to escalate to the point of driving himself to my house to bang on the door insisting that I fistfight him. The second time this happened I drunkenly obliged and got my ass beat.
6. About 6 months later, my baby mama had appointed the boyfriend to be in charge of delivering my son to me every week at a designated time that we had chosen. He did not put any priority toward delivering him to me at the appropriate time and was consistently 30mins-1hour late.
7. One day when my son was a full hour late arriving, I texted my baby mama to ask where he was. She noncommittally advised that he was on his way, but another half hour passed with no arrival. I explained that his bedtime is earlier at my house than usually necessary because I lived further away from his elementary school than she did and insisted that he arrive within 25 minutes (the amount of time it takes to go from the couch at their house to my driveway) or else I would lock my door and require that they keep him on a school night that they hadn't prepared for, feeling sure that this would teach them not to bully me about drop-off times. Instead, her bf arrived 45 minutes later (well after the point he would've known the door would be locked) and, with full knowledge, had my son get out of his booster seat and knock on my door, shifting all of the trauma of this experience onto me rather than his extremely late delivery. 
8. My ex-wife opted to exaggerate this and a couple other things that she intentionally had taken out of context (I am an alcoholic so extrapolated under oath that I had driven drunk with my child in the car when I hadn't and had no drunk driving arrests, and I am a fledgling cook so she said under oath that I had force fed him jalapenos when he had asked to try them) for the purpose of securing emergency custody. Both my mom and the grandma that messaged me showed up in court in favor of my baby mama and presumably had their fingers crossed that they would be called on to testify against me. Once I explained to the judge about the misunderstanding he ordered that my relationship with my son be rekindled by the mother delivering him to me directly once per week and ordered our parenting plan be re-filled out. 
9. I have not forgiven my mom or her mother for showing up in court on behalf of my ex-wife. It is abundantly clear to me that they were hoping the judge would call on them for testimony (which he did not) and so they were ineffective, but not because of their effort. I have never received an apology or any other meaningful communication from either party since the court date. My grandma insists that she was there because I had locked my son out of my house &amp; that she was only looking out for him, but I have carefully explained numerous times the exact transcription of events and she has chosen to either not to believe them or to assume I was at fault regardless by explicitly denying any apology. 
10. I blocked my mom completely from social media for roughly 9 months before I opted to unblock her without notification, after which she sent a friend request, indicating she wanted to rekindle our relationship without offering any apology for her attempt to cause me to lose custody of my son. 
11. My brother has intentionally avoided direct contact with me and opted instead to form his opinion based on my visible actions on Facebook, where I tend not to argue with people unless the position I'm defending feels infallibly correct, leading to the conclusion that I think that I am never wrong. In reality there are a dozen examples of people proving me wrong and I've referenced them at least once to him but his position has not changed, which has led to me discrediting his opinion even though I highly value any praise he may give.

&amp;#x200B;

I have heard from my grandma a couple of times since then, including this request, but she has stood by her stance that I was at fault for not allowing my son into my house when he was egregiously late. I have also been in contact with my younger brother, 19, who still lives with my mom &amp; has expressed his inability to understand my side of this repeatedly up through the ultimatum, culminating in his sending me a lengthy, vulgar message and then blocking me before I could respond.

&amp;#x200B;

When I began typing this I was of the opinion that I have been judged too harshly for my decisions and even after editing have probably written the post in an obviously biased fashion. I apologize for that and hope that any comments this post receives will help point me in the right direction as I am honestly open to influence and wish I had more of it.",23Jul2020,0
220,So my old bff is asking to hang sometime. I haven't seen her in 2+ years and she isn't the best person. I believe my parents don't like her (tbh idk if they were talking about her for sure).

221,"American here. I'm starting to develop COVID-19 like symptoms. My state is starting to surge again. Elevated temperature but no fever (&lt;100F), but horrible sore throat, coughing, bad chest pain, fatigue, aches and pains all over my body. I'm 30 and suffer from underlying conditions so I'm used to working in a state of constantly feeling sick and tired so I'm wondering if it's just stress from a new gig, but with the growing chest pain I feel like it might be COVID-19. I live in an apartment with about 4 other people who don't take COVID-19 seriously so they haven't been practicing social distancing and they have told me multiple times that they don't think I'm sick because I'm always overreacting. 

The problem is that I just started a new job and I'm in a probationary period where I have no health insurance. I don't have any vacation or sick days yet and if I get tested but it's negative it will reflect badly on me as my employers are very conservative, and if it turns out out to be positive at best I will cause my new coworkers to hate me because I would be the first one who tested positive in the office and at worst I might lose my job because I don't qualify for FMLA yet. I don't have any opportunities for health insurance or unemployment since I have not been here for very long I haven't paid much into unemployment insurance through this company.

228,"Lately I've been getting upset and irritated really easily at almost everything. I'm normally a pretty patient person that can tolerate most things/work things out and not have things bother me in the long term. For most of my life I've always been the optimistic one that sings about sunshine in the morning. But recently I just can't seem to do that anymore. I have constant headaches and feel so exhausted. I've been sleeping in every day but wake up feeling like I haven't slept at all. I feel bad for my partner because they don't understand how I feel and I've just been a downer for the past month and they're taking the brunt of it.

I don‚Äôt want to go into specifics but he‚Äôs been professionally diagnosed with several mental illnesses, he‚Äôs been to jail and rehab several times and has a serious history with addiction. I honest to god just do not trust him with her. On one hand I know a father figure is important but on the other I know his mental issues cause him from knowing right from wrong, he can be very manipulative, and he also has delusions on occasion and I have no idea if he‚Äôs using or not. I genuinely feel like her safety is at risk if she was left alone with him I also know he can‚Äôt financially provide for her at the moment but it feels wrong to just completely cut off all contact because after all he is her dad.

234,"I spend way too much time and energy taking care of the things I own. I tend to clean them often, use them very delicately etc. For example when I first got myself a mobile phone I used to spend a large amount of my time cleaning it, making sure to clean every time after using it. I do this with my laptop and headphones as well. When I try to stop myself from doing this it stresses me out incredibly and gives me intense headaches, that is whenever I see any dust/dirt on them or any signs of rough usage. And this is causing me two major problems ( Especially the second one )

1. I spend way too much time on caring and handling the stuff I own carefully rather than using them as a tool to reach my goals. This is causing a lot of stress and stopping me from using them as they were meant to.
2. When I lend my stuff to other people, they obviously do not treat my things with the same intense care that I do and this drives me crazy, I get incredibly mad at people and I start to constantly micro manage them.

For example, I have a very old pair of headphones that I love a lot. I have been taking very good care of them and even though it started falling apart I still managed to fix it, especially the wire since it broke at the place where it connects to the headphone jack( similar to how apple charger cable breaks at the end). So I am very careful with how I handle the cable of my headphones when I use it. Recently my cousin has come to my home to stay with us and during his stay he used to borrow my headphones to watch stuff or play video games and the way he used to handle it used to drive me crazy. I am not able to tell if he was actually careless or if I am thinking too much about it. I used to get incredibly mad watching him casually swing the wire around and trying to calm myself used to take up a lot of energy. Since if these headphones broke then repairing it would be a huge headache for me and buying a new pair is just too expensive for me and my parents are not at all well off, I don't want to burden them with having to buy me a new pair. I don't know if my mind is making it out to be a bigger deal than it actually is. I talked to him about it and explained to him as to why I would like him to be very careful with the wire and he seemed to understand but yet every now and then he just does something rough out of habit and even though I know he did not do it on purpose it makes me very stressed. I don't know if this is justified due to the reasons I mentioned above or if I'm being irrational.

Having to deal with similar thoughts on different levels on a daily basis has been very mentally taxing. I even wonder if I suffer from OCD every now and then.

237,"This will likely be very long and rambly because I have no idea how to put it into word so I apologise but thanks for trying to make sense of it haha. I would especially appreciate advice from women on this topic.

 So I'm a guy nearly nineteen she's about the same age and throughout highschool whenever I would see her she was always super quiet and only talked to her close friends so we never talked basically at all but I still thought she was super cute.  I never tried to ask her out mainly because of how my last relationship ended but also just cause we didn't know each other.

My last relationship was when I was alot younger at the very beginning of highschool but still had a huge impact on me. She was also a very sweet shy type of girl and I truly loved her even though we were so young. Out of the blue one day she texts me saying that things aren't working out and she wants break up. I tried to get her to give me a reason and all she would say is ""I have a lot going on right now"". The next day I dropped her thing off at her house and she never spoke to me again. I still don't really know what the true reason was and it has made me absolutely terrified to have relationship again. She broke up with me when I thought we were at our happiest so I've been too scared to try another relationship since then. So now onto the girl I have a crush on I guess...

Back in highschool she was pretty shy and quiet as I said. I know she has anxiety and depression which I think we could bond over and help each other through because I go through waves of that as well. She is the first girl that I  can even think of spending my life with since my last girlfriend. I just don't know how to start a relationship with her. I'm super shy and don't talk to people much myself  plus with covid going around we wouldn't even be able to hang out necessarily.

Yesterday she shared a post on Facebook where she replies to each comment with one of the pics in the post which remind her of that person. ( Hope that made sense) I commented and a few minutes later the pic she replied to me with was a boy and girls hand exchanging a rose. I don't know what to think of that. Does she like me? Does she think I'm cute? Or is she just being nice? Lol. Thank you for reading my rambles sorry if it didn't make sense. I appreciate any advice given.üòÅ

239,"Let me explain. 

I am a 18 year old American boy. 

First I will start with my father. I love my dad but he has done some bad things. He is bipolar and he always needs to feel needed. He would limit his kids social contact and be mentally (and sometimes physically) abusive and then would frame himself as the only person who could comfort us. He would say things to make us hate our mom, grandparents, and even each other. He would mentally break us down and build us back up with him as our support beam. He would make us do everything. 

Next my mother. She is a bipolar, schizophrenic, drug addict. She is mentally incapable of what it takes to be a proper mother. Her schizophrenia made her believe some terrifying things that she would for some reason preach only to me as a kid not my siblings. I never knew how to relax because I thought death would come at any second. She left when I was 8 and has been in and out since then. And I want to forgive her in the limited time I have left (I‚Äôll explain in a bit)

Now for my (first) stepmom. She moved in the week that my mom left and immediately took control of me and my siblings lives. She would punish us cruelly for small things (tie us to chairs, take things away and force us to watch everyone else get it, put us in our rooms with little human interaction for extended times. And the fighting between her and my dad was intense and daily and being the middle kid I would sacrifice myself to take the punches (metaphorically mostly) while the older ones kept the younger ones out of sight. 

Now my siblings. I am the 5th born of the 10 from my father (one from a woman before my mom, seven from my mom, one from an affair while with my mom, and one from my former stepmom) we all love each other very much and care for each other but we are complicated because someone always had to step up to be the parent and for the last 5 years that has been me and it has been worst for me because I literally had to be because my stepmom left multiple times and my dad had lost his job at points. 

Finally, my girlfriend. She is a polish girl I have known for 3 years. In that time she has become my best friend, my only friend, my only light in the dark. We know everything about each other and we love each other extremely. And since I‚Äôve graduated from high school last month I will be moving to poland in December (hopefully). 

And this is where I need advice. 

1. I know I am ready to move there. There is not a single thing in this world I want more than to be with her. But I am having trouble talking to my dad about it as we have a complicated relationship. He may have a new wife who is decent ,but to my younger siblings, I am their ‚Äúmom‚Äù and with that comes the call of my responsibility, my instincts that I have developed over years of taking care of them and protecting them and teaching them. I don‚Äôt know how to overcome this ‚Äúguilt‚Äù it seems like a mountain 5x the size of Everest and there is o going around it. But I know what I want, and that is to move to poland. I just need to learn to move on. 

2. My past has taken away my ability to appreciate life. I don‚Äôt know how to feel truest happy because I‚Äôve never felt it before. As a result I don‚Äôt know how to enjoy things. Growing up, anything for me was bad, and enjoyment was bad. And now that I‚Äôm older this has transferred into my life and I don‚Äôt know how to appreciate things truly. Happiness is the fruit, and I, am Tantalus. I want it, I can see it, I can reach for it and almost touch it but my past always seems to drag me down and never let me taste what this fruit is like. I look at the world and I just see grey. The only thing that makes me happy is my girlfriend, 5000 miles away. 

There is so much more I could say but I don‚Äôt want to write too much I just need help I am having so much trouble moving on. Please.",23Jul2020,3

In addition, there‚Äôs a chance I might not even go to that school. Why, you might ask? Well, it‚Äôs simple. My mother quit her job as a doctor and one of the most suitable job opportunities for my dad is in Massachusetts. Not only that, but with my family‚Äôs semi limited funds, they want to go on a road trip around a country in an RV, an experience that I wouldn‚Äôt enjoy and one that would borderline stress me out, but every time I try to mention that I would hate and that it would stress me out, they just tell me ‚Äúbut the RV is so nice.‚Äù The friend I‚Äôd normally talk to about this has been avoiding me, and the one I did tell made it a joke and it pissed me off.

248,"I (14F) have a hard time controlling my negative emotions, so I tend to get kind of pissy with my parents (for example I will give them short answers to questions and will sometimes talk back to them). Most of the time I won‚Äôt realize I‚Äôm doing this until afterwards, and despite me trying my best to control my anger and sadness, it gets out one way or another. I think this has something to do with me not having an outlet for these emotions.

When I try to talk to my parents (mostly my mom) about these emotions she tells me that it stresses her out and that she cant deal with it, so I really dont have anyone to talk to.

I guess the real question here is should I hold in my emotions? or try to find an outlet?

249,"Hey guys, a few months back I made a post on r/RAOBJ (random acts of blowjob) and this guy in my area agreed to meet with me. He ended up giving me his instagram and snapchat, but there was a girl on his instagram and I asked him who she was and he said ‚Äòshe‚Äôs my ex‚Äô. I didn‚Äôt believe him really, but decided to meet with him anyway. We met around three times after this and he posted a picture with the same girl on his Instagram with some heartfelt caption saying how much he loves her. Upon seeing this , I went to her page and saw that she has tons of photos with him as well as his name in her bio. 

I contemplated telling her when I first found out a few months ago , but decided not to. Now I feel guilty for keeping it from her and my now current BF has just done something horrible to me and I keep thinking of how I would hate for something like that to be hidden from me. It‚Äôs been so long though so I don‚Äôt know whether or not I should tell her. Advice please ...",23Jul2020,1
252,"Good day to you, I'm a young man (18) on the threshold of greatness, I have invulnerable ambitions to change the world and while I realize they may be childish I cling to them all the same. You see while my ambition strong, I feel lost. I'm going into my senior year of Highschool and I've succeeded in having near perfect grades throughout school, in addition to this I received perfect scores on my AP tests this year. I'm excellent with self motivation and always seem to aspire towards my next goal. 

Despite my self-assured success in both present and future, I struggle to find a reason for why I do it. Every day my hobbies lose more meaning and every time I attempt to glimpse into my future through my imagination, I'm always confronted with my own question, ""Why bother striving for such greatness when you already have all that you need"", why have money? Why bother with meaningless hobbies? why must I search for love? Why must I aspire to make the world a better place? The thing I enjoy most in life is watching kindness and love blossom, to sit cross-legged with the enlightening scent of sunset air brush against my whole being. You see I have everything I need, no endgame, no grand goal, no reason to engage myself in hobbies, just a childish idea of what I could do for people as a world leader. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I come seeking advice from you no matter who you are. Do I strive to change the world and help to make it a better place or do I simply live out a happy average life? I'm young and have a great deal to learn before I could begin to chisel away at what my true purpose is, but here I am questioning it now.",23Jul2020,2

For example, at work there use to be times where we had to ask people to wear a mask, and if they told me No, I straight up could not tell them they couldn‚Äôt come inside, I had to rely on my more aggressive coworkers to come handle the situation.

I know no one can ever give me a solid answer, I have to figure that out myself, but I was wondering if anyone had any tips on how to tell if I‚Äôm actually attracted to women, or if I just think they‚Äôre pretty and how I feel in regards to the idea of being in a relationship with a girl is normal for a straight person and I‚Äôve just been looking too far into it. 

For more information I guess, I‚Äôve always been completely ok with the idea of dating girls, when creating fantasy scenarios in my head I can easily put a boy or a girl in the spot of the fake partner, I can easily picture myself kissing/falling in love with/being with a girl in the same way as I can with a boy, I can easily picture my future self being married to either, I kinda want a girlfriend in the same way I kinda want a boyfriend (but I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôve just convinced myself I do).

260,"TL;DR: Do I stay and live at home with my parents during my only year of graduate school and save money or live on my own with my friends and spending around $800 a month on housing/food (my preference) 

Right now I have just graduated college and I am about to start graduate school. Before COVID I had everything planned out, I would be going back to the college I attended (my in state school) and I was going to be living with friends as I was before. However with COVID my school is giving the option to do online classes. With Grad school being as expensive as it is and my parents paying for my tuition and most of my rent the last few years I offered to pay rent instead of my parents. I have two options live in the city of where my college is or live with my parents for the next year. 

I would much rather live on my own with my friends than live with my parents. However, staying at home would allow me to save money to move out after graduate school and help my parents pay graduate school at the same time. Living with friends would give me more freedom and more room to grow up as I would be handling all my finances., however that‚Äôs an extra $800-$1k a month I could be saving. While living with my parents seems to be the smarter move im still unsure. Living with my friends is the choice I want but i‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the choice that‚Äôs the best for me.

264,"Hello all, I‚Äôm new to this so I apologize if I don‚Äôt use correct acronyms during my rant and advice seeking post. 


So long story short I have been dating this guy (30) for 2 years now. We met at work and became close friends. Once we were close friends I made the first move. We became inseparable after that. We faced hardships together. We both got fired from our employment do to an incident off of work. He got a way better job and advised I didn‚Äôt have to work for awhile and I didn‚Äôt. I wanted to continue to do what our career was prior to termination and he was not happy because it was a male dominated profession. 
I stayed without a job for 7 months he paid all my bills. Lon story short our fights became violent he would drink and become this angry person he would get drunk and leave then come back at 2/3 in the morning or the next day asking to come home (he moved in with me) I forgave and allowed it. For Christmas his ex gf called and I answered she told me they were hanging out and they‚Äôve seen eachother a couple of times since our relationship began. I cried all day. Instead of comforting me he left to Applebee‚Äôs were he text me to join him for dinner. I declined his offer and he pocket called me minutes later and I heard him flirting with a girl. Me, being the anxiety driven nervous  wreck I went out to the Applebee‚Äôs and  as soon as I drove up I saw another girl in his car. I made it known to him that I saw as I parked in front and waved and left. During my drive home I attempted to call and text him to receive answers... I just got the ‚Äúit‚Äôs over I‚Äôm done with you‚Äù text message. I was heartbroken. I needed comfort and I reached out to a guy I use to see but he lives a couple hours away. I got home packed up and left... my ex called me an hour later to stay gone because he needed to talk to me he attempted to get me back home for 15 minutes. His ex gf then text me to advise me that he was then calling her. I called him to get answers AGAIN and he was at Applebee‚Äôs with his friend getting drunk. I left stayed two nights with this dude. I couldn‚Äôt take it I couldn‚Äôt take the crazy feeling of being heart broken I came back to my house and he showed up later checked my phone and saw my maps that I had gone to that other guy. He made my life hell called me every name in the book and made me feel dirty and bad about my actions when he forgot about his. Fast forward to a week or so later we talked he said he would stop drinking and stop being an asshole we went to counseling for 3/4 months. On my birthday he flipped out over a dog my ex gave me and said I put him last because the dog got lost and I looked for it. he left to his parents and got drunk he returned at 5/6 am to pull me off of our bed and said he wanted to the bed and to take everything he paid for. He grabbed me by my foot and pulled me out of bed. When i asked if I could change he corned me and yelled at me and said all for a stupid dog. At the time I had enough of the emotional abuse and lost it I started throwing everything out I, myself got the California Kong sized mattress and threw it in the garage. He attempted to calm me down and I just couldn‚Äôt, I couldn‚Äôt. 
Weeks later he got an apartment and again he called me and asked to forgive him, I did. I told him I could not tell my parents because they have had enough with my stress of going back and forth with him he agreed to letting things calm down between my family before we told them. My parents came to visit me so I stayed home that night. He got mad got drunk and called his ex. He had his ex sleep there with him at his apartment that night the next day he called me telling me horrible things to take him his keys to the apartment and said I was a POS. When I went to take him his keys his ex gf was there he flaunted her around me and made me feel so little. 
After she left he called to apologize I had it at the time and cried and cried. He continued to call and beg I finally forgave him. A couple weeks went by and he did the same thing got drunk and broke up with me. He had his ex gf there for two days... after she left he called me and same thing all over again. I don‚Äôt know what to do this man is clearly stepping all over me using me,  cheating on me, disrespecting me and I can‚Äôt get out from under his spell. What is going on someone please tell me what to do how to stop this madness In my heart. How do I stop caring for such a horrible man.",23Jul2020,5
265,"Basically around my (21F) recent birthday, my dad came out as a drug addict to me. He did not explain many specifics at the time, but it obviously hit me very hard because I had been completely oblivious. Because he wasn‚Äôt doing HARD drugs per say, he wasn‚Äôt doing anything at home around me or noticeably drugged up. So I did not know.

A few months have passed since that and I‚Äôm spending time with the family due to COVID. We‚Äôd been doing fine around each other and I never asked for more specifics from him, though I‚Äôve wondered. Well, had a heart to heart with my stepmom the other day (like crying, talking for hours) and she explained it all in more detail. Essentially, my entire life he‚Äôs been on drugs. And I‚Äôm not some kind of frigid SAY NO TO DRUGS person either (I mean unless it‚Äôs the really hard, damaging stuff bc that seriously ruins lives). Weed isn‚Äôt /bad/ to me. But things got bad in high school, my dad stopped coming home from work. Most nights he never came home. I rarely saw him. Turns out, a woman I considered an aunt (not by blood) had been buying and supplying him with drugs because he asked her to and maybe she was in love with him, maybe she was just trying to be a good friend, who knows. He then started mixing pills and nearly overdosed when I was 15. No one ever told me‚Äîuntil now. That moment changed things for him I guess. 

So I find all this out just a few days ago. That all this stuff was happening while I was struggling in high school, feeling depressed and abandoned (or then he was overbearing if not neglectful), that he was hurting my stepmom with his actions and being a bad husband and father. And I just feel like I don‚Äôt know what to do, how to act around him since that conversation. I don‚Äôt want to be mad at him for the past, and she‚Äôs forgiven him for everything. But I kind of feel like ... I never even knew this person I call my dad. Like my whole life what I‚Äôve seen has just been a pretense. And so now I don‚Äôt know how to be with him, so I‚Äôve just been quiet or irritated/mean when he is at home. And I don‚Äôt like being this way, but I feel stuck. So, if anyone has made it to the end of this really long post... I would really appreciate some advice on how to make things normal again. Do I talk to him about this? Please help me.",23Jul2020,1

280,"

I recently  got stopped by a police officer on my way back home from work. It was like around maybe 11 because I got off late since I work the late shift and I was just coming back from a rural area. I was in my company car that‚Äôs marked with our logo on it.  The road was dark on my way back home because I was in a rural area so I had my bright lights on. And I didn't realize it was still on when I got closer to home . And as I'm driving a police officer was like behind me and I was worried at  first because I thought I was speeding but then the cop passed me up and I was like okay Im  good then further down he started slowing down so I started slowing down too because i didn't want to pass a cop up and we were both going really slow , so I just got behind him . I haven‚Äôt been in that situation before so I figured with us being the only 2 on the road he would‚Äôve flashed his lights or did something to get my attention without slowing down. I‚Äôve been followed  by a cop once  before in an area that‚Äôs known for having that issue . The officer followed me until I pulled into my drive way and he drove off. I wasn‚Äôt sure if it was a similar situation. Plus the fact that he had just passed me up I assumed I wasn‚Äôt doing anything wrong. 
He later turned off and I turned off into a neighborhood not far from my house just so he can get off me. Then as I turn he was right behind me and put his lights on. So i pull on the side and I'm looking for the license and registration and it was kind of like I could kind of hear something but I couldn't hear too good. Then once I realized he said driver get out the car I got scared so I was trying to hurry up and get my phone to record because I didn't feel safe at all and I didn't have time too because he kept raising his voice like DRIVER GET OUT THE CAR! I didn‚Äôt take my phone out because i know there‚Äôs a possibility it could be mistaken as a weapon. 
So I hurried  up and get out and he just said you know it‚Äôs illegal to have your bright lights on. I was confused because I didn‚Äôt even realize that and also I was scared because it‚Äôs late at night, dark and an officer has never demanded me to get out the car. 
He said I was blinding people ( we were the only 2 in a 2 lane road) and I  blinded him and I needed to turn it off and it's illegal and I just said I didn't realize it and didn't know that and he let me go...
But I felt it was weird situation because why ask me to get out the car and yell at me like that?! Is that normal ? Was I in the wrong? I‚Äôm not a person who‚Äôs dealt a lot  with law enforcement and that had me shaken up even if he didn‚Äôt give me a ticket.",23Jul2020,2

It seems fairly open and were pretty close at this point. she cared if I left her open and about my feelings and constantly told me that I was cute and that she wanted to kiss me.

After that she becomes distant and dry with me and very much the opposite of what she was before almost like trying to talk to a girl for the first time over text and them just being dry asf to drop the hint.

This girls hasn't flirted with me in two days and today she didn't text me once and when I texted her late at night she became dry and did that whole ""I'm going to bed in 15"" which we all know is a lie bc they just don't wanna talk to you like she did that last night too and then I just say ""right...."" ""gn"" bc i'm really over it here. BUT THEN she goes ""um okay"" like she was offended by that???? I'm so upset because It's like i'm getting the hint that she's not interested but then when I ask if we should just stop talking she doesn't understand and then proceeds to NOT flirt w me or text me. So then why are we ""talking and flirting"" like HELLO were clearly not so can we just end this? At this point her and I don't rly talk every day and she seems so distant and i've yet to have anything cute ever said back to me so i've stopped complimenting her; she is also not affected by being left open or not being texted at all",23Jul2020,2
286,"If anybody could give me some advice, I'd really appreciate that. Any ideas as to why they would've left, even just your stories. I do still have contact with this person so if anybody knows what I should say, that would be really nice to hear.

\----------------------

My group is pretty accepting and friendly, by no means a ""bad crowd."" It's been a year now and for the sake of anonymity, we'll call the person who left the group ""X.""

X was -- in the past -- in a toxic relationship with another member of the group, but they have been long gone for at least a year or two.

X was in yet another relationship with another member, but it just fell through in the end, no dramatic break nor baggage to my knowledge. That person is still a part of the group. I suspect this person was depressed and - hard maybe - may have been slightly manipulative? (definitely not a narcissist nor a sociopath; I have seen them before) That would give incentive to avoid the group.

X seemed to have some issues at home and could have been dealing with depression, so another friend would consolidate X and listen to their issues. The friend who'd help X will still occasionally text them today, but rarely get a text in return.

From what we know, X is at another post-secondary school and hasn't moved out of town, so distance probably wouldn't be a reason. It should also be noted X isn't confrontational and unfortunately, lacks assertiveness.

287,"Hey there. I been having a problem over the past six months or so with speaking correctly and remembering words that has been increasingly bothering and concerning me. This issue began early this year (Pre-Covid, if that matters) and has been slowly getting worse. I've found over the past few months that when I'm speaking with others my vocabulary has shrunk considerably and I am speaking in much more simple sentences. I have also found that I frequently have to take long pauses in the middle of sentences to remember words. In addition, I have also been forgetting the definitions and proper usage of more complex words, leading to me compulsively looking up and attempting to memorize the definitions of many words. These issues probably come off as trivial but they've been seriously bothering me and I'm not sure if I'm overreacting to all this. Thank you in advance for your advice.",23Jul2020,2

290,"So I'm a 30 year old male, and my brother is a 27 year old male. We live in the United States. He has two bachelor's degrees (one in biology, the other in microbiology) and he has a master's in supply chain management. 

Throughout his life he's always had a lot of trouble communicating with people, making friends and connections, etc. He's also always had a very superior attitude and an argumentative streak. His performance in school was always very hit or miss. My parents did a lot of work to get him through school but when he got to college, he said he wanted to go to medical school, hence the two biological degrees, but he was only able to get those through supplementing them with summer classes, and additional help. etc. He couldn't get into medical school and got the Master's hoping it would get him a job.

He's never held a 'professional' job before, and the few part time jobs he's held before have never lasted very long, either due to circumstances or due to something he said or did that caused problems.

I had a lot of struggles out of college trying to find a 'professional' job and so I can't really blame him for that. However, since getting the Master's it's been over a year and he has yet to find something.

Last year he started interviewing with a military recruiter about possibly going through an officer training program due to his multiple degrees. The process took a very long time though and now with COVID they've told him that it's been delayed indefinitely. He actually has recently been speaking with an Air Force recruiter as well, hoping to just enlist and forget about the officer program, however, the fact that his officer candidacy is apparently still intact caused problems, and although I'm not sure, I think he may have said something to the Air Force recruiter that may have made them realize that he may have problems mentally.

He's been staying with my parents for years now, and has little social interaction outside of me and two friends he knows from college whose main interaction with him is online games. My parents pay for everything he has including health insurance since he can no longer be classified as a dependent and yet he is very combative and argumentative with them every single day over minor things, and seems completely ungrateful over everything they've done for him.

Now, I do think that part of his situation is just the way the state of the world is with the economy and the pandemic, but I also think that a big part of the problem is his personality and/or mental health issues but I have no idea how to address that. Therapy has been suggested to him before but he doesn't trust therapists and gets angry at the suggestion. Also, he's 27 years old, it's not like he can be forced into it either. He's never been tested or diagnosed for any autism spectrum disorders but I really think he might have Asperger's or something along those lines.

Last night my Mom called me and broke down into tears because she just doesn't know what else she can do for him.

I've talked with him and tried to help him through the process with this military recruitment thing, but I do feel like I only get part of the story from him and he doesn't usually want to share information if something goes wrong. Is there anything I can do to help him? Either to get him to address his issues or to just get him a stable job where he'll be able to get out of the house?

He's also learned a little bit of coding on the side just from free online courses and stuff, but I doubt he'd know enough to be a viable job candidate for anything like that anytime soon. I really think something needs to change soon, just because the situation has gone on so long and I don't know if I could reasonably recommend him for another year long training program or something along those lines.",23Jul2020,2

So basically around November me and W were talking and thought to exchange reddit accounts just for fun, so we did that. At the time his only had images of their pets and stuff. Well today I decided to check back in on W‚Äôs reddit account and saw posts from about 150 days ago about M being depressed and part of the time suicidal, going into detail about how he self harmed, referred to himself as worthless, unworthy of the people who are nice to him, and a bad person. I assume this has to do with the fact that I‚Äôve seen some people online will dump all of their problems onto M, with him being too nice to refuse their venting or ghost them (I asked him today why he doesn‚Äôt do that as it came up and he said, ‚Äúcause Im too nice and hate myself for giving a shit about random people‚Äù) I genuinely don‚Äôt know what to do now as W hasn‚Äôt had really any posts relating to it since then and I don‚Äôt want to intrude on their business.

296,"In a post from months ago, I had stated the situation I'm in with our roommate, who is also our friend for well over 11 years. Long story short;

\-Usually in a cranky mood

\-Makes backhand comments about us needing to do the dishes ( we can be a bit messy )

\-1 hour bathroom use 3x a day ( 4 of us in total living in a single apartment )

\-Disappears half of the week with her boyfriend

\-Hasn't had a job since the pandemic in Feb and we've been supporting her since

\-Doesn't cook/clean/contribute anything 

\-Anytime she's confronted, she tends to 'shut down' and sort of avoid us

&amp;#x200B;

Ready to give her the boot but my husband is like ""Not tonight. She's in a bad mood"". This is EXACTLY why I want her out. Her being in a bad mood affect us all...including telling us to be quiet when it's well BEFORE midnight when we're gaming, and generally sours the mood. What I'm upset about, and not actually afraid of, is losing her as a friend. She's petty and will most likely remove herself from our lives despite everything we've done for her, which only makes the situation worse. Sabotaging a friendship because she's the problem in this household and she's definitely got her boyfriend's house and aunt's house to live in but chooses the convenience of living with us because who else will buy her food, provide ALL the necessities ( laundry detergent, toiletries, food, and transportation )? Because clearly it's not her boyfriend or her aunt since she asked to live with US over her boyfriend or aunt.

&amp;#x200B;

She just got home after being away for 2 weeks with her boyfriend because she got 'stranded'. Boyfriend didn't have his car, she didn't wanna take the bus. She clearly had no problem asking my husband for a ride to work 40 min away almost everyday or have issues ordering an Uber. She was 'stranded' because she wanted to be there, not because her hands were tied.

301,"Hey, I don't use reddit very often, and I'm not even sure if this is the right place to post this, but I really need help. I can't talk much about this issue anywhere else, and I'm in a really tough spot right now.

To sum it up, earlier today, one of my friends (We'll call him P) was on Parsec with my best friend (And he'll be C, just to simplify things.) Unfortunately, C had forgotten that P was still on his computer, so he proceeded to browse porn sites. One of these sites was a site called AI-Dungeon, where C proceeded to create a custom scenario with him and me.  
This scenario was specifically NSFW just from what P could tell. This went on for a short while, until C clicked off. I did not know of this until \~2 hours after the initial event.  
Now that I know what happened, I feel really uncomfortable around C. P told me that he apparently had feelings for me for a month, so I'm assuming this stemmed from some sort of obsession with me. C has some kind of mental illness, likely depression, and I'd heard from another friend (He'll be G.) that while he was dealing with his depression, he used to have someone he obsessed over too.  
If it wasn't obvious by now, I'm in a very tough spot. I don't want to tell C about what happened, because I know it'll make him feel very guilty and it'll probably cause him to become more depressed. But I also feel really uncomfortable when talking to him. Trying to avoid talking to him is near impossible, since he shares most other social medias I use (including Discord, where he is in a lot of servers and group chats with me.)  
Just as a side note, we are both minors, so I'm not sure how this would be handled in a legal standpoint.

311,"I have a friend I've known for 10 years since we were 14. We were very close.
Fast forward at age 17, I get us tickets to a concert and at the VERY last minute she leaves me on read and ghosts me for the entire day. I was very embarrassed because I told everyone about going to this concert and she just ditched me without saying a word. Next few days she tells me she was having family issues which is why she never replied (wtf), so I kept pushing asking why the fuck couldn't she had let me know or texted. And she had nothing to say other than she was busy... so I stop talking to her for a year because I was butt hurt lol and she seemed to not even give a shit. After that year we reconnect and start talking. 

There have been times where I felt like she didn't value our friendship as much as I did but I felt like I had no one else as close to me as her so I continued our friendship. 

When we were 22 is when I'd get a few texts from her or sometimes no reply until a few days later . And I would always get excuses but when I would do the same she'd text me asking why did I take so long to reply.

At 23, I moved to a diff city and she would not even call or FaceTime me so I could show her my new place. I called other friends and mentioned this and they thought it was weird.

The excuse I'd get is that she doesn't like FaceTime or calling, she feels awkward. Bullshit because she's always tell me about FaceTiming some dude yet never with me anymore (we use to FaceTime and call a lot as teenagers).

So, recently I've tried hanging out with her ever since I came back home this year and she would have an excuse but then I find out she hung out with another friend through social media. I found out through a mutual friend who contacted her about the post. The next day, I got what sounded like a confession about her hanging out and why it happened I was confused on why she felt the need to explain herself to me because I know damn sure she's hung out with someone this past 6 months. 

I had texted her a month ago asking her something and she didn't reply until 4 days later confessing she had seen my text. I thought cool whatever and would try communicating with her but after awhile it would fizzle out. She ended up texting and I just decided to completely ignore her until I got scared about something in my personal life . So 7 days later I wrote her a paragraph and what was I met with? Radio silence. She hadn't checked up on me or anything and what irks me so much is the fact that she would always make side comments about my late reply's but she hasn't been there on my biggest life events yet she wants me to be happy about her possibly starting a family now. 
Like fuck outta here. But then I feel like I'm being an anti social person?

315,"I used to be friends with a girl from November up until the end of January. It was a great friendship. We were up late on calls all the time, we talked almost everyday and we were even the first people the other talked to of the decade. 
Towards the end of January, we had a falling out. See, in the middle of December, I was being a completely self centered jerk and let‚Äôs just say that it didn‚Äôt end on the greatest note. 

A few months later in early March, I was telling one of my friends about the falling out and she seemed to want to message the girl and get her side on it too, just so she could judge from both sides. I let her and let‚Äôs just say, I have know idea why. She was extremely rude to the girl and it just made things worse. The girl messaged me again saying she wanted to try and be my friend again but my friend who had just messaged her turned that idea off for her. After saying that she gave me a good few days of conversation about everything although even then I didn‚Äôt think I was the issue and blamed her for that. After that, she went into ghost mode again (I.E., ghosting me) and since then I‚Äôve long gotten over the whole or deal for the most part. 

Fast forwards and after some thinking, I realized what had happened and that it was my fault.  Fast forward some more to last night and I was having some late night thoughts and I decided I‚Äôd like to apologize.

My boyfriend told my that we should buy a Nintendo Switch together, the Nintendo is about 380 USD (8500 MXN), he wants to play with me like Mario, and stuff like that, he says he‚Äôd like to buy it mostly because we can both play. 

The thing is... I want to buy my PS5 so that I can play the games that I want, and enjoy the games I‚Äôve been expecting for a long time. Now, I could basically buy both of them. I can already out half of the money for the switch but that would would bring my savings to 0. 


I get 500 MXN (aprx. 22 USD) from my parents every 15 days, that means if I don‚Äôt waste any single peso I have, I could buy the ps5 in 10 months or a whole year (if I buy the switch), and maybe I can get a bit of help for Christmas, and I still have the next few months, the ps5 lunches aprx December (2020).

 Okay, let me explain.  I am a huge fan of this band, so I joined a Facebook group dedicated right said band. I posted that I was looking for friends, because I‚Äôm going through a really hard breakup, and then friend L commented and asked if I wanted to join a group chat. There I met friend M, and the girl this story is about, friend R. 

I didn‚Äôt realize it was a role play group until after. The three girls (friends L, M and R) are ‚Äúdating‚Äù the three guys in the band. Let‚Äôs call them S, R and E. I play R, and R is dating friend R. 

At first we all just talked in the group chat, then things in the chat turned to a different tone. As in friend R started to role play as kissing R (me). Then she private messaged me, and asked if we could continue. So we did. We got pretty far before she said ‚Äútime skip‚Äù. 

But that wasn‚Äôt the last time. And every time we eat farther in farther in the role play. It gets really hot. And she says ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù a lot, to R. And she asks ‚Äúhim‚Äù to tell her why ‚Äúhe‚Äù loves her. And I can come up with reasons, but as time goes on I realize I mean a lot of the things ‚Äúhe‚Äù says. 

I don‚Äôt love her. But I think I‚Äôm developing feelings. Or maybe I‚Äôm caught up in the character/person I‚Äôm pretending to be. I might be clinging to the affection she give ‚Äúhim‚Äù but I don‚Äôt know. 

I‚Äôve tried talking to her outside of being R, and she‚Äôs amazing. It‚Äôs really awkward outside of role play though. I feel like I‚Äôm wasting her time or annoying her. She always reassures me but I feel like all she‚Äôs interested in is R. I‚Äôm worried that if I do have feelings she won‚Äôt feel the same and she‚Äôll want to stop role playing

She has said she really enjoys talking to me, but it could be that she likes the fantasy of being with R, he is famous after all. I really enjoy role playing with her, and I don‚Äôt want to stop. But I don‚Äôt want to pine over yet another person who doesn‚Äôt see me how I see them.

* BIG ONE: Boss asking me to take a 20% pay cut during the COVID lockdown months (April-May) to accommodate for lower revenue/income/etc. for the company. Boss insisted that other employees took paycuts and admitted to forgoing their own salary for the month (emotionally pressuring me into doing it as well?). **I work for minimum wage.** When I told my boss this, they said that minimum wage laws didn't apply to me because I wasn't a contracted employee (OKAY THEN - I signed a W-9 with them) - and Boss said it was a ""slap in the face"" that I would ask for more money during this time, that other employees accepted the pay cut because ""they are adults"".
* Boss texting me late at night, then accusing me of being MIA the next day (a repeated occurrence, nothing was ever urgent - Boss is a night owl).
* Boss telling me to do something, me sending confirmation of done task, then Boss texting me hours later asking me if it got done...repeated occurrence.
* Relative recently passed away, and upon hearing this Boss told me to take the rest of the day off - then proceeded to ask if I could ""at least"" send over 3 project deliverables. Ended up working a full-day anyways. Same issue happened when I had a bad car accident a few months ago - Boss asked if I could send project deliverables over ""just for today"" while I was still at the scene.

I reaaallly want to quit. I never want to put this job as a reference or on my resume, so I have nothing to lose by leaving without two week's notice, but I'd feel bad - the boss is a kind person outside of work, but I cannot stand the lack of professionalism and lack of contract and employee benefits. It's not worth the minimum wage - McDonald's would give me better benefits than this place (no shame for McD's workers - RESPECT, in fact, for being smarter than me).

I've been applying to other jobs, but no leads yet...

Do you guys have any advice?",23Jul2020,1

 Imagine yourself at home, relaxing to whatever moves you. Ping! Ping! Hmm a message from someone you don't know. 


""I have texts and evidence that your Ex is doing meth amongst other things. CPS already contacted. Please message me back""


Your stomach drops. How are the kids!? Meth!? What in the world.....!?


There's a whirl wind of activity over the next week. CPS worker recommemds a lawyer, so of course you do. Even with the virus keeping you from working. This is for your kids! You have to. It's the right thing to do......


Your able to get the kids out while setting up a hearing! Awesome! Wait $300 an hour for the lawyer? Please let this work out


Judge shows leniency towards Ex. Gives her time to come up with money for a lawyer. But I had evidence they couldn't be trusted and I can't afford anymore of this!!!!! Falls on deaf ears. 


At least the judge says you get to keep the kids for 2 months! They start to shine. My God how they seem to grow before your eyes! They almost never mention ""her""
 Hell! She only called 5 times, and once was to bad mouth your daughter!!!!!!! Who's only 7!!!! Ggggrrr


Ex and her husband fail UA tests miserably. Boo ya! Time to win this thing! We can't afford it much longer. 


Next hearing is here. She somehow has a lawyer. It's an absolute mystery how she can afford it but hey.....you did the right thing remember?


By the closing statement, the judge destroys her and says she is not credible and desperately needs help! Holy crap, the feeling of elation is truly something you haven't felt in awhile! But 2 more months with no child support and school around the corner. What do I do for my job here soon. So you step up and ask....


""Judge, I need decision making! School in a couple weeks. You even said she's not credible! I need to figure this out so I can work and get money for my kids""


And!!!!!!!!! Your cut off.
""Not enough info. Good day all. Click""


The floor bottoms out. But but... I've done everything I could do! I didn't do meth. I didn't lie to the court. My kids are healthy and very happy!


And now you get to watch the clock. As it counts down 2 months so your crazy Ex gets the kids back. And hear stories from your daughter how she is being emotional abused and God knows what else.


Why? Because after 15k you have nothing. She somehow has a lawyer, probably due lieing to her family. You just lost the war due to attrition. Good day sir.

I really don‚Äôt know why I feel like this especially when I‚Äôm a really fortunate person and have friends and a great girlfriend. I almost always feel like a waste of space, a waste of just resources and a disappointment. 

I feel like a no body and always tell myself to shut up, don‚Äôt talk because no one cares, don‚Äôt talk because I‚Äôm not funny, nothing would change much if I was gone etc. I sometimes think to myself that I should just leave my girlfriend just because of how I am and who I am and how many better people in every aspect there are. Same for my friends, of course just not in a romantic way. 

I spend lots of my nights just feeling sorry for myself and wishing I just never existed so I didn‚Äôt have to deal with everything in the first place. Im constantly reminded of who I am, and how I can never be ‚Äúnormal‚Äù (don‚Äôt worry it‚Äôs not anything terrible it‚Äôs super first world) and I‚Äôll have to always be lesser than my parents. 

I know I‚Äôm young but everything I do, I feel like I do wrong. I used to be smart and ahead of all my classes and people thought I was going to be big, successful or just something like that, but now I just try and pursue something that I feel is looked down on and I feel like a let down because most of the things I do, I do wrong. I break everything I touch or at least that‚Äôs how it feels. And it doesn‚Äôt matter how much people tell me they‚Äôre proud of me because everything just feels empty. 

I want to die but I‚Äôm majorly scared of death and I wouldn‚Äôt ever do that to the people around me because I‚Äôve already had to experience 2 suicides and I know how it goes. I just love making up scenarios in my head where I have the chance to kill myself without hurting anyone or in a scenario where it would just fix everything but that‚Äôs not how it works, I know. 

I‚Äôm sorry for how I write if anyone even reads this far. I can‚Äôt format and I usually just ramble when I talk about this. I tried to add some line breaks like bot suggested to make this easier on the eyes. I‚Äôm a very fortunate person in many ways so don‚Äôt feel very bad for me.

343,"Hello. I am a 13 y/o male, and my dad's an abusive narcissist. He has abused me and my brother for years now, and just last November he hit my mom. I need advice, but first I'll provide some context

Now, I might go on a bit of a rant but please, just stick with me. I promise I'll get to the point. I'll try to leave out unnecessary details and leave the important stuff in, but idk

&amp;#x200B;

So, I'll start at the beginning.. 

&amp;#x200B;

My dad is a diabetic, also an alcoholic. Those don't mix very well. He gets drunk very often, and he tends to act out in violence. The reason he had hit my mom was because she started ignoring him after he flirted with his ex and even invited her over.

One day, my dad had enough, and he was pissed off at my mom because she wasn't talking to him much anymore. He said he hit my mom because ""she wouldn't stop bitching at him"", when it was the exact opposite. I witnessed the whole thing. I had no idea what to do, and I didn't even think of calling the police.

Then my dad stopped fighting and started yelling at her, and it went on for a while. My brother and I ran downstairs, and my mom came down a little later crying.

&amp;#x200B;

We would've moved if we could've. 

We had nowhere to go.

That was November 2019.

Me, my mom, and my brother all sleep in the same room, and we have been for months. But we found a place we can rent. We're supposed to be moving in on the 1st of August. 

Now, I'm gonna skip back a bit to a few months ago, I was in the car with my dad, he had just brought me back from hockey (before the pandemic). 

I asked him a question I still remember which was: ""why did you hit my mom?"" 

he didn't give a proper answer, be just said cause ""she was bitching at him"" and he told me he would kill her if she kept doing it.

we pulled into our driveway and I ran inside to tell my mom about our conversation and what happened. She's been scared since, and so have I.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I know I'm going in all different directions with this and it might not make any sense, but I'm gonna get to the point.

&amp;#x200B;

He left his facebook open. yep, he logged in on my mom's laptop and never logged out, so we can see all the messages he sends and he gets. He has been flirting with girls, he has been lying about my mom in all sorts of ways, and a bunch of other dumb stuff.

He keeps telling his friends that ""she's gonna come at me with the lawyers"" and how he thinks ""she wants to steal the kids from me""

he sent a message on july 6th (that I just seen today) about how july 26th is an important date for him.

I'm worried now as it's the 22nd and I'm not sure if he's going to try to hurt us or kill us or sue us, but this is scary.

I don't know if I'm being paranoid or not but I don't know what I should do.

I told my mom to call the cops, but she says we need to be in a safe place, and we will do that once we move, but I don't know if we will even make it that far.

&amp;#x200B;

I left a lot of things out, I'll try to answer as many questions as I can, I have to go to sleep soon though so I'll read most of them tomorrow. Please if anyone has any advice reply. Or if you have any questions as well.",23Jul2020,9
344,"Am 20F.

I need both my friends, experience and family to keep me alive. As time progresses, I might lose my friends interest as I wasn‚Äôt allowed to go out at all

I need to explore outside so I can know where my interests lie in (I have no interests at all). But being pro-active in the public means defying my parents because my parents don‚Äôt allow me to go out with like-minded people or friends at all.

Moving out isn‚Äôt an option either because housing is very expensive in Singapore. So, I can't afford to defy my parents as financial cost and university cost is very expensive and impossible to gain single-handedly. 

However, the more I stay with my family, my mental health deteriorates. I still have had to work on my train anxiety as I was raised to take car 99% of the time inclusive of going to and from school and going to work.

Not to mention the society standards, taking train is a norm but yet I can‚Äôt, having a job so that parents can boast to their relatives, getting married asap, getting financial stability for myself, provide a part of my salary to my parents.

No matter how much I think, money is the only way keeping me alive to my basic needs and living without happiness seems to be the norm of life.

345,"Almost a year ago from now i was in a very happy relationship with my ex who I‚Äôll call S for short. Around the same time I had a really good friend that I‚Äôll call A for short as well. One night I felt like it was time to tell S about how I deal with: Depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, ect. We would always discuss our issues and I wanted to be honest with how she was helping me over come these problems. The next day I found out that she canceled our weekend plans because she was breaking up with me, and eventually I found out it was because she was in love with A.

Of course I was crushed, and cause I was blinded by guilt I spent the next few months trying to get her to come back to me. Eventually she had cut ties with me and we haven‚Äôt talked since January first. I‚Äôd still think about her a lot but I had mostly moved on with my life. I‚Äôve tried to really focus on stuff that made me happy like music and the gym. I cut ties with A as well sadly because we began to drift apart after the situation.

However earlier tonight she made a new Snapchat and added me. She said she was sorry for everything that had happened and wanted to be my friend. Of course I got really frustrated and let out all of my anger building up over the past few months and haven‚Äôt let up. Honestly though, I still want her in my life cause we have so much in common, but I don‚Äôt want to lose all of my progress of becoming better

348,"I'll try to make this as short as possible. But basically, I'm a gamer, so I meet a lot of friends online. I started noticing a trend where most people I meet online are suicidal and/or depressed. I deal with severe depression myself but here is where the difference comes in - I keep my depressing thoughts and real life problems to myself. I game to get away from all of that. Everyone else I meet is very vocal about their suicidal / depressive thoughts. In the last year, I've started severely limiting myself to talking to anyone online because of this. I still have one friend that I've been talking to for over a year and he's always been depressed but it's recently gotten worse after his girlfriend broke up with him. My problem with him is that I feel like he only talks to me for validation, so that I can comfort him, and tell him nice things, and encourage him in other aspects of his life. But I'm so tired. I'm not a therapist or anything and I'm dealing with a shit ton of my own problems. He recently wanted to make a drastic change to his life (idk how though with all the corona stuff) so he stopped coming online and everything, stating that he's spent too much of his life on the computer. This kinda pissed me off because when it comes to him wanting to turn his life around, he has no problem cutting me off even though I've been there for him for the past year. Anyways, looks like he realized there's not much you can do with corona and everything being shut down (california), so he went back to messaging me and first thing he does is complain about how everything sucks.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I don't know what to do. I really don't want to talk to him anymore for my own mental health, but at the same time, I'd feel bad to leave him at a time like this. I don't want to seem mean, but I know from past conversations, that I'm the only one he feels comfortable sharing this stuff with, so if I leave he has no one else to vent to. And I know he's not going to be seeing a therapist. I don't know. It might sound silly but it takes a lot of energy from me to constantly have to validate him. Our whole friendship basically revolves around him talking / complaining about his life and me giving him advice and compliments to make him feel better and I'm just burnt out. Thoughts or advice?

But my other roommate gets hot really easily and turns the AC temp down significantly, sometimes to 69F which equals $$$. He complains that his room is significantly hotter because the vent doesn‚Äôt work well (he‚Äôs been there for over a year and hasn‚Äôt bothered to pester the landlord enough to fix it, he‚Äôll only reach out to him once or twice every few months) so he has to turn it down at night, usually behind our backs when we‚Äôre all sleeping. Also, during the day he will turn the AC on and the temp down because, again, he complains that his room is hot but doesn‚Äôt want to open his window to let a nice breeze in and keeps his door closed all day while he works. 

The other roommate also said that he would also turn the heat up significantly in the winter because of the vent issue, which makes it impossible for anyone else to sleep comfortably in the sweltering heat. It also drove gas costs up significantly when they lived together last year. Quite honestly, the last roommate they had wasn‚Äôt one to set their foot down and demand some sort of compromise, and for the sake of everyone I would like to do so.

He also had a brain autopsy, and his organs were given to people in need. The thought of this terrifies me as well. He was a drug addict, but was getting help and really trying to get better. He died due to an unrelated seizure, they said he had a heart defect and that they think he was unrelatedly epileptic his whole life. 

I can‚Äôt get over the fact that he had a horrible life and died at only 21 before even a day of his life was remotely truly good. This thought makes me sick. Not only that, but he was alive for a short while before his mom pulled the plug. He had some brain activity, and even responded to squeezing her hand a few times, and wiggling specific toes. He ended up stopping. The thought that he could‚Äôve possibly knew he was going to die, trapped in his body and unable to communicate is also making me feel sick. He was a wonderful person.

We have never met before, but all of our previous attempts to meet up have fallen through. Most of the attempts have been hindered by our parents refusing to let us meet up.

At the start of this year, I pretty much lost my patience with my parents and the entire world, and booked a plane ticket to see him in September without their knowing. My ticket as well as my hotel-room are both non refundable. And yes-- I did book everything 8 months in advance, because I was piss sure that everything would work out. Of course, this was before covid-19 hit and we would have never booked it if we knew.

Anyhow... I've decided to go see him. I understand there is a pandemic and everything, but I have waited and been a ""good, patient girl"" for 3 years now. And there is absolutely no guarantee that my parents will approve of me seeing him *next year*, when the pandemic may be significantly better.

I'm struggling with how to tell them. I've talked to several people about this and I still cannot get a good grasp on what I should do. I know without a doubt, they will be vehemently opposed. I understand for good reason as well; it'd be scary and dangerous to let your 19 year old daughter fly alone across the country to meet some random boy she met on the internet. However, despite my parents warning me, I will not compromise on this like I have done for the past 3 years.

So far, my old teacher from high school told me that I should ""tell them that you're going. Do not ask, but politely let them know that you've made this decision as an adult and you will be going."" I think this is solid advice that I should take.

I have also created an itinerary plan for them to perhaps alleviate their worries. It includes:

* Airport and Travel Plan (what airport I will be taking, when my flight times are, etc.)
* Navigating Airports (how to navigate an airport, where baggage claim is, what to bring, etc.)
* Important Documents (for the airport, and also my insurance card)
* Hotel Plan (where I will be staying, where that's located, etc.)
* List of potential locations (locations that I might be going to with address and photos)
* Emergency contact numbers (friends who are driving me to airport, # of my bf, etc.)
* COVID-19 Preparedness (how I will stay safe from covid-19)

As far as actually *approaching* the conversation with my parents... well, I have no idea. What should I say? How should I bring it up? ""Hey dad, mom, I am going to fly to Tennessee to see (bf's name) in a month,"" or ""Parents, I want to go see (bf's name). I've bought a plane ticket and everything already..."" etc. Do you guys have any ideas?

**TL;DR: I am going to see my boyfriend who lives across the country. I know my parents will be opposed, but I am going to see him anyways. I am wondering how to approach them on the topic as far as opening up the conversation; what should I say at the beginning?**",23Jul2020,3
370,"I‚Äôm the type who‚Äôs never into anything serious because I‚Äôm too focused on my well-being, my studies and my future. I‚Äôve been seeing this guy every week to chill at his place, we have sex and we just spend the entire day or few days together. We had an agreement that we‚Äôre only seeing each other and not be involved with anyone else. Understandable, it‚Äôs not good to sleep around with a lot of guys so I went along with it and had to drop this one other guy and refrained myself from seeing anyone else. Him and I literally act like a couple and there‚Äôs never a dull moment. One day he says he really likes me. He‚Äôd say he misses me when I‚Äôm not around. He mentioned kids and marriage. But I don‚Äôt feel the same way even though I have fun being with him. He understood and we still kept on seeing each other. 

Then one time I was peeking at what he‚Äôs doing on his phone and I see that he‚Äôs on Bumble chatting with a girl. Other times I caught a glimpse of somewhat flirty messages with another girl. All this while he still claims that he‚Äôs attached to me, I make him happy and all that. I know I was never into him like that in the first place but I feel hurt by the fact that he‚Äôs spilling all those words and didn‚Äôt even mean it. I don‚Äôt want my feelings to be played with like that. He‚Äôs noticed that lately I‚Äôve been quiet and seems like I‚Äôm not okay. Like he thought something was wrong when I didn‚Äôt ask him to shower with me and that‚Äôs cos he was so absorbed on his phone so I didn‚Äôt ask. But I know I have no right to feel that way. My question is, is it reasonable for me to feel sort of hurt and deceived that he‚Äôs trynna chat up other girls?",23Jul2020,2
371,"So I‚Äôm the only girl and the middle child, my older brother is 23, I‚Äôm 18 and my younger brother is 10. Lots of age gaps. Recently I‚Äôve been having issues with my mom and her behavior while she‚Äôs drunk. When my mom gets drunk she gets abusive, controlling and hurtful. The most recent thing she did broke the last straw for me, she asked me to pick her up from her book club where her and her friends read a book for the month and then once a month drink heavily and talk about it. Picking her up was no issue and it was fine. She told me I had to take someone else home which was also fine. So before I start driving she starts immediately shit talking my driving(mind you it‚Äôs midnight and she‚Äôs still drinking), I wasn‚Äôt driving crazy or going too fast I was being cautious, we drop her friend off and my mom gets in the car and starts yelling at me about how scary that drive was and how I‚Äôm driving like an asshole while being extremely negative and hurtful. She told me she was going to drag me out of the car and beat me and more so obviously I defended myself and said do you want me to crash first because that‚Äôs a great idea. 

So we‚Äôre driving back to my house, and she‚Äôs still going off, at this point I‚Äôm pissed, we‚Äôre almost back and her tone immediately changes to ‚Äúwhy are you mad, what‚Äôs going on, why are you upset‚Äù which made me even more mad. We get back and I stop in front of the house and told her that how she just acted was abusive and hurtful and that I wasn‚Äôt getting out unless she apologized. I threatened to leave if she didn‚Äôt because I just needed to breathe. She flipped out and tried to take the keys out but ended up breaking my key off the key fob. I sat there with my car off in full breakdown mode until my brother got the spare key (screamed at me first) and parked my car. The next day I was still mad. I told my dad exactly what she was going to say and bring up if I tried to voice how I felt. The next day we had another fight and she said exactly what I said was going to happen. I told her I wanted her to stop drinking and she told me ‚Äúwell I want you to stop eating‚Äù (I struggle with an eating disorder),I was done I just gave up. 

I can‚Äôt voice my opinions without her trying to constantly be right. My brother helped me pay for my car, and I paid more than he did and I‚Äôm working on paying him back, she always says ‚Äúit‚Äôs not your car‚Äù but it‚Äôs not hers either. This is only one example and I don‚Äôt know how to fix it or what to do, I‚Äôm so frustrated and done. I just want to fix it but I don‚Äôt know how to explain that without hurtful things getting said to me. Sorry if this is long I just need some help",23Jul2020,2
373,"My sister is 13 years old and my aunt invited her, her cousin and her friend to camp with them and I new they were probably going to drink ,but they did it in such a way that I need to get her ass in deep shit. I don't dislike my sister I just don't want her disrupting others and potentially hurting herself. Again she's only 13.

376,"I have posted some about this before but it is ruminating with me. I can't stop thinking about what I've done.

My fiance has two children (10 and 6) who he shares custody of with his ex. I have always gotten along fairly well with her. We've always been friendly and respectful, texted occasionally and gotten together on the kids birthdays and for school events. She has always seemed to want a deeper relationship and I have been reluctant to open up to her. I am a very guarded person so I have always tried to just be kindly supportive of her without opening up too much.

&amp;#x200B;

I got engaged in February. Ultimately my fiance and I decided not to invite her to the wedding. I knew I would feel uncomfortable. When she found out she was apparently very upset and started being really standoffish and a little bitchy. I wanted to reach out. I really thought I was doing the right thing. I told her how awesome it was that she was supportive of us and our day and how much I appreciated her wanting to be there, that it had nothing to do with her but it just wasn't what we were comfortable with.

She took a month to respond - the day before her son's birthday party telling me how I had ruined the family and that she know longer wanted anything to do with me but would be polite for the kids.

Somehow I thought I could still salvage this (I know. I should have stopped. I tried to explain myself. Why it was hard for me to have her there. Why it had nothing to do with her. How much I appreciated how open she had always been but that things were hard for me.

She called me insecure, told me I was putting myself before the children a bunch of stuff I shouldn't have responded to. She kept badgering me and bullying me and eventually I snapped back at her. I feel awful for what I said. I criticized her for ruining her marriage, for the way she parents, for fighting with her boyfriend.

I apologized immediately before she could even respond. I feel so awful. I have never spoken to anyone that way. I don't have any excuses.

Needless to say she did not take that well. She does not wish to have any further contact with me at all at this point.

I don't know what to do. My guilt is destroying me. I ruined what was a good relationship, could have stopped at a functioning one and then took it way too far and destroyed everything.

I haven't eaten or slept in days. I hate myself for destroying everything. For hurting my fiance. For hurting his kids. I have been contemplating self harm. At night I can't sleep so I just take out pills. I look at them. Occasionally take two or three. Never more. But I'm scared I'm warming up to it.

I've considered leaving my fiance. I know he deserves better. I know his kids deserve better. I don't want to go but I don't want to keep living with this guilt. It is destroying me.  I think I should go, but I love him so much. We talked about it today. He doesn't blame for what happened. He says he's not worried about it. That everything will be fine and he just wants me to stay. But I feel like I can't. I can't face his children. I feel like I'll never be able to discipline them effectively with all the guilt I will feel for the rest of their lives. 

Any advice. Please, please. ",23Jul2020,2
377,"Hi everyone, so I am male 25 years old, and basically all my life I have had issues sticking to things.

What do I mean by sticking to things? Well just sticking to a certain goal in general. Like lets say I want to learn how to play piano, I'll start by looking up beginners guides and start a video, but then the next day I already give up on it either out of boredom or I just think myself out of it.

There has been so many things I have wanted to do, but I can't seem to stick to anything. Like daily exercise, meditation, reading, etc.

It's getting to a point where I am getting older now, and I haven't really accomplished anything when it comes to finishing things. Heck even video games, I won't even finish every game I play.

My family has recognized this problem and it has to be the biggest factor in my life that is holding me back from everything. School? I dropped out. Military? I ditched before I took the ASVAB exam.

I just can't get myself to do anything, I always think ""Oh I think I could be good at making music or good at making art or this!"" But I just want to skip to the good part of doing the cool things you want to make, and not learn the basics and put in the time to actually learn to get to that point.

I might be asking a weird question for advice, but if anyone could help me, it could actually save my life.

Because if I don't overcome this mental issue of myn, I may live life without actually accomplishing anything at all. And that, terrifies me..",23Jul2020,2

382,"I am a software developer. Due to Covid-19, I will be working from home for the majority of this year and perhaps beyond. One of my colleagues is visiting family out of town soon, which is allowed by social distancing rules here. Since the family he's visiting have to work during the day, he asked if he could work remotely while he's there too and just spend time with them in the evenings. Being software developers, we only really need an internet connection to work remotely. The company said that this would be unfair to our colleagues who can't work remotely (manufacturing staff, etc), and said that he has to take time off as part of his annual leave. Personally, I think that the manufacturing staff couldn't care less about what we do, and the company is being stubborn. My manager is on board, but the HR department said no. I was hoping to be able to do something similar in a few months myself, so their stance saddens me. If we're literally not allowed to come into the office, why do they care if I work from home or from somewhere else? Does anyone have any advice about how I could bring them around to the idea that some jobs will just have perks that others don't have? 

For added context, the company is quite new (only about 5 years old) and they still like to think we're a start-up. For example, the CEO doesn't have an office and just sits at a regular seat just a few desks over from me. But the company has had some very successful funding campaigns recently, and has grown to over 500 employees in recent years, so perhaps they're being a little idealistic.",23Jul2020,1
383,"I'm sorry idk where else to put this, r/askvet isn't helpful, they dont allow people to even suggest what could be wrong with a pet. 

My dog Peanut is a mix breed, about 25 pounds, and she just turned 2. She was also the runt. 
She was an outside dog with her bigger sister Daisy (almost twice peanuts size). Everything went well since we've gotten them as puppies, and they enjoyed being in their outside kennel area. We'd feed them in the mornings, and a snack in the afternoons. Just a dry and wet food mix. Peanut being smaller, never ate a whole ton, but that was normal for her. 

However one day she started not touching her food at all. But considering they share food bowls, it took a few days for us to catch on. She started not wanting to come greet us when we got to the gate door, so I went in and got her and brought her in the house. She seemed really lethargic and had no appetite. We thought maybe she gotten worms, although they get a treatment every month. So we started there and gave a treatment, and I started force feeding some soft food, and she still drank water on her own. Several days went by and she wasnt seeming better. At this point she started getting little tremors every now and then. 

On the night of the 4th of July, her nose bled a bit of bloody discharge. We decided to take her to an emergency vet, and they did a blood test and urinalysis, they wanted to keep her and do more tests. But we simply can't afford it, it would've been over two grand! The blood test came back with high levels of phosphorus, creatine, and calcium. I dont believe they found anything significant about her urine, just that she was dehydrated.

They said her kidneys weren't doing well and weren't doing what they should be. But at that time it was hard for us to make sure she was getting enough fluid, so that influence could've affected the rate at which her kidneys could expel waste. 

I asked what options we had that we could afford, and they gave her fluids and sent us home with a steroid (prednisone) and anti nausea meds. They gave her the first doses of each before we got her back. And mind you, when we brought her, she didnt want to walk. And her eyes were bloodshot. When they brought her from the exam room, she was walking and looked much more alert, and she even walked to the car. The next day and following days, she seemed so much better, she moved around, ate on her own again, and started to poop again. She really had seemed all better. Except when she ate and drank she acted like her throat was sore, she would move her head weird and swallow dramatically.

They only gave us about a 10 day supply or so of the prednisone. Once she ran out, she started to decline again. She definitely didnt get as bad as before, we were able to catch the decline early. On the second day of her not eating, I started calling local vets to get her in. It was hard force feeding her this time, she was vomiting every other time we did. I was able to bring her to the vet July 21. 

At this point her symptoms are lethargy, vomiting, tremors, the weird swallowing and possible sore throat, and no appetite. I think she's also ran a fever a couple times. The vet didnt seem all that concerned considering she was walking around and alert, and because she is only 2. They also did a blood test and urinalysis. But when the vet called me today to tell me the results, he was very concerned, he said her kidney levels were elevated, and that she probably has kidney disease. And he also said her adrenal levels were elevated and he suspects addison's disease. He wanted us to bring her back for a 400$ test to confirm addison's disease. But we just cant afford it. I asked if there was anything else he can do for us, and he's going to give us some more steroids that I can pick up on the 23rd.

I've been doing hours of my own research trying to find anything. We're going to try and find some homeopathic treatments, at least for the kidney side of things. Ever since we brought her back on the 4th, we've been feeding her a kidney safe diet. 
Since she's so young, I dont like to jump to the conclusion of addison's disease. 

I personally believe she has an auto immune disorder and is fighting off a bacterica, specifically leptospirosis. (We also live around western NC, for our geographic location).

However when I brought up the lepto on the 4th to the emergency vet, and to the other vet, it was basically brushed off. But she has almost all of the symptoms, especially the most prevalent ones, as well it would explain why her kidney function is depleting since it infects the kidneys. I also suspect leptospirosis because their kennel borders the woods near our house, wildlife such as a raccoon or possum could've easily climbed into pen to eat what they left in their food bowls, and contaminated them. As well, we've seen multiple rats around the house, and they are known to carry leptospirosis as well. Peanut also was never vaccinated for leptospirosis. 
Considering she has always been given flea and tick preventives, I wouldn't think it's that likely she'd have a tick borne illness such as lyme disease or rocky mountain spotted fever. 

I want her to have quality of life, but I also want to give her a fighting chance. She's so young, if we could just find the right treatment I think she could bounce back. She's just lost so much weight, I feel so bad for her. It seemed she got sick so out of nowhere. 

We just cant afford thousands of dollars to try and figure out what's wrong, we've spent so much already, almost 2 grand. 

I know this was long and a lot to read, but I wanted to provide as much detail as I can. Thank you if you've made it this far.

Another note, she hasn't been coughing any, and there hasn't been any unusual discharge from her eyes. No bloody stool or pee from what can be observed. And when she does pee, she usually has to pee a couple times. As well, her sister Daisy, has been completely fine, (she also moved in with a family member on the 5th, so she isn't in the backyard anymore). 

If you have any advice on what we can do, or any idea at all what may be wrong with our poor Peanut, please tell me.",23Jul2020,1

387,"So my best friend for 3 years all of a sudden decided to drop me out of no where. When I tried to ask him the reason behind it he left me on read and never responded. Eventually I found that the reason was he wanted to reshape his personality for a different friend group, mainly to be more mature. This lead him to believe that I am not mature enough to be his friend and that cutting me off completely was the best option. The reason this is really aggravating is because we were best friends and he shut it down without hesitation, and he convinced me to transfer high schools so that we could go to school together. Although I wanted to transfer before he recommended it, he was a big factor for the reason that I went. I don‚Äôt want to lose such a good friendship for such a dull reason, but I feel like if he actually cared about the relationship we had, he would‚Äôve tried talking to me before ending things.

396,"So, this happened a couple of months ago: me and my father had a really hardcore fight (for my standarts, that is).

I am a... whatever, young man, 23 years old. I am studying at this private college, paying about US$550 a month (not a USA citizen, nor living there). For the past five years, I was in a deep depression, barelly functioning

At this time, five years ago, I started my studies at this university, when this really hard wave of sadness that drove me to depression hit me. I could do nothing - it was one of those desabillitating ones, that all of you have heard/read about: not eating, sleeping, and my grades and studies going down hill by the minute. I was not trying to hide it, but neither was trying to show it off. My parents did not helped me - my grandparents did, finding me theraphy, and trying to help me get my shit together. 

Anyways, amidst all this, I was fortunate enough to go on a exchange program, and I went to Canada, where I lived, studied, and worked for 6 months. For the first time in my adult life, I felt like a functioning human being. Tripping here, and there. But still, learning how to walk, you know?

So, when I got back, it was time to resume my studies. Thing is... I didn't know if I wanted to resume them... Hell, even now I don't. I don't if is trully what I want. But I tried to push it foward. In my own stupidity, confusion and doubt, I forgot about the payments, for a looong time. Six months, in fact, a total of (around) US$3300. My father pays the college, and when he found out about this debt, he went ballistic. He punched me, slapped me, and stoomped me, 'till blood was drawn.

By the end of it, I used my money, that I raised in Canada to pay for it.

Some people told me it was over the top. Others told me I had it coming. I am an unsecured person, who cannot understand my own fellings. Did I deserved it? Should I be angry?

PS: English is not my first language, so, if any mistakes are found, I am glad to correct them, if pointed. Add to this the fact that I have a hard time trying to explaing myself - in person, or in text. I will happilly explain myself, if needed and asked.

399,"I'm honestly really REALLY unsure what to do in this situation and I'm kind of freaking out about it right now. Here's some background:

When I was around 9 years old, I woke up to my parents arguing about my mom cheating on my dad. When I woke up and came into the room crying, my dad drove me to my grandma's house and by the time I came home everything was fine. That was the end of it.

Flash forward to 2018 (I'm now 15-16ish years old). My dad has moved out of our house due to differences between my parents once again. It's important to say that my parents have never had a healthy relationship. Their bickering was incessant and I was honestly kind of glad that they were on the verge of divorce. It would've just saved a lot of trouble. Anyways, my mental health during this year was going downhill for a multitude of reasons that are completely irrelevant, but over the time that my father wasn't in the house, I noticed a pattern. I have two younger siblings, and on the weekends they would be dropped at my dad's place. On these days, my mom would go out every night and not come home in the morning. I'm definitely not an idiot, and eventually I confided in my grandmother about it, who was my closest family member at the time. Even though I begged her not to tell my mom I told her about it, she confronted her anyways, and eventually my mom confronted me about it. She told me she wasn't cheating, and with the mental state that I was in at the time, I really just wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt and not have to deal with it anymore.

It's now 2020. My parents still don't live together but my dad really is trying his hardest to repair the relationship, but my mom (to my eyes at least) isn't trying in the slightest, regardless of what she says. She kept going out every weekend following the confrontation, and now she will literally call the men she's talking to in our own house - literally no subtlety. The calls she had were never romantic in any way, so I was really scared to confront her about them and just have her deny it to me again. I really just wanted to have a normal life for once, so I ignored it all. Despite this, my curiosity got the best of me, especially when I would literally see her on tinder/bumble/etc., and one day I went onto her phone and found physical evidence that she was cheating. I'll admit that I was wrong with this and I really regret doing it, but she never found out so I just erased it from my mind. Right now, she is on a call with her ex-boyfriend from a year ago (during the time my parents were separated), and she is openly arguing with him about their sexual relationships. I feel as if she knows I'm terrified to say anything about it, but I want to confront her badly. I understand that my parents were separated during the time and are still separated to this day, but I'm infuriated by her telling my father that she is trying to fix their relationship when in actuality she is still doing the same shit she was doing prior.

I'm searching for somebody to give me advice right now. I think it's also important to say that I will have to stay in this house with my mother for the entire year, as my college schooling is remote.

\[edit\] I accidentally pressed submit before I finished, but I meant to add that I'm really trying to avoid an absolute battlefield occurring. I'm really lost right now.",23Jul2020,1
400,"Starting off by saying this is a throwaway since people at work use Reddit. Sorry for length.

I've been working for a small business for close to 4 years now. A little over a year ago, ownership changed hands to someone who had been working there for some time. My ""new boss"" knew I wasn't getting paid enough and gave me a couple small raises as him and his spouse became more comfortable with the finances of the business. This also applied to a couple other long-term employees who stayed on.

I found out in January that an ex-employee who had been working there about as long as myself had left making the same amount I've been making for over a year now. The issue is that I'm crossed trained in multiple areas of the business and know how to do the most tasks out of everyone else, included my bosses. Most employees only learn one job and might learn a couple small, helpful tasks for others departments, but I could work in just about any area and be able to hold my own.

On top of this, I'm basically a manager but without the title or salary pay. I'm constantly given tasks that would typically be reserved for one of the bosses, have responsibilities and privileges that would never be trusted with other employees, I'm in the loop on most changes and decisions for the business, and most co-workers come to me when they have questions or need tasks.

I don't mind doing these extra tasks and working in other areas, but I'm doing all of this while still holding down my own department. Both the ex-co-worker and I feel my pay does not adequately match the skill level and knowledge I possess, especially since they left making the same amount as I make and they didn't have all the cross training and extra responsibilities I do.

We came back from a state mandated shut down at the start of May and I've felt bad about asking for a raise since we spent a whole month out of work. Now I have less than a year left with the business before I have to move and I feel like I should be making something that better reflects my skill level. I really don't want much, just an extra dollar or two.

I've never asked for a raise and with our work dynamic being super casual, I don't know how to ask without it seeming like a big formal ordeal. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",23Jul2020,1
401,"So my friend and I are sexting buddies. We sexted 2 weeks ago. I wanted to start it up again cuz it‚Äôs been 5 months since we last done it. He claims he stopped it because he didn‚Äôt want me to feel used. (Pretty much felt used the entire friendship. But I thx I guess) so I texted him saying ‚ÄúYou got any plans for tonight?‚Äù I felt very bold. And we had a pretty good time when we last got freaky with eachother. He was very into it. Sooo I thought about giving it a try again. He did say I would get more videos of him. Sooo there would be more of this happening. Anyways after I asked him that he said ‚ÄúNah‚Äù and I said back ‚ÄúOh you don‚Äôt? Hmmm‚Äù and he said ‚ÄúYea‚Äù and i said ‚ÄúOh okay. Do you want to do something?‚Äù Hoping him asking ‚ÄúLike what?‚Äù But he just said ‚ÄúUm i think I‚Äôm good for now.‚Äù I feel so many things from that text I have no clue. I feel embarrassed and tricked. Because this is the 2nd time he put me down on this. I don‚Äôt understand, something tells me there a 3rd party in the mix. But I don‚Äôt have proof. 
So I asked him if he knew what I meant by that and he said ‚ÄúYea ik Lol‚Äù I felt disgusted with myself and thought that he thought I was being creepy or something. So I apologized (I really should stop being so apologetic, submissive to him. Cuz it shows I‚Äôm weak) and he said I‚Äôm good. 
Great now conversations aren‚Äôt working and the sexting isn‚Äôt happening. These are the only  things that are making this friendship stay alive. 

I feel like he‚Äôs going through something as well. And I wanna talk to him about it. But Idk how to approach. I‚Äôm still confused on why he said the I think I‚Äôm good. And he added ‚Äúfor now‚Äù..like what? Is that feeling of him not in the mood gonna changeover??
He‚Äôs okay with this sexting stuff. I asked him if he wants to do it before we started it up again, since it‚Äôs been a while and he said it doesn‚Äôt matter to him. I‚Äôm frustrated. I‚Äôm sure he knew where I was gonna go

403,"All my life, I've known my father to be abusive.   Some of my earliest memories of him were witnessing him beating my mom in front of me.  Other times he would attack me out of the blue and tell me that he reacted because I looked threatening to him.  He would also manipulate me into doing things such as help him run his businesses after my mother committed suicide.  He would say things that made me feel as if he would maybe take his own life if I were not to help.  Eventually, we ended up fighting about so many things that he eventually kicked me out of the business and the house we were living in together.  

Since then I've had to rebuild my life with no support from any of my family.  However, he recently reached out to me saying that he wants to fix our relationship.  He cited that his business and personal relationships are failing and that he needs me help.  It comes at no surprise to me since he's always been a major asshole and COVID is shitting on everyone's lives/businesses.  

I wish my therapist would just give me some concrete advice, but instead he is trying to get me to trust my own judgement.  I don't feel that seeing him now is worth it as I'm still social distancing, but at some point I think I would eventually like to find a way to reconnect but I have trouble seeing how I would accomplish that without him causing anymore harm to me.  

I have so many thoughts that conflict with each other.  On one hand, he's still my father and I acknowledge that he had a terrible childhood with no solid role models.  It breaks my heart to imagine him getting old and dying alone.  On the other hand, my gut tells me that he is probably still poisonous and recognizes him as the source of so much pain in my life.  If we tried to talk about any of my trauma, he would most likely deny any wrongdoing.  I often fantasize about ways I can instill the kind of terror and pain that he inflicted upon me.  However, I know that isn't the higher path and would not bring peace.

I was just accused of sexually assaulting an ex-friend of mine while we were in high school.

Additionally, the accusation goes on to say that I drove her home the morning after because she couldn‚Äôt find anyone else to drive her at that certain time. My understanding from my own personal experiences with sexual assault is that you want to be as far away from the person as soon as possible...

There was bad blood and this was renewed especially when we saw each other at a restaurant on her birthday, particularly considering we still have mutual friends.

406,"Long post incoming, i‚Äôve tried to condense it as much as possible. This happened a couple of years ago now but I‚Äôve recently been thinking about things and just want some reassurance really. Sorry about formatting i‚Äôm on mobile and this is my first post ever so if I get anything wrong, again i‚Äôm sorry.

I (F22) was in a relationship with M(M24) for 4 years. I was young and at the start I was convinced I would be in this relationship forever as I was head over heels for him. Everything was good for about 2 years, but I noticed him getting more controlling and angry. He would often punch walls, break x-box controllers, punch himself and slap himself when he got worked up. He was diagnosed with ADHD as a child so I put it down to this and tried to work with him by calming him down every time he got angry. 

It slowly progressed into him taking more of his anger out on me, screaming and name calling etc. until one day he turned around, in the middle of arguing over something really insignificant, and hit me. He instantly regretted it, or so he said, and apologised and was so sweet to me so I forgave him and I promised not to make him that mad again. In hindsight I should have left right there but I was young and foolish.

Cut to another year later and i‚Äôm in a full blown abusive relationship. He continued to get worse and worse, hitting me when he lost his temper and one of the worst things that has scarred me for life was getting into a car accident with him after he was driving down a country lane in the dark with no headlights on at 50mph, didn‚Äôt realise there was a sharp bend and we ploughed straight through a hedge into a farmers field. The car was wrote off but I was unharmed save for whiplash and throwing up in shock. The worst thing was a couple days before we were arguing in the car and he said ‚Äòi‚Äôm gonna drive this car into a brick wall and kill us both‚Äô. The actual crash was sort of a reality check for me, and I decided I no longer wanted to be with him.

So onto the best friend. I have known L(M25) since I was young. We first started talking on BBM, back in the good old days when everybody had a blackberry phone. He lived 145 miles away from me and it was only ever an online friendship, he was funny and really easy to talk to. I was never interested in a relationship with him due to him living so far away, he was just a good friend and we met a couple of times at concerts for bands we both liked. We drifted apart as we got older, especially when I got into a relationship with M. When the abuse started, I really felt I needed someone to talk to who wasn‚Äôt friends with me (most of my friends were friends with M, and to them he was bubbly and charismatic, so I felt nobody would believe me in what I was saying about him). Me and L started talking again, and I confessed to him what I was going through. Around this time I had recently lost my mom to cancer as well, so it was nice to just be able to talk to someone without worrying about making them mad for being sad. 
 I never intended to catch feelings, but with L being so supportive and caring, I couldn‚Äôt help it. He was trying his best to help me get out of the relationship with M as I felt too scared to do it on my own as I was worried what he would do. 

L decided to travel to see me and stayed in a hotel, I was staying in my house. I visited him in the hotel and we had lunch then went to his room to watch TV. We ended up cuddling while I cried and he comforted me. It was the best feeling having someone comfort you after so long of being ignored and isolated. I went home and confessed to L that I had feelings for him, and he said he felt the same way.

At this point M was suspicious that something was going on, but I kept reassuring him that everything was fine and L was just a good friend from when I was younger. Things were reaching boiling point, and around this time I also unexpectedly lost my dad. Losing both parents before 20 was the hardest thing i‚Äôve ever had to deal with, and with M getting more volatile than ever I knew I had to get out. I told L my plan and he explained to my family what was going on as I was too embarrassed to tell them what was going on with M. 

I told M that I wanted a break, and he broke down and threatened to kill himself. So I felt bad (I suffer with manic depression and couldn‚Äôt stand knowing I made someone feel like that when I knew how it felt myself) and reassured M that I just needed some space to deal with the death of my parents. This is when the car accident happened and my life seriously flashed before my eyes. L came to see me again and stayed in a hotel, and I went and stayed with him and we kissed and then it escalated and we had sex. I never intended for it to happen but my emotions were all over the place and I just felt happy with L. 

After this I fully broke it off with M. I didn‚Äôt want to cheat and I especially didn‚Äôt want M to find out I had slept with L while we was still together. I still had to deal with M though, as he owed me money because I paid for a new car for him after the accident because his car had been written off. Also a lot of my dads belongings were still in the crashed car from when I was clearing my dads flat, but I couldn‚Äôt go retrieve them from the car myself as I didn‚Äôt know where we crashed because it was an area I hadn‚Äôt really been to. 

I had to beg M to let me get my dads belongings from his car for weeks, but because he was angry I had broke it off he dragged it out as long as possible. When he finally let me go get them, the car had been broken into and there was glass all in my dads things (clothes etc), so I had to take what was most important and leave the rest behind because he didn‚Äôt want to wait for me to clean things up. 

L was coming to see me more frequently and I stayed overnight with him in the hotel. I told him how I feel like I will never get away from M, as he was still ringing me and texting me saying he loved me and he would change and then threatening to kill himself. L comforted me and helped me come to terms with the fact I was being abused and it wasn‚Äôt my fault.

I realised that if I told M I had cheated on him, he would hate me as he had been cheated on in the past but it probably meant he would no longer want anything to do with me. This was my way out and as shitty as it was that I cheated on M I don‚Äôt regret it. So I told M over text (I was too scared to say it face to face) that I can‚Äôt be with him and I cheated on him but didn‚Äôt say who with. He took it horribly but my plan worked as he said he no longer wanted anything to do with me and blocked me from his life. I was exhausted but finally free, except for the odd text from M asking me for sex or calling me every name under the sun. 

Fast forward to two years later and me and L are living together with our beautiful little puppy and I couldn‚Äôt be happier. But my friends are still friends with M and I feel like I constantly have to explain myself for cheating, but nobody questions M for the abuse because to everybody else he puts on a persona of a happy go lucky person and I feel like nobody believes he abused me. I just want confirmation that i‚Äôm not a shitty person really even though I know in my heart I shouldn‚Äôt feel bad for an abuser.",23Jul2020,2

My friend of 12 years has abandoned me. I met her when we were in kindergarten and we had been friends since. But as we got older she regularly threw me under the bus for things I didn‚Äôt do, or would say rude and hurtful things to me. Whenever I get excited about something or something goes good in my life she is very quick to shut me down and tell me ‚Äúit‚Äôs not a big deal‚Äù or she would point out ways that it possibly wouldn‚Äôt work out. And the most hurtful thing she ever did was out me to my father, I didn‚Äôt have the luxury of coming out to my father, But I still forgave her. She regularly made fun of me by calling me fat and such. She throws a tantrum whenever she doesn‚Äôt get what she wants, and once I started standing up for myself it got worse but I still forgave her for everything. If I did one little thing wrong she would blow up at me and make everything my fault, she constantly overreacts and she is an attention seeker, and yet I still forgave her for EVERYTHING. We started working together and it was going okay till she got a girlfriend. She stopped talking to me out of the blue, we went from hanging out together every day to her not replying to my messages or even wanting to see me. And since I was hanging out with her so much I wasn‚Äôt able to see my real friends. When her and I were hanging out I wasn‚Äôt allowed to have other friends because she ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt want to be abandoned‚Äù. Now that she practically isn‚Äôt in my life anymore I‚Äôve gotten to hang out with my other friends and I‚Äôm starting to enjoy life more.

I've alluded to this problem in a few posts, but this one is straight up admission.
One of the few things that emotionally keeping me going are these rotating romantic fantasy scenarios I have with, at least, 3 people I know in real life. Being in intimate scenarios, being wholesome, sometimes even in a relationship. It's not a polyamory thing, each person is a place holder but what we do in the fantasies vary depending on the person.

2 of them are in relationships and I NEVER want to jeopardize someone's relationship to fulfill my own wants/needs.

1 have them has grown distant with everyone, including me, so the idea of them being remotely interested in me anymore would shock me.

I don't want to dwell in fantasy but, at the same time, I want to have something fun to think about to help keep me going. Might already b3 too late because I've pretty much posted about this on various and individual occassions, it's, admittedly, annoying at this point.

So cut to now. I have the same quantites from before the hunger state as I do now. The only time I haven't felt hungry is when I eat a truck load while my parents are gone.

and by ""death related"" i dont mean suicidal/homicidal; but like what would happen and how would people react type shit. tbh, i think to a degree its normal, but it has become very common in my case.

i always feel negative and fucked up.

btw, not hopeless, sad..

but its more about anger and insecurity;

also, my self esteem has become very fucked up, particularly my self image (physical)

and also, i tend to get anxious over some shit i shouldnt even worry about. its like im almost always stressed

plus that, i feel like mentally weak, i dont even know how to explain it. but i feel weak.

now, i think it should be noted that im EXTREMELY isolated; which i think is the root to all of this. i mean, before i didn't have any of these thoughts for sure.

what can i do about it??",23Jul2020,2

432,"So I (22M) have been working at a small casino for about 20 days. There is only one person working per shift, so everyone is alone, we don't have a security guard. If anything happens, we're told to push the panic button, and a security team will be coming.
I sort of new what I was getting myself into before I started, the audience for this type of business is not very polite, let's say that.
I have been threatened like 2 or 3 times and had a few other issues but I managed to deal with them.
Yesterday night I had this guy coming in (the casino was empty), and I realized after a few seconds that he was deaf and unable to speak (first I thought he was high or something). He was trying to communicate with me but I don't know what he wanted, anyway I showed him he cannot enter without a mask. He was fine about it and fist bumped with me like 4 times. His friend comes in and gets him out (he didn't say anything to me). 
Fast forward to the morning, when the girl who takes the shift comes. I was waiting for her to check around so I could go home, and this guy comes again, with his ""friend"". He was wearing a mask this time but we tried to tell him we're not open yet. His friend who was speaking very little was not helping us with him at all. The ill guy was making indecent signs (showing that he would bang my coworker) behind her back. I didn't tell her, but I was trying to get this guy out. My co worker comes as well, trying to help but nothing. Then I tried to gently push this guy out, and he suddenly went very aggressive. His friend pushed him out and I came after, just for this guy to start to spit on me. Then he missed a punch in my face (he hit my glasses though) and I immediately reacted by trying to hit him back (he escaped). He got very, very mad at that point, acting like a gorilla and making weird noises. His friend tried to sort of hold him. In the meantime my co-worker pushed the panic button but the security wasn't coming, and I called police after, but they were slow as hell.
When security guy came (a pretty old guy), I was inside. When I went out to see what's happening, the security guy was leaving, not informing me of anything. I went to his car to ask him what happened and he told me they left (I saw them, they were walking very slowly away, always looking back). He told me that guy is known to do damage to private properties and causing problems in general, but the police does nothing about him. 
A few minutes later police comes (they were not hurrying at all, taking all their time). They asked what happened and nothing more. They said they were going to turn around to catch them from the front. I looked for them, but they actually left. They didn't go after him. 
Now I don't really know what I should do, the guy showed me in sign language that he will cut my legs (the only sign language I understood), and I'm not sure if he's going to come back for me one night.",23Jul2020,2

I could say he's absolutely the one after everything we've been through and all the sacrifices we've done for each other. So.. there's nothing wrong, right?

I feel like I can‚Äôt even enjoy anything or have any hobbies before I fuck it up. 

Things I love like making music, playing guitar, playing video games, watching movies, hanging out with my friends, drawing, and probably many more.

But things started going downhill when I started posting shipping art of JJBA characters, and I started getting hateful comments. They hurt a lot but there weren't that many of them. But from the sudden one of my publications went viral, it got retwitted more than 1000 times, it was some Giorno x Mista art, and I started getting called a paedophile because of drawing shipping art of them since in the manga and anime they're 15 and 18 respectively :/

I clarified that all my art and characters were +18 but I still got a shit ton of hate for ""aging up underage characters to draw shipping art of them"". It wasn't even porn, it was just some random shipping art :/

I know this is my fault mostly though because i have always lied to them about my state of being, but only after getting to know them. I‚Äôll be open about my self harm problems and suicide attempts but after a week or two start telling them i feel fine, when im not.

449,"So here's some context about what's happening..



This all started when me and my friends including him were playing minecraft. we were all vibing around when all of a sudden, the toxic dude (let's call him carson) hought of burning my other friends house.

So he asked my other friend if he willingly wanted to burn the house with him (let's call him martin) and so martin agreed to burn it down with carson.

After he burned down the house, my other friend (again, let's call him samuel) was really mad about what he did, and not about the fact that his house had just burned down. And while they were arguing, martin confessed to samuel that they burned the house down with carson, and all the while martin was feeling guilty, carson was arguing with my other friend not feeling guilty about what he did.



After this happened, he increasingly started becoming more toxic and always wanted to start a fight with us. All the while we were trying to find out why he was being more toxic to us.

Another notable thing is that whenever me and my friends chat in the group, he would **always** say ""ok"" ""mk"" and i honestly don't know why. 

Another thing to note is that he's mostly socially awkward and very shy in real life, but is always toxic to one person or another when we play with him online.

453,"I am about to begin my first year of college here in the United States, but the current political climate of the country is beginning to scare me. Im scared that this upcoming election is going to be very messy and that this country is well on its way to complete facism. I've recently become involved with this wonderful Danish man I met through tinder, and he is planning on moving back to Denmark as soon as possible. We have been talking at lengths about me going with him and starting a brand new life in his home country. Of course, its a huge life-changing decision to move across the world, when you know nothing about what the first step even is to doing so, but I am incredibly attracted to the idea. I visited my older brother, who lives in Germany, over New Years last year, and I completely fell in love with Europe and told myself that one day I would leave the US to live there. I just didnt know this kind of opportunity would come so quickly. 

So here's my question - would it be unwise for me to consider this? I dont know if im just being rash and I dont want to rush something like this. On the other hand, it feels as if the Universe is bringing to me what i have been longing for - a relatively easy way out of the US (easy meaning i wouldnt be alone in the immigration process). Its almost too good to be true.

I figured it would make the most sense to wait until i have completed at least one semester of college, depending on how quickly the US deteriorates in the next couple of months, and apply to a Danish university to continue my degree and obtain a student visa.

455,"I‚Äôm very socially extroverted. I have a lot of friends in school, quite popular. People might tell me that I‚Äôm a shitty friend for this but I don‚Äôt really think they‚Äôre friends, I make friends only just survive the highschool social hierarchy. I literally just have a good time, get good grades, flirt with men, then dip the fuck out.

The problem is there‚Äôs this thing I always do, every time the school year finishes I disappear into the social media void. I used to chat with friends everyday, take photos, usual social media shit. When I go into that ‚Äúvoid‚Äù I remove all my personal accounts from my phone (FB, IG, Twitter, Tiktok) Etc. then make completely new accounts that they don‚Äôt know, where I just lurk and fangirl over popular stuffs like anime and do art. Doing that was almost heaven for me since I don‚Äôt stress over social media, I genuinely just do what I want and no one judges me for liking those things.

Since they have no idea of my other accounts, they have no way to contact me. They call me through my number and I just wait till it stops ringing. I avoid them EVERYWHERE whenever I go into this void and turn into an introvert. I get absolutely NERVOUS when I open any messaging app on my personal accounts. (It doesn‚Äôt happen when it‚Äôs during school days.) only to end up ignoring those messages then logging off.

School is starting again and I think I dug myself deep because I took that extroverted persona too far when there was still school. I have so MANY ‚Äúfriends‚Äù than I usually do compared to other school years. I completely ignored them and I have no idea how to face them since I‚Äôm required to go online for school and possibly meeting them in real life after the pandemic ends. 

My question is in the title, I‚Äôve NO idea how to face them after this quarantine since I am required to talk to them! If I can‚Äôt think of any excuse, it‚Äôs just social suicide for me. 

I know I‚Äôm a piece of shit for ignoring them, I was a weird loser in elementary so when I learned that fake extrovert thing, I became popular and thought I found the cheat code in life and used it in highschool. I‚Äôm sorry. Thank you so much if you read through all of this.

My partner worked in the spare upstairs bedroom (the home office) and I set up on a small desk in the main living room. The living room is the centre of the house and you must go through it to access the kitchen or the garden and shed. 

Unfortunately my other half lost his job due to COVID but is thankfully waiting to start a new training role in a few months time. He is free to spend his time at home as he wants; I‚Äôm still working. When he lost his role I tentatively suggested I move into the home office so he could use the rest of the house at his leisure.

The living room is used for many other things and my partner is in and out all day. We had family over until late last night to play board games and today my work space is cluttered and chaotic.

I checked my wallet if there's still enough money which I can use when I join them. Sadly, the only money that left is the money that I save to buy something important. So I told them that I can't join them because of that. This one of her friend, 'M', we had an argument weeks ago and my relationship with him is not that great so I'd rather call him somebody than a friend. 'F' knows that 'M' and I are friends and he trusts 'M' more than me. The problem is, because of that fight and because 'M' is still mad at me, happened to react on my chat on the group chat. He told them that I told him that I don't even wanna hang out with them and that I just made an excuse to not join with them. I did not react to his chat but the others did and got angry at me. 

&amp;#x200B;

As I've told earlier, I read their whole chats. 'M' told them that he can't go with them because he has a job and far away from us. For some reasons, I feel like he's lying. I've never really trusted him. So I tried to know if its true. So we both play the same games and we're friends in the game but not playing together and I can see when did he play and on the other game, I can tell where he is because of the things that they send. But on the second game, he doesn't even send me gifts anymore but one of my friend lend me his account a long time ago but 'M' didn't know it so he still send gifts to my friend. Because of that, I discovered that he's lying. He still lives near our friend 'F'. Also, on the first game, he plays when he has to work. He told them what his work is. The work there will surely make you busy. He plays that game at 1, 2, 8=10 in the morning and 1, 2, 10 in the evening. So yeah. there's no way that he can play at those time whether your in the night shift or day shift. I also wait for another day and that same time again and on the second game, he send gifts that he can only obtain when he's near in his house.   


I know it's weird that I'm doing those thing. He may even call me stalker when he founds out what I did. I just really did that to prove that what I thought was right, that he's lying and is just like that one that he told them that I am like. It's not also the first time that he lies but I don't know if his friends know it. Should I told them that he's lying? Or should I just tell them that I can't really go with them and just ignore what he said?",23Jul2020,1
459,"It was new year's eve in 2018 and I had just been dumped by someone I was in love with. I wasn't in a good state of mind and got quite drunk at a friend's house. I was younger and didnt really know a lot about consent and choosing sexual acts. Things didn't go well, and I made out with one of the guys there, while everyone else was asleep. It was dark, silent and late at night. We were making out, when the guy went a little beyond what I was okay with doing sexually. I froze, didnt know what to do. Just waited for the thing to get over and woke up the next day with a bad hangover. Spoke to the guy casually and went on with life. The incident however took its toll on me a few days later, and then kept bothering me for months. I feel guilty and a bit helpless even today, especially now when I understand what consent and choice mean, for not having voiced myself out/ stopping the person from doing it. Now, I just want to put all of this behind me and continue towards a more positive future, but I just can't seem to get over the feeling. I dont know what I should do to get some kind of closure. I know one can never get over something like this, but what's the best way to put it behind/ bury it ? Need some real advice on this..",23Jul2020,1
460," Hi all,

I am participating in a debate where i have been assigned as a delegate for Sudan and the agenda for the debate is Euthanasia.

If you are not from Sudan, Can you please tell me your views on Euthanasia and assisted suicide

So i wanted your help, those who live in Sudan or anyone else, can you please tell me whats the attitude towards euthanasia in Sudan?. What is the governments stand towards it? and are people willing to make euthanasia legal in Sudan? Also if euthanasia is illegal in Sudan can you please tell me the reason for it?

If you are not from Sudan, Can you please tell me your views on Euthanasia and assisted suicide

Euthanasia means:- practice of intentionally ending a life to relieve pain and suffering.

I sincerely request you all to help me with this. It would mean a lot to me.

Thank you.",23Jul2020,1
461,"I am 21M and I've never had problems talking to girls before but all of a sudden I can't get my feelings out

I am absolutely floored by this girl I work with. She has a fantastic personality, she is 1 of 5 people in this world that can put a genuine smile on my face, if I'm having a crap day just seeing her makes things a little better, I'm always interested in the things she tells me about. My point is I'm pretty love sick, and I've already told her I like her on a serious level. So the full story to that is, we were closing the store and she counts down the money while I mop and take the trash to the back room, well I rushed through my work so I could talk to her and tell her ""I like you"" it took a lot to get that much out then her response was ""I'm I your favorite"" to which I replied ""no it's more of a serious I like you"" all I got was a simple ""that's sweet"" then we sat in awkward silence. After that we worked together a few days later back to back to back and I felt like I had created an awkward situation with her, but as I thought on it I came to the conclusion that maybe she also had some stuff going on and that's why she wasn't a acting normal (Still not sure though). However a few days ago we had a meeting with some corporate lady and after that she was nice enough to give me a ride home being as I'm limited to walking right now and it was 106¬∞F outside, anyway on the way to my house she was talking to me like we normally do. Now I think I've got another chance to convey my feelings for her and I'm not sure how to do it without seeming like a creeper, cause I was just gonna tell her all the things I wrote at the beginning of this paragraph, but now I feel like I should ask her what her opinions of me are as to avoid seeming like an idiot for pouring my heart out incase she doesn't have positive opinions of me. If I'm being real honest I just want a chance to show her I'm chivalrous and trustworthy but I'm apparently not much of a smooth talker anymore.",23Jul2020,1

465,"I'm (22F) currently entering the last year of my BBA in tourism management but I feel very unprepared and reluctant about working in the field. I'm very seriously thinking about going straight into a BSc in electrical engineering after this, entry isn't much of an issue and money is doable. Tbh I'm more excited about this idea than I ever was about tourism, but I was completely at a loss about what I wanted at the time and just wanted to move around and travel.

I've been having a very hard time in connecting with classmates and colleagues at my job in a hotel restaurant. We have no common interests and I always feel like I'm lagging when trying small talk. In addition to that, I find almost all past and current college classes  boring, and really I should have changed major, but I had no idea what I wanted and then some personal bullshit happened and I got 1yr of delay and just decided to finish the bachelor. At that time I had no space in my mind to think about anything but getting through the days and weeks, but now everything is a lot better. My ambitions are back and I feel dissatisfied with my current situation.

I'm able and very willing to work on getting my maths and physics skills back to previous levels and I've been learning to program for the past couple months.

If you are a professional in this or other scientific/technical fields, I have a (in addition to whether reschooling is worth it) question: how much room is there to be creative? I do digital (concept) art and am planning to get my programming skill up to a level where I can make artistic little games. I've accepted that expressing creativity might be a side job and hobby forever, but I'm curious how relevant it is in technical/scientific fields at University level jobs.",23Jul2020,1
466,"So I'm not sure how to start this, as I have been all over the place emotionally for a while now, so I'll just jump straight into it.

Warning: this got quite long and rambly. 

My cat has been missing for about a week. He was the first pet I got independently after graduating University, and I have had him for a little over a year. Needless to say I love him a lot.

I've always struggled with anxiety but upon starting uni and moving away from home it became apparent I also struggled with depression. I was in a very bad place during my first year of uni, and only told a close friend at the time due to him having a similar experience.

I eventually managed to pull through with the help of new friends, and graduated uni with decent grades. I was then living with 6 other friends after graduating, in a house share for 2 years. During this time I got my cat, Church.

During the last year or so I worked two  jobs that only affected my mental health for the worse, and I ended up quitting both on my boyfriend's advice after he said he couldn't watch me cry every morning and night anymore. I would throw up most mornings with the anxiety of going to work.

After I quit my last job, Covid hit, and I have not been able to find any other work as of yet. As my boyfriends job was also put on hold, we have been without income and this has caused a great deal of stress for me. I have noticeably been more affected by my depression and anxiety since then.

We came to the end of our lease, and struggled immensely to find a house to rent. In the end we were lucky enough for my boyfriend's uncle to rent his bungalow out to us at a very generous rate. For this I am so very thankful as we could have been left homeless essentially.

The house is lovely, but it is very far away from my friends, and I have no family in this city. I have struggled a lot since moving here with feelings of isolation. I cry a lot of the time, and have been really struggling to adjust to living just the two of us, despite how much I love my boyfriend. When it was all of us together, there was always someone around to talk to, or to distract from what I was feeling. 

We adopted another kitten, who is the daughter of my original cat, and each of our friends has one of the litter. My cat loves his daughter and they were instantly bonded and it made me so happy to see them playing and cuddling.

That was until about a week ago, when Church was let out at night, as per usual. He was out for 24 hours but this was not out of the ordinary so we didn't worry until the following night when he also didn't return home.

He has only once stayed out 24 hours and normally does no more than 8-10 outside on a night. He is also very shy and gets spooked easily and doesn't like people who aren't me or my boyfriend.

We haven't heard or seen anything of him since. I put food out every night, we have been on the streets every night calling his name. We have alerted local shelters and vets and have informed all of our neighbors. We have driven back to our old house but he hasn't shown up there either.

I feel broken. I miss him so much it physically hurts me, and I'm back in that place I was in my first year of university. I have no desire to get out of bed, and have been laying awake in bed until early to mid afternoon doing nothing.

I cry on and off throughout the days, and sob uncontrollably at night, to the point I feel nauseous. I know he is only a cat but he was my baby, and my first pet, and we only had the privilege of spending a year with him when I expected to see him through to old age.

People keeps telling me cats go missing for long periods of time and I shouldn't give up hope, but I can't help feeling deep down that he is dead.

My boyfriend is back at work now, and in the days I am alone, and my friends are not close by enough to just drop in as none of us drive. When I am not crying or watching out the window for him I feel numb. I try to do some household tasks but often end up putting more off than I end up doing.

The other day I was so hysterical that I slapped myself in the face, hard, multiple times because it was the only way I could stop enough to properly breathe.

I have spoken to my boyfriend about how I feel but he is also sad for our boy, and I do not want to worry him further when he is at work.

I've spoken quite openly with my friend who has a psychology degree and experience with depression, but now I am scared that I am messaging her too much, and I desperately don't want to push anyone away.


I love our new kitten (Maeve) a lot, but it doesn't help that she is a clone of her father, and I think about him every time I look at her.

My boyfriend is already talking about getting another cat to fill the hole Church left, and to have a cat for Maeve to play with. Its not that I don't want that for her, but I just still can't accept that he's gone. I'm a pessimist by nature and have already begun to believe we will never see him again, but at the same time I can't accept that.

My mum is getting worried, as she knows how I have been in the past, but I can't talk to her. There is nothing she can do so far away, and she also suffers with anxiety so it wouldn't be fair to put that on her.


I used to speak to a councillor, but this was organized through my last job, and I lost this when I quit. Since then with Covid I have not been able to speak to a doctor regarding my mental health, and in the past have not been taken seriously. The waiting list for therapy through the NHS is very long and uncertain, and I can in no way afford private therapy.

I feel like I am in a downward spiral just desperately trying to save face and not let on how badly I am coping. I miss my boy so much, and I don't know how to proceed. Everytime I think I am feeling better, something reminds me of Church and I break down completely. Last night, after quite a nice evening watching TV with my boyfriend, I went outside to call Church's name, as I have been doing every few hours and every morning and night. I didn't expect much, and he obviously wasn't there. I felt numb. I came back inside, I went to change for bed, I sat on the edge of the bed, and all of a sudden I was sobbing and I didn't stop for roughly an hour and a half. I know it upsets my boyfriend to see me like this and he does everything he can to comfort me, but he misses Church too, and my upset just upsets him more.

Not sure what advice can be given, I think I just wanted to talk about this with someone who doesn't know me, and isn't biased to try and spare my feelings. Any advice you do have would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you.",23Jul2020,1

468,"Recently I [18M] have not been mentally sound and I seem to be getting worse and worse as the days goes by. It sounds really selfish to say this but what can one do about the fear of being forgotten? 

About 2 years ago when I was still in High School a kid in my school unfortunately committed suicide. I did not know the kid personally, and at the time I didn‚Äôt care.... but that was until I noticed something.  After the week of sobbing, and the ‚Äúwe will never forget you!!‚Äù statements etc.... everyone just stopped talking about him. What happened to never forgetting? Some kids literally joked around going ‚Äúwho?‚Äù when the Principle said his name during an assembly, some kids using his death as an excuse to do stuff against school rules (like vaping in the bathrooms). Those thoughts have crept on me since then. 

What is my legacy on this earth? Why am I who I am? Will I too be forgotten? It‚Äôs a thought that has been haunting me for a whole 2 years and nothing... NOTHING has worked. 

I went to the school councillor (wonderful lady, she helped me with so much) and she said ‚Äúit‚Äôs normal, eventually it will pass by‚Äù and it never did. I went to a psychiatrist, and she said ‚Äúit‚Äôs normal during the grieving process‚Äù but I was never grieving in the first place. I feel people are not understanding what is actually in my head no matter how well I try to explain it. Not even my parents can help me when I said what was on my mind. They were the ones who took me to the psychiatrist trying to be supportive of me)

I am not scared of death, it is something that is natural and I cannot prevent it. But what can I do to fight this? Why out of all people am I the one feeling the fear of being forgotten and no one else? I have tons of friends, tons of support, and no matter how much I try to think of my ‚Äúloved ones‚Äù I always feel like it‚Äôs never enough. I feel like the only satisfaction is for me to be in a history book.

Suddenly a road rager was behind me aggressively honking, yelling, flicking me off, and telling me to pull over.  Apparently I had cut him off which I wasn't aware of. He started tailing behind me and I slowed down as I had no idea what was going on and a bit shocked. He then cut out the lane sharply , cut me off, and slammed his brakes and I almost rear ended him. He came out of his car aggressively walking towards me. I stepped out of the car, not a smart move but my wife and newborn was also in the car, and I thought I could lure him away from my family and calm him down. He kept walking into my personal space while I kept stepping back trying to talk him down. He shoved me once, then gave me a right hook to the face, and then shoved me again. I didn't retaliate as my wife was screaming to leave it alone, my newborn was excessively crying, I didn't receive any major injuries, and I didn't want the situation to escalate anymore. The guy eventually went back in his car and drove off. I have this all on my dash cam with his license plate recorded.

ive never really been book smart. i dont know the multiples of 12 or 13 but i can say that i have a lot of common sense, or at least i would like to think. i also tend to overthink and question morals, existence and purpose every day.

i can not recall a day where i haven‚Äôt thought about death. not specifically suicide (although sometimes it is), but just how valuable my time is on earth and how after everyday i am 24 hours closer to my funeral. i do not think i am mentally sound. i have literally told zero people this or anything even close. i went to therapy last year for problems with biting my fingers and we naturally talked about relating subjects, like what could be causing a now 18 year old to still be biting his fingers to oblivion. i never really answered the questions in 100% fully or honesty, just because i wasn‚Äôt yet comfortable with telling anyone about my thoughts.

since then i found out that my dad stopped paying for therapy, and was making my mom pay for the entirety of it. my dad is quite wealthy and my mom isnt poor by any measure, but she is limited on what she can spend. also, the company my mom works for is being bought out so she might lose her job. making her pay is not a moral option at the moment in my eyes. i have also talked to my dad as in why he stopped paying for it, and he told me that my mom never told him why i was going to therapy or why i was put on medication for a short period of time. my honest thoughts are that both of my parents did something wrong.

my dad is now married to my stepmom. she already had a son but they now have had another one. my dad has said hes proud of me, but i dont think he actually is, and is just saying as ive done pretty much nothing proud worthy. his new son feels like a do over to me, as he thinks im addicted to video games and would probably want a son who can watch football with him.

A few days ago i was feeling kinda shitty and tried to talk to her about it and she just kinda said that she was busy. After that she was sad because of stuff thats going on in her life and so we ended up on call for the rest of the night and even played some video games together, she said sorry about not talking about what happened to me and said she really cares about me. 


Fast foward and she was super worried and stressed and even crying because she  had a friend who was under some heat that basically needed a lawyer and lawyer advice, so i got in touch with a lawyer, after like 2 days, i asked her about her friend and she didnt  seem to care about it and didnt even take his number, also tells me she doesnt want to talk about what happened to her friend.

This week i asked her again to come over and she said for me to stop pressuring her and said her life at home has been shitty (yet she seems happy and goes out with her friends pretty much everyday), i also asked her if she wanted to go to the beach with she said its complicated.

As far for who‚Äôs officially on the lease, me, her and my dad - roommate is only listed as a occupant. Me and the roommate got into a bad argument. Started on text, ended in person- peacefully. I was out driving when it started. When I was on the way home the roommate got in my fianc√©‚Äôs face and yelled at her. She left before I got home because she didn‚Äôt felt safe.

She was able to get her godmother to buy the plane ticket. She is looking to claim ‚Äúdomestic violence‚Äù to break the lease.

She is also gonna try to use the garage (which is a separate lease all together, only me is on it.) to store her belongings until she can come back and get it. 

She proven intent that she‚Äôs not going to fulfill her obligations to pay the rest of the lease. I contacted the management, and they just said they don‚Äôt care what happened, they won‚Äôt get involved, they want it paid on time in full. 

How do I go about the rent situation? Take her to small claims court now? Or wait until she doesn‚Äôt pay? She usually pays me weekly via online payment app and I pay lump sum. 

I don‚Äôt mind letting her use the garage to store stuff, but I am not gonna do it for free anymore. Can I write up a contract making her agree to pay me X amount a month (or week) for a storage fee? And if she defaults, she forfeits the belongings? Or just say you have until X day (60 days from now) to grab your belongings until they become into my possession?

One last thing, if she has no intentions on staying, can I legally change the locks? I don‚Äôt trust her to not steal anything that‚Äôs not hers. My friend said it‚Äôs legal, but it seems far fetch considering she is on the lease. 

Thank you in advance.",23Jul2020,1

493,"Hi there! So, I have pretty severe bipolar disorder. Anyone who views my post history will see how serious it is. I manage it with therapy and medication. I took a leave of absence from my job last year and once it ran out I became unemployed. 

In less than a month I will be moving across the country with my parents. 

I am looking into a daily, 6 week procedure called TMS once I get there. About a half hour per day. Essentially it's magnet therapy. If I can get my insurance to cover it, I may be able to experience a period of minimal depression symptoms. This is important to me. However it could be difficult to fit this into a workday. 

Equally important is moving out of my parents' house and getting a job. Unemployment runs out for me in September assuming my state passes an extension, and I have a fair amount of money saved. I found a job online that looks perfect. Low stress, in my field, in the new state. I'm thinking of applying, but I don't know if I should just coast by on unemployment while I undergo treatment instead. I dont know when else in my life I'll have this kind of time.

498,"Hey, keen to know everyone's thoughts on this. My sister went travelling in the US with her partner over a year ago now. She came back to the UK about 2 months ago and still lives quite far away from me. We were just arranging a visit with each other on the phone there - she wants me to come to hers, which is about a 4 hour journey for me. Thing is, she lives with her partner, who is lovely - it's just that my sister and I haven't spent any one on one time together in a while. Because it's been over a year I thought I'd ask if her partner could maybe stay with friends or family while I visit. 

She went completely cold on the phone and started talking about how it's the pandemic and that's too difficult. 

As I say, I don't have a problem with her partner - it just changes the dynamic when he's around. Plus they have been together every day for over a year now. I don't know - I have my own place too so she could come and visit me without anyone interrupting. Am I being selfish? 

It's fine she is concerned with the pandemic but I know for a fact that they have been seeing their friends during all of this for parties so not sure why it's such a big ask that he stays over at one of their houses for a night. Plus I'll be visiting so...

I did it to be able to secure a good paying job in the IT industry.

502,"Just to provide some info about me, I'm a 17 year old guy from Spain and I can speak fluent english and a tad bit of french.

As a warning, I don't know how long this will get but I feel like I need to provide as many information as possible.


I have never been a really social person. In real life I have a very small amount of friends, most of which are from when I started high school and I was lucky enough to meet a bunch of people to hang around, but up until then I had 1 or 2 close friends from primary school.

As the years went by, I became more and more interested in meeting new people because I was feeling lonely and I reached my peak during quarantine, so I started posting on this platform in look for online friends. Before this, I had already met around a dozen of people playing online games and 5 or 6 people from Insta who I was introduced to by my irl close friends. 

The problem with all these relationships is that they all were lost over time. My videogame friends moved on and started ghosting me for no particular reason until I was left all alone playing what used to be my favorite game, now it's a dead game to me and I can't seem to enjoy it thanks to them missing. I didn't try to reach back to them because I didn't want to be clingy and perhaps they just didn't want to talk about it. But I've felt serious heartbreak many times after some of my pals left. 

The people I met on Instagram lost interest despite my efforts to keep the conversation fresh and simple and they stopped talking to me over night, and I felt like I always did something wrong.

The other redditors I met showed no interest in a long term friendship and forgot about me the next day, even after hours of chatting and them saying they enjoyed meeting me. I am currently trying to meet new people but I'm starting to lose hope by the minute, as I'm starting to see no one might like me and that's it.

The case that's the most tragic to me is a girl my age that I met on the videogame I mentioned before, we started to chat on Instagram and she said I was so sweet and she was lucky to have found me. I even know her circle of friends and we've played together on a couple of occasionss. I had good hopes about my friendship with her and I believe I found a treasure of a person. But then she started to get more distant and I felt like she didn't want to talk. Now she will never start a conversation, she answers in a dry way and I feel miserable about the whole panorama. I'm honestly so confused about her behaviour and I don't want to leave her this way.

Im starting to think it might be me who they're getting away from, and it's not because of their personal reasons. It can't be their problem if I've already met over 40 people on the internet and no one seems to stick around. I've lost all hope and a ""there's plenty of other people around"" won't help the situation, it just makes me more anxious to meet people because they'll always leave, with no exception.

I can't see what's wrong with this problem, I'm always caring, friendly, not too clingy and not too frequent with the texts and always offer my support. But no one seems to like the way I am. I'm very stressed at the moment and I feel like I'm not enough for anyone.

Some advice on keeping relationships would be highly appreciated, but at this point I've heard it all, and no cliche ""just keep on trying!"" will help me.

**My Life &amp; Situation**

I'm a 19 year old girl who has always been homeschooled. Though I've been homeschooled, I only have a 7th grade education because my mom has had it hard being a single mother with an abusive and threatening father hanging over her and I in our lives. I haven't had any friends or relationships in real life yet. I take care of my mom every day who can't walk on her own due to a leg injury, and I also stay inside as much as possible because her immune system is very low and she could easily get the virus. Since I stay inside, I can't meet people IRL and try to make friendships and relationships. I also have tooth problems because my mom and I never had enough money to get them fixed. I have missing and bad teeth and they look very ugly and I'm too embarrassed to smile and talk to people in real life or in video calls.

Ever since I was 5 and watched a couple on TV or in a movie I always dreamed of being with my soul mate. It's always been my biggest dream and drive in life. I've had some internet relationships but they never worked out. Lately I've been very lonely and whenever I watch a movie or show with a couple in it I yearn to be with someone even more and I feel restless. I really want to find my soul mate but I have a hard time finding people with similar beliefs and interests who I click with. I prefer older music, movies and comedy and Christian beliefs while most people my age listen to mainstream pop music and rap. I don't want to join a dating site because I feel like most people are just looking to hook up and I want a real relationship. I don't know where to find people who have my same beliefs and interests over the internet near my area and if I did, am I good enough for them? I have no education and my teeth are messed up. Plus I'm very shy and awful at conversation.

I know you guys will probably say you don't need a boyfriend and I agree! I know I'm alright without one for now but I'm still very sad and would love to have one and want to find him.

507,"Okay so basically it was me, my roommate, and his girlfriend all living together at one point. During that time, things were horrible. I‚Äôm not gonna get into to much detail because it‚Äôs just so much, but she‚Äôs literally..and I mean literally, the most toxic individual I have EVER met in my entire life. 

If you‚Äôre curious as to what type of female she is, lemme just give you a quick summary. Loud ghetto white hoe. She scams people online for money. Has multiple boyfriends that she juggles around. She neglects and mis treats her 2 year old daughter.

Whenever a guy doesn‚Äôt do what she wants (such as buying her something she wants) she will literally hurt herself and threaten to call the police and get the guy locked up for domestic violence. She‚Äôs a drug addict, a major alcoholic, just overall a bad person. I can go on forever but let me get to the point. 

Back in April, after a huge fight..she finally moved out. It‚Äôs just me and my roommate now. We all went on to our separate ways and we were both relieved she was gone. Shorty after, my roommate got another girlfriend. That lasted a few months and they just broke up about two weeks ago. 

The beginning of this week, I heard my roommate and his ex talking on the phone. Which surprised me knowing how dirty she did him, and me. Fast forward to now, he has her over here for the weekend. 

I told him before she ever planned on coming, I do not want her over here. It‚Äôs undoubtedly gonna be an L for him, and probably for me too. I tried talking to him about re-connecting with her and how it‚Äôs a very very bad idea, but he doesn‚Äôt listen. 

He completely ignored my request by not wanting her here, and now she‚Äôs here. I can literally feel the negative energy she brings into the place. She wants to move back in too, and knowing him.. he‚Äôs probably gonna allow it. What do I do? I shouldn‚Äôt have to feel uncomfortable in an apartment I help pay bills for",23Jul2020,3
508,"Long one, sorry! Little back story, we became friends from work and were really good friends for about 4 years. Along with another co-worker (A from now on), and my BFF (J from now on) and (J) friend from uni (B from now on).  This might get confusing but I‚Äôll do my best. 

So basically this all went down when I had night out with (J) and a few of my new friends. Immediately she was stand offish towards them and rude to me most the night. She also ended by leaving without telling me and sending a text that said ‚ÄúI left. Have a good one.‚Äù So obviously I was like okay she‚Äôs mad, I‚Äôll give her some space. In the mean time (J) asked (A) to get information from me about that night, cause I know (A) and she literally never asked things like that. So I thought that was fucked up. We went a few weeks without talking and I slowly notice she had delete all our photos together, delete me off Snapchat and clearly muted me on Instagram (all shit a girl would do lol) so that made me pretty upset. A couple more days go by and must go home because my grandfather is sick in the hospital. While I‚Äôm there I receive a text from her basically stated that I‚Äôm a shit friend for having other friends and not giving her 100% of my attention. I then explain to (J) it‚Äôs a bad time, and she responds with ‚Äúoh that sucks, I hate when ppl get sick‚Äù and continues pressing me for an apology (which I gave her!! Multiple) and keep in mind this is ridiculous because we are adults and she‚Äôs treating me like we are in the 8th grade. (J) ends the text convo with ‚ÄúI need to think about this‚Äù... just mind blowing she can turn nothing into this huge deal. But she got exactly what she wanted, all the power. 

A weeks goes by and I loss my grandfather. (J) (A) and (B) did not contact me. They all decided this fight created from thin air was more important. So obviously I‚Äôm extremely upset with all them. I reach out to (J) to just make this go away, so I apologize for anything she brought up.. but as this conversation went on, she kept finding things for me to apologize for?? Honestly i was like ‚Äúdo you even like me? Cause it doesn‚Äôt seem like it‚Äù. And I absolutely promise all these things were fucking ridiculous reasons to apologize for. I‚Äôm a genuine person, I know when I did something wrong and I‚Äôll always do my best to fix it. But all this shit was BS. 

So after this conversation I realize the friendship has become toxic, all she does is look for reasons to be mad at me. I‚Äôd be walking on eggshells around her. That‚Äôs not a good friendship, so I decided I‚Äôd stop contacting (J) and (A). (A) because she was clearly spineless and was (J) little helper and didn‚Äôt reach out when my grandfather passed, she only pressed me for information and when I didn‚Äôt give it, she wouldn‚Äôt even bother answering my last text. 

Now remember (B) the uni friend. So I was unaware, but (B) has been fighting with me for months lol without telling me. Her reason.. I didn‚Äôt hangout with her enough. Keep in mind we are all adults and have lives and if I‚Äôm being honest I actually had to go very out of my way to see her since she lived far away from me, which I did fairly often, and that was never once reciprocated. So anyways, it all came down to me just blocking them all off everything. I waited till they unfollowed and deleted our photos together so I knew they weren‚Äôt interested in reaching out to me. (A) and (B) didn‚Äôt talk to me this whole time. Once (J) decided she was mad at me, they all were, so I knew I couldn‚Äôt trust them anymore to not be biased. But I feel like absolute shit all the time and I don‚Äôt know if I made the right decision. Cause now I have no close friends.

509,"Hello,

I'm sorry if this problem seems trivial compared to everyone else's with the current situation, I don't want to undermine or minimize anyone else's feelings and concerns.

I'm the youngest of 4 children in my family, and one of my brothers has had a strenuous relationship with my since I was born. When I was a little kid and he was a teenager, he would often pretend I didn't exist if I frustrated him for trivial things, for periods of months to a year. 

I've been dealing with a lot of mental health and stress-related issues, and my sleep schedule has been ruined because I'm staying up to be constantly available for a friend of mine who lives in a different time zone. The reason being that this friend's brother committed suicide, and I am prioritizing being there for them as much as I can. 

Last night it was my brother's birthday, and I was asleep while they were doing the celebration, and someone came to my bedroom to wake me up and get me. I, wanting to get as much sleep as I could due to how I was feeling, made a selfish choice and said no and went back to sleep. I woke up a few hours later and realized what I had done, and I tried to talk to him when he came downstairs but he looked at me and didn't reply then left to his bedroom.

It's not like I didn't want him to enjoy his birthday. I was out with our mom 2 days ago, and she asked me what cake I would be okay with eating for his birthday (as I am very picky). I told her that it is his birthday, and it does not matter what anyone else in the family would enjoy, and I told her to bring my brother's favourite type of cake, strawberry cheesecake (which I strongly dislike). I wanted him to have a good time.

He hasn't stopped speaking to me for a long time now since we are both adults (I am 19 and he is in his late 20s) and I am worried that this will result in hurting our relationship severely.

I'm afraid to go into his room and speak to him, as he tends to react strongly by yelling and I don't want to make him angrier than he already may be. But at the same time, I want to apologize. Thirdly, I'm not exactly sure how to apologize and express to him that I wanted him to have a good birthday without sounding like I'm making excuses. I don't want to unload all of my personal issues and my friend's situation either, because my family has reacted very poorly to my desire to seek professional help in the past.

I don't want to be a bad person and I don't want to be a bad brother.

Anyone have any suggestions on what I should do?",23Jul2020,1
510,"Women at my work have started taking jabs at me saying I am a woman.  I started out just ignoring it I am fairly shy guy and just thought it was a silly thing that would pass because wearing the face mask my face does have a feminine cast but I have deep male voice and facial hair so didn't think they were serious.

last night my direct supervisor said directly to me ""I am not angry you're wearing mens clothes, but I am really angry you aren't admitting it."" and her cold attitude toward me makes it hard to work with her since this started.  I am pretty sure she is the one that started this whole thing.

No guys have said anything to me about it other than one dude said ""someone said you were a transsexual but with your voice and the way you walk I didn't believe it.""

Oddly, I worked there for several months before the pandemic started and other than some light ribbing, and a 'no offence' or 'sorry' before saying something bad about white people.(I am the only white person working there.)  I had no issues.

I don't want to get people in trouble, or myself fired I actually like the people I work with despite this but I would like it to stop.  I mostly have just responded 'cmon guy, I am a man' or 'I am a dude' or 'I am not a woman' or just ignoring it.  

Is there a different approach I can take to stop this?

511,"He recently started VR chat on the Oculus and he has completely stopped doing anything around the house. Today will be the 5th consecutive day hes done it. He goes on from 4pm to usually 1am, and I keep telling him hes getting addicted and that while the computer is high end, playing VR for that long is putting ""strain"" on it, and that I need it for college.

He did this while my mom was alive, before the Computer and VR, but it wasn't like this, because my mom kept him in check, but now that shes gone, its exaggerated.

My sister says he doesn't have boundaries, what-so-ever, i.e., with his new friends, only on the 2nd day he knew them, was doing all kinds of erotica and role playing,which is a whole other problem, because he didn't know any of their ages or if any of them are pedo's, and when I brought it up he got so mad, and told all of them, which lead to him taking off his headphones and having them try and start with me. While I was asleep, on the 2nd night, he thought it would be okay/funny to show them who I was, which I was NOT okay with. That crossed a line for me. I don't know how to handle this, and hes starting to slowly not listen to me.

518,"My previous posts explain more. Basically, about three days after my wisdom teeth surgery (my surgery wats on July 13th) I developed a brutal canker sore infection that effects my mouth and throat area. I went to the ER on the 21st where they stuck a camera down my throat. The doctor even said himself this is the worst canker sore case he has ever seen in his career. He counted around 20 from the roof of my mouth, the entire uvula, and all the way down my throat. The best he could offer were pain meds. 

I‚Äôve been taking pain meds for a week and I‚Äôve felt nor seen any type of improvement. I‚Äôve tried everything you can think of. Tylenol, ibuprofen, milk of magnesia, benzocaine, magic mouth wash, valacyclovir, gargling, and nothing works. Yes, they do provide numbing pain for five or ten minutes, but that‚Äôs simply not enough time for me to eat, drink, sleep, or basically live my life. 

I haven‚Äôt had an actual meal for a week (I‚Äôve only been eating little bits of food maybe once or twice a day), I haven‚Äôt been able to drink lots of water in over a week, I haven‚Äôt been able to have a good night‚Äôs sleep for over a week (By the time I feel sleepy, the pain meds ware off and the pain startles me up. Sometimes, I manage to fall asleep only to wake up at 3 in the morning because the pain is so bad), and I haven‚Äôt felt pain free for over a week. I haven‚Äôt felt this week, miserable, or hopeless at all in my life. 

I‚Äôm loosing hope by each passing day. They said it gets better, but it seems there‚Äôs either no change or it gets worse every single day. I‚Äôm DESPERATE for anything at this point. I hope somebody out there knows something. I regret getting my wisdom teeth removed every single day I wake up. It‚Äôs the first thing I say when I wake up and it‚Äôs the last thing I say before I go to bed. I would MUCH RATHER take misaligned teeth over this any day of the week. Because I can actually eat, sleep, drink, and live PAIN FREE.",23Jul2020,1
519,"Hello everyone. I'm a boy of 17.  And I've been having problems trusting myself, or rather, my specific skill set. Around a year ago, I was expected to submit something unique, which I made myself, for my school's upcoming Science Fair(people viewed me as one of the most promising members of the Tech club). My girlfriend suffers from dyslexia. She had(and still has) problems perceiving relative depth and height of her surrounding objects. So, I made her circuit integrated glass frames(not delving into further details), which at least helped to ease her  viewing and sensing, and definitely help troubleshoot the problems she had walking. A few glitches and bugs were rectified with a little help from my club mates, and the rudimentary project was a success.

Now to the present. She was really very happy with the frame. And I was happy that she didn't have to depend on others(mostly), for walking, handling things, getting handed things, and a few other basic human activities. That is, until four months ago.

On 9th Feb. she was rushed to the nearest hospital for treatment. The frame had worked properly for close to a year. I had even tweaked it a bit from time to time to make it work better, and ensure her comfort. But, 9th Feb., afternoon, the chips in the frame short circuited. Her eyebrows were signed, and the skin of her forehead lightly burnt. Luckily, and I mean that, her eyes weren't damaged.

I couldn't look at her face after that. She is rather fragile, and knowing that the cause of what happened to her was something I made, and the fact that she trusted me enough, as far as going to be the ""guinea pig"" of our experiment, made me feel worse. She has always been the cheerful of the two of us. Even when she was wincing with pain, she jokingly told me, and I quote, ""Don't worry, it will get better. I won't remain this ugly for long. Till then, and even after that, don't you dare think about any other girl.""

We have talked about it. She has told me that she holds no grudge against me, and that she, in no way, holds me responsible for what happened. But since then, I have not been able to find motivation for any new ""project"" of mine. I have been really very sad of what she had to go through because of me. I have not let that affect our relationship, or my grades, but the guilt always seems to weigh me down. We have been together since we were 14. She has always been there when I needed her emotional support, and that she decided to put up with me even after everything that transpired, saying that she would never let anything, no matter how many ""accidents"", drive a wedge between us. This only makes me feel more pathetic, and makes me wonder whether I do deserve her love. I have been to therapists(although one would think that after everything that happened, she would need one). Her parents are cool with me. She is ever loving and sweet to me. However, I just can't seem to put this in my past and move on. 

So, I finally came here. Any advice would do good, because I'm desperate.",23Jul2020,1

521,"I'm 28 years old this month.
When I was 21, I wanted to study computer science but I was a few points less than the University's admission threshold. So I started studying industrial engineering reluctantly after being pressured by my parents. That didn't go well because it just didn't interest me. So I stopped studying after 2 semesters and went to improve my SAT grade. A year and a half later, I managed to improve it enough to get into the computer science degree that I wanted. When I went to sign up, I was told by the professor that's in charge of admission that according to the University's rules, if I drop out, I have to wait 2 years outside. Ok, only half a year to wait. So I did. After this half year, I went to the University again, but, they increased the admission threshold so that I couldn't sign there anymore. It felt the same as a heart break. But this time I chose to study electronics engineering instead because it was close to computer science. But still, when I started studying I felt bad, not concentrated because the electrical engineering degree was 5 years to graduate as opposed to 3 years in computer science. I failed many exams until I dropped out again. Heart broken yet again. My mind was so messed up that I went to the University yet again, but this time to study externally(pay them per course, study as external student but not as an undergraduate), so that if I pass a few courses with high enough grades, I would be able to admit back to the degree. (It also cost a fortune to do that). So I paid this high amount of money, and I knew that I won't be able to study. I was too messed up and heart broken. After 1 week of going there I simply went home and never came back. Instead I started working in a 6 days a week job, for a little bit over minimum wage, with no time for myself. I guess it's better in a way because it doesn't let the bad and sad thoughts take over. But I'm living with my parents, I don't even think about relationship because.. I'm a failure and basically have no idea where to continue from here. 

What would you advice me? 
Thanks",23Jul2020,1
522,"So I quit Reddit 6 weeks ago, but here I am again. This requires a back-story.

In early April, I \[23F\] purchased a vintage silk ensemble from a little struggling shop owner from Etsy, which we shall call Vicky. I really liked the set but decided to indulge in it primarily to help a struggling business owner. We lived in two nearby, but different, countries. Long story short, about 6 weeks later I still had no update about where my package was, and after she finally got hold of her local postal office, they found out that they send it to the wrong country and that the package would be returned to her ASAP. Upon hearing this, she canceled my sale and issued me a refund immediately, and let me know that she would let me know once the ensemble is back in her possession, so I can buy it again for the same price (so I would pay for shipping twice). I let her know that might the package still be delivered to me, I would, of course, pay her due amount. This was all in late May.  The package ended up still being delivered to me, with a delay of two months. I send her a message immediately, telling her it arrived and to send me her info, so I can pay her what is due. I got an automatic reply stating that she will be gone until the 20th of August due to personal reasons. I will likely be helping a friend move in a foreign country then, and I might not have the necessary infrastructure to complete the payment around that time (e.g. my computer, a safe WiFi network, etc.). As I don't like to let people wait for money I owe them, and she might be in dire need of money atm (depending on what ""personal reasons"" implies), I decided to try my luck and see if I could contact her through social media, as I owed her 130EUR (about $150). I saw that her professional IG and FB account hadn't been in use for a while now since mid-June, so figured I might as well try her private FB, as it was linked to her professional one. 

There, it was stated that she was married to a man, let's call him Joe. Joe shares the same last name as an acquaintance of mine. The name is not that common, so my curiosity took the best of me and I went to check whether they were perhaps related (as far as I know, they are not). To my nasty surprise, an older man which we shall call Patrick shared a lot of racist posts on Joe's timeline. An example of which would be pictured with text such as ""Arabs, Black and Muslims have no lessons to give us!"". Joe ignored them for the most part, neither commenting nor liking to any of it, apart from one, a more ""lighthearted"", albeit imo still very much racist, post which features a picture of an African man using a toilet seat to eat with the comment ""when you send things back to the village without proper explanation"". Now, I am black myself, and find such posts very hurtful. I checked the policy of the shop, and she does not accept returns. I looked at Patrick's profile, and he seems quite close with Joe. Patrick even created a fundraiser to help them back in March as well as a few pictures of him with Joe. This leads me to believe that they are quite close to Patrick, but also very much struggling financially. I do know that the country they live in isn't helping struggling businesses.

Before purchasing from any business, I always like to quickly scan through their linked social media, see what's on there, make sure I don't support bigots. Vicky is also a tattoo artist (American traditional) and some of her art and prints do depict black and brown women. Additionally, she followed an account I followed, which was this artist very vocal about racial justice and diversity, so at the time I purchased the item, I figured that Vicky was somebody I wanted to buy from. Now, I'm not so sure. Obviously, I don't want to give my (black) money to a racist business. I thought about just sending the ensemble back at my own cost, but have no guarantee that I might not still have to pay for the ensemble, as I agreed upon initially (especially if the package gets lost again), as she has a ""no return policy"". Secondly, my allegations that she might be a racist is based on ""association by association"" if you wish, since her husband seems to be the one primarily associated with this man. Also, I know nothing about them, so can I really make such a claim? I don't want to penalize somebody that is obviously struggling currently, based on the claim that they are ""associated with somebody that is associated with a racist"".  I know from many of my white friends that they tend to tolerate older racist family members because they feel like, at their age, it's a lost cause. Thirdly, she obviously has my address, and if they were to be racists, I have to be very careful in how I handle this. As of now, in light of everything that has happened, I'm very emotionally drained of having arguments about racial injustice with people. I'm thinking of just waiting until she contacts me for payment, and simply pay it while sending her the following message:

""While trying to contact you to pay you the money owed ASAP, I saw that your husband had some racially insensitive and hurtful things on his FB timeline. He has the same name as I friend of mine and wanted to know if they were relating in some way. I do realize that you are not responsible for your partner's Facebook timeline, and what other posts on it, but please consider that these posts can be hurtful for your clients, such as myself"".

Also I need to say I have a hard time with grammer and wording things. I am not very smart with grammer and how to properly type sentences so please pardon my very crappy grammer and I understand you stop reading bc of how trash it is to understand.


I've been hiding these feelings to myself for a long time now. I haven't told a single person bc im ashamed of it and I don't wanna sound bad. But I don't know what it is making me feel like this and honestly I wish I didn't have too feel like this but everytime I get a job, the following days after if I don't mentally prepare myself by sitting down and thinking about: A. B. C. D. or E.  I will be inches away from a mental breakdown day of job start. Even if I do that I have so much anxiety I can not stop myself from crying 

I get so overwhelmed. I think about how everyday Im gonna have to go in to a place filled with people I don't know and do a job and do it a certain way everyday to a certain level I wont get fired for working at, How Im gonna have to do it for hours and hours on no end in large amounts of physical pain except for a couple shitty breaks. Up until I go home and spend the next day trying to enjoy the few hours of freedom I have left in whatever way that is on loop everyday and most the time its me prepping hours before work bc I need to be prepared and solid so I can be out the door quickly.

Its me folding my work clothes for that day into a pile on my bed from what item im gonna put on first to the very last item and doing it multiple times until they are folded exactly how I want and even if takes me an hour they will be folded perfect or I don't leave until they are, getting the makeup out im gonna wear setting it beside my mirror, getting the brushes I use exactly then its me getting my shoes placed a perfect way or again not leaving until they are how I want them. Then its me trying to squeeze the next few hours for whatever juice of joy I can.

Which is nothing because I've done everything I need to do for that day including feeding and walking my dog, so I sit in the living room and scroll on social media with no fancy things happening. 

Honestly, I do not want a job right now this is why I've gone this long without picking up another its been two weeks sense quitting my last one, I've been milking my freedom dry. However I do know I want to focus on getting my GED as I only did two-years of highschool before leaving (that's another story on its own) after that im not sure.

I don't want a job, but there's physically no way for us to live without at least two people providing income. We cant afford the apartment on my grandmother's retirement fund she gets at  the first of every month and my mom's job alone and they are about to close down because of all the covid cases they are getting until its properly cleaned top to bottom but at this point, I don't think I care if they struggle. 

Sounds so awful and it is awful. So awful.

 But why, why the fuck should I be so stressed like this? Im not ready for this, no one fucking showed me let alone tried to show me how to be prepared or prepared me. But there's apart of me who doesn't wanna sit around and not do anything all day but I cant work a job rn. My ability to function properly as a human and work at the same time isn't possible right now but my father and brother said I was just gonna be like my aunt who sits around and does nothing all day and be nothing in life and I don't wanna let them be right. But how do I continue to kill myself mentally everyday and still function? I don't know what to do. I've never in my life been so stressed, so overwhelmed and so worried to be perfect bc I don't want my father and brother to see me struggling.


How do I not work, try to focus on me while providing no income to help and letting my father and brother's words be right?
I haven't told my grandmother or my mom how I feel because I know what both will say. They will tell me they understand, but there's no way for me to do that, this is the real world and I need to suck it up and work bc they need my income too.

I know, I know this this is the real world and it requires struggle, it requires tears and it requires lots of pain for it to be the real world. 

But im not sure how much longer this colliding with family drama will take before I collapse and breakdown. Bc I've managed to stop myself everytime I've almost had one but I don't think I can this time. I don't wanna snap. 

What do I do? Im lost, im scared to lose my apartment bc we cant afford it anymore due to me not proving income too,   Im scared we wont be able to survive bc we little to no money.",23Jul2020,1

538,"Hi folks. My partner and I have been living in our apartment for just under a year now. The apartment we have is two floors, and the one below us is small studio. There are always people moving in and out of that unit, and we‚Äôve never really had any issues with noise or anything, until recently. 

About 4 weeks ago, a younger couple and their dog (a mastiff or something close to it, I think) moved in. Admittedly, we‚Äôre not dog people in the slightest; we don‚Äôt dislike dogs at all and generally like them, they‚Äôre just not for us. We‚Äôre also not the type to complain about noise because we‚Äôre late-20s/early-30s, and very laid back, easy going people. 

For about a week or so, the dog has kept us up at night because it barks constantly. Most nights we are eventually able to go to sleep after a few hours, but last night was the worst it‚Äôs been yet. We both have day jobs, so we typically go to bed between 9:30-10:30. So, we go upstairs, get comfortable, and the dog starts barking. We hear our neighbors leave on their motorcycle, and the dog gets even louder. It seemed like it was echoing through our building‚Äôs hallway and our first floor, so even with a floor between us we can hear it plain as day. 

It‚Äôs now about 8:30 the next morning, and the dog is still barking and its people aren‚Äôt home. 

My partner didn‚Äôt get any sleep at all, and I only got a few hours. We don‚Äôt want to be rude and we understand that dogs can‚Äôt really control it (as far as we know, anyways), but we want to at least bring it to their attention (and hopefully stop it from happening so often). Any tips on how we should go about this?

Also, we‚Äôre concerned for the dog. It‚Äôs a really small apartment, and it seems too small for two adults and a mastiff to be comfortable. I work from home during the day and am outside on our balcony frequently, but I‚Äôve never seen them take the dog out for a walk. The only time I‚Äôve seen the dog is when it got out without a leash the other day. Its barks seem more distressed now that it‚Äôs been about 11-12 hours, and I just hope it‚Äôs okay.

I also make many meals a day for him usually because I currently work on thurs-fr-sat-sun and he works through the week, so I have time during the weekdays if he says he‚Äôs feeling too rushed to eat. He also does not offer to clean those dishes after lunches or suppers, so I either clean them or I leave them there to hope he gets the hint. Today, the sink was flowing with dishes because of days of me saying ‚ÄúI literally do everything else, why can‚Äôt he just do some dishes?‚Äù. I asked him if he could do them, and he freaked the fuck out at me. He got super mad and basically was like ‚Äúwhy is this my job?‚Äù and went in the kitchen huffing and puffing about how the sink was disgusting and how ‚Äúpeople‚Äù leave the dishes for days. I said ‚Äúyeah, you do leave dishes for days‚Äù and we ended up getting in a fight. 

He said that he does ‚Äúso much‚Äù around the house and tries to clean up the kitchen on his lunch breaks. I said ‚Äúoky, yeah, that‚Äôs what a member of a household should do‚Äù and he‚Äôs like ‚Äúwhen do I ever have time to clean!!!! I work!!!!!!‚Äù And it was just messy. He also sees himself as the clean person and that he‚Äôs soooo on top of house work and completely denies not doing his fair share. In his mind, he honestly thinks I‚Äôm the one who doesn‚Äôt do the fair share. This is because I boycott doing his work to try and show him that I‚Äôm not a maid. As a result, only my mess gets cleaned up (as I usually do, so that mess is always invisible) and his is laying out in the open making the house look dirty. 

After the fight, he is now currently giving me the silent treatment because I was ‚Äútoo rude‚Äù when I asked him to clean and was being ‚Äúunfair‚Äù.

545,"Hi, 
Ive been frustrated about this since this morning.
Basically, I've known this pornstar/model for years now. I've watched a lot of her adult videos and seen a lot of her model work online. I sent her some funds through paypal a few days ago. The problem is that I said something along the lines of 'Hey, this is emeraldmb65 about the video request'. This morning she emailed me saying that her Paypal account was put on a permanent ban. She sounded pretty upset about it too as she's been using it for years for a lot of her transactions. Paypal even withheld the money that I sent her as well so she cant recieve it and I cant send it to her a different way. I honestly didnt even mean for any of this to happen, I just wanted to request a video from her. The worst part is that this is one of the first times I've actually talked to her in some way, shape, or form. I cant stand that this is the way that she'll remember me. I just emailed her a few times about just giving her the money and forgetting about doing the video. She sounds ok saying that she could accept other payments, but shes still understandably upset about losing the account. At this point its not even about the request, I just want to have good relations with her (I just want to be friendly with her and I dont want her to hate me). What should I do now?

556,"Hi there. If you don't have the time, just read the last paragraph please. It may seem negligible but I really need some advice right now. Thanks.

-

Keep in mind that I live in an Asian country at the moment. 3 years ago, back in my last year of middle school, I worked really hard to get into a prestigious private high school and luckily, I got in. It was a very competitive environment but I met so many inspiring students and this school really motivated me to do better. 

I was born and raised in Canada, and moved to Asia 8 years ago. I was lucky enough to adjust to a new environment and had no trouble in school as well. But I always dreamt of returning to Canada one day. There were many reasons toward why I wanted to go back to Canada but I think I just really missed how life was like there. Despite the fact that I was a student at a well-known private high school, I decided to transfer to an international school with a North American curriculum.

Now I thougt I had made a great decision. I missed Canada, always wanted to go back, and I found a school that would let me get into a Canadian uni. My parents supported my decision and I was so excited to be in an English-speaking environment after so many years. It was almost too good to be true. 

Well? I hate it here. Literally every aspect of this school is so messed up. The teachers, the students, the location (they said they were moving to a new building but nopeeee) and just everything here is actually depressing. 

There are barely any students here to begin with, and most of them are the most self-centered people I've ever seen. And I've been to 6 different schools so far so I've encountered a LOT of people.

The system here is aslo very flawed because half of the teachers barely know what they're doing. I could rant about all the messed up things but that'll take me an entire day so to sum up, overall, I regret coming to this school. The only benefit is that I can apply to a Canadian university, but now I'm wondering if it was even worth the transition between a  perfect school to a half-assed one just to go back to Canada. 

I can't believe it's been 2 years since I came to this school and the only reason I was able to survive was because I finally found a friend who wasn't self-centered that I could finally relate to. But this friend is a year older than me and graduated this year, so next year I'm alone. And I'm doomed.

Regardless, I can't go back in time so I have to deal with the decision I made in the past. I have one year left, and I feel like I'm gradually going crazy. It's summer break and yesterday I couldn't sleep cause I was crying about this issue. I literally don't even go to school rn so this just proves how much I hate it. I just felt so stupid choosing to drop out of my previous high school even after all these years.

I'm having a hard time forgiving myself for transferring schools. Nobody knew that this school would be so crappy. Just like I mentioned, I sometimes wonder if I should have just let go of my obsession of wanting to go back to Canada because then I wouldn't have come to this school. But again, I can't blame anyone because no one knows the outcome of a decision.. I think ahout this way too often and it's like a loop of thoughts that has been going on forever for the past few years ever since I came to this school.

I want to learn how to accept reality and deal with my regrets. I want to stop blaming myself for making an unfortunate decision. I just got unlucky, and I chose the wrong school. But I no longer want to think about this anymore. I can't transfer anywhere and I literally have only a year left. Yes, I hate this place but I honestly just need to get over it. I want to make the best out of my situation right now, and I want to stop regretting about a decision I made which turned out to have a bad outcome. Can you please give me some advice?",23Jul2020,2

565,"So let me explain the situation.

A friend of mine (we'll call them Steve) had a big blowup with one of their friends (we'll call them Emily) and now they are no longer friends. In venting to me, Steve was telling me how much of a psycho Emily was turning out to be. Steve mentioned Emily has herpes, that she often doesn't take her medication, that she does not use condoms, and that she sleeps with a lot of men. Worse yet, Steve told me Emily does not care who she gives herpes to. Steve also told me the names of some of the men she has slept with, and I know a few of them, though not well.

Since being told this information by Steve, it has weighed heavily on me. I have gone back and forth with whether or not I should reach out to the men Steve told me about to give them the heads up. Part of me says it is not my business and the other part says ""well someone made it your business and the responsible thing to do would be to tell them."" After all, if I were one of those guys, would I not want someone to tell me? Further, some of those guys have girlfriends now. While you could argue that the men would be at fault for not wearing protection, their now serious girlfriends should not be negatively affected by this poor decision made by their now boyfriend. Theoretically, telling the men might protect future girlfriends and wives as at least parties are aware.

Steve says I should not say anything because karma will come back to Emily. If I say something, I do not want this to come back on Steve. If I say something, I also do not want it to come back on me. I know how these things go, people like to shoot the messenger and if Emily does have a few screws loose, I don't want that coming my way. I also think about the legal implications. I believe what Emily is doing is a crime as she knows she has an std, is being negligent, and is knowingly passing it on. If a guy decides to pursue charges and I had told them this info, am I now involved in that case? Could my outreach to the guys be considered slander? Would I be an asshole if I told the guys that she has herpes? I struggle because herpes can lay dormant in one's system for years and it is not something that is generally tested for in standard std tests.

571,"So my wife is really excited to go to a pool party with some people she knows from work, but I'm not so keen on her going. I won't lie that a part of the reason is resentment that she made no effort to invite me along, despite it being a large gathering with a few dozen attendees, many of whom are likely to bring their SOs. I do feel as though she is specifically against me attending, and that is fairly hurtful. It's not that I think she's cheating on me or would ever do that; I trust her implicitly in that department, but there are other ways she is not as trustworthy. The main reasons I'd rather she not go are that she has very poor impulse control, and is likely to drink a lot, and at an event like this, I suspect there will be drugs present, and I doubt she would be able to turn them down if they were offered to her. She is prone to easy addictions, so this would be pretty dangerous for her, yet she remains adamant on going. On a side note, she also gets very obnoxious when she drinks, and I really would rather not deal with that. I've expressed my concerns and discontent, and while she didn't touch the drug issue, she assured me that she, indeed, *would* be drinking too much. I know it's her decision and that I should trust her not to do anything stupid, but in many ways I don't based on her past behaviour and statements. I wouldn't dream of trying to ""forbid"" her from going, and that would just make her more adamant on going anyway, but does anybody have any insight on how I might convince her not to attend?

576,"Seriously, that's all I wanna know, why is it so difficult to cut toxic people out? Imagine your ""friend"" is a piece of shit, rude, self-centered, drug addicted, has to be better than you type person and yet somehow here you are still managing to interact with them, trying to convince yourself that the past is the past and that everything will be ok. I've tried so hard, I did my best to look past their violent behaviour, them ruining their own relationships and hurting the people closest to me, them ruining my relationship by fucking around with my ex about 3-4 days after we broke up, in a period where I was at my lowest, not to mention their guilt tripping self-harm, blatant lying, shit-talking and manipulation. Yet here I am, apologizing for my fucking mistakes. And when I finally decide to stop, to try my best to just cut them off and leave everything behind, somehow they ask me ""have i done something wrong?"".

And then i'll feel guilty, often i'm angry at them for no reason, angry that somehow they think everything is ok even though they're the reason behind my own self-harm, my self-consciousness, theyre the reason why my friends and I have trouble trusting people, theyre the reason that my friends and I are so close, because we look out for eachother. And when i'm angry for no reason, I feel guilty, as if i'm just going off on one because I feel like it, because I need attention and it makes me feel so sad. 

So then I feel the need to apologize, its always ""I'm sorry for getting angry with you."" but it's more like ""I'm sorry I didn't do a good enough job of cutting you off, and I felt so guilty that I had to apologize, and you still dont think you did anything wrong. 

And that's it, that's the endless fucking cycle. You're friends until the next big fuck up, till the next small one that can only remind you of the bigger ones before. And there's no escape when youre stuck in an environment with them on a daily basis.

579,"I am uncertain what to do in what I take to be an unusual circumstance.

There are three parties involved, Me is me, P is my partner, and C is the other person. 

Some background: I operate a discord server for a social group from my college days, it started with a fairly small number of people and grew as people brought in friends after college. All three parties (Myself, P, and C) are on this server. I met P before college and helped them through a really rough time, they were struggling with depression and were suicidal on a few occasions. I met C during college, they were excitable and liked to be involved in things then. P has lived with poverty and recieved neglect in their history. C has recieved psychological abuse in their history. After college C had a place to live and I did not yet, and they offered take P in for a little while till I could get on my feet fiscally. While C and P were living together, P said C became more and more controlling and psychologically overbearing, telling P how to think, dismissing P's opinions and expertise in subjects. P was afraid to say or do much of anything because it could provoke C into a rant of telling P how to think and act. I only saw some of this first hand, but I do trust P that most of it did happen. I don't think C meant to be cruel, but P considers them an abuser now. When I was able to get my own place and bring P to live with me, C kind of disappeared from our lives. C was still on the discord server, but they were never online. 

More recently, P has been in a much better place psychologically. I try to do the right things to help them, but I don't understand the nature of the problem some times due to my own mental abnormalities. C suddenly returned to discord recently, and P has been having panic attacks daily but is afraid to leave this server because it is the only link to several of our friends. I probably should have booted C a long time ago. The other people on the server, even if they know C, don't know how P was treated. Now, with C suddenly active again, I don't know the right thing to do. To everyone else, if I decide to boot C and C decides to make drama it will appear I removed them because P didn't like them. Almost everyone on the server knows P is my partner. I try to stay impartial in disagreements and moderation necessities. It's been years since anyone had heard from C until a few days ago, maybe they have changed? But their mere presence is giving P panic attacks. 

How do I move forward without creating more drama than is necessary or hurting someone? Do I boot C and pretend they were never there? Do I explain it? Do I let C stay and P cut off a major social part of their life? Do I ask strangers on the internet to tell me what to do? Do I panic and delete the whole server? 

Joking aside, I suggested that P block and mute C already, this caused another panic attack from a past experience tangentially similar to this one. Do I just boot C and move on? I don't want to be perceived as abusing my administrative powers, but I also don't want P to damage themselves.",23Jul2020,1

My main issue is that I am afraid to sleep alone at night, even at my parents house, without dogs in my room I will struggle

Once night time hits and I'm alone, my brain immediately thinks about ghosts, demons and monsters who will kill me, during the day I'm completely fine

587,"Basically are house maid comes over 4 days a week and since I'm on my own and parents are out on vacation, she has taken the liberty (with permission) to bring her 13 year old daughter, it's a big house on the coast with a large swimming pool, and shes the type from what I have quickly observed to be filming/showing off the assets on social media I assume...

Anyways seems like the girl has a crush on me, keeps staring at me and is super shy when confronted when normally she is outgoing to everyone else...


Yikes I'm a 24 year old male and if this doesnt already make my socially awkward ass uncomfortable idk what does...


Anyways the question was, I was hyped up and  wanted to jump in the pool today but the girl got there first (queue up the  Mike Kowalski meme)

The maid and her daughter got here an hour earlier then previewed since they finished up another house earlier today.

I dont know what to do, do I jump in the pool with her and stay on one side? I keep putting doubts in my head that I will look like a fucking pedo when I swim in underwear, since I dont have any swimming trunks.

I'm confident in my body but not comfortable when theres a mom and a 12 year old that I barely know and half ass speak there language...

What would the mother think I would say if she saw me in just underwear chilling with her daughter in the pool?


Do I just shelter elsewhere in the house and let this blow over until they leave???


I just dont know what to do...

I have genuinely never had an interaction with a young girl before simply because it's never been in my social circle of friends having younger siblings and what not so I have no idea how to act with children with coming off as malicious, yet alone i cant even speak their fucking language (I'm staying at my parents house in a foreign country that I dont speak)",23Jul2020,1
588,"Looking for any advice, speculation, etc... Yes, I am talking to doctors and getting tests. I am just looking for speculations or suggestions... with Corona, I feel like every hospital doesn't know wtf they're doing anymore. All my tests are coming back normal... (still waiting on the blood).

Okay, I am wholly convinced I am dying. Approx 6-9 months ago I began experiencing unruly fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain. Not eating was more comfortable than eating. When I ate, I knew pain would soon follow. Liquid diarrhea every time I went. Recently has turned bright green. I speculated IBS so I paid $900 out of pocket for a full abdominal ultrasound... they found nothing. Yesterday, I paid for 8 vials to be sent out for celiac, thyroid, etc. Waiting to hear back. 

Recently I've started drastically losing weight. I noticed when I ate processed foods I felt like I was giving birth to the antichrist (literally an hour after eating), to where I'd get hot flashes, sweat; pray to god to take my ability to defecate away. This is where I speculated celiacs disease or irritable bowel, so I spent $300 on gluten free food and have been sticking to that. 

Despite that, this week, I noticed I am losing 1-2.6 pounds a night... water weight, fat, I don't know. I've dropped from 114.8 to 110.4 in 3 days despite eating as many calories as possible and doing zero activity. I have never been larger than a size 5 but I always had some meat on my bones. Lately I am watching it all melt away. I laid in bed this AM and pulled my legs in and literally wanted to cry because I looked like a damn ghoul from the skyrim tunnels. :l (tryingtodivertpainwithheehees) 

Has anyone seen this happen, does it remind you of something? I am open to any speculation, I have spent so much money trying to figure this out and every time a test comes back, the doctor says I'm okay. I do not feel okay, I feel poisoned half the time, or too tired to do anything but come home from work and sit, or dab and knock myself out. I can't lift my arms for more than a few seconds before they burn or I feel my chest get tight. My BMI is 15.9. 

Also, at what point should I go to the ER? I am not an ER fan but... if I should... Almost every day I feel like I am fighting a poison inside me, I literally just want to lie down, close my eyes, and wake up when it's over. 

Symptoms: 
-Abdominal pain 
-Constipation / diarrhea 
-""flighty"" chest feeling 
-hands tremor very faintly once a day or so 
-pain after eating 
-hellish pain when pooping (since eating mostly gluten free this has subsided 75%) 
-weight loss every day 
-too tired to do anything 
-need motivation to eat, despite being hungry 
-i noticed im starting to ""stop"" breathing throughout the day. Like I subconsciously start holding my breath til it's too much, then I notice and gasp.",23Jul2020,2

592,"Hello. I‚Äôm 22. 
Ive been working and living with an elderly woman [76] for a few years now. Initially, I met this woman through a friend while job hunting and at first she just needed a hand organizing paperwork, but later on, my responsibilities branched onto different things like grocery shopping and picking up her medication as her trust in me grew. 

I learned that she has osteosarcoma and has no family who really cares for her. She has been living alone for years prior to meeting me and yet we got along so well, she eventually offered a room for me to stay in. It was a dream come true. I never minded our age difference. Her generosity and friendship is more than I could ever ask for. 

Now, I come from a small family and don‚Äôt have many friends. I usually keep to myself. But this woman was able to break down many walls for me and thus has become my most beloved friend. 

Unfortunately, her cancer has deteriorated her health and energy significantly these past two months while we‚Äôve been in quarantine, and she can no longer stay up for very long. I cannot and will not leave her side now, but i‚Äôm ashamed to admit how depressed the situation has made me feel. I‚Äôm trying really hard to stay strong for her and keep on with my duties as I always have, but every day is getting harder. The realization that I will be the one to find her when she passes is still a great devastation to me i don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôll ever be ready for. I still try to prepare somehow for that day when it comes, but i‚Äôm still afraid.

599,"

Usually people get in trouble for not doing their job but nope, not me! For some context, I work with my family‚Äôs business. We‚Äôre in the fitness industry, so there‚Äôs a large database and alot to do. My heart is with this business. It‚Äôs my baby. I helped to build it since I was 15 years old. 

When people don‚Äôt take it as seriously as I do, i get upset. I don‚Äôt show it emotionally because I have to be professional about it, but I take it out by ‚Äúdoing other people‚Äôs jobs‚Äù. Because i‚Äôm so invested in this, I take on roles that are not my job because 1. People ask me to help them/ do it because I‚Äôm knowledgeable about everything obviously or 2. Because I know it‚Äôs not going to be done on time or 3. Because I know it‚Äôs not going to be done as well as I would do it because I know how it should be done and at what quality. I‚Äôm a control freak when it comes to work. I admit this, but my mother doesn‚Äôt hear me out about WHY i‚Äôm like this.

The only problem is, which is what my mum keeps trying to tell me, is how are others supposed to figure out how to do what they‚Äôre supposed to do if I‚Äôm doing everything? I understand this side completely but at the same time, this business is so fast paced that we don‚Äôt have time for fuck ups and for people to take their time about it. I wouldn‚Äôt have to take on these jobs if I felt that my colleagues were doing their job!

We‚Äôve brought in so many people who just haven‚Äôt delivered. Whilst I am tired of doing all of this work, I love doing it because it‚Äôs my passion and it‚Äôs my family‚Äôs magnum opus. I don‚Äôt want it to mess up and I can‚Äôt sit back and watch other people mess it up. I‚Äôm tired of people not having urgency or that mentality to sacrifice a little for more.

My mum just doesn‚Äôt understand how much it means to me for the business to do well. I know I shouldn‚Äôt take on so much responsibility because it‚Äôs not fair on myself or to my colleagues, but they make me feel like this in the first place! People back away from the problems, and I pick them up yet I get scolded for it. 

I‚Äôm thinking to quit for a month and focus on my university, and maybe she and the office will understand where I‚Äôm coming from. I put so much passion and time and effort into this, but I guess it‚Äôs not appreciated. Or maybe I‚Äôm just unable to let go. I‚Äôm tired of fighting with my mum about this. What should I do?",23Jul2020,2
600,"TL/DR: Wife is working from home but does nothing. I think (but I'm not sure) that this has been noticed. She refuses to talk about it or make any changes. She gets angry and defensive when I bring it up. What do I do?

My wife's office is currently closed and all employees are working from home. However, my wife spends most of her time watching TV shows or chatting with her sister. The other day a senior coworker asked if she was working from her phone since apparently their system specifies whether someone is on mobile or on their laptop; I believe the implication of this is that she couldn't be doing adequate work just from her phone. And a few weeks ago this same coworker indicated to their boss that she is overwhelmed with work and would like to ask my wife to share some of the load. Nothing seems to have come of this, but I don't know why. I don't think it's because my wife is refusing, but I do suspect that she SHOULD be actively reaching out to this coworker to offer her help. But my wife hasn't gotten the hint, it seems. 

I try to discuss this with her and she refuses to change, and she continues to make excuses. She brushes off the hints, lamely tries to assure me that it's all fine. But she sits around, occasionally refreshes her phone screen, and simply doesn't work. 

It seems clear to me that this has been noticed and I'm terrified. We absolutely cannot live on just my salary. I have only been able to find part-time work, but continue to look for full-time (not easy since few places are hiring during COVID). We have rent and car payments. It would be a \*disaster\* if she lost her job. I've started to look for a second part-time job as well. 

I can't talk to her about this as she gets defensive and angry. Part of me just hopes she gets confronted by her boss. She's 33 years old but, when it comes to work, seems to have the maturity of a teenager. 

Any strategies on how to bring this up? How to make her see the importance of this?",23Jul2020,3

I used to be a big shoulder for my mother to lean on, but she ended up abusing that. Things went from bad to worse but we made up and i see her every now and then. 

The problem is that whenever i see my mom, the only thing she does is vent out, complain complain complain, and all this negative energy really is bringing me down. Is it not a basic human right to not wanna listen to something? She gets extremely upset (which is also a right, but just unreasonable imo) when i point that out, and will say im extremely selfish, am i?

I just finished 3 back to back 11hour shifts at work, i have a day off and i wanna wind down and play some videogames, she comes in my room, sits on the bed and starts talking about all her problems whilst im in the middle of doing stuff, and will then follow up with a; ''Are you even listening?'' expecting me to drop everything im doing to listen to her vent. 

I love my mom, but im feeling more and more like she sees me as only an emotional relief system, she has taken some trumatic mental hits which i think have to do with it, as she used to not be this way.

606,"So this has been on going for about 2 years now, and I'm going to start from the beginning, but you can easily skip to the end to see the real dilemma. 

So gradually over time my mom (36F) started to become more distant from my siblings (8F) (12M), and I (16F). She had recently gotten out of a divorce with my sister's dad. We're all half siblings and none of us share the same dad. To say the least, he didn't take the divorce lightly and made life hell for my mom. Which I can only assume is to blame for the next events. My mom has been a manager at a 2 restaurants for about a decade at least. At the one closest to wear we live (walking distance) a new guy started working there as a dishwasher. He was quite clearly a drug addict, he was tall, lanky, pale, his hair was always gelled and spiked up, he some times wore black eyeliner, and over all looked very fragile and frail. 

My siblings and I switched week on week off between our mom's and dad's. When I would come to her house often I thought it smelled funny but I wasn't sure what it was. One night I had 3 of my friends spend the night here, and one of them woke up in the middle of the night because she needed to go outside to get fresh air. The other 3 of us were confused because it wasn't hard to breathe for us and we were used to it. I feel terrible for exposing her to that and she hasn't spent the night here since then. Eventually it got worse, and when I'd come over the first thing I noticed when I opened the door was a huge waft of air that smelled like marijuana. All of my clothes smelt like it and I was afraid to go to school because of that. At the time, I was in 8th grade. It became apparent that my mom had some guy over a lot, but she did her best to hide him from us.  He only came over at nights, but he wasn't very good at staying hidden. You could constantly hear him yelling at my mom since her room is in the basement and it echos through the vents. You normally could only hear him, except for when she yells telling him to be quiet because it was normally in the middle of the night. I wasn't able to sleep at all the night before the first day of school because I was kept up by his yelling. It was always him accusing her of things such as cheating when she wouldn't even have the time in her schedule to do so. I no longer felt safe there and didn't want to spend so much time there, so I talked to my dad and I only went to my mom's every other weekend, same with my sister, however that was for custody reasons.

My mom lost her job and was told that they'd love to have her back, but she needed to get better first because it was clear she was on drugs. She started a babysitting/daycare business at our house. However one of her friends was helping her with it, but one day stole a lot of our stuff and took off. 

My mom's dad ended up coming up from Florida to visit (we live in Michigan) and tried to convince her to go to rehab, or at least come back to Florida to stay with him for a while. She refused at first but ended up going to a rehab place near us. I got a call from her and she said visiting hours were on Sundays, and I could talk to my aunt if I wanted to see her. Well a couple weeks went by and I started to feel bad because I was busy on Sundays, but I then learned that she had gone in on a Thursday, and left the next Saturday. She went back to her house and change the locks on our doors so her boyfriend couldn't get in. However I think she ended up giving him a key. This happened twice. 

One day while I was spending the night at a friend's I got a call from my grandma (my mom's mom) and she said something bad had happened but she refused to tell me what it was, but said she told my dad. So he picked me up and told me the story on the way to his house. My mom has had an overdose, and was rushed to the hospital last night. After being told the story from a couple people, I can say that what happened was my mom and her boyfriend were in the basement and he had injected heroin into her arm, which made her heart stop. She stopped breathing for a while, but they were able to restart her heart. My mom's friend who was in town was staying at our house, and when this happened her and my brother were home so she rushed him out of the house. Her boyfriend was the one who called the police and I thank him for that because he knew he would end up going to jail. When she left in an ambulance, he left in the back of a cop car. He was then taken to court where we learned he had charges of assault from girls we didn't even know. However he snitched on other people so he didn't go to jail. It became apparent that they were doing a lot more than I had thought, as reports stated heroin, crystal meth, and cocaine. 

This was her wake up call, she agreed to go to Florida with her dad and went to rehab there for about a year. Within that time, I would make trips to my mom's house to grab stuff I had left there, or would spend time with friends in the area. One day I was hanging out with my friend who lives down the street from my mom, we went to her house because I wanted a pair of sunglasses I had left. The doors were locked which was odd because they aren't usually. So I went around to the back where I knew we had a spare key, while I was grabbing it, my friend said she saw someone in the back window. I got scared and turned around but no one was there, I figured she might have seen something. So I grabbed the key then looked up again and saw him standing there in the window of the back door, then smiled and waved to us, if sent chills down my spine. He walked away and we walked to the front of the house because I didn't want to leave now, I just wanted to get to my room and get out. So I put the key in the door and unlocked it but then in the window of the front door he was there holding the door shut, he looked at me and told me to come back later. I immediately left with my friend and we didn't look back, forgetting I had accidentally taken the spare key. I still feel like I shouldn't have let him say that, it was more my house than his and he didn't have the right to tell me to go away. 

During that summer, he was arrested for an armed robbery of a couple in their garage. He was taken to court and denied bonds, from which he was finally taken to jail. I was doing as much digging as I could, but no where could I find how long he'd be in for. Either way, it made me feel safer to see his name on a list of inmates.

Finally my mom was back, she was like a changed person. Most importantly, she felt like a mom to me, and I had never had that connection with her before. She settled in and then my siblings and I started going there every other Saturday, slowly increasing how much time we spent there. She was doing very good on no drugs or even alcohol, and continued to go to meetings about once a week. She started talking to me about what was happening and turns out during the day when my mom was at work, he would be out with friends cheating on her with both guys and girls. He would be doing drugs with his friends, and at the end of the day come home and accuse her of all the things he had been doing. She told me how the only reason he was around was because she thought she could help him, but through rehab and therapy she realized that not everyone can be helped, and it was better to let it be. I also told her about all the times I felt uncomfortable around him. Like in the middle of the night, if I got up to get a drink and he was also up he would stare at me and it made me uncomfortable, but not my face, somewhere on my body. A few times I'd see him directly staring at my butt which made me only wear sweatpants at her house.

It's been about a year and a half since my mom's been back now, but it's happening again. She's becoming more distant. The house smells funny and strongly of cigarettes. And he's back. About 2 weeks ago I went down to my mom's room to ask a question and saw him laying in the bed. I'm scared. I normally don't like spending time at my dad's, but at least there I feel safe. A lot of times when I come back here it's obvious someone has went throught my room. Just this morning when I woke up I saw a car pulling out of the driveway, I didn't have my glasses on so I couldn't see who was driving. I then heard some noises and my dog was making a light growl. I walked towards the kitchen and saw someone tall dressed in all black quickly turn around and leave out the back door. I ran back to my room and stared out my window but I wasn't sure where he went. While laying in my bed I heard my dog growl again and heard the back door open and close. Which is what made me want to make this post.

And this is where I need help. It's obvious my mom doesn't like this guy and tries to get rid of him, but whenever he's here it's like she doesn't care. I want him gone and I know the rest of my family does, but I don't know if they know he's back. I've never talked to him myself, and I don't normally talk to my mom about it. I don't think he's actually doing anything wrong so I don't think I can call the police, even if he was, I wouldn't know what to do or say. I have major anxiety problems so I wouldn't know how to talk about these things with my mom. Someone please help me, how do I fix this, and how do I get rid of him..",23Jul2020,1

He will deny responsibility for pretty much anything he does wrong, and mom swallows it as fast as he can dish it out. He had a job briefly this summer and was taking good silverware to work and throwing it away. Every day 1 fork, 1 spoon. Went unnoticed until 8 were gone. His response ""wasn't me"". I find a piece of silverware in his work lunchbox ""was only this time"". Find spoon in his truck ""it was only that time"". Just complete lack of accountability and since there is never admission his mom wont punish hm.

Last week it all changed: we have a ""change jar"" that is stuffed with change and bills. My wife noticed it was half empty last Thursday. Her 16m is going on ""vacation"" with his girlfriend to Myrtle Beach, SC this past weekend, and he quit his job a few weeks back and has no money. So, we put 2 and 2 together and confront him. He denies even knowing where the ""change jar"" was even though everyone in the house knows exactly where it is. Worth mentioning he stole from it previously before I was in the picture. 

I eventually grow fed up with it and start calling polygraph providers in my area. He realizes I am serious and admits taking the money, but disagrees with how much was there (\~150USD). BS. So, based on that admission he gets to go on vacation, but consequences are waiting when he gets back. Supposedly. His Dad is unfortunately ambivalent and somewhat blames us for leaving money ""laying around"", and isn't necessarily going to support us in grounding 16m.

16m has also sent text messages to his mom stating that he cannot live with me anymore. He is willing to do whatever he has to do to deflect this by creating turmoil. I see it coming. He returns home in a few days - going directly to his dad's - and I am conflicted with how far to push the consequences he should face.

615,"Hi, I don't know what to do, I'm in highschool, and studying music professionally, but i really want to play volleyball, my dream is to become a pro player although i know is not easy because i haven't started and I'm 16, at least I need to try.
I'm also really insecure about it because I don't know if my teammates are going to be nice and I'm really insecure about my image.
I train by myself but i feel like i cannot get better if i don't practice with other people since it's a team sport. 
Because of corona i don't know if I'm going to be able to join a club, and my parents don't support me playing, because they think I must center in my studies even if i have really good grades.

617,"I need help and advice to stop being a ‚ÄúJerry‚Äù from Rick and Morty.

So I realized that I‚Äôm a Jerry to the T. Which is pretty fucking horrible. I‚Äôm a complete spineless doormat who has a terrible dependency disorder which also causes anxiety, depression and feelings of low self worth.

Just like Jerry who worships his wife and has a bit of an inferiority complex because she‚Äôs so successful while his life and hobbies are lame and he‚Äôs always screwing up. 

It really struck me when he‚Äôs awkwardly talking to his wife about their relationship and looking for validation and she responds that loving him ‚Äúis work‚Äù. Its a conversation that I‚Äôve had too. 

He‚Äôs constantly worried his wife will cheat on him because of his low self worth and they‚Äôre (probably) only together because of the unplanned pregnancy of Summer.

His life is my life. To .the. T. And I don‚Äôt want to be a Jerry anymore. Now I‚Äôm here looking for advice. 

I‚Äôve looked up Dependent Personality Disorder which seems to be a disorder with very little study behind it, so I can‚Äôt find any self help books, case studies or medication evidence. 

The only thing I can find is that they find Schema therapy to be effective but it‚Äôs one-on-one psychoanalysis therapy which I‚Äôll look into when I have the time, but I‚Äôm looking for something I can start today, baby steps.

Anyone else suffer from this? Anyone else been there and what worked for them?",23Jul2020,1
618,"Alright, So my mom is a teacher her job cut her pay, because she‚Äôs having trouble passing the certification exam. My sister, her fianc√© and I moved in with her in October to help out with her mortgage. In mid November I left the fryer on while talking to a salesman outside and the kitchen set on fire. The insurance company paid out for everything. Everything was covered. All they needed was a 500$ deposit. I paid the 500$ deposit. 
My mom took the insurance money and started paying bills with it. Paid the mortgage and a late fee because it was a month behind.
Paid student loans, car insurance etc.
We didn‚Äôt know any of this was going on.
If my mom would have said something I would have went in for overtime to help out. I don‚Äôt mind at all. 

Now in July they finally finished the house (don‚Äôt ask me why it took so long lol because I don‚Äôt know either) and they are putting a lien on the house because she used the insurance money as a personal loan. Now she is looking at us for help again. I‚Äôm tired of my mom making bad financial decisions and we have to bail her out. 
Every time she needs money it inconveniences me in some way. By either making me pay something late or me not being able to do what I want.

I'm in a huge group chat, where I love to talk and chat with my friends. The groupchat started out as a study group chat and expanded, so it includes a lot of people (some I know well, some I don't), which I really like. 

However, this one girl from the chat will constantly dm me, and if I don't answer immideatly, she'll tag me in the group chat. I find it very obnoxious, but I also know that many of the other people in the group chat ignores her, because she is a bit different. I don't want to hurt her feelings, but I really want the constant, obnoxious texting to stop. Is there any way to calmly and kindly ask her to stop?

I've tried suggesting that she makes some friends or find people that she has something in common with, both in real life and in our groupc hat, but she just really clings to her, because I'm nice to her. 

I really don't want to be rude towards her, but her constant texting has made me choose not to chat on the group chat with all the other people, because I know she'll text me, if she sees me online. I don't really know what to do",23Jul2020,1

622,"F, 23.. 
2 years ago I was doing my college when I had moved to Germany to be with my partner. Since then I haven't worked or study (Uni) . I have been studying the language and before corona happened I finished the level B1 which allows me to have basic conversations. I used to be very outgoing but ever since I moved here, I am now scared of any interaction which is the reason why I barely have friends, no one to share any of my struggles. I cannot work because I struggle with the language and most requires fluency unless I am a programmer and I cannot study (uni/internship) either. Now I am getting pressured by him and his family. I understand that but just the thought of going to work (if i ever get) or continuing to learn German just makes me so stressed. To the point that I'd rather be dead. I know I'm being a weak ass bitch but this shit is just so difficult for me. On top of that I don't even know what career path I'm going and I have no skill or talent. I'm useless and confused.

623,"I (17F) only see my step sister (15F) once every few weeks besides the pandemic, where she‚Äôs been at my house for roughly 4 months. We haven‚Äôt been close for many years but recently are starting to become closer, as we often message/talk to each other daily. 

She gets very poor grades but I‚Äôve never really judged for that, as when I was that age I didn‚Äôt bother trying and just barely passed any classes. But she asked a question at some point asking where Egypt was, so I responded northeast Africa. She asked where Africa was, and slightly taken aback I told her where Africa was. I started lightly quizzing her on various countries that i thought were common knowledge, like where New Zealand was, but she got almost every single one wildly wrong. She didn‚Äôt know where Mexico was, and we‚Äôre Canadian. Anyways, I kind of excused this as I just assumed maybe she was bad at geography. 

Then one day I was helping her with her career life school project and this is where she learns college was not free. I tried to explain to her but she seemed distraught like she had no idea, and it was quite odd since I thought that was taught quite young. 

Finally, I was talking to my step dad about the Chinese uyghurs situation calling it the ‚Äúmodern day holocaust‚Äù. She turns and asks ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the Holocaust?‚Äù At first I thought she was joking but she was serious. I explained it and she seemed shocked. What I don‚Äôt understand is they taught this in the grade she just passed. How can you sit through a history class without learning what the holocaust is, even as a vague idea? 

I feel like I sound quite rude or big headed in this but I‚Äôm genuinely concerned regarding if she has an undiagnosed learning disability or something. I know some of these can be passed off as just things she may not have known but there are so many more of these that have blown my mind on how someone over the age of 12 does not know this. Am I just being an ass or do I have grounds to be concerned? And is there anything I can do to try to convince her to focus on her studies more?",23Jul2020,6
624,"I genuinely think my uncle is a sociopath. I am afraid of him. Long story but need advice. Please.

Hello everyone, like the title states, I think my uncle is a sociopath. Yes, I mean the psychological definition of a sociopath (not just being dramatic). I put up a front around others but I am actually scared of him. I will start this out by providing some background information. For the sake of this post/privacy I will refer to my uncle as ‚ÄúBob‚Äù. 

My mother and I have been talking about Bob recently out of concern. My mom informed that ever since Bob (her brother) was a child something was off about him. Bob stayed in trouble throughout school. Always fighting with others and treating everyone in his house ungodly. Bob would lash out at his father and demean him. Example: Bob would make his father eat outside during dinner time because apparently he breathed too loudly. This is just one example of the many fucked up things he would do. Bob has had a very interesting and unstable life. During his 20‚Äôs, Bob moved away from his very small hometown to Miami, then to Texas, Los Angeles, and on to New York City. While in New York, Bob lived in the Chelsea Hotel and attended the Fashion Institute of Technology (did not complete his degree). No clue how he afforded this (I assume he used others peoples cash). He has toured with and befriended some very famous musicians, artists, and photographers. Bob only wears designers clothes, despite the fact that he has never worked in his life. Once again, I am assuming that he uses his boyfriends to find his lifestyle until they can no longer provide for him. I have met some of his past love interests. They were all very bizarre people. They would visit us at our house when we were younger. My uncle and his boyfriend would make fun of my sister for wearing makeup and making sexual references to her (calling her a whore)...she was a minor. Another example: one time my uncle called my mother at 3 AM and had his boyfriend act like a doctor. During this call, the ‚Äúdoctor‚Äù informed my mom that her brother had killed himself and was in critical condition. He lied about the whole thing. My uncle was pulling some sick joke on my mom. 

Bob has never worked a day in his life. Like stated above he only wears designer clothing. However, he is on governmental disability? He is in perfectly fine health to work. He uses his government benefits to buy very expensive clothes. When going shopping at places like Walmart, Bob will slip things into this coat pockets and steal them all while wearing a $1,000 pair of shoes. Bob also is a pathological liar. No one in my family believes anything that he says because he has been caught in so many lies. Example: he called me a couple months back and accused me of being a drug dealer. Bob told me that he had evidence and was going to contact my private college and have them expel me. Side note: I have never even tried drugs. Bob felt the need to call and tell my parents this lie and then went on to berate them on the phone. I heard this phone call because it was on speaker. Bob made fun of my fathers cancer and then proceeded to curse him out (all for no reason). He will randomly call our house at 1-3 am and leave the meanest voicemails on our answering machine. He left me a voicemail calling me a f*ggot and a racist c*nt. Bob left another voicemail saying he had proof that I had been bringing men into my apartment for hookups (once again all lies). 

Most recently, Bob was arrested for a domestic dispute for the third time in under a year. This time he spent a month in jail. Apparently, Bob had beaten the shit out of his boyfriend. Keep in mind Bob has no money of his own because he has leeched off of everyone else. Now Bob currently has nothing (except for all those expensive clothes). He is living with his mother in their very small house in the middle of nowhere. He has no car and no friends. 

Wrap all of this to say, I am convinced he is a sociopath. I worry that once I start my career he will try to ruin it for me. No lie is off limits for him. I‚Äôm scared he will contact one of my future employers and make up some elongate lie about me.If he knew he would benefit from it he will do it. What should I do? I just needed to vent about this. I‚Äôm scared.",23Jul2020,0

For starters, even though my university is globally in the top 20, whenever I see that someone successful went to so-and-so university to study for some reason I keep thinking I've messed up in life.

For my career choice, I guess you can say I want to go down a late-blooming path. It requires that I study for a few extra years instead of going straight into the job, and when I see someone who has started working already it once again makes me feel like I've messed up.

There are so many other comparison points that make me feel like I've messed up. Even simple things like the things I say, or the holidays I chose to not go on because of other priorities, or even the events I refused to go to something else. The list is endless, and nowadays it feels like every single thing in my life, I regret.

I have moments when I reassure myself, when I realise that my path is my own. I by no means have messed anything up, I just did what I wanted to do, and at the end of the day that's how life goes. Even if I did what I now think is 'perfect', there are absolutely no certainties in life.

653,"So my spouse hasn't been able to see or talk to their mom in over a year because my father-in-law is crazy. Little bit of back story I am a 27 year old female my spouse is also 27 FTM Transgender.

 My in-laws have always had a lot of family drama and my FIL has had many altercations with his brothers and sister. He claims that his siblings are keeping his monther from him and interfere every time he tries to visit her. According to my spouse's aunt and cousin the reason he is not wanted over there is because he starts fights with his mom and makes her upset. Including throwing the bibile in her face, which had always been a very Christian lady. 

My FIL has instigated numerous fights between my spouse's family including trying to get his niece to meet him for a fight with our nephew in the car,  trying to kidnap our nephew, and fighting with us and my BIL over all sorts of stupid stuff. 

Last year he decided he was angry about not being allowed to see his mom and wanted us to get involved and somehow convince my spouse's uncles and aunt to let him visit his mom. We told hims we didn't want to get involved in the drama. We also expressed confusion on why he thought they would listen to us about the issue. He started berating my spouse saying they were disrespecting their parents by not standing up for them. He started telling them they were going to hell for being gay and sending 20 text messages at a time getting angry that they weren't responding because they were working. 

My spouse was very upset and after 4 year of bitting my tongue I was fed up. I sent him a message basically saying he needed to stop disrespecting my spouse and harassing them while they were working. He basically told me it was none of my business since it was his family to which i responded to if you're disrespecting my spouse it is my business. He basically started throwing the Bible at me to which I basically said that I'm not afraid of his imaginary friend because the true God is all loving and all forgiving. The argument continued to escalate I called him a phyco and eventually blocked him. He continued to argue with my spouse telling them to put a muzzle on his dog and calling me assssley instead of Ashley because apparently I'm an ass.

For some reason he thought I had taken my spouse's phone and was texting for them, which I wasn't, and began threatening me and trying to pay me to fight him. We ended up filing a police report and they advised us not to respond at all and if he continued we could charge him with harassment. 
My spouse's mother is taking FIL side on everything and is refusing to speak to us as well. I know it has been hurting my spouse even though they claim they are over it. She didn't even call or text for hia birthday last year. My spouse tried to reach out to her by writing her a letter and taking it up to her work. She refused to even look at us so we handed the letter to another person and she gave it to her later. She did write them back but basically said we needed to apologize and ""make things right"". My spouse sent her a mother's day gift despite not being on speaking terms. 

Today is my spouse's birthday and my BIL sent them a video that my MIL had recorded for them. Basically she said she loved them and wanted us to be a family again and they would put the drama behind us but we needed to make things right and apologize. Other than calling my FIL a psyco I have no clue what else we have to apologize for. 

Also I met my FIL mother recently and she said herself she didn't want to see him because he always acts like an ass.

I don't know what to at this point but I'm tired of seeing my spouse cry and hurting from this.",23Jul2020,1

His usual response is that there are too little trash cans (lazy), or that it will just be blown in the river by the wind (no shit).

I don't want to go and clean after him.

So if he was your friend, what would you do to make him care?

He's a fun guy, and I don't want to just dump him. I would like to think that there's a way to make people want to care about the environment, instead of just giving up on them.

So what's your advice? How do you approach people, how do you make them care?

I think I should be more forthcoming and let him know that if he's gonna make me clean after him, I'm not gonna hang around with him. But then again, that won't change his behaviour. So how do you make people change?",23Jul2020,11
656,"I started seeing a new therapist. She feels like she's good and can really help me with things like anger issues, depression, etc.

But after a few sessions, I get the vibe that we are not on the same level in some aspects. She seems religious (Christian), her therapy has a big component on the evils of pornography use and masturbation, and politically we may not see eye to eye.

I'm Christian, but I don't identify with a particular form. But I'm not really looking for spiritual guidance. Her faith has only kinda come into the discussion, partially I brought it up. 

Pornography/masturbation she seems very anti on this‚Äîhas studies etc on it, that seem legit but I have to look into it. I'm NOT seeing her for anything sexual related but part of her qualifications is licensed sec therapy. Our sexual relationships underpin a lot of our mental health? But I'm not addicted to it‚Äîkinda like drinking beers doesn't make you an alcoholic. But also something an addict would say? Haha.

657,"My parents got our house built about 20 years ago. Whenever my dad got the house built, he also bought the lot next to our house to keep someone else from living on top of us. Well throughout the years my dad has always stressed the importance of keeping our house whether it be to live in it or to run it out to someone else. He has told me explicitly several times to never sell the house which I understand. 

I currently live with my parents now since I just started my career a few months ago and in about three years I plan to move away to another state. Well for the past year now my dad has been asking me about possibly getting a house built on the lot next to our house so that I can live there. He told me this would be a good idea since I don‚Äôt have to buy any land and I can just Get cheap but nice home built. This doesn‚Äôt sound like a bad idea but I don‚Äôt want to make that decision right now since I plan to move in a few years. 

I have lived in my city for my entire college career (undergrad and grad school) And I just truly feel that it is time to MoveOn. I‚Äôve tried to explain this to my dad but he doesn‚Äôt really see the point in moving to another city, he thinks it makes much more sense financially to just stay here and build a house on that lot. I really think he just bought the lot so that I could move over there whenever I became of age. Someone has even suggested that he might want me to stay so that i can take care of them when they get older. He‚Äôs tried to convince me by saying that even if I do move in a few years I could rent the house out to someone else. I just don‚Äôt know, I really am trying to see if it would be worth it. I have a good relationship with my parents, I just think it‚Äôs time to spread my wings. What do you guys think?

Tl/dL: my dad suggested that I built a house on the lot next door. He claims it will be a good investment even if I decide to move in the next few years because I would be able to rent it out.

662,"hi. i‚Äôm a 14 year old male, and i‚Äôve been wondering for the longest time if my parents are really as unfair as i think they are. of course, i believe they are abusing mentally and emotionally, but i‚Äôm not sure so, i wanted to ask here. (i‚Äôm on mobile so sorry for formatting issues)


Okay, so a LOT of things happen, but i‚Äôll just name a situation that happened recently, and if you guys want me to go more into depth, then i will do as such. 

My dad got home from work and i just woke up. like just got up. it was about 3 and this is the first time i‚Äôve EVER woken up this late, i haven‚Äôt even done anything close to it in a long long time. so, my dad sees that i haven‚Äôt swept or anything yet because i was trying to eat first and then go straight to that. He asks why it wasn‚Äôt done and i said ‚Äúi just woke up.‚Äù then, he just lost it.

Now, my dad ALWAYS is in a bad mood when he gets home from work. if even the slightest thing isn‚Äôt done, he loses it. even if everything is done and perfect, he still comes home mad and try‚Äôs to find a way to lose it at me or my brother (i never come out of my room, i‚Äôm a lazy fuck etc. etc.)

so my dad goes on a rampage, starts
yelling and saying that i‚Äôm not doing anything productive and i‚Äôm just staying home doing nothing (which isn‚Äôt true, i‚Äôve been working out and skating and writing music) when i tried to fight back, and tried to defend my self, he either grabbed a belt or something that can hurt me, this time it was the belt, and i quieted down.

He starts going back to yelling, and making me do all this other random stuff, then he leaves to go workout, and i get a text saying that now i have to turn all my electronics in at 10 pm and i have to do a book report every. single. week. (due by sunday of course)

now, i am outraged by this, because they made me turn my stuff in before, but it was bc of online school. And when school ended, they said i wouldn‚Äôt have to turn stuff in anymore. And, Not only that, but i want to enjoy my summer. i want to play games with friends or be on ft with a girl late at night, and they are blocking me from doing that, and i hate it so fucking much. 

later, i am conversating with my mom about this, and basically we come to the deal that i can keep my phone for one night, and wake up at a reasonable time, i can keep my phone. okay. my big break through, maybe they‚Äôre finally being fair and reasonable.

or so i thought.

cut to this morning. i woke up at 9:08 AM. by myself. i‚Äôve never been so happy, i‚Äôm telling you. 
i text my parents, ‚Äúi‚Äôm awake at 9:08‚Äù i‚Äôm so excited, i finally did something reasonable. i text again ‚Äúcan i keep my phone‚Äù my mom texts back ‚Äúi woke you up, and you didn‚Äôt take out the trash.‚Äù WHAT. i am LIVID at this, and i start texting about our deal we had, and basically my moms point is that she knocked on my door and ‚Äúwoke me up‚Äù but when i woke up she was long gone at work.

So i (21F) have an ex bf who's friends with a few of my friends and thats fine and all but anything related to him gives me extreme anxiety, similar to how i feel when im going to get a shot ( I have a phobia of needles ) My hands get sweaty and my breathing heavy, i feel dizzy, nauseous and overall just, not great. I know its an issue because I almost threw up talking about him to a friend ( he needed to send over stuff so i went through a friend and even that was too much )

Our breakup was messy and bad and we don't speak anymore and that's fine i just don't know how to function with my other friends as he's always, there. And i don't want to loose out of hanging out and gaming just because of my anxiety..

Its mostly online but i don't want to just leave all my discords and chats and completely remove MYSELF from everything just because he's there, should i just keep powering through the anxiety or should i take time away. Time away is what ive been doing but it's been getting worse. I genuinely don't know so any advice is helpful!

665,"My bf 23M and I 24F broke up a little over a month ago. He isolated me from everyone except him and told me my friends were all out to hurt me. Made me feel worthless. He also started fighting with me if I hung out with people. He convinced me they were in abusive relationships and I couldn't help them/ not to talk to them. I quietly left my friend group and didn't say why. He began threatening after that and I feared for my life. 

The threatened to rape me because I stopped sleeping with him and he knew I was abused in the past. He started sleeping with a weapon at night. He was highly manipulative but still a proud person in our community. His friends that knew though were afraid for my life/safety. He molested children (with proof) that was how I got out, because other people started believing me and them. 

My friends say that if I believed they were in abusive relationships I should have stepped in and warned them like they did for me. I feel ashamed and traumatized but also I feel like a shit friend. Someone please give me an outside view/advice or just tell me the harsh truth.

Edit: They were not in an abusive relationship but its more of a what would I have done if it were true. Am I the shit friend?

666,"For context, a couple of years ago I (F27) worked in a school teaching child A, child A was lovely, I never had an issue with her or her parents and it all worked out fine.

Cut to two years later I now have a different job, and I attend a socially distanced, silent, BLM protest in my local area. It was very peaceful and respectful (I suffer from severe anxiety and Bipolar so busy loud places would have triggered me, not that I believe any less in the cause, I just worried a larger protest would cause me MH issues) I attended the protest alone, and never advertised that I was going, or persuaded anyone else to go. 
My attendance has triggered Child A's father to attack me online.
I don't know how he found out I was there, I do not have him or any of his family as any social media friends, and my social media is locked down tight because parents often try to look me up online.
But he has now gone on a tyrade of hate, he has accused me of brainwashing children, and of purposefully getting Covid-19 and passing it on to children so their parents get sick. (I have not had covid-19, and I haven't been teaching so this isn't possible).

The advice I want to ask is; do I confront him about what he's saying, knowing he could use what I say against me in his hate campaign? This tyrade of abuse has sent me into a spiral and I've started self harming again, which I have been free of for 6 months.
Or, as I do I leave it alone and let him ware himself out until he finds something else to distract him?

669,"I work in a hotel as a receptionist, I was on a lunch break and my coworker called me over to speak to this customer. Apparently the dude used hotel's property for several hours yesterday, insisting on our new receptionist to use it. He claimed that he had no laptop or phone and even went as far as asking to use my coworker's phone. Today, my coworker unplugged the computer and when the same customer came over to ask for the same thing, she lied to him about the laptop not working and had trouble trying to deter him from using the hotel's property. I didn't know the context at the time and explained to him calmly that this was laptops property and we don't allow guest to use it. Long story short, the customer got infuriated that he got lied to and proceed to argue with us over the smallest of things and directly ridiculed our customers. He said things such as ""You think you're smart? ...."" or something along the lines, I cannot remember clearly as I was extremely tired at that point. However, what I do remember was I nearly cried after hearing all that. I proceeded to give him an address to a local coworking space with desktop computers that he could use, however he ignored it and continued to ridiculed both of us. Eventually a third staff came by, became really angry at the customer, slammed the table and dissed out much needed table. The customer eventually listened to what we had to say but that didn't stop him from giving us filthy looks.

The day after, he checked out of the room and we discovered he went to 2 other rooms in our hotel and grazed the surface of 2 very expensive TV with a knife. We leave the 2 room doors opened since our electrician were working on it. The wires on the TV were cut and the fans were also cut off. We were unable to get a camera recording of his actions and no photocopies of his passports were made. Overall, he got away with destroying 2 rooms, I'm still young and traumatized by the experience. I can't help but think of it and overall I'm affected by the insults he threw at me yesterday. I don't know what to do or how I can handle it. His messages were clear and I feel in danger whenever I think about it, I can't help but feel as if I just met a potential murderer.

670,"I moved to a new apartment a few months ago. There is a little boy who lives across from me; not sure how old he is, but he said he was going into the fourth grade. He started off as seeming normal, then one time when I was outside with my cat he came up and started screaming at my cat and I had to run after her because she went to hide. Then, about a week later, I was standing just outside my door with my cat. She was on a leash. He came up to us, began screaming at her again, and I opened my apartment door to let her escape him. He chased her into my apartment, chased her around until she hid under the couch, slammed the door of my bedroom and knocked things off my walls, and hid in my closet. He probably stayed inside for a total of 5 minutes. Throughout this time I had been telling him to leave. He just laughs and says no. At the time a woman who lived in his apartment with him was bringing in groceries from her car or something. I ran outside and said that her child was in my apartment... this made the kid run out and rejoin his mom. She didn‚Äôt seem too worried, I think she yelled at him not to do it. 

Then, yesterday morning, I was drinking coffee with someone I had over. Suddenly I hear a frantic knocking at the door. It‚Äôs that boy. He wanted to come in and see my cat. I said no and asked him to go away, said I had things to do, etc. For the next 10 minutes he knocked on the windows and door, stuck wrappers through the side of my window screen, and almost broke my window screen from pressing his face on it. My apartment is tiny so I closed the blinds but he knew we were inside and just kept yelling nonsense. I finally got sick of this (I mean, I had a guest over!!) and went outside to tell him off. Well, I had forgotten how fast he was ‚Äî he darted past me and into my apartment. Went and laid on my bed, almost knocked things off the wall again, etc. I tried to reason with him, asked where his mother was, nothing worked. I finally resorted to dragging him out of my apartment by the arm. He was almost as tall as me but still a kid, and I feel bad for using force on a kid that I don‚Äôt know, but he just wouldn‚Äôt leave and is such a menace. 

This morning he‚Äôs woken me up not once, but twice knocking on my door for 10-15 minutes each, turning the handle and banging on the windows. I can hear him yelling outside. I think he does this to other people too. It‚Äôs at the point where I hate him and I don‚Äôt feel safe leaving my door unlocked to run to my car ‚Äî what if he sees and runs in and does something to my cat?

672,"I spent years trying to get onto a course at university in the UK.  In 2018, I finally made it and by the start of 2019 I was studying at a University for my chosen course.

However, I'm currently in my second year of university.  The course I am currently doing is very intensive.  This means we have limited weeks off when compared to other university courses.  Not only this but the course is understaffed and there is a lack of communication from staff members and limited support in regards to this course.

During Covid, my mental health took a turn for the worse.  This was partly due to being extremely isolated and alone, and the extreme amounts of stress which my current course puts me through.  It is now clear to myself that I am failing my second year badly after failing an essay and having a bad placement period.  I'm concerned that either I'm going to be wasting my life on this course and I won't successfully complete it or this course is going to keep putting me in a downward spiral and may cause me to take my own life.

Recently, this concern has caused me to change certain aspects of my life.  I have also realized that this course is affecting my mental health more than anything.  The problem is that I'm now well into my second year.  This means that if I did drop out to do something else, I wouldn't get full finance to complete a different course and would therefore need to pay for my first year or two myself.  This would cost around ¬£10,000 for one year as far as I can tell which I certainly don't have.  On the other hand, I would miss out on the career I have worked hard to get towards, however, I think changing course would also make me happier and give me more options in the future.

So now, I'm unsure of what to do.  Any advice on this situation would be greatly appreciated.  I have missed out a lot of detail to not bore anyone reading and I'm unsure if the information I have missed out is important so I'll add it if it seems to be.  Sorry if it is difficult to read/ understand.  I wrote this in a hurry due to stress.

687,"Since November I‚Äôve had a number of online subscriptions that get renewed each month. I didn‚Äôt know overage charges were a thing and had about -30 dollars in my account that I was going to top up but had just forgot because I stopped my subscriptions and never buy anything else. For months those overage charges multiplied and I am now -2400 bucks. My account has been automatically closed but I am going to have to pay that 2400 back, the other problem is I am starting college this september. I just need to know how likely I am to recover from my mistakes before roughly January because thats when my fees are due. I need to make about 5400 dollars from now to then to cover my debt and fees. Ive started work at a job that pays minimum wage (14 bucks/hour) and get about 28 hours a week. I will only have that job until the second week of September so it will be enough to break even with my debts for the bank, but for my fees I will need to find a new job.

There is just a lot of uncertainty for me at the moment and I need to know from others if I am still in a recoverable position or of any tips on how I can help myself financially. If you have had a similar experience, weather it‚Äôs dealt woth or not, please share that too if you‚Äôre comfortable.

688,"Hello there!

I'm starting as a receptionist tomorrow and I'll have 12-hour shifts. I'm told that it can get immensely boring when there isn't anything to do or anyone to talk to and while I don't plan to use possible tips on the first day, I need some ideas further down the line.

I am a guy who gets bored of things easily so I need a few more ideas. Currently, I'm planning to bring a book, a booklet to draw in or write in and...well that's the farthest I got with ideas really! I'll be stuck to a chair for most of those 12 hours and while the building looks nice I don't want to spend my days looking at a wall. 

Does anyone have some similar ideas to what I wrote? I'm also into thinking about stuff like paradoxes or unsolved theories, maybe riddles...or just simply, philosophical quotes that are open to speculation.

my mom has been very supportive but to the point where she lived my life for me and i know thats not okay.  
my dad is a piece of shit and basically humiliated me publicly since i was a kid.  
hes called me stupid and every time i try to express my opinion or something i find interesting hes always laughed at me and called me an idiot.  
i loved drinking because it took away my anxiety but it cost me a lot.  
my license was suspended at 21 and because we hired a shitty attorney i think he made it worse.  
i havent had a drivers license in almost 8 years (im 28)  
i signed a plea deal that did more harm than good, the lawyer just took the money and ran.  
i only mention this because not driving has fucked me up a lot with being independent and ruining some job prospects. also i still live with my parents because i cant afford to live on my own and id rather just save money for now.  
i had a lot of friends back in the day but none now. people that know me keep me at a distance or think im a maniac so i dont have anyone my age to talk to.

i feel bad for disrupting her life and i dont think its fair to her.  
i cant talk to people anymore, i feel really odd and the opinions others have given me about myself make me afraid of saying the wrong things to people. so i dont associate with anyone anymore.

693,"So starting off, my wife stays at home everyday by herself. I am the sole breadwinner. I make a fairy decent income that is able to support the needs of both of us. She isn‚Äôt a stay at home mom yet. She really has nothing that she has to do during the day. We have no kids yet. We have one cat. So it‚Äôs not like she is having to juggle the responsibilities of watching kids and maintaining a house. She has never had a full time job in her life. After we were together and dating for a few years she quit her part time job and said that she wanted to be a stay at home mom shortly after we got married. We both talked about how much we wanted kids while we were dating, and were even planning on having them within a year of being married. I understood why she would want to quit her job so that she could prepare for this. She didn‚Äôt want to have any job she‚Äôd have to commit to while having to worry about getting pregnant and going through that. I was perfectly fine with this. I never pressured her into being a stay at home mom/wife as I wanted her to do whatever she thought was best with her. I would have been happy if she wanted to work too. 

We have been married for over a year now. Still no kids. And she has not even wanted to try for them. After getting married she kinda put that thought on the back burner. She had a long talk with me a few months into being married how we needed time to ourselves for a while and for it to be just us as a couple. I agreed even though this wasn‚Äôt the original plan. She has been on birth control since then. I figured that since there would be no kids to watch after that she would either pick up a part time job or do more work around the house, since she has no other obligations. Although this was on my mind I did not bring it up to her. At first it seemed like she would do a fair share of chores. I would say it was split about 50/50 then. After work I would come home to plenty of work that still needed to be done and I would usually be the one to cook or pick up dinner as well. I was even okay at this point as I knew it was only fair for me to do half of the work. 

Fast forward to about 3 months ago. My work had gotten really busy at this point and I was coming home even later. I noticed that less and less work was being done even though I was working more. I would say I was doing at least 70% of the chores and housework at this point. The only things that I knew that she did during the day was watch tv, go hang out with friends, visit her parents, and go shopping. I didn‚Äôt want to say anything at first because I didn‚Äôt want to upset her or anything. Around a week ago I finally snapped. She was doing less and less work each week. I finally told her that she needs to do more around the house, at least 50% of the work again as I have a full time job and am very tired when I get home. I said that since she doesn‚Äôt have a kid to watch after or a job herself that she should be able to have the house clean and dinner cooked at least sometimes. She got super upset and started crying and yelling at me me. She called me a sexist pig for saying that. Before I had the chance to say anything else she stormed out and went to her parents house to sleep that night. She came back the next morning. Her parents have told me that I need to apologize to her and that what I said was really humiliating and sexist towards her. I refused to. I have yet to apologize to her. We have barely said anything to each other since.

695,"I'm at a loss and having a big cross roads moment. I pride myself on being a good person to the ppoint it's annoying like protagonists in a TV show.   


I run a Pokemon Go Raiding Group. The group used to be on a social media pltrofm and the owner has shut it down. During this time, I got to running the physical raid routes and facilitating like I did in my old area. I was also making new friends at this time. I made friendly acquaintances with a few people that ended up coming down to two as people drift early on. All three of us met at the same time. These two started dating. Hetero Man andWoman, and me, a Gay man.  


I could tell the guy was off with me so I tried to distance myself, but I kept getting invited to the same place. There were supposed to be others there but they would ditch last minute. He would make low key comments about my race/nationality (was born here but raised elsewhere but moved back) and would make low key red-flag comments (asking if you thought he was hot, talking about being maly compared to you). It was fine though I jsut kept trying to distance.  


He kept acting (by saying) we were all friends, but I found out he complained to the owner of the group (who wasn't really there running things). I pointed out how other publcily posted how they thanked me for how I run things and it was just him (I even guessed it was him when she was trying to keep it anonymous which brought down the veil). Little did he know every time he complained It would be right after we all hung out. So he would be fine, then complain with childish nonsense like that everyone hated me and I was a jerk.  


Before this and before I got the bad vibes, there had been a few occasions where I was excited, and we were all running down the hill and I grabbed a few peoples hands (I wasn't the only one to do this) to jokingly skip down while saying ""Adventure Time"". Another time was when he kept making comments about masculinity (looking back this was abd but it was early on so at first I took it as a joke) and I went ""Oh I see, you don't (something) because y'all homophobic"" (JOKINGLY, in the way that it's done on Keele and Peele (seriously lookint up it's a joke). He freaked out at this because it was Pride Month (hadn't been to a Pride prior so actually didn't know myself despite bieng Gay). He said ""shh don't say that it's pride month I don't want people attacking me"" to which I said ""oh dude, it's a joke from a comedy sketch."" Now I can see he was freaked out because he truly was. Keep these two things in mind for later.  


Time goes on (fastforward to when he's mad ecomplaints, acts nice to my face but dead pan face when no one is right next to us) and I mentioned to the Woman once that I was uncomfortable   
around him, maybe it was in my head but that' I'd prefer not to be invited. they were just starting to date so I'd be uncomfortable being the third wheel anyways, and that obviously we'd all see each other, but if she organises and outing that there be a few people there. Outside of the Pokemon Go group, she had organised 2 or 3 more things and each time it ended just being the three of us (everyone seemed to not show).  


There were a few days I decided not to lead the Pokemon Go group to, and per usual, he would be all high energy at first like it was hs time to shine, acting liked he'd care just like achild trying to out do you, but then he'd go off ahead, not herd the whole group and jsut a few people so he was sorted. It's like he (like so many people) want to be the leader, but not do the work for the community. He goes off ahead and not everyone follows him and the gorup gets split. I follow someone else and whenever I was asked what we should do or where we should go, I said ""Whatever you think is best.""  


Well, homophobe guy (and again this will be more confirmed later and just what he is to me (actually he's so much worse since it's personal), kicks off, he walks away form the gorup and blows up at the end so no one can hear him, but in the distance he's yelling about it to the Woman, and they're both looking at each other then looking back at me. Later, the owner gets a complaint that I ran it deliberately away from him. Luckily someone confirmed otherwise. He just has it in for me.  


Anyways the woman and I fall out as newer acquaintances. We went to a Pogo event which was for 3 hours (for those that play pokemon go it was Community day). It's in the park, everyone meets at a certain time and then just walks around in a route. If you're late no worries because we'll be circling back. So I walk with the gorup. She was like 45 min-1 hour late. Because I kept checking and then eventually forgot because I was having fun she got pissed. I forgot for about half an hour, then realsied and so at this point we're half way through the event. So I start to text her and call her. She's not picking up, and leaving the messages on read. I wrote out that sorry you were so late I went on and assumed I'd bumped into her. Then, I left who I was hanging with and spent the rest of the event, and stayed an hour after because I was worried, trying to find her. I searched for her for 2 and a half hours. This was a Sunday. After work Monday, she calls me pissed about me ditching her. I told her I spent an hours trying to find her and he wansn't picking up the phone or answeting the texts. She said she didn't want to bother because she was pissed at that time. And I told her, ok fine, but so you were pissed after you were late for an hour, were supposed to be with the guy that day, he ditches you (for whatever reason may have been legit) and then when you show an hour later and I sdon't get to you in a half hour, you get mad. Now fine then and there you don't wanna talk to me, but it's a day and a half later and you're holding a grudge calling and yelling at me after I spent forever wondering if you got kidnapped or hit by a car or something. then she backtracks and says she can't deal with my issues with the guy and all this fighting and can't we all jsut hang out. Clearly him not showing up was something to do with our distaste for one another. I told her that that wasn't fair. I told her that we haven't known each other that long, I've only mentioned once that he made me unomfortable and that I wanted other people around. That them dating has nothing to do with me. I then went on to say but now we're on the topic, he's doing things that are damaging to me, so I don't have time to be dealing with him, and then keeping it myself ust to be criticised by you to force me to hang out with him.  


We hung out once after that where she was off, and then the last time she said she couldn't hang out and then shows up to where I invited her (another pokemon comm day) and acts standoffish. When I addressed it later she tried to turn it around like I wasn't her only friend, shedoesn't have time for me. I blew up, because I was done, and said this is you paying me back because you're mad about before. You told me you were too busy to hang out and come to this today and if you had time you'd be elsewhere with another friend, then you show up to this group and ignore me while I'm next to you. I cut ties.  


So the guy keeps brooding and I realise that I'm now planning my schedule on days he's not signing up to go, but then he signs up for more and more. I text him and say, "" hey I'm going on this day. I also see you're going, can we please go and just help the group out together. I've been really uncomfortable but I don't see why we can't go like we did initially and just have a good time with everyone."" He explodes instantly, and says ""you forced me yo hold your hand and make me uncomfortable don't touch me if you message me again I'm going to call the police."" WHAT!? So I said, I never forced him to hold my hand, don't message me either. This is what I mean, he's taken something that happened months before and we've seen eachother since then, I've been pressured to hang out with him because of the Woman, while when she's not looking he's wanted me to leave.  


So I message the admin and she asked me to send the texts. She puts us in a group chat to facilitate. I come at it every message with I try to run this group to help and most people like it, they've even said so publcily on the feedback, you've asked me to run it somedays too. Can we please just move forward and try to get along (which was hard for me). He then complains as before about me ""being a jerk"" and ""running it into the gorund"". When I refute it and provide the evidence (of literall member feedback), he then says ""oh well this was fixed when you addressed the complaint befoe"" to the admin. I question why it was brought up again. Then he says I was a jerk to him personally in front of people. I said when do I have the when I'm running it, and if that's the case who are these people. you keep saying these people see this but bring them forward to the admin. He then said again, ""well this was fixed when the admin addressed it last time.""  


When he couldn't get his way, he then did the thing which confirmed to me without a doubt he was a homophobe. He wrote a long message in whcih he accused me of.  


Multilple times forcing him to hold his hand.   
Trying to flirt with other member. He said this is not a dating ground and I shouldn't use it as such.  
Asking him out on a date and trying to turn him gay and not accepting he was gay. He then said he has gay friends so he's not homophobi .  
Calling him a homophobe multiple times in front of everyone and telling people he was a homophobe.  


Obviously based on what I've said above, he's lying outright, these things didn't happen, and he took the one tie from months back where a bunch of us did a silly hand hold thing and twisted it to ""I was always trying to hold his hand"". Wa'ts ironic is after the first woman, he started trying to go out with another woman. which is fine we are all adults people are gonna date, but you're accusing me of something that you're doing and it's coming from the clear fear of my being gay and you lying to extremes to damage someone just because you don't like them.  


I was distraught. I'm only paraphrasing what he's said. I saw it in the morning and was crying in a restroom at work. I couldn't hide it on my face. I was scared, embarassed, and no matter how hard I tried to stand my ground and not give up what I loved doing to a bully, but also being nice and inclusive to that bully, I was getting shoved so far down. He accused me of sexual harassment that didn't happen. As it is I'm not popular on the gay community because I actually call out the harassement that can happen and say that being gay, ro anyone gives us no excuse, same rules for all.  


The admin can't verfy either way at this point, so she temporarily bans us both for a month. He leaves the chat and gives us a big fuck you. syaing that It's being manipulated for my favour. I say ""While I strongly disgree with what has been said here and I will not tolerate this gross misrepresentation, I understand your position and respect your decision.""  


A month goes by and I get to go back, she even asked me to help lead it that day like normal and provide the live link if I was comfortable and I did. The next time I see him at an events, I look up and see it's him, and then look down at my phone. He goes ""Yeah that's right, fuck off."" while I was off to the side so no one else could hear.  
When it came time to start I was my extroverted self and he couldn't say anything because now if he did everyone would hear.  


Eventually he would sign up for every day but mayb came to two (that I know of). I wasn't at each event, but I was at a lot and he signed up often but then was a no show.  


Fast forward and right before quarantine I've been made an admin of the group. Other admins were named, but the owner asked me who should be admin, so it's all people I've recommeneded.  
She had stated she felt like not running it or paying for the platform, but was getting back into it so stayed admin.   
We kicked out some creepers that were disresepctful to woman (like sending nude pics and derogatory writing). There was one guy that was passive agressive and homophobic (over masculine talked down everything I said kept sending fmaboyant gif's whenever I did anything. Me and the orignal owner got in a disagreement because this person had never been to our group but again she wanted to keep the piece, but wanted me to apologise to him despite him turning everything I said into something perverted (I always say good juju for good luck and he found some urban dictionary crap in retaliation for being asked to delete a condom commercial he psoted that was urealted to pokemon). I stood my ground and took two whole days to send my response to the admin to be firm without enraged. I said I wouldn't tolerate being complicit to those who are the oppressor. I was made admin and some new person who is being perverted and blatantly disrespectful can say what he wants. He also sent a passive threate with a slurish gif to me and then messaged all the admins I was a perv. There was no misunderstanding, he was there to cause trouble. I said this may get me removed from the group or removed as admin, but I cannot allow this because if it was any other member we would shut it down.  


She actually apologisesd and said she'd close down her group as she didn't feel fit to run it (which was not my intention and shocking). Her platform has closed, the new guy wasn't allowed back in (pray he doesn't show in person), and I'm lef tin charge of this What's App Group until we make a Facebook.  
In reorganising, we made a seocnd what's app group to split up conversation topics (one was for active gaming the other for general chat and info).   


I removed the orignal homophobic guy when doing this (the one that went out with the woman mentioned above). I sat there and thought, ""I keep putting others first even to my detriment, but no, not anymore"".  


Here is my dilemna. One, he could find me in person and it could cause issues, a few days later he messaged me.   
On the one hand, I'm continuing an existing community, on the other, even prior to being admin I physically ran the thing and now what's left is a small portion (200 of 3.5 thousand) that I'm still running. Half of me wants to be the bigger superhero, but the other half knows as soon as he gets the chance he'll be a dick. I don't feel safe around him, and I'm sick of homophobes, discriminators, and just general bullies that are unsafe getting away with what they want.   
As far as I'm concerned, he can find another group to play with, despite all the crap he dragged me through, I kept trying to be inclusive both during and after what happened.   


I'm still struggling though, what do I do. Do I let him in but then make it harder to kick him out again. I cannot forgive what he did, even as time goes by, someone saying those things and trying to get me booted clearly shows he had issues and had ill intent, and that doesn't just go away. I'm always trying to do the right thing in general, but now that it's my own group, he's stated in his lies before he wanted to be away from me. Good, why must you go to the one group I'm in. Yeah you were in it for a while but you barely go. If he's the one that feels that way why follow a group I'm in (and now running).   


What's more, if I don't respond to his text, I know it's a matter of time before hefinds me in person and it's gone unaddressed, but me texting back will piss him off and cause a social fire where I don't feel safe. But I can't just roll over either.

I'm gonna keep talking in circles now. Someone please help.",23Jul2020,1

I've had a really toxic relationship that hurt me deeply. I was always stressed out. I thought once I left my parents home I could be normal. I thought I was until quaruntine hit. I started smoking a lot more during quaruntine (Mary Jane) but I spent so much time being stoned, that I did a lot of introspection rather than just chill. I realized I hate myself, no, I loathe myself, I also hate my life the way it is.

Even when I want to do something, I often physically can't get my body to do it. It's almost 7pm and I am still in my pajamas because I don't have the energy to shower. I find it very difficult to do my homework when my parents aren't watching over me and I live alone. That is no way to live.

I have suspected some form of depression and have had some suicidal thoughts. I started taking a new epilepsy medication that has depression and thoughts of suicide as side effects and at first (in march) I thought it was just going to fade out but it hasn't. I am not at all planning suicide, I know that I would just cause lots of other people pain. But I still think about my own death at least once a week.

I am scared of testing another medicine because my mother tried like 30 different rheumatism medicines for ca 6 months in 2016/2017 and ended up attempting suicide and living in a mental hospital. She is fine now but I still get flashbacks and am terrified that that will happen to me.

What do I do? How do I battle something that I think is depression? How can I be proud of myself? because currently I am not.

Thank you.

725,"TLDR:  We can no longer care for a stray mother cat and her 5 kittens. They are starting a flea infestation and hide in small spaces, making it difficult to catch them. 

Less than 2 months ago, a mother cat started roaming and sleeping in our backyard. She would approach us, and we would give her food and water, being that she looked thin and we live in 100+ degree heat. 
A week later, she brought over one kitten, then another. One day we went outside to find THREE more smaller kittens that were nursing on her. 
Our plan was to spay/neuter them. But even in this short amount of time, it has become too much for us to care after. Even getting one cat sterilized and vaccinated is pricey for us. 

The major issue now is that they have started a flea issue in our backyard. We washed every kitten and applied topical flea treatment on the first (older) cats. We clean both inside and outside every single day, but fleas keep showing up. As the kittens keep growing, they hide under small spaces and are so difficult to catch. 

I can't think of any friends or family that would be willing to take them. It also pains us to separate them from their mom. Animal shelters in town seem to be strict about their stray intake requirements. 

Edit: Animal control only does TSR (Trap, Spay, Released to original habitat)

731,"Okay so I‚Äôve been in a relationship with this girl for about a year and a half, we were friends for 4 years before we began our relationship but we never crossed that super personal barrier (so I wouldn‚Äôt go as far as saying she was one of my best friends, just a friend) up until we started dating. 

How do I begin? Well, my girlfriend has never given me a reason not to trust her, I just simply‚Äîdon‚Äôt. And I know that sounds like such an asshole thing to say but there is no other way to say it really. This is my first ever serious relationship and I feel like I‚Äôm fucking it up because I can‚Äôt bring myself to confide in her to stay loyal, to not lie to me, etc. I grew up around more toxic couples than you can imagine, starting with my parents of course. Lies and more lies and cheating and domestic-abuse and more lies. And I have always been the biggest preacher of not letting your past determine your future but it‚Äôs easier to say than to do.  I genuinely question anything anyone says or claims ever and it drives me insane sometimes how much I don‚Äôt trust people. (In case you‚Äôre wondering I have trusted people in my life but the ones I trusted most stabbed me in the back and as a result I lost some of my ‚Äúclosest‚Äù friends). Anyway, I think I just can‚Äôt afford to have my heart broken because I was ‚Äúnaive‚Äù or ‚Äúgave my trust away‚Äù. I guess I‚Äôm just trying to save myself from heartache because I know the only person I will end up blaming is myself. And she doesn‚Äôt deserve me constantly being suspicious of things or second guessing her words. 

Now, here is where I become more of an asshole. Recently she experienced a loss in her distant family who lives in another country, her mother is there visiting at the time of the occurrence on her own so she told me she might need to head out there to be there for her. Which I completely understand 100%. She isn‚Äôt so distraught herself because I‚Äôm assuming this was a distant family member of hers and maybe that‚Äôs why she doesn‚Äôt seem to be grieving so profoundly. The only thing is I immediately got anxiety over thinking she was heading there. Knowing she has an ex there, and some dude that continuously tried to get with her (which she said she told him to back off when she was there last year and let him know that she‚Äôs in a relationship). The thing is last year her ex still came to her house yelling out her name in the middle of the night. That led me to think that she had some unfinished business and ... I am not down for that. It resulted in us having various talks over the situation and she reassured me that nothing happened. To which I had to swallow all of my doubt because I‚Äôm trying to grow right? I‚Äôm trying to ‚Äútrust‚Äù. 
But now that it‚Äôs happening again I don‚Äôt know what to do or feel. I know that it is not about me right now, and I‚Äôm not trying to make it about me which is why I have not expressed this to her. But how do I deal with it myself? I‚Äôm tired of being this way.",23Jul2020,1

733,"Ok so im 14(M) and my sister is 20. Due to COVID she decided to come back to live with us for the time being. Anyway, about a year ago I got a PS4 as a gift from her, my mum and my other sister. No one ever touched the PS4 and I just played on it when I wanted to tbh. A few weeks ago when she came to stay over I offered her to play one of my games (Apex Legends). Its a very easy multiplayer game when you start because it matches you with other new players. 

She played on her own PS4 account I made. She played for quite some time and enjoyed it,   which made me very happy of course, but she started asking me to play more and more, which I still honestly didn't mind. But as time passed and she got more ""attached"" to this game she played for wayyy too long, and wayyy to long means longer than me, as in 5-6 hours leaving me to play at night, which I dont mind but I have online classes which I have to wake up early for.

 She doesn't have a job right now and no homework. So one day I started playing at ""her time"" which is day time and only 1 hour in she asked me to play. I said no since I dont get to play long because of going to sleep early because of school, and I haven't played with my friends for 3 days (keep in mind she doesnt have any friends on PS4). She then started complaining she has nothing to do then I just sighed and carried on playing with my friends. About 30 mins later she starts being annoying like putting on a weird face and laughing whenever I die in game (which I dont do to her). I just dont care about it and carry on playing, while she just watches. Then my other sister walks in and she asked my sister wtf are you doing and she starts complaining. I get off the ps4 and let her play for the rest of the day, leaving my friends.

 Now its night time and I get online to see if my friends are still on, which they are. About 20 mins of me playing and she asks if she can play. bruh. I say play later. She asks when im going off and then she sayd ohh you're going off at this time right which is sooo long. I get angry but dont say anything. Lately shes been playing for too long and im a type of player that if I dont play for some time I begin to suck. And my game lobbies are filled with REALLY GOOD PLAYERS, WHILE HERS IS FULL OF NOOBS. How do I tell my sister it's my PS4 and my hobby, I can go on whenever I want and she should go buy her own PS4.  Also, the PS4 is in the living room so whenever visitors come she forces me off it to watch lame youtube videos with the visitors in hope to try entertain them. SURPRISE, they get bored and leave. I always say you should've let them play a game or asked what they wanted to watch but she tells me to shut up. 

I really dont know what to do anymore how do I tell her nicely or do I even tell her nicely to PISS OFF ITS MY PS4, YOU DONT CONTROL IT WHEN PEOPLE COME AND YOU SHOULDNT BE PLAYING FOR SO LONG YOUR 20 GODDAMNIT AND YOU DONT HAVE A JOB OR WORK TO DO YOU JUST SIT AROUND ALL DAY.

735,"I've been in a ldr with my boyfriend for almost a year now. My bf suffers with terrible anxiety and depression. My own mental health has never been the greatest, although I've never been diagnosed with something due to the fact that I've never really spoken to anyone about how I'm feeling except for him. He's been having a pretty rough time with corona going on because it has caused our schedules to become rather different from what they used to be. For him, it has freed up time throughout the entire day, but for me, has caused my schedule to become busier with work and having to now be home with my family where I'm required to help out around the house on and off throughout the day. My boyfriend, although he refuses to talk about it, exhibits clear signs of relationship anxiety. He's clingy and can become upset when I don't text/call him, despite telling him I'm busy and will get back to him. He gets upset with me at times if I'm talking to other people because to him, it seems like I don't want to be talking to him. He also strongly believes we have to do pretty much everything together. Despite me saying all of this, that's not even the biggest problem here. Lately, I've been having a rough time myself (in terms of mental health). The combination of my own feelings and being worried about him have been having their toll on me. My boyfriend is normally very caring in the sense that if I tell him something is wrong, he'll insist I tell him and allow him to do whatever he possibly can to make things better, no matter how he's feeling in the moment. The past couple of weeks or so however, I've been worried to even tell him what I'm feeling because he somehow manages to make things about him. Here are a few examples:

\- The other day, I had a bad panic attack. I was nowhere near my phone and could not be bothered to find it because I was in a terrible state and not thinking clearly. Later that day, when I called my bf and told him of this occurrence, his first response was to become upset with me because I didn't come to him while it was happening since we're ""supposed to be in everything together.""

\- I've tried to handle my feelings about my bf and his own struggles with mental illness differently only to be met with negativity. Being that I love him, it's difficult to not become sad when I see him in the states he has been in, but I do know that I have to take care of my own mental health too and stay strong for him. As a result, in the past, I've tried to not be as sensitive (not becoming apparently upset) when he brings up his own worries. His response to this was that he feels as though I don't care and he'd much prefer it if I did show I was upset with him. After that, I decided I'd stop hiding my emotions and let him know of how I felt. His response was to take blame for everything and tell me he's the only cause of my bad feelings (he's not).

\- Up until this morning, I was having a hard time because my family said some hurtful things to me and it really brought my mood down, leaving me in tears. Shortly after, I saw a message from him and responded, clearly upset, to which he took blame for once again, despite it, at that moment, having absolutely nothing to do with him.

\- He can be really difficult at times to communicate with and despite me asking what's upsetting him continuously, he tells me it doesn't matter and that I don't care anyway. When I tell him how saddening it is to hear him say that when I really do care, he takes personal blame for it.

This entire post was probably a mess and I'm sorry about that because I'm in a rush but I'm really overwhelmed at this point. While I know his anxiety and depression play a huge role in all this, at times it almost feels emotionally manipulative and I want to know what others think. On different occasions, I've brought up us taking a break or not being together for him to figure things out (I want to be here with him while he does so but sometimes that seems like it will only make things worse) but he's told me that this relationship is the only thing keeping him going. He had a really rough childhood and I know he has brought a lot of the fear from that into our relationship too so I don't want to be too hard on him because I know that is not his fault. I'm just tired of him managing to turn every situation - even those that have nothing to do with him - into something about him. I could really use some advice.",23Jul2020,1

My GFs mom is really offended and is calling us stupid for ""shipping"" my GF's daughter to her father who tested false positive (recently he told us he came out negative for blood work but positive for antibodies) because she's going to come back sick and infect us all. I don't understand my GF's mom's logic, she invited her nieces and nephews over to stay for 4th of July (4 extra kids of unknown origins!) and then stacks an entire family from PA (5 people, two adults). 

Our logic was that her daughter would have space to breathe and play as she pleases without having to be in this now densely packed home. With her father, it's just two people vs this giant cluster fuck.

748,"This is not supposed to be for upvotes or attention, I‚Äôm just venting and hoping for some kind of support I guess. It helps to write about it.

I‚Äôm 23 and have lived with my dad my whole life to take care of him, he‚Äôs 58. About a week ago I found him on the floor in the garage late at night, he was confused as to what had happened. I immediately told my girlfriend to call 911. He was saying he got ran over by a truck and I had to keep reminding him that he probably just had a bad fall. He had been exhibiting signs of memory and mental problems weeks prior to the fall which made me very concerned. 

The ambulance came and picked him up, and due to covid they didn‚Äôt allow visitors, but I got updates on the phone from doctors and got to talk to him, in his confused state. They ran MRIs EKG, CT scans and the whole bit. Nothing out of the ordinary besides a bad UTI, which apparently can cause mental delusions in elderly people. So I had hope a week ago. Then I got a call saying they brought him back from a cardiac arrest. His blood pressure has been crazy since then and his kidneys completely shut down so they put him on infusions and dialysis. He‚Äôs in the ICU after the cardiac arrest. 

So with the dialysis and infusions and feeding tubes and intensive blood pressure management, he made some slight improvements, which brought me back to having hope. But I know he was just suffering and that all of this treatment wasn‚Äôt a long term solution. So he decided to tell them to just pull the plug, in his will he has control and consent to tell them to stop treating his issues. So they took out all of the treatment after our last visit yesterday. And they said they don‚Äôt know how long it will be until he passes, so he‚Äôs on a comfort plan where i‚Äôm assuming they just pump him full of pain and sleeping medications until he‚Äôs passed on. 

I‚Äôm waiting for that phone call to tell me the news. This has all been very difficult for me at such a young age, but I know people have it worse. It‚Äôs just hard. He told me in the hospital that it‚Äôs okay and that there‚Äôs no worries in death because death is the absence of worry, and he told me his last words to me which were, ‚Äúcelebrate my death and spread love, i‚Äôll talk to you every day from where I go‚Äù 

He‚Äôs always been a very tough man, and never slipped up when taking care of me and his other family. He was my rock, always on top of everything, he took the burden of stress so that I and my family could have a good life. And still when leaving this world, he maintained that same strength and even laughed about it and joked around about having a cold beer and a cigarette when he gets to heaven. 

I‚Äôve experienced friends dying, and I‚Äôve witnessed a gruesome death in person as someone died in my arms after getting ran over by a large truck, but it doesn‚Äôt even slightly compare to my dad dying. I don‚Äôt even know how to process what‚Äôs happening. I have to deal with the will, the attorneys, getting into all his bank accounts, figuring out his estate and debts and how everything will be handled. I have a drinking problem and i‚Äôve been indulging in escapism constantly. I don‚Äôt cry in front of others but when I‚Äôm alone I completely break down. I just don‚Äôt even know where to go in life, he was my guide and my mentor, he was so great and intelligent and wise, steadfast and strong, he was the leader I always needed. Without him there‚Äôs a huge emptiness in my being. 

I don‚Äôt really know what else to say, other than expressing my hurt, even though he wants me to be happy and celebrate his death and his life it‚Äôs still difficult to even comprehend anything that‚Äôs happening. I‚Äôm having a lot of mental issues and dissociation, everything just feels like it‚Äôs falling apart. Other people in my life are there for me but they don‚Äôt really know what to say to me that helps and it feels like they don‚Äôt understand my loss.",23Jul2020,5

750,"My last partner suffered from what I believed to be undiagnosed depression. We dated for two years and we spent a lot of time together, several people on my own family suffer from this mental illness so I've grown use to the symptoms and habits it can create. 

Since we first started dating he had always been kind to me, and when we got farther in our relationship everything started coming out. He wanted to kill himself, he thought about it a lot in excruciating detail. There was days he felt worthless, days he just felt numb and physically couldn't bring himself to go to work and had to call in sick. Everyday he'd tell me these things and I encouraged him to get help, or talk to a professional as they could actually give him helpful advice. He refused and said he didn't need any help, and that he only needed me.

I'm an essential worker and everyday when I'd be coming home from my shift I'd have all these texts on my phone, about how he needed me, and that I was the only thing he found worth living for even though his family loves him dearly. (He has a very good relationship with his family.) He started depending on me which was terrifying, I didn't know how to help. He was older than me, nineteen and I'm just about to turn eighteen.

We continued on in our relationship like this until i didn't feel attraction anymore, it was like caring for him everyday. He constantly needed me and I understand to an extent why, but he refused to go and see medical help and it was frustrating. I cut the cord eventually and told him I wouldn't like to date him anymore, to please seek professional help and find himself. He was erratic, screaming about how I was the only thing keeping him going. How it didn't make any sense why we we're breaking up when we were so happy. I wasn't happy. 

I care for my elderly Granny as she has no-one else, I make all her meals and help her with daily jobs like showering and getting ready to bed. When dating this person i found it difficult to care for my Granny fully because I was worried about if he was hurting himself. He always expressed distaste when I told him I'd be with my Granny looking after her instead of being with him. 

Earlier on this week I came across his reddit, and there was several posts about how he had attempted suicide and was blaming it on me, and that everything was my fault. I feel like shit. 

For some extra context I was fine supporting him and trying to help him with the additional help of his family. He eventually just laid everything on me and I didn't know how to help at all, he'd put me into positions where I'd phone in to work saying I'm ill when in reality I felt forced to stay with him in case he hurt himself. We spoke about getting him medical help numerous times but he'd refuse and say he didn't need any, and that he'd only ever need me. I spoke to his other friends vaguely about his mood swings and how he spoke and they said he'd never mentioned anything or spoke to them about these things, and seemed independent. 

I know it was probably an asshole thing to do but I honestly felt so suffocated and crushed by him, he was very much dependent on me. Christ I'm such a  asshole",23Jul2020,2

753,"There's this close friend I currently have whom I've grown up with throughout my high school years and further in my adult life, we've worked in the same office, field and share interest etc.

Late 2019 and during 2020 I started to increasingly notice that we might not really be close friends but just share a close business relationship for opportunities and self improvement, Its like they changed overnight (you know that one friend who's often afraid to try and need a push or a link? Yes, that's been them). 

So here is where the fall deepens. One of my exes constantly tries to reach out to me but I try my best to keep my distance because I've moved on from that relationship and I want new experiences, however this friend would often mention my ex directly or indirectly knowing how I feel. Last month I told them to stop because it's somewhat triggering and I asked if they'd like me to update them on everything their ex is doing or messages sent from the same asking about them and 'no' was their reply. I got more pissed because the same day I ran into this friend's ex and didn't bring them up in conversation because I was thinking about this friend's peace of mind. Fast forward to July this friend again indirectly mentioned my ex then again directly in two messages and I just went MIA.

After a week of silence this friend sends me a message, ""can we talk"" I confirmed yes only to get a call asking to use my links to do business I got annoyed again but helped anyway, however, throughout the process I got whiffs of bossy disrespect like them; not showing up to close the transaction and saying last minute we should reschedule when I'm already at the meeting place, trying to bend me to their time when they're ready to move and some other jabs via our texts like, 'hey, email sent and I'm going to bed'...'keep sleeping, I'm going to work' or when I missed a call, 'answer the phone when I'm calling'. We use sarcasm a lot but those responses felt different especially when I didn't laugh.

I wrote all that to ask, what do you guys think the best action is; to bring up these points again with them or just throw on my baby powder and ghost...also am I taking things too seriously?

756,"For context, I‚Äôm a 19yo male attending college in a city away from home, and I was staying in one room of a house for cheap while looking for a job and a nicer place. I had one roommate, K (21yo male, from another major city near this one) who I previously didn‚Äôt know that well.

A few weeks ago, I went home for a week to spend time with my family. A couple days after I left, the house I was staying at was broken into because one of the other tenants left the yard gate open after they parked their car. The thieves smashed through the window of those tenants‚Äô room and proceeded to loot the house.

They got into our room, and ended up stealing my toolkit, my safe, my gaming controller, two pairs of K‚Äôs shoes, his speaker, and an old wallet K had that only had his social security card in.

I let K know right away, and immediately drove over to survey the damage. The room was a mess: our belongings were scattered everywhere. That was when I noticed what was stolen, both mine and his (I figured out what was stolen from him by sending him pictures of the room and because he asked me to look for particular items).

We were both upset, and I thought we would just have to deal with it. But then, a few days later, K messaged me. He said that the whole thing was my fault, that I must‚Äôve left the door unlocked on our room and that was how the thieves got to our stuff. He demanded that I pay him for his lost items, even going so far as to try to guilt trip me into giving him the money. I told him that I thought I remembered locking the door and that, since I had stuff stolen too, and since the thieves got in because of the other tenants, I wasn‚Äôt at fault. I also informed him that the day I headed down there, I found that even when the door was ‚Äúlocked,‚Äù it could still be pushed open. I tried as hard as I could to close it, and I had my gf try too.

Since then, he‚Äôs been badgering me and trying to manipulate me into giving him money. I‚Äôve talked to my gf, my older brother, everyone I can think of, and they all think K is in the wrong for asking me, but I can‚Äôt get past it.

Am I in the wrong? Should I give him the money?

I am 25 years old and have been struggling to fall and stay asleep for some time. 3 or 4 times a week, I lie in bed for a few hours before falling asleep. Those nights, I probably average a solid 4 or 5 hours of sleep. I am a medical student and was a pre-med athlete in college, so unfortunately late bedtimes have been a part of the routine for some time and probably will continue to be in the future.

771,"I (F25) have been struggling recently with feeling left out with my friends. 

Growing up I always had great self-confidence I was great at making friends and was generally very happy, though I also enjoyed a lot of time to myself (colouring or on my game boy) I still had very good friendships and often went out with my friends. I participated in many clubs (drama, orchestra, football, tabletop gaming) and had friends from these too. 

When I was 10 my Mum remarried and when I went to high-school (UK) I was very upset as we had to move to my Step-Dad's area and I lost contact with all my childhood friends and was very worried about making new friends starting high school on my own.

In my primary school, there were only 8 girls in my year and about 20 boys, because of this (and the lack of puberty) we were very mixed, but my main friends, the ones I'd hang out with outside of school and went on camping holidays with, were boys.

After Facebook happened many of my childhood friends added me, but we never really got back on touch properly. Despite this, it was nice to see their posts, what they were up to. I was pleased to see that even in high school, this was how I found that they had no issues being friends with girls, even through puberty.

Luckily things went well for me in high school, despite my worries I fit in well, though I wasn't popular I got on with everyone and could happily hang out with most groups. It wasn't until I was about 16 I found a group I really got on well with, they had had basically the same childhood as I did and many of the same experiences and hobbies. (there were about 7 of them in this group) 
For 3 years hanging out with them was pretty great, unfortunately there were certain times I felt left out, I believe the cause of this was that they were all boys.

They would frequently hold get togethers where I was the only one not invited.

At first they said it was due to it being a tradition as they'd grown up on the same street and had been friends since they were 4, which I completely understood and despite being a bit disappointed didn't question it further.

The first time I really thought something was an issue, was when a new friend ""Charlie"" became close to the friendship group, but despite also not growing up on the same street... Was invited to these get togethers that I was not allowed to. The new friend was a male.

I decided to not make much of a fuss about it, but this was partly due to developing a crush on ""Fred"" and not wanting to cause a scene.

Within 3 months Fred and I started dating and our relationship together was great. Personally I have always felt uncomfortable with PDA, so if we were both around the others we still treated each other pretty much the same as we had before we started dating.

Unfortunately this is also were it became more obvious that the group did not feel as close friends to me, as I felt to them.

It turns out they had a group chat, that I wasn't included in, that did include Charlie. Fred accidentally mentioned it in front of me and was visably regretful of this.

Originally his reason was that they were all on IPhone and as I was on Android i couldn't join the chat, so I said fair enough and continued messaging each of my friend individually.

About a year later they decide to set up a Facebook group chat, I was invited to it and it was lots of fun and was largely exactly what I would speak to them about in private messages anyway, game releases, arranging to meet up, discussing armour set, deciding what to play online together, general daily chat and I was really happy.

Unfortunately it turned out they'd also created another chat, which was exactly the same, without me. When I first found out I just assumed it was for talking about the game si didn't play, but then ""Kevin"" got a girlfriend and she was very hostile towards me, though it has never been spoken about it seems that she has banned him from contacting me, any contact from him is now through her.

The other told Kevin she seemed very controlling (in many other aspects, what he can wear, when he can play games, when he can go out) but he brushed it off.

After this everything went down hill very fast, they completely stopped speaking in the chat I was in, only speaking other chat, arranging meals and nights out without telling me, or if they did they'd claim it was a ""traditional"" meal so it was only them going.

I seem to have now been completely pushed out of ""friend"" position and into ""Fred's girlfriend"" position.

Unfortunately I had very bad depression last year and that made things seems even worse.

It has now reached the point where I feel like I have no close friends, I have friends from work, we hang out sometimes, but we are very different and in to very different things.

My self-confidence has taken a massive hit and so I don't feel up to attending any clubs or activities, partly because I'm scared that being the only girl, I'll end up getting outcast again.

Does anyone have any suggestions on how to deal with this overwhelming loneliness?

It feels especially bad when they did an online watch party today for the Xbox Showcase, despite me also being very excited for it, but Fred being right next to me on a headset in party with them all discussing it and asking me to shush whenever I tried to mention anything about it and turning down the TV volume so I could barely hear it, so that Fred could properly hear the watch party version.

I've tried hosting table top gaming nights with them all, buying and arranging it all myself and many other similar things, but it is so exhausting when I am the only one putting in the effort.

I have spoken to them about it and they all say I'm still their friend, there was a point, while I was depressed, that I was devestated sobbing wondering what I was doing wrong to not be good enough and begged Fred to speak to them about what I need to do differently (he was going to a ""traditional"" meal) and when he genuinely approached them with it, they all apparently got uncomfortable and just played it off.

Im beginning to get bitter about Fred not taking this seriously or being insensitive or not understanding how upsetting it is to me when he is in the same room as me, playing games I'd love to play with him, being forced to watch in silence as he's playing with the others all in a group together on headset.

It's made me largely give up gaming as I cannot even explain how painful it is to be playing the same game in the same server right next to someone in the same room and still not be included.

Any suggestions on what I should do differently or any suggestions on how to change my mindset on this issue would be greatly appreciated.


Edit: Fred and I have now been together for 8 years and live together, my absolute best friend is female, I met her on my first day in high school and we just got on amazing, we're still very close, but she lives 3 hours away. Wiht both our schedules it's difficult to meet up and hang out, especially as she isn't into gaming so we can't hang out online.


TL;DR Feel like my close friends don't want to be friends with me because I'm a girl, I can't keep being the only one putting effort into the friendship, but it's made a lot harder by one of them being my long term partner (we were friends for years first)",23Jul2020,1
772,"Hey,

I'm pretty lost at the moment. I've been struggling with tonsil stones since I was a kid. I've tried every single remedy that I could find but the stones and bad breath has only gotten worse. It has gotten to the point where nearly everyone around me can't even be within 3 feet of me and my bosses, classmates and teachers have ridiculed me about my bad breath. I'm terrified of speaking to new people, or just being in close proximity to another person in general. I feel like people think I'm really gross and disgusting. I finally talked to my PCP about removing them, and she referred me to an ENT who said that he could take them out. 

I just don't know how I can afford it. I'm a broke college kid, so I'm kinda new to healthcare/insurance stuff and I honestly don't know what steps I should take from here. From what I've been reading online the average cost of a tonsillectomy in my area is around $2000-$3800, and I'll likely be paying the total costs myself since its an elective procedure.

774,"This will be a long one. Hoping this reaches out to someone kind enough to read and reply with non-judgment.

I am currently 20, and for the past 10 years I have been holding in the truth about my past to all of the friends that are closest to me. I was born in Poland, and when I was 4 I moved with my mother away from my abusive father to start a new life in Scotland, UK. I knew no English, but was lucky enough to be immediately placed into excellent primary education as soon as we landed. I soon enough learnt English over the course of the next few years, with the help of the school and my mother who taught me off her experience working as an English teacher. Our years to begin with upon moving consisted of my mother re-marrying and divorcing in the first 3 years, and with no solid father figure in my life, I grew to become very introverted all through my childhood and into late-teens and adulthood. My mother eventually found love again in my step-father who took upon the stable father role that I was missing in my life up to that point.

At 11 years of age, myself, my mother, and my step-father all moved away to the next city over to start afresh again. I was very reluctant to move yet again, I had grown close to the people I had gone to school with and was ready to enter secondary education and continue in what seemed like the next obvious chapter in my life. Having to move and start in a new school again took a toll on my mental health, and I went into the move extremely insecure of myself. I was ashamed of my ethnic background due to bullying and discrimination I had received in school. When meeting new people in secondary school, I was not transparent about where I was born or my situation with my father. I stupidly thought that I would be able to navigate socially a lot easier if I made out I was born and raised in the UK. This eventually spiraled out of control, to the point where since telling the lie, I have been battling with extreme depression and every possible negative emotion under the sun.

Today I sent her a message asking her if she was ready to talk. She replied saying she felt awful but she doesn‚Äôt wanna lie to me and didn‚Äôt know what to say because she doesn‚Äôt feel the same way.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. The last few months have been some of the worst in my life and the hope of being with her has been the only thing going for me.

I was in the washroom for a while (which yes, I was in the wrong) but as I stated it was a panic attack and I wasn‚Äôt really pay attention to the time. I came out of the bathroom and was bombarded with question. She asked why I was in so long and after I told her, I was asked what was happening. I told her it was personal (which is was, she has no need to know) and she continued to ask and pry another 3 times until she finally gave up. Another time, she offered all of the female employees to travel over to the next town to pick up supplies and I wasn‚Äôt offered at all. She gets mad at me for doing nothing (it‚Äôs a theatre so In the day there isn‚Äôt anything to do after the cleaning) and yet all the girls are sat around a table talking and texting on theirs phones.

784,"My SO and I are best friends and have been together for about 3 years now. I actually see myself spending the rest of our lives together. I currently live in my parents house while I wait for the fall semester to begin. My parents and I are polar opposites and I tend to avoid them at all costs. My mother is emotionally manipulative, is a major cause of my body issues, and is a constant source for anxiety and stress. My SO especially hates my mother and her side of the family for how they treat me. SO want's nothing to do with them, but I am still not financially independent and won't be for at least another 6-10 months. I will be graduating in a year, then I will be able to move in with my SO.

 After moving back in for school, I never see myself moving back in with my parents. Ideally, I will spend my adult life working and living with my SO. I had planned on limiting family visits to only holidays. I **do** want to partially cut my family out of the picture, but I am not yet in the situation where I am able to. I agree with my SO that I need to get myself out of this situation. I need advice on how to continue my loving relationship with my SO, while helping him understand that I do not yet have the capacity to leave without it being very traumatic for myself. Also, any advice on cutting off unhealthy familial relationships would be appreciated.

Side Note: I have started to call out my parents for the things they say and how they negatively effect me. There is no physical abuse or anything to warrant serious intervention. I only fear that there would be lasting backlash from the family if I were to abruptly leave instead of gradually 

TL;DR: My SO hates my parents and my moms side of the family who are emotionally abusive.

A few weeks ago she told me that I saved her and if it wasn't for me she doesn't think she would still be here, while I appreciate it's a nice thing for her to say and I'm grateful I've had that sort of impact on her I feel like that sort of statement puts a huge amount of pressure on me that I don't think she realizes. I don't have any plans on breaking up with her or anything at the moment because like I said I love her a lot, but I don't know how things could end up in the future and I feel like her saying that might make future decisions even harder for me.

I don't want to bring it up to her because it's going to make her feel terrible which will just fuel into the depression even more. She's 21 and I'm 24, this is also my first relationship so it might be why I'm struggling with this situation more than others might.

788,"Okay, this will require some background, I'll keep it brief as possible:

15 years ago I fell hard for a girl. 6 months into our relationship a friend helped me see how she was emotionally abusing and manipulating me. I also found out she was  seeing other guys. I broke up with her and that's when her crazy was unleashed. On top of stalking me she hit me with her car and drove away laughing. I was fortunate to not have more then a sprained ankle, cuts and bruises from it.

I got a restraining order against her. The judge quickly issued a restraining order. And one night after screaming at me outside of my apartment the police arrested her for violating the order. I have ever been in and I have never spoken to, or seen her since.

Fast forward to today, I work closely with our Customer Service manager and she mentioned that she has a new employee training in. I usually introduce myself to new people but when the CSM told me the employees name, I realized this is my psycho ex from 15 years ago. Since then I have been in my office trying not to freak out . I don't feel like this is coincidence.

793,"Hi friends, if anyone is out there who feels similarly or has any perspective to share it would be greatly appreciated!!

Brief background:

Because of our dear friend covid, it seems there are not many places hiring for student-friendly part-time jobs in my area. I have been looking for the past couple of months for a restaurant job, but have not been able to find much. I am not surprised, as I only have one year of fast food experience- so there are plenty of people who are more experienced/desirable than me.

I keep feeling guilty that I am not currently working right now, and am worried that I am ""wasting"" this time. I have already worked fast food and there is not much else I could learn from fast food, so I am not applying to the fast food places which are hiring, because I keep feeling like my summer plans should be enhancing my life.  I would rather be more strategic with what I invest my time into. Opportunity cost of not working is not a big problem as I am in a co-op program in university (so I will already be working for part of the year) and I also live with my family and don't pay rent.

I have thought about taking up a new hobby, doing some more reading, and just plainly doing things that I enjoy... but I may be stuck in analysis paralysis, as every option feels like it is not the most productive use of my time, and I cannot figure out what to do for the rest of the summer. People have said to me that I should just relax and take it easy, and that I work too much. I keep feeling like I am a bum if I don't work, and I feel like I should still be open to working fast food again even though I don't think it would be optimal at this stage for personal development. 

My main questions:

1) Am I justified in thinking that I absolutely should be working right now? Should I focus on hobbies, or work (keep looking for jobs and apply to fast food which I don't want to do)? I know a lot of people are unemployed right now due to covid, but is it really that many people? Maybe I am one of the few who are not working right now?

2) What are some other ways I can develop myself during the summer? I have made a coursera account and am exploring some subjects, but I don't know if learning about philosophy is really that productive of an activity as it will not do much for me in real life. 

Are there any other university students in the same situation? What have you guys been up to this summer? Cheers",23Jul2020,2
794,"As a child I was very curious, I soon found out my love for math, then science and finally my biggest love of all... Physics, at primary school. I was never the ""best student in class"", I didn't even care about it. I just wanted to hear the teacher talking about physics in class. I wished to have physics to do physics every day. However, I didn't study when I walked home, I only watched videos on youtube (for physics mainly, and gaming) and played video games.

I didn't give a damn about the world around me. I just did whatever I loved, without any worries of being good at it or being famous one day for being very good at it. I didn't have to prove anything to anyone, and most importantly I didn't have to prove anything to myself.

I'm now 19, I managed to pass my exams and as a result, I managed to get into university. I'm studying physics. I made it... Yay! Not exactly.

You see, in order to ensure a position at the university I had to study real hard during the last class of high school. I never studied much. I was just good at math and physics and anything else I enjoyed. I was crap at history for example (or literally anything else that didn't have to do with math and physics). Studying so much during that last class of high school made me lose a portion of my passion for physics and math. I was hoping that when I got to go to university I would get that back. But nope. Not even close. It's the same, and maybe worse.

People are making me the thing they want me to be, including my family. Another grey person, without dreams, without passion, without purpose, waiting for life to get him/her in the right way. I don't wanna be like that. I don't wanna be like the people in my village. I want to have a different life. I want to be someone, do something great, something that the world will remember me for. Of course, that has to do with physics, game development or guitar, the three loves of my life, I don't care to be famous, just to be famous, I just want to achieve something great in the fields that I like.

I'm finding things in university really difficult, I don't even know if I am smart enough to make my dreams come true. I have never made real and strong friendships and I have done nothing remarkable so far despite that I'm 19 already. I'm not even that good in physics and math anymore. Maybe it's because I also started learning guitar and programming. However, I can't choose one over the other, I love all three of them, guitar, physics, programming and maybe being very good at a couple of things simultaneously is not achievable, it is probably impossible and I will probably stay forever mediocre at everything I do.

Why did I lose my passion, why do I now care about other people, why do I feel like another human with limited possibilities? Why have I stopped philosophizing when I'm on the bus, when I'm bored or before I go to bed? Why am I not so passionate about the song imagine and John Lennon anymore? Why did I stop caring about world peace, about making a huge speech where every single person would hear me on tv, talking about how we all humans should stop carrying about religions, countries, possessions and work all, together for the advance of humanity? Why did the song that describes me the most become comfortably numb instead of images? Why did I stop dreaming big?

And most importantly, How did I make myself grey like them?

I feel better now. This is how I'm really feeling, I had to let myself know the truth.",23Jul2020,1

803,"My then-fiance and I were scheduled to get married in late April of this year with a venue, photographer, etc., booked. I emailed our photographer, let's call her X, in March telling her that due to shelter-in-place and limits on the number of people who could gather, we were going to cancel the wedding, but would like to do portraits at a future date. She was very understanding and enthusiastic about the portraits and I said I'd keep her posted. 

In late May my fiance and I got married in a socially distanced elopement-type deal in our officiant's backyard. It was very last minute, memorable, and we were able to get our friends who are professional photographers to take pictures of the big day. (We didn't ""book"" them for our originally planned wedding because we wanted our friends to be guests and enjoy themselves, but since the circumstances changed, they were excited to be at our small, spontaneous wedding ceremony).

Now in order to book our photographer X, we had to put down a non-refundable $400 deposit. I looked over our contract and it states that if the Photographer can't perform the agreement in whole or in part because of acts of God or nature or terror, or other cause beyond the control of the parties the Photographer will return all paid fees to the Couple but shall have no further liability. 

Anyway, fast forward to a couple days ago, I say we're ready to do portraits if they're comfortable doing so. The response I get is that X's policy for deposits during Covid (which are typically non-refundable), is that they can be transferred to a future wedding event of (roughly) the same amount of hours. My fiance and I had originally booked 4 hours. Of course our portrait sessions wouldn't last nearly that long.  Her email then states that she would charge separately for a portrait session, and that she hopes I understand. She mentions that portrait rates will be discounted at $300 for 1 hr, $400 for 1.5 hrs, etc., but that the original deposit we paid can't be applied to this service, it can only be applied to a wedding of similar duration or forfeited. 

Now that we've gotten married, we aren't planning to do a large ceremony in the future, but were hoping that this deposit, or at least part of it, could go towards a portrait session. My husband doesn't understand why the deposit isn't transferable to another photography service like portraits. He says that if we can't have the deposit at least partially transferred, we'll book our photos with someone else. 

Trying to put myself in her shoes, I'm thinking that she was expecting and we agreed to a longer contract, and is now out the money we would've spent for the 4 hour session. Since the $400 deposit is technically non-refundable (though I think there's also some ambiguity with the clause about it being refundable due to circumstances beyond our control, which Covid was), but she can probably legally keep it. 

I'm also very aware of how hard hit photographers are with Covid going on, and wanted to leave a generous tip when we did portrait sessions. However, I thought at least part of our $400 deposit would be able to be applied to portraits as it's the same service but not as long (and with only husband and I to photograph as opposed to a full wedding).

I'm trying to see both sides here. I feel for the photographer and I also agree with my husband that I wouldn't feel comfortable booking a portrait session with them if we essentially lose the $400 deposit and then have to pay of a minimum of $300 on top of that. Any advice, suggestions, and thoughts would be very appreciated. Thanks!!",23Jul2020,1

         and I live in Switzerland she in Germany

I'll probably delete this after I get answers since I think this is pretty weird. Basically, I have a humongous crush on a girl. She is pretty, extremely nice, smart, has similar interests as me and is physically active. The problem is, I almost never see her, now even less since she'll go to (I don't think she uses Reddit but in case she does I'm not gonna say where, just extremely far away) for a year. She is a few years older than me and I think she has no idea I ""like"" her, she probably just sees me as a younger guy that's ok to be around. 

So, if you only see a girl like 3-5 times a year, you don't know her THAT well and she has no idea you like her, probably doesn't like you back and there's no way you're gonna tell her to not weird her out, it sounds like a really bad idea to chase after her. The thing is, she really motivated me to get my shit together.

Since I met her (like not long ago at all) I tried to live a good live to impress her. Almost no more videogames, less scrolling Reddit, quitting porn, took up drawing, went hiking, jogging, working out, learning more new things and excercising my brain instead of watching Netflix and trying to be less introverted and actually having friends, and most importantly trying to think more positive in order to get over seeing her so rarely, which is actually helping me a lot in my everyday life. I think about her all the time and really don't know if it's hurting me or helping me just focussing on her.

What could be considered bad is that she's christian and I'm not so I started praying and thinking about god, and although I still think he doesn't exist, it kinda gives me hope.

TL;DR I fixate on a girl and it drove me to better myself and my habits.

So what I'm asking is, is this healthy? Should I just try and move on or is it driving me to achieve more?

808,"So my girlfriend and I have been together for almost 8 months now. She's known her best friend for multiple years now. We met because her friend randomly added me on snap and we all hung out and my gf and I hit it off and well now we're here. But I've noticed her friend seems extremely possessive.

They live right across from each other, which means during this quarantine they have hung out a lot. At the beginning they didn't talk for like two weeks because her friend is terrible at responding, but now they hang out everyday. Which is fine, I could honestly care less, but her friend insists that they hang out. She makes my gf hang out even if she doesn't want to. Shell physically pull my gf out of her house or guilt trip her into doing stuff. This is just kinda annoying as my gf admits to even giving her friend more attention than me, and sometimes it's just annoying (like when you're trying to call or plan a date night and you can't because her friend is practically attached at the hip). On top of this, her friend also seems slightly toxic sometimes. She recently threw a massive party in the middle of this pandemic, with people that my gf is at odds with. My gf didn't want to go but her friend forced her by physically dragging her out and guilt tripping her. It's to the point where she doesn't even try to fight anymore as her friend is relentless. She also continues to call my gf and complain about her broken relationship but when my gf gives her advice to fix it she ignores it and then tells her on/off boyfriend who gets pissed at my gf and it causes her a lot of stress. Her friend also doesn't end up defending her when her bf says shit about her.

Overall, I know this is really stupid. I'm really tired right now but I don't wanna be possessive. I know this seems quite possessive, and I don't really like that, I just needed somewhere to vent this. I do think her friend is possessive of her and sometimes a little toxic, but it really doesn't help my case that her friend doesn't completely like me and has said so (she doesn't like me bc she thinks I made my opening moves too fast and should've waited longer to ask her out), I dunno. If this were AITA I feel the the asshole and I'm sure I sound like it too, it's just I don't 100% like the behaviour of her friend but I'm not gonna say anything unless my girlfriend asks me for advice about it.

I know her, too- and I would have loved to stick around, but over all, ""it's best that she doesn't know that we spend time together,"" because she has an idea of me, and I don't want to cause a fuss in their relationship just to spend an hour together talking about plants and playing with his dog... As bad as it would look if she did find out if we were spending time together, I left that choice in his hands.

The kinds of rumors that you hear about yourself that are cooked up in a small town could make the simplest of lives seem like the worst, and I feel like half the time I'm battling assumptions... If people don't want to give me a chance than I definitely don't want to lose sleep over it, especially when I'm more likely to flirt with her than him at this point in my life üòÖ

815,"My dad is 56, overweight, and lactose intolerant. He was diagnosed to be lactose intolerant 6 or 7 years ago, but he still drinks a lot of milk and eats a lot of ice cream. Every day after dinner, he eats a big bowl of ice cream. He also eats cheese and drinks milk. Every time we go to a burger place he orders a cheeseburger and a milkshake, even though my mom tells him order something without cheese.

And this causes a lot of problems. He has really stinky farts, and sometimes they're totally unbearable. They linger around for quite a while, and everyone leaves the room. Everyone has talked to my dad about this before; he insists on eating yogurt and milk and stuff despite being lactose intolerant, and the results are just disgusting. We've bought him dairy-free products before, and he says they taste weird, so he continues the eat the regular products. We've bought him probiotic pills, but he still eats a lot of cheese and milk and ice cream and stuff.

Every time we order pizza, we get my dad a salad. He eats the salad, but still eats a couple slices of pizza. And then when he goes into the bathroom, everything smells like disaster. When my mom cooks, she does not put cheese in her food. However, it's mostly like milk and ice cream that messes him up.

Is there any way I can make my dad stop eating all those dairy products? They are giving him gas, and probably worse problems down the road.",23Jul2020,1

I have apologized for this multiple times to her as the friend just made her uncomfortable, as he pushed ""C"" to stop without giving her options or solutions. I just wanted her to find healthier ways of coping with trauma. Why I'm bringing this up now is because recently I stopped being her friend due to ""C"" still having aggression towards me for it.

820,"conflicted about reconciling with abusive father

All my life, I've known my father to be abusive.   Some of my earliest memories of him were witnessing him beating my mom in front of me.  Other times he would attack me out of the blue and tell me that he reacted because I looked threatening to him.  He would also manipulate me into doing things such as help him run his businesses after my mother committed suicide.  He would say things that made me feel as if he would maybe take his own life if I were not to help.  Eventually, we ended up fighting about so many things that he eventually kicked me out of the business and the house we were living in together.  

Since then I've had to rebuild my life with no support from any of my family.  However, he recently reached out to me saying that he wants to fix our relationship.  He cited that his business and personal relationships are failing and that he needs me help.  It comes at no surprise to me since he's always been a major asshole and COVID is shitting on everyone's lives/businesses.  

I wish my therapist would just give me some concrete advice, but instead he is trying to get me to trust my own judgement.  I don't feel that seeing him now is worth it as I'm still social distancing, but at some point I think I would eventually like to find a way to reconnect but I have trouble seeing how I would accomplish that without him causing anymore harm to me.  

I have so many thoughts that conflict with each other.  On one hand, he's still my father and I acknowledge that he had a terrible childhood with no solid role models.  It breaks my heart to imagine him getting old and dying alone.  On the other hand, my gut tells me that he is probably still poisonous and recognizes him as the source of so much pain in my life.  If we tried to talk about any of my trauma, he would most likely deny any wrongdoing.  I often fantasize about ways I can instill the kind of terror and pain that he inflicted upon me.  However, I know that isn't the higher path and would not bring peace.

Short background and recent event

All my life, all the times I have hungout with people is because either Someone backed out and they have a spare ticket now or I was around when the planning was happening.
When none of these cases happen, i would be by myself for days and the others would go out to do things. The wasn't invited in the latter situation at times too, even though I helped plan it.

Recently, I asked a few friends of mine to come over to my place (cases here are low, everything has opened). I recently started cooking and I wanted to share it with someone. This wasn't an out of the blue invite, we had been talking online and are in the same batch at school (diploma course). A couple of them said they would love to come over and decided on the coming Sunday to do so.
Come Thursday and apparently a few of the others had planned to go to the beach and invited the ones that said yes to me. They told me this and invited me to the beach. I went, but I felt really out of place. While we were going back, I reminded the two that my offer was still open. They again said they would love to and will let me know.
'Let me know' was synonymous to 'no' as of what I had experienced. So, as a last try, I asked them and they said the same, 'let me know'. Now, as always, I was like 'the balls in their court'. If they really want to, they will contact me.
It has been a month now. Not only did I not get any confirmation from them, I recieved no messages at all. It's like, if I don't message them first, as it has always happened in the past, I never get to talk to them.
They have hung out enough now that I will be a sore spot to stand out if I did go with them. This train has passed and I have given up on hanging with them.

Addition: I have gone for therapy for anxiety and depression which has been caused by such a life and loneliness. It was crippling me before and now I can do things like school.

My question is:

What do I do?
What do I do the next time I meet someone new, like in a place of work?
I am so scared to talk to anyone now because I know the same will happen.
I can clearly see myself being 'Forwver Alone'!
Help please!!!
Not being able to hangout has come because I don't seem to make friends which reciprocate. Happened all my life. Is this what will happen forever? I don't want it to!!! I want to change things, but I don't know how!!!",23Jul2020,3

This might be a long post so I apologise in advance. I am currently 29 and have had multiple bouts of depression and anxiety since my teens. My experience of depression and anxiety has resulted in me not being able to keep a job, remaining in toxic friendships and relationships, and generally living an existence where I am perpetually unhappy and stressed. I finally went back to school to become a teacher and felt like I was on a really good and positive trajectory till I took a big risk taking my first teachinh job abroad. It was in Qatar and I absolutely hated it. The people were awful, the kids too, not to mention the complete inefficiency of the school. I know I was naive to take such a risk and not forsee how my mental health may deteriorate in such a novel situation, but I really wanted to push myself and be the person I have always wanted to be. It was a mistake and then I found myself heading abroad to spend time with loved ones before finding a new job. Once there I got stuck because of the pandemic, but it also gave me time to think and recuperate. I could see negative patterns I had allowed to flourish, and started somewhat working on myself. I realised how much I had wasted my 20's simply focusing on the negative and not believing in myself, letting other people's opinions dictate my behaviouf constantly. I want to start afresh but was looking to see if there js anyone else who has embarked on really transforming who they are, and their path at this stage in life.

Also, does my professor think I'm a nazi now?

859,"Mid 20s F, and I'm looking for a FWB. Met someone off reddit who was also looking for an FWB with emphasis on the friends part which I very much agree with too. Want something casual to blow off steam but not really looking to date seriously.

Now, we've met twice (casual social distanced dates, no sex) and he's quite funny and easy to talk to, but I'm not sure if I feel a spark. He's very chill, thoughtful, fun to hang out but not very assertive and I don't feel those wild butterflies and giggles. I'm part attracted and part not, the thing that's putting me off is his teeth, everything else is fine. But I'm looking for an FWB anyway not a relationship so maybe it doesn't matter if I'm not wildly attracted? Would like some outside opinions",23Jul2020,1

862,"This is for a friend first of all

Context:
So in October/ November two of my friends ‚Äòdated‚Äô I say it like that because they never went on a date and it was just a label (also I‚Äôm 50% sure that the girl only did it because she thought I liked him and that would be jealous) 

A few months after they broke up, the girl sent a text asking to get back together. From what I can gather, he didn‚Äôt say anything much no clear yes or no. For some reason, the girl thought he said yes and thought they were now ‚Äòdating‚Äô again. Until the past week, I and the boy had no idea about this so we were super annoyed as anyone should be. She won‚Äôt give me any info about it but seams serious. The boy isn‚Äôt interested in her but I think the girl does, so any advice on how to let her down would be great",23Jul2020,1
863,"So, I‚Äôm a guy and I also like guys (I‚Äôm 20). I have this friend from work that is one of my best friends right now. I‚Äôve always had a crush on him and I really do love him to death. He‚Äôs the first person in my life that I actually find easy to talk to. I don‚Äôt have to try to make conversation with him, it just happens. 

Very long story short, I got into cutting and I started cutting myself every time that I would feel lonely. One night when he was talking about a girl from work, I got so upset that I was uncontrollably crying and I ended up stabbed myself pretty deep into my stomach. I confided in another friends about it and that friend ended up having a talk with the guy I like about me. 

I ended up taking some initiative and I decided to face my crush head on. I told him that I liked him and that I feel so comfortable around him and all that jazz. He took it very well, he told me that feelings aren‚Äôt always something you can control, he said he was flattered and that he really likes me as a friend and also feels comfortable with me. We talked for like 3 hours and he confided a bunch of personal stuff in me and I did the same with him. He‚Äôs not into guys so, he didn‚Äôt reciprocate those feelings but after this talk that we had, I felt okay with the fact that he was just a really good friend. In fact, I felt super selfish for putting that at risk because I couldn‚Äôt keep my feelings in check.

For the next day or two, I felt better. I did feel more platonically towards him and I was somewhat complacent with him not reciprocating. But that was only temporary. I started getting those feelings again for him and they came back stronger than ever. I was already really depressed and suicidal before all of this happened (I have a lot of other problems). I‚Äôve talked to friends, my therapist, and my psychiatrist and they tell me what‚Äôs wrong, but they don‚Äôt really give me a whole lotta advice about what I could do. I‚Äôve had really strong urges to cut again, but I haven‚Äôt just yet. I have a lot of scars on my body and I‚Äôm trying not to make more but I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can keep it together.

I still feel really bad whenever he mentions like a female celebrity or a female character from a video game being ‚Äúhot‚Äù. Because it just reminds that I‚Äôm not that. If I was some hot woman, he would like me, but of course, I‚Äôm a guy, which is just an instant no for him. I‚Äôm not mad at him for not liking guys, it just makes me feel not good enough....I‚Äôd like to believe that 2 people can fall in love no matter what the circumstances are, AKA there‚Äôs something wrong with me that he doesn‚Äôt like. 

I also feel like I put a lot more into the friendship than he does. I only have like 2 or 3 friends and he‚Äôs definitely my top friend. I love talking to him, he instantly makes my day better, I would talk to him all day if I could, but I don‚Äôt think he feels the same way. I think to him, I‚Äôm just another one of his friends that he could live without. I know I can‚Äôt force him to feel any certain way, but he leaves me on read a lot and I just fear that he doesn‚Äôt actually like me as a friend, he just pities me or something.

I‚Äôm not sure what I‚Äôm asking for. I guess I just want some advice or some help about what I could/should do. I‚Äôve been told that I should just distance myself from him as much as possible but I can‚Äôt do that. He‚Äôs such a good friend, he‚Äôs one of the only people that makes me feel even the slightest bit of happiness, and I‚Äôm not gonna throw out this friendship because I can‚Äôt keep my feelings in check. I‚Äôve also been told to find a new guy to like or get out there and find someone else, but that hasn‚Äôt been going great. Everything‚Äôs closed because of the whole virus thing, and I did shamefully download Tinder because I have some friends who are in successful relationships from there and it didn‚Äôt work out. I actually got 6 matches over the span of the two weeks and all 6 of them said that they didn‚Äôt mean to swipe right on me, and one of them even called me a ‚Äústupid mistake‚Äù. So that was great. I‚Äôm also no spring chicken and I live in a pretty conservative area....so my options are limited.

I‚Äôm just so lonely, I‚Äôve never known anyone to have feelings for me, which is fine but I just feel like I have a whole lot to give and no one seems to want it.

Anyway I‚Äôm sorry for all of this and I guess I‚Äôm just desperate for some help. I don‚Äôt like asking the few friends I have because I feel like I‚Äôm putting my own burdens onto them and that I‚Äôm more of a liability for them than a friend. Idk, I‚Äôm sorry for all of this and I do appreciate any support. I know that at the end of the day, it‚Äôs just some stupid guy having a crush on someone who doesn‚Äôt like him back and he wants to kill himself because of it, which seems super petty and middle school-like but that‚Äôs just how it is.

I dont even go out besides to buy necessities like food even though some places are open in my area or to even just go for a walk but I barely went out before everything shut down.

I think now that we have gotten closer and were able to experience traveling together and haven't broken up after that (hehe), my parents have the fear of us being together in the long run. I have been facing some negative comments often from especially my mom, my dad has said all he needed to say a couple of times and he said he won't bring it up any more. They do prefer me not to be with my bf in the end and not to take him seriously. This is also a strange comment, because I have taken every relationship seriously in the past. None of my relatives are in North America, they are all living in Eastern Europe...It has been challenging being home throughout quarantine because there is no place to escape from the negative moods about my relationship. I understand that my bf and I have very, VERY different cultures and religions etc. His parents do not even know about the fact that we are dating, because I am sure he would face the same issues as I am now but he has made it clear to his relatives that he is not going to engage in an arranged marriage and all that comes with it. I was salty about him hiding our relationship before, but now that I am experiencing negativity from my family first hand, I understand why he's secretive.

My mother said that I am not even understanding what I am getting myself into, and what my bf is also getting into. That it will be super difficult for us and we will give our kids a hard life too. And we will never have a normal family and my parents won't be happy and nor will his. That we will face hardships everywhere and so will our kids unfortunately. That our kids will also be super stressed out about the wildly different religions and cultures and it will be a mess.

874,"this might be a long post depending on how much i can type without crying. 

i found out about 6 months ago that my boyfriend of two years has been cheating on me the entire time we were dating.

what i had found originally, was a folder in his phone of nudes of his exes and also women he had hooked up with and that he downloaded grindr and was flirting with men online. 
i didn't know the full extent of it and he told me that he forgot he had those pictures on his phone and that he was feeling sexually confused. 
i asked him if he wanted to open up the relationship so he could explore his sexuality more without the fear of losing me. he firmly said no, he didn't want that at all and that he would stop cheating on me all together, delete the pictures and dating app and gave me the password to his phone. 
a month passes and things are getting better, i'm starting to trust again, slowly. 
wrongly so. 
he never stopped cheating on me. not a single second. he still has a dating profile, multiple ones at that. he is still talking to old flings, sending and receiving nudes and flirting with multiple men and women alike. 
he has a fetlife, grindr, okcupid and plenty of fish account. he would message people he found on craigslist and leolist for their ""prices"" and make plans to hook up.
he buys porn from women on onlyfans.
i haven't told him that i know any of this yet, every month that passes i hope that maybe he won't do it this month, week, day, whatever. but he always does, and it always hurts. 
he treats me so very very kindly to my face, it's almost hard to believe that any of it is true but it is. my family loves him, my friends like him and i love his family and his friends are really sweet. 
we have plans to travel and we've talked about our future multiple times and with all that he has done, with the chances i've given him, i'm not sure there is a future here anymore. i hate to say it but i still love him so dearly. 
i'm at a loss, i know what i should do but there is such a big part of me that wants this to work but i can't be the only one trying.

880,"I work in a warehouse. Today was my one year anniversary. 
It's not a hard job by any means, and I love the diversity of the place. Lately, though, I've become the target of one of the ""higher ups"". He bullied this other girl in my department to the point of tears -- when I agreed with her that he was wrong (tried to consistently block her from doing her job) things took a turn. 
The strange thing is, I never mentioned my opinion on the matter to him. 
He stopped me a few times to ""correct"" how I do my job. I showed him I was doing it correctly. Then he stated a group I worked in were handling something incorrectly. I cited the conflicting information from other managers and said I'd change and inform the group (I'm a trainer as well). A couple days later, in front of multiple managers, he decided to make an example of me by laying me out and saying how I am to blame despite my evidence to the contrary. One manager came by later and said the mean one shouldn't have said that. He was sure, like all the managers do, to make sure the mean one wasn't present. They're terrified of him. No one stands up to him because when they do he, he disrespects them and blames them for problems they didn't do. 
Well, to today, it's my anniversary. You get this stupid little pin saying ""1 year"". I was a day one with my warehouse so I've seen it grow and change. He made a point to say ""I'm not your manager anymore"" when I didn't react he decided to dig deeper and said something like ""you don't need to using the text service to ask about your pin"" (I'm paraphrasing the second part bc there's background stuff for our jobsite. He was also offended because i wrote someone saying he, the mean one, saw me and walked the other direction. He had the pins. He knew how bad I wanted mine. He looked into my eyes and walked away. So, yeah. 
He made a point to do all this in front of my trainees, bosses, and coworkers. 
He made attempts to block me from doing my job efficiently for months by changing policies and restricting mine and my groups ability to do them. Everytime I seemed to find a work around that didn't affect his metrics, he seemed to be upset and angry. 
I work hard and I do well in every process at our warehouse. I thought that would make me shine and I would be praised (I'm versatile and I don't brag at work).  

I'm up for a promotion but it would be working directly under him again. He seems to hate me and no matter what I do, I can't seem to change his mind. No one else treats me like he does and no one does anything since they're afraid of him and his retailation. 
I went to his manager (the only one above him) and he reassured me he would talk to him and make him stop attacking me. That was for the incident with the managers and he turned around and did it again today. 

What should I do?

I often get kicked out of communal living areas as my brothers want to have the rooms to themselves. I find this unfair but my mum defends them and tells me to 'compromise'- like seriously?! Isn't compromising both having use of the room? I also have next to no WiFi in my room so use the downstairs areas to do work, but I'm always getting kicked out. My mum told me she 'didnt understand me' when I vented my frustrations to her.
Im really not a fussy person to live with- I've had no problems with anyone I've lived with in the past 3 years apart from my family. Mostly because I feel like I'm not entitled to use any living areas and whatever my brothers say, goes.
Anyway, I don't see this behaviour changing at all. It's really frustrating me. Usually I take myself off for walks because otherwise I'll explode and say something I don't mean.

882,"Before I get started, I want to say that I am 17, male and from Kansas. I really am not up for hearing that ""you're too young to die"" crap people say. My life has been an absolute waste. My Mom had me at 42 and my Grandma wanted me to be aborted. I sadly, was not. I have never had friends, because I am a very shy person. I have Autism. I can't control what I do a lot of the time. I have way too many problems and I need help. Is death the right thing for me?

I'll start off with my family. My parents are barely home, Dad works nights and sleeps during the day, Mom owns a store and works during the day and afternoon. When she comes home she is agitated because she has constant head pain. She fell on her head in 2000 while Christmas shopping and injured her brain. My Mother is also deaf. She doesn't know why she is agitated for no reason, but I think she has CTE. She will not go to a neurologist because of money. My Grandma is dying and she is being abused by her Husband. She is left at home alone all day while he hangs out at bars. Even worse with COVID 19. Monday my Mom's sister, who suffers from Tourettes, texted my Mom saying that my Grandma fell and broke her hip. He was home. Apparently yesterday he told her he was not home. I don't think so. I think she was pushed down. He has thrown beer bottles at her, punched her, and pushed her. He has taken life insurance (I think that's what it is but I'm dumb af) out on my Grandma. He also has access to my Aunt's personal accounts and has absolutely ruined her credit. They sleep in different rooms. My Grandma cannot stand without help and I mean she can't even TRY to stand. He has to help her. There's no way I buy that she fell trying to stand up. I fear that he will kill her. We suspect he has a girlfriend on the side. On the other side of my family, there's my sister. She is in her mid thirties. My Mom had her very young. She is also deaf. After my first suicide attempt she sat me down and told me not to make mistakes like she did. She told me when she was my age she got into the wrong crowd and started doing hard drugs and stealing things. She is well known in my town for these things. She went on to tell me she was beaten with a metal bat by the people she hung out with when she wouldn't give up her car. I knew everything except the last part. It's hard to believe, really. She hasn't told her sons about it either. I never see them unless it's something like Christmas or the 4th. That's all the family I have. 

Now about me; I am at home 24/7. I don't go to public school, I do year round virtual schooling. I left public school two years ago. I am not normal. I've never had friends. At least not real friends. I think I am asexual. I feel so bad about it. When I was young (12 or 13) I found out my Mom was sexually assaulted by the man I was previously talking about. Very, very gross shit that made me so sick. Since then sex has been an absolutely disgusting thing to fathom. I don't watch porn, or do anything people my age do. Just the thought of sex disgusts me. I really have no dreams or aspirations besides being an athlete which is basically unachievable at the moment. I am also fighting a gross problem by myself; bed bugs. I am ashamed I let it get this bad. My family makes fun of my paranoia. I have been fighting the bugs for weeks by myself. It's hurting my sleep. We don't have enough money for extermination. We just lost a cat to cancer in May because we couldn't afford treatment. We are pretty broke.  

I have tried to end my life before. I really want to do it again. I know I have nothing to live for anymore. I hate the things I used to enjoy. I cut everyday. It's all my fault too. There is nothing I can do except kill myself right now. I really hate that THIS is my life. I threw it all away. Wasted. No real childhood, constant anxiety, being put down for no reason. I used to believe in God but now I don't. No way a God would let this happen to someone. I have no one, too. Is death the right choice? It's a stupid question but...maybe there is a silver lining? I might not be in the best mental state so can someone who is please tell me if death is perfect for me? 

All I know is that something bad will happen if I live. Something so bad it impacts my life to a point of no return. Maybe my Grandma's death, maybe death in general, maybe the house catches fire....who fucking knows. But something horrible *will* happen. I can feel it. And I know it's all because of me.",23Jul2020,0
883,"I live in a large apartment complex, I've been living here since November. I didn't realize when I moved in that the appliances were all bad. The fridge leaks water, the dishwasher sprays gross food debris even when the dishes are rinsed beforehand, and now my dryer is squeaking.

I can deal with the first 2 things with a towel and by doing dishes by hand. I had tried to get someone's attention on the fridge but with covid stuff the office was closed and only emergency maintenance was being done. Fine, I'll just put up with mopping up some water every now and then.

But with the dryer, it started out a small squeak that I hardly ever heard, and is now a full blown squealing every time the dryer is on. Which is a lot of the time. I did my research and it is a potential fire hazard.

I figure this is an emergency situation. Now I can't seem to find anybody that works for my apartment building. The office should be open, and it's not. Ever. The website for requesting maintenance won't let me log in (it says my user and password are found but that access isn't allowed at this time) and I don't get any response when emailing the address that the management gave when I moved in.

My father is not a good man, and at the age of 11 I found out he was cheating on my mother and I told her. He then married his mistress, had 3 children with her, and cheats on her too. Her family is very large and... opinionated, and I‚Äôve never felt like I‚Äôve been fully welcomed. They all act is they are/were the most loving family for me, but it‚Äôs the complete opposite... 

My parents had a bitter divorce, and my dad‚Äôs new family never hid the fact that they didn‚Äôt like my mom. My dad and stepmom lived with her parents at the time, and whenever I would go there for the weekend, they would hide my cellphone so I couldn‚Äôt be in contact with my mom. To this day, my ‚Äústep-grandma‚Äù will still make disrespectful comments about my mom, and everyone acts as if it‚Äôs totally fine. When I was 12, my best friends birthday party was the same day as their thanksgiving dinner. I went and had dinner with them, but told them my mom would be picking me up shortly so I could go to my friends party. They responded by locking me in the house against my will, and when my mom showed up and I was let out, my ‚Äústep-grandma‚Äù followed me to the car screaming and swearing at my mom then screaming in my face that I was a bitch. They ‚Äúapologized‚Äù a week later and it was never talked about again. My stepmom‚Äôs siblings started having children and a couple of years ago my ‚Äúaunt‚Äù had this sign made for my ‚Äúgrandparents‚Äù with all of the grandchildren‚Äôs names on, and mine was not included. I brought it up to my dad that I was hurt by it and he said ‚Äúwell, yeah, you know that‚Äôs just for the kids!‚Äù. Not one single person in the family brought up that I was left off the sign. It really hit me then that none of them must consider me a true part of the family if no one caught that.

On my birthdays, the only people that reach out are my dad and stepmom and it‚Äôs hit and miss whether anyone else does. No texts, calls or anything from any other of my aunts/uncles/grandparents etc. Our birthdays are all within a few weeks, so there‚Äôs usually a joint party, but with COVID this year, I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable going (they never followed social distancing rules), so all in all on their side of the family I got one phone call and a text. 

About 10 years ago I found out my father had cheated on my stepmom after he left his emails open, and never told anyone. Then a couple of years later, my best friend told me that my father had messaged her and asked for nudes. I confronted him about it, but never told my stepmom. My father and I recently got in a fight because I said I didn‚Äôt want to keep his secrets anymore, and I feel so mentally/emotionally messed up from the last 14 years that I can‚Äôt even look him in the face and just needed some time away from them. He told me to fuck off several times, called me a bitch, a spoilt brat, and told me he was washing his hands of me. A few days later he tries calling/messaging me saying he‚Äôs sorry etc. He said that he told my stepmom about messaging my friend, but not about the cheating 10 years ago because ‚Äúit would ruin his marriage‚Äù, which means he still is wanting me to keep a secret. 

Now, I‚Äôm getting messages from my dad, stepmom, and her sister all trying to talk this over, but I‚Äôm not sure if I even want to? I always dread talking to them or seeing them, and feel like it‚Äôs an obligation/chore, but I don‚Äôt owe them anything. The more messages I get from them, the more anxious I feel. I just want to block them all and never talk to any of them again, but is that too extreme? I imagine that happening, and it sounds like peace. The only part I struggle with is my brothers, as my father said if I don‚Äôt talk to the family, I can‚Äôt see my brothers. There‚Äôs three of them under 15 and I love them so much. I feel so torn because I don‚Äôt want them to grow up without me there, but I can‚Äôt mentally keep doing this. Besides my brothers, the only two members of the family I truly get along with are the ones that married in. Funny how that works.

All of these things are just a scratch on the surface of things that have gone on through the years.

I‚Äôm so sorry to anyone who has read this far. My goal eventually is to go to therapy, but I currently don‚Äôt have the insurance or income to do so. Hoping some outside input might give me some clarity.

Thank you!

888,"Hey guys, I‚Äôm stuck and torn.  I‚Äôm genuinely into cars and love it.  It‚Äôs literally my life and how I have the people around me. My car broke down and it‚Äôs about 6k to fix it.  I love this thing and it was one of my dream cars. Anyways, I can pay and fix it but problem is I want to scale in life, I have big goals, I current sell cars for a living and day trade on the side.  Part of me wants to stand up of the car scene because I spend so much money on cars....(almost 15k the last 2 months) but it‚Äôs really hard bc it‚Äôs literally what I enjoy. 

I could sell it and leave my passion for this hobby, or I can just not fix it and just let it sit aside.  Truth is letting it sit doesn‚Äôt take more money out my pocket. Should I just wait to fix it and focus on life now, or sell it and just get back into cars later?

I‚Äôm also 20 turning 21 in two weeks. Not that it matters but that‚Äôs my other dilemma, having ‚Äúa lot of time‚Äù.  I‚Äôm very torn

How do I make a shift in my mindset, and let go of something I‚Äôm truly passionate about?

890,"I'm in a four-person group chat with my friends, and we talk every day. Usually when we make plans, 3 of us plan it and the other agrees after. So, recently I've been wanting to hang out, but one of them (in the first 3 I mentioned) never responds so we don't make real plans. One girl and I say something along the lines of, ""lets get \_\_\_"" ""ok / when / etc"", but no one else replies (expected of one girl but not this one, like I said). It's very strange and I can't think of a reason why. We've hung out three times since quarantine restrictions loosened and I thought we all had fun. She responds to basically any message except for anything about hanging out, even though I know she's on her phone. 

None of us have issues with each other or anything, if we talk about any other subject or even when I direct message/call her everything is perfectly normal and chill. I've tried directly addressing her but she gives noncommittal responses like ""I don't know."" I doubt it's a time issue either, because we're all on break and have complained about the excessive amount of time we have. She's in a friend group with my boyfriend too, and I saw a message a few days ago where she said ""hang tmrw?"" (not creeping through my bf's phone lol, it popped up on his screen while I was using it and I didn't look further). The difference between that friend group and ours is that ours has no guys, and I'm not in the other one, but the other 3 girls are. I'm scared that maybe I'm just boring compared to the guys. But I'm still confused because hanging out never seemed like an issue before?

My point is, to a hiring manager, I think on paper I'd appear to be at least competent and reliable in an office environment.

My goals are basically:

\- Find a job where I'm earning roughly $65k + benefits in the Los Angeles employment market

\- Work a ""9-to-5"" in an office environment (barring COVID of course)

\- Be a salaried staff team member, not some 1099 contractor. I want someone to put a ring on it.

\- Not sales/commission/pressure-based, I wanna say hi to Phyllis, sit down with a big cup of coffee, and absolutely go to town on some spreadsheets or something. The full ""Office Space"" reality where I can settle comfortable into mid-level bureaucracy.

\- I'm teaching myself comp sci basics starting with Python and eventually a nice suite of front-end web development tools, but that will probably take a couple years at this rate.

896,"I don‚Äôt really know where to begin, the title basically says it. I‚Äôm a 16 yo girl living in Germany. Before all of this I was pretty average in popularity. I had 4 or 5 close friends and was never really involved in any drama, didn‚Äôt party a lot or stay out late. I don‚Äôt have experience with any hard drugs. I‚Äôm a good student and I think I am a pretty nice and chill person. I have suffered from depression, but had been in a really good place for the last couple of months.  About 1 1/2 month ago I met this boy named S (18yo) at a party (legal under the corona regulations where I live). Some of my friends knew him, so I didn‚Äôt think much of it. He approached me and we talked for hours and really bonded - important to note that we were both drunk (drinking age is 16). Over the next week I hung out with him and his friends almost every day. They are all 16-20 yo and mostly done with school, including S. They‚Äôre nice people and we had a lot of fun, but also drank a lot. I got caught up in all of it and came home after curfew almost every day, which my parents didn‚Äôt like, but since I‚Äôm usually a good kid they weren‚Äôt too worried. I‚Äôd tell them I was studying at a friend‚Äôs house when in reality I was hanging out with S and his friends, drinking on school nights and skipping school. After like a week, he threw a house party. The original plan was for around 50 people max to come (I know, very irresponsible), but by the end of the night we had lost count of how many actually showed up. It started out really nice, we were drinking and smoking weed and just having a good time. Then they started doing cocaine. S told me he had only done it a few times and that I shouldn‚Äôt take any because he didn‚Äôt want me to ‚Äúgo down that path‚Äù. I did NOT do coke and btw didn‚Äôt take any other drugs besides alcohol and weed. They stayed up all night and took some more in the morning. That alone should‚Äôve turned me off him, but I‚Äôm an idiot and I was so fascinated by this boy that it just made him more interesting in my eyes. I told some of my friends at school about it and i felt so cool having them interested in all the crazy things going on in my life. I still asked them to hang out, but they weren‚Äôt really interested in doing stuff with S and his friends and that was all I wanted to do. I spent all my time with them, completely disregarding everything else. Then I heard from a girl that my friends had been talking bad about me behind my back. At that point S and I basically stopped talking and I spent a week in my room crying, not just over him, but over the whole lifestyle and new (and old) friends that I had lost along with him. No one reached out to me, or texted me back. I tried talking to some people at school, but they would walk away when they saw me coming or just end conversations. I was freaking out, because I had no idea what I had done to any of these people. Now some have reached out to me and told me that they‚Äôve heard I have a drug problem or things along those lines. I know that I put myself in this situation. These last 3 weeks have been hell and I have never felt so low and alone. It‚Äôs all my fault and I know that. But I‚Äôm going insane because I have no one in my life I can talk to and I don‚Äôt know how to fix this situation. Any advice would be appreciated...

all of my colleges that i want to get into require two years of the same foreign language. unfortunately, however, last year i was in a german class. i had expected to take a german class this year, but because of said circumstances i will not be able to via school.

i‚Äôm really worried about this because that means i will not be accepted into the colleges i want. this is further complicated because 1) the colleges i want are all of the ones that actually have the specific skillset i want (theatrical direction and writing), and 2) i‚Äôm unfortunately autistic and already not very wanted by colleges because of having burdensome accommodations due to said autism. if i don‚Äôt get into college, i don‚Äôt know what i‚Äôll do with myself.

i am aware i could take an online german course from
another site, but i don‚Äôt know which ones would be transferable to a high school credit, and which ones are cheapest. i don‚Äôt know what to do and i am absolutely terrified.

904,"It happends every so often but I'm finally sick of it and scared he might actually snap one day. I (16 M) have never been physically abusived or anything, but my dad will always go on these scary tangents. It's almost like he's bipolar or has massive anger issues. 

Like today I was complaining to my stepmom about having to get my hair cut. My dad always wants me to cut my hair while I like it a bit longer. Now I'm not saying down to my shoulders long just a little over my ears. Literally the difference from a three or two on the sides. Of course when my stepmom tells my dad later behind my back (thanks) he flips his shit calls, and threatens to ""beat my ass"" when he gets home.

Since I'm so disrespectful just because I like my hair long. He says all he wants me to do is to look ""presentable"". To who?who the hell knows.Then tells me ""if you want to be a bum pack your fucking shit up and go live with your mom because all she wants me to do is to stay under her fat ass untill I'm 45 and become nothing in my life."" Wow thanks dad your so supportive.
Even though in the end I stopped complaining and got the haircut. 

Its not like I'm a failure of a son either. I just passed my 2 AP classes with a five and going into my junior year with a 4.6. I haven't touched drugs or alcohol and I try my best to be respectful. Yeah my sleep schedule may be fucked but so what? I'm not disturbing anyone. No matter what however it always somehow ends up like this. 

That being said it's probably an empty threat, but still scary nonetheless. It's not like he's a bad person either. He was in the army, a firefighter, cop, and now a paramedic who runs his own company. I just wish he stayed nicer all the time. God forbid he finally snaps on one of my siblings. 

This is kind of rude to say, but I have no choice but to be dependent on him. There's no way I could pay for college in the upcoming years without him helping, so I can't just pack up and leave. I just hate it so much and need some advice. Because the only play in my playbook currently is to be his obedient middle child who should never have an opinion on anything, always agree, laugh at racist jokes, be slient, and never disrespect him or offer another suggestion.


P.S- my mom's not a bad person she just has some flaws. My dad on the other hand is homophobic, racist, anger issues galore. If it's not obvious I live in the Southern U.S with a conservative baptist father partially on my free will. He doesn't pay child support, just buys me what I need and want sometimes to keep me happy.

907,"For some reason I cant post at relationship advice, or relationship.. so here it goes.

My girlfriend and I have been dating for 9 years. She is from a relatively wealthy family who is passing through some tough times because of the quarentine (they own a small shopping mall, and it has been closed since april because of covid legislation in my country).

Wanting to help her family, she started to look for ways to make money. She eventually found a famous site where you can sell images and videos of yourself (known as OF) and.. asked for me to help her with the account, content and everything. She said she could not do it alone. I love her. I really do. So I started helping her. We decide what we're going to post and I pretend i'm her on all social media we created for her OF persona, because she can't deal with the costumers.

So I talk like her, I try the best I can to sell to sell her photos and videos to those guys, I always tell her everything that is happening and we decide, together, what do to on various situations.

But the thing is: I hate it. I feel like a piece of shit for doing so. It makes me so sick that I pretended someone thats lives with me got corona so I would not have to see her for a while. And it is not because I'm angry at her or anything. I just would not like to talk about OF when we meet up, but that's impossible (I know, I'm a scumbag).

Don't get me wrong, it is not her that makes me feel this way. It is what I do. I feel like a cuckhold pimp. I take her photos, I edit her videos to erase something that would make her more recognizable (birthmarks and stuff), I do literally everything I can to help her.

But I feel like I'm losing myself over it. We stopped doing it once because there were a problem on the account itself and she cried so much, she felt useless because she couldnt help her family. So we tried again and i'm putting effort to be.. lovely to the fans on the site while I pretend i'm her and yes, she is hot, so she is making money (her father has control over her bank accounts, so I send the money to my account that i gave her full access, including a card of her own).

I wish we could stop it. Erase everything and move on. But I do not make enough money to provide for her yet (I'm a recently graduated lawyer in my country).

She knows I'm not ok with it because I've made myself very clear since the start. But I kind of downplay it so she can feel a little bit better.

Do you guys have any advice?

This friend of mine and I had a falling out when I told her that her baby daddy and then boyfriend had come onto me. I had told my boyfriend about it before I told her. He and I talked about it and he told me to tell her. I called her later that night and told her about the baby daddy (also 18M). 

I had turned my phone off the night I told her since I was spending the weekend with my boyfriend and I wanted to focus all of my attention on him versus the current situation at hand.

I had called her and she was basically blaming me that it happened and told me she was going to sleep with my boyfriend to get back at me. 

A few weeks later (today) my former friend texted my boyfriend and told him that I had cheated on him. I‚Äôm not sure if she texted him this to try ruining our relationship and I tried to talk to her in a manner of adult and she told me yet again she would sleep with him. 

Keep in mind,  I called her a week ago and tried to fix things and she seemed okay at the time. I had told her I did have some sex dreams about my ex but none of it was acted upon.

929,"a few days ago, i received a call from someone with no caller id. i let it go to voicemail, thinking it was spam. when i looked at my phone later in the day, my history showed that throughout the day they called multiple times. i picked up their next call thinking it might've been important.

i asked who i was speaking to and who they wanted to speak with. they told me their name and asked if there was a [insert name] there. i didn't know anyone by that name, so i told them they had a wrong number and they hung up.

i thought that was that, but i got another call shortly after. i ignored it again.

they didn't call for a few days, but earlier today they called again and i declined. i'm kind of scared, lol. is there a way to block caller id calls or something of that sort? what do i do?",23Jul2020,1

933,"I (23f) just received a pretty large sum of money (well over $15,000) and I already had a decent amount in my account from my previous job so I am doing just fine financially. I am currently unemployed, and I live with my parents. I go back and forth between their houses (they are divorced), and I help with expenses when they let me. I am pretty spoiled, so they sometimes tell me to keep my money because I am unemployed. I normally pay rent to live there, but for now I help with gas, groceries, bills, etc. instead. 

Now that I‚Äôve received extra money, I‚Äôve been thinking that I should gift them, not out of necessity, just because I love them. They always help me when I need anything, but I‚Äôm afraid they‚Äôll refuse the amount and tell me to keep it. But I‚Äôm also afraid that if I gift too little, they might be offended. Their reactions to things can be very 50/50. My parents also hate each other, so I don‚Äôt plan to tell the other I also gave them money, but I plan to give them the exact same amount. 

What would be an appropriate amount to gift each of them? My family is by no means rich. I‚Äôm not used to having this amount of money to throw around and I want to be smart about what I do with it because I am unemployed, but I also want to be helpful. Thank you for any advice!",23Jul2020,2

940,"I've talked about my living situation at length on other subreddits. Basically I \[25F\] have been in a living situation with a mentally ill roommate \[29F\]. She was placed under an involuntary mental hold but refused all treatment.

There are hygiene issues in that she hasn't showered in at least 4 months and my home reeks of her sweat and her stench. She also leaves rotting groceries out because she is unable to care for herself, flashes me, and seeks out verbal confrontations with me. It's exacerbated because of COVID because we have been forced into the same space for months and my life at home has been a living hell where I'm fearful and uncomfortable every day in my own home.

Before all of this, I was admitted into a selective grad program and I'm taking one online course for it while working full time. I felt a ton of imposter syndrome as is because most of the people coming into this program are younger and not working. I'm also transitioning fields and don't have the background in this that others do. I've struggled a lot to keep up with the work for this class and had been doing well. I fell behind on a few assignments around the time my roommate was sectioned, in part because I was spending hours talking to her family who wanted her hospitalized and needed my cooperation and once had to call the police right before a class.

When she was taken away I naively thought this would be the end of the issue and I sent an e-mail to my professor saying, without giving too much detail, that I had been in a stressful housing situation and would catch up on my backlog of assignments, which I did soon after.

Her return from psychiatric hold made everything worse. She now blames me for her time there and her family will no longer work with me or respond to any messages. Their daughter has gotten more malicious towards me and I'm currently couch surfing, still trying to make rent because I'm not able to get out of the lease even though I'm not living there, and trying to keep up with all my work commitments and this course while also not knowing where I'm going to be staying more than 2 - 3 days at a time.

I've fallen way behind on the class material and because there are such high expectations of people in this program, I'm extremely embarrassed. I also don't know how to convey this to my professor or if it even matters. Part of me feels like I'm an adult and I should be able to roll with the punches. Does it even matter what the circumstances are?

Looking for some advice on how to face this situation. Part of me just wants to quit my program completely. I hate that I'm starting my academic career on such a low point.",23Jul2020,1
941,"We were having a rough time in our marriage and we were not in best of terms. I fell for my colleague who I was able to connect mentally and we were mutually attracted . Before falling in the hell/heaven hole of cheating , while contemplating what is the right thing to do with these feelings  I asked my wife that we should work on our marriage . After 2-3 weeks of going nowhere I asked for divorce ( too short i know but the impulse was too high due to the bliss from the new partner I was seeking to be with)  . We were not able to work on our marriage and I gave her emotional hell talking about divorce all the time for 3 months or more . I even told her ""find someone else"" which she was deeply hurt by yet she was hell bent on staying with me.  I confessed after 4 months that I am cheating and she still decided to stay with me. I did not love her while I was cheating and I don't love her even now. I am no longer contact with the person i cheated with. It was not physical by the way.

As much as my wife loves me, I simply not able to connect to my wife and don't feel attracted to her. We seem like opposite poles. I really cant forcefully make me love her. I tried counseling which was of little use. How do I love her ? My wife is super patient to stick with me and trying to work it out. we have a son and he gets love from both of us. I dare say I love my 3 year old despite being a cheater because that is the truth. For my wife's sake I feel she is better of without me but apparently she loves me more than anything else. i am not sure something like that is even possible being married to me.

947,"Hiya, just so you have some context to the stuff below I am a 19M and will be entering my second year of university. 

Recently, I have become envious of almost everyone in my group and always see myself below them. Every single one of them have something I wish I had such as a girlfriend, intelligence, strength etc etc. This feeling of envy/low-self esteem started with my mate now dating the girl I liked (long story short, I didn't know I liked her until they started to date each other). Earlier this week, the main part of the group moved into their household for the 2nd year of university. I can just turn up to their house whenever I want but because I am not living with them I just feel envious and I am struggling to shake off that feeling. Furthermore, because of Covid 19, I'll be entering the second year with braces which isn't ideal if I am hoping to get a girlfriend at the start of next year (should be off by mid-Oct though). 

I struggle with self-confidence when it comes to initiating a conversation with girls because I constantly think I am being negatively judged literally as soon as I walk over. It's probably my naivety speaking there. I have never gone up to a random girl, introduced myself and carried a conversation from there. I just can't bring myself to do it.

I know I am not socially awkward either because out of my entire group, I definitely know the most amount of people in the year (as in we would stop and have a talk when we bump into each other).

I would like to clarify that my mates are really nice people and never put me down. I know this is all in my head and would just like advice on 1. how to be more confident and 2. not get envious. These two things really need sorting out, as it is ruining my life at the moment.

Near the end of high school I had a falling out with some of my closest friends, but I was leaving for university in a different town at the end of the summer, so I didn't really make new close friends before I left. That was fine because I leaving. For three years I was living in a different city going to university and I have friends there but I wouldn't really call many of them really close friends. Then for the last year I was doing 2 jobs in a2 different cities, one after another (not where I'm from or where I go to school). I made friends there but nothing long lasting. Then because of the coronavirus I had to come back to my hometown. I have 1 close friend here and we go on socially distanced walks but I don't really have anyone else besides my family. I still talk to my friends in my university town but 1. I've been gone for the past year, and 2. I don't know when I'll be able to go back so I feel like they're going to move on and forget about me if they haven't already. Also, a lot of my friends from school are graduating this year and since school is going to be online for at least the fall and probably the spring as well, I don't know if I'll ever be living in the same city as them again. Most of them will leave that town when they graduate.

I don't know what to do. It's sort of possible for me to move back to my university town because someone I know has an open spot in their house, but this would mean taking a 5 hour flight and moving during the pandemic. With the added cost of paying rent and flights I don't think its worth it. But in my hometown I'm lonely and I feel isolated. I can't use the normal advise like join a club or take up a hobby because of the pandemic. I don't know what to do.

960,"Hello !

So, when I was 17, I saw in the Marketplace an organ (an electric one from the 80s I think) that was given away for free, and I was interested so I asked for the dimensions, which were too big to be reasonable to take, and I knew this. But because I am stupid stupid stupid I did not have the force to say ""no, I am not interested finally"" and since the facebook person stopped replying to me for two months, I thought it was over without me needing to say ""I am not interested"". But then she told me that she actually paid to keep it in a storage to give it to me and that she put so much time to reply because she was busy with moving out ! So, my landlady and I went to her storage, but it was too big for her car, so the person from facebook went all the way (2 hours) to bring the organ to me !!!

I don't know how to react to such kindness ! She didn't even want to accept money ! I gave her drawings and I wanted to send her a video of me playing the organ, but it didn't happen because it was hard to find a position to film and I don't play well.

Anyways, one year later, I didn't use much the organ (because I don't play very well, one of my roomate got upset and it's in the commune room instead of my room, and I am busy with school).  And, I need to change of house very soon, and the organ was a big worry. Initially, the plan was to find someone to take it, but this didn't happen, I didn't even try to put online (although I wanted too ! I am stupid and lazy and unmotivated because I didn't think anyone would want it).

Anyway, after one month of thinking about what to do with the organ, my landlady asked me to speed up the process and gave me one week to take it out of the commune space. I panicked, and I wanted to take it upstairs in my room to have more time to think about it, but sadly I wasn't strong enough, and the organ got stuck in the stairs (I even achieved to do a hole that I will repay for of course). So I didn't see any other choice than deconstructing it, because it was blocked in the way and I was too proud to ask anyone help (also, I ask help much too often, I try to learn to do this less). It took me four hours, but I was able to completly deconstruct the organ.

I regret it, I should have more energy to put it online to give it to someone instead of this impulsive deconstructing. But I guess what is done is done, and I was wondering what would be the healthy way to deal with this?

So far my ideas are 1) try to rebuild it (I doubt I can, but I can try). But the problem then, is, again, what do I do with it? I kind of want it away from me, I feel bad each time I see it, to be reminded of all the kindness that was wasted onto me

2) find a storage place where to put the pieces, as well as some other ""garbage"" I am attached too (school notebooks), and keep it till I am rich enough to find someone to fix it, and put it in a true house where it won't be minded (but using storage space would be expensive for me, and who knows when I'll have enough money to do that ! Probably never)

3) ask a friend if they want the electronical components and throw the wood and the rest if he's not interested (and then where do i throw it?)

I am feeling really ashamed about all this (and I also I feel bad for the instrument. I don't think it was one of quality, but still it was a musical instrument that deserved respect!), and I don't know what would be the healthy way to deal with this. Throw it and forget it, in Marie Kondo style? Or try to fix it, and keep it till I learn to play so I can make good use of the gift/ or find someone who would do a good use of it? But that would probably mean years of me going around with that heavy instrument and I am kind of a poor international student ! And also, I feel so bad each time i think of this organ (and seeing it augments the frequence of me thinking of it), like really it put a circle of pressure around my heart",23Jul2020,3

973,"TW: abuse (verbal, mental, emotional), depression, family issues

So just to start this off, I‚Äôm a 20 y/o college student home for quarantine/the summer. My mom has never hit me or my 16 y/o sister, but the way she treats our father and the effect it has on us is honestly destroying me. I don‚Äôt like her, and I‚Äôm starting to feel like I don‚Äôt even love her, and I feel really guilty over that. My mom has worked hard all her life and provides for us‚Äîshe even pays for my school, which is really expensive. My dad is a stay at home dad and helps out around the house, except he doesn‚Äôt do a lot of the tasks my mom has asked him to, which is a big source of strife between them (and by extension, my sister and I). 
My mom has a lot of mental and physical health issues that weigh on her emotionally. She has depression and takes medication for it (as do I) along with an autoimmune disease and heart problems. My sister and I believe she has a lot of other unaddressed mental issues, specifically with anger. 

There was an incident over the winter where we were in another state for the holidays and our dog got sick. My parents were arguing about whether or not to take him to the vet (dad wanted to wait and see how he was doing the next morning while mom wanted to take him then) and it led to a huge blowout. They were screaming at each other in my aunt‚Äôs house, and at one point my mom hit my dad. He‚Äôs a big guy, so he was okay, but that didn‚Äôt excuse it. My sister started yelling back at my mom because it wasn‚Äôt right, and my mom told my sister if she didn‚Äôt like it she could ‚Äújust leave‚Äù. My sister was 15 then‚Äîthere was no where she could‚Äôve gone. She then made my dad sleep in the car that night (a freezing night in Minnesota). When we called her behavior abusive all she said was ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre damn right it is.‚Äù We were supposed to visit more family the next morning in another state, but my mom said that my dad, sister, and I could go, and that she had already booked a flight back home for herself because ‚Äúno one wanted her around‚Äù. I had to be the one to calm her down and get her to come with us, which in itself was exhausting, but then she admitted she didn‚Äôt even book a flight and that that was a lie to get us to care about her. She had an episode getting into the car where she was trying to get comfortable and started throwing things, one of which hit me, albeit on accident. Instead of apologizing she just said ‚ÄúThis is all you‚Äôre going to talk about now‚Äîyou don‚Äôt care that it‚Äôs an accident‚Äù. I let it go, but later when she was in a restroom, my dad told me that since I was the only one she respected, I had to be the one to keep her calm, which was entirely too much for me. (For the record, our dog is fine and we made it home after the holidays). That‚Äôs a very abridged version of the events, and I will say that my moms doctor was taking her off her depression meds that she has been on for ten years those weeks, but it was still awful. 

There was another night a couple weeks later where we were supposed to go to a festival as a family. My mom and my sister got into a small argument (really, it was nothing and not even a serious topic) but my mom blew up. She wouldn‚Äôt get out of the car for the festival and said (about my sister) that she ‚Äúraised a mean girl‚Äù calling my sister nasty and all sorts of other things. She wouldn‚Äôt talk to anyone the rest of the night. 
I told my therapist all of this when I was finally able to see her again, and since my underage sister witnessed my mom hit my dad, she had to call social services. I was panicked because I didn‚Äôt know how my mom would react (surprise‚Äîshe wouldn‚Äôt talk to me the rest of the day) and an investigation was opened up after the initial interview. The case was eventually closed, but that didn‚Äôt make anything better. 

My mom and my dad have always had bad fights where they scream at each other and threaten to get a divorce but never do. And I get my mom‚Äôs side when she‚Äôs upset that he doesn‚Äôt have a job and just sits around all day and blows money on things, but she shouldn‚Äôt act like she does. More recently we went on a trip (she‚Äôs convinced that since I‚Äôm in college our ‚Äúfamily is being destroyed‚Äù and that ‚Äúthis is our last summer together‚Äù but that‚Äôs a whole other can of worms) and just as we were about to leave she freaked out that the counter was dusty and started screaming. She even yelled at me and my sister for not cleaning it, even though she never asked us, so we never knew to (I get if we should pick up after ourselves, but we can‚Äôt know to do specific things without being asked). My mom ended up getting so mad she took a bottle of cleaning solution and slammed it against the counter until it broke and exploded everywhere. The entire trip she was harping my dad for every little thing he said and was just generally very uptight and pissy the entire trip. She was ruining her own good time by reading too deeply into everything and making a big deal out of things (and causing public scenes!) but still blamed us for it. She even made a comment about how we‚Äôre only going to remember this trip as her ruining it (implying that was unfair) even though it‚Äôs completely her. 

I‚Äôm just so tired of it all. It‚Äôs hard being home from college, and quarantine has made it even longer and harder here. I get to go back to school for my junior year in a month, but I feel bad that my sister will be left behind here to deal with this. My mom is incredibly depressed about me going back‚Äîshe cries whenever she thinks about it, and uses it to guilt me. She keeps talking about how our family is ending, while also always throwing the cost of my school in my face. Which I understand! But then when talking about my sister‚Äôs birthday she‚Äôll say ‚Äúmoney is meant to be spent‚Äù (which is just really funny after everything else she says about money). She just acts like me growing up and developing my own life is a slight against her personally, and I‚Äôm afraid if I try to stand up for myself too much she‚Äôll stop paying tuition, and then I‚Äôll really be stuck with her. 

The other day she suggested a story to me (I‚Äôm a screenwriting student) about the events that happened over winter, saying I should write something about that and social services. But she wanted me to make it clear that the family in the story I‚Äôd write would be a good family. I thought social services investigating us would be a wake up call but this just further reinforced to me how she sees herself. We can never have actual, calm discussions about this because she‚Äôll just say something like ‚ÄúI guess I‚Äôm just a terrible mom then‚Äù and try to make us apologize and feel bad for her. When she suggested the story I just wanted to scream at her. You‚Äôre not good parents! We‚Äôre not a good family! It was just such salt in the wound. 

My dad could be a better dad. We could be better kids. But I can‚Äôt handle it anymore. We‚Äôre always walking on eggshells around her. And I just feel bad, because she really does so much for me, but I don‚Äôt want her to be super involved in my life. I don‚Äôt want to cut her out completely because she‚Äôs my mother, I just want to keep her at arms length. I know she won‚Äôt go for it, but it‚Äôs my life and I‚Äôll be able to make that call someday. I just feel bad about it.",23Jul2020,1
978,"So what I (28F) mean by connections group is I want to make like a FB group for my city where board gamers and ttrpgers (Tabletop Role Play Gamer i.e. D&amp;D) can reach out to each other and make connections to set up game nights or just to hang out and make friends with each other and whatnot.

The reason I want to do this is that I personally find it hard to make it to the local game shops' game nights/days, and I would like to meet and connect with other board gamers myself. The thing is, I know connection groups like this aren't always the best and it can possibly breed some unwanted troubles like dangerous people joining and preying on others.

Either way, I've searched FB for a group like this for my city/area, but haven't found one, so that's why I am considering making one. Obviously, not until after the COVID situation has gotten better, though.

I do hiit for 20 minutes every other day and walk at a decent pace for 1 hour  every day. Why i do so little? Idk im lazy. 

So a normal days meals for me are i wake up at 8am and dont eat until 16 hours since my last meal (i try to eat dinner by 6pm but its not always possible) . I drink water or low calorie diluted juice. I eat 3 pieces of bread for breakfast with salad mayo and either chicken or salami. I eat different nuts and fruits during the day and then 2 chicken breast and brocolli peas sweetcorn  and carrots for dinner. On the 2 days i went over my family ate takeaway i just ate a burger no fries no drink. Anyway today after 3 weeks i finally weighed myself and im 127.5kg and im gonna attribute that to going to the toilet just before weighing myself. It killed my hopes and will to carry on. Eating is the only comfort i have, being lonely depressed and anxious, without it im lost.

982,"I'm a bit lost right now. 



I've been struggling on and off for a year or so with things, however it's all peaking right now, I've lost my best friend, my job is risky and then today I've just found out that I've been lied to by not only this best friend but also my colleagues and boss. 



I feel like I've got nothing left. I have 1 friend, who is rather distant at the moment even when I try to chat with him. The person I considered the biggest positive influence and friend in my life has finally snapped to the point of no return, she no longer wants to be there in my life in any way. I hate my job. My family aren't the most understanding or supportive either. They would support me if I lost everything, however at the moment they blame me, they say that it's my own fault as I don't look for other jobs enough (I have done, but in the current situation in the world, jobs aren't the most easy to get. I have my own issues of the career I'm in is so niche, I can't easily change companies. If I leave there are few options other than a career change. That might seem drastic, however the position I'm in do any leave me with many other options.)



I feel like I have nothing or no one.
I feel awful saying that as my family are here, just maybe I don't feel they truly understand me right now.



I'm an introvert, or at least was until more recently. As much as I want to change that, I just can't. I'm not a big outgoing character and can't even fake it. 
My best friend understood me, I understood her. Our friendship made me feel content in life, without it I feel empty.
I am becoming more and more shut off since this started to crumble, it's not the first time someone that's meant a lot to me has left my life. I don't feel like I can trust anyone anymore, I'll just end up broken after a while. The people you think you can trust, maybe you can't?



Even when I'm keeping myself busy, it's there in my mind, how much I miss this person (and others), how much I miss enjoying my job, how much I miss my life of the past, when I was so care free and content. I feel like my only way back to happiness is by finding these meaningful connections again. I can't be totally happy alone, I need companionship. However at the same time I'm too scared to pursue these again and I don't even have enough friends or a social life to find people. 
I liked my life without the need to force myself into social situations I don't enjoy.

983,"I [25M] previously went to college and due to financial reasons I haven't been able to go for around 2 years at this point. So as a result I have been working with my father at the company he's employed with to save up for myself and for I do finally return to school.  

Unfortunately throughout the years I honestly have messed up with my finances (blown money on foolishness, women etc) and I am nowhere where I should be financially, mentally, and growth wise with  the amount of time I've been working.

Recently my father got another job opportunity from different company and he's left me in charge of the apartment that we stayed in while we worked here and he wanted these last few months to be my last working here until school starts. But the time I've had to stay here on my own, working, and taking care of myself I feel as though I am starting to grow as a person. 

I would like to go to school, however I would like to stay a year and work on myself as a person while working, saving, and overall growing up as an adult.

985,"ETA: myself - f/26, my partner - m/29

I'm considering breaking up with my partner of about a year (see separate post). I'm starting a new job next week and really need to be at my best. It's a professional field, I'm a new grad with limited experience, and feel like I won't pass the probation period. They are very strict in who they keep and require high-performing workers. Further, mistakes can cost people their health, so it's important that I'm at my best regardless. I feel deeply under qualified, and am basically spending all my free time trying to catch up through reading what I should have learned through clinical experience. It's also the only job I've gotten after 35 applications, so it's not like I can find another one easily if I mess up.

I'm torn. I feel I need to break up with my partner. However, I do love him and this new job is going to be extremely tough. I'm not sure if I can handle both at the same time.

I guess I have two questions. 1) Would it be unethical to put off breaking up with my boyfriend for a month? FWIW he knows what the issues are, it wouldn't be out of the blue, and right now we're ""working on it"" with slow success. I'm 90% sure breaking up is inevitable, but part of me thinks more time may change things.

2) If I do break up/if breaking up is the right thing to do, how do I handle it at the same time as work? My boyfriend is my best friend, we've basically been living together since month 2, and with everything going on we've been pretty much each others only contact for months. We laugh all the time. Losing him is going to be like cutting off a limb. How do I do this and keep up my performance at work? I'm unfortunately a fairly emotional person, so I know the guilt and sadness is going to affect me deeply. This job requires a lot of analytical thinking and speaking with people in person, so I won't have much time alone and I need to be at my best.

But I just put it on the alcohol cause I not fond of alcohol but was curious. So we decide to drink again another day. The second day is me drinking alone in front of is door because he was late by an hour. I had like 150 ml of a 45% wich was for me a lot. He end up giving me a shower and make me eat bread. At the end of the night I wanted to play a game. The game was high in his closet so drunk me couldn't get it so he had to get it since he didn't had a drink. Midway he stop and ask if can do a 3 third base. Drunk me think he is trading the game for it. So stupid drunk me accept we ended up doing doing it and afterwards played the game. The next day I don't think much of it, I had to puke. We ended talking about what happened a few days later. He though there were the mood and I told him I though he was trading he was feeling bad blah blah blah. He ended up to fourth base with one of my friend and told me wouldn't do it again with her because he didn't had the spark and he wanted to do it with someone he loved. Like I said in the beginning we hug a lot but during a day we got out he hugged me from the back and kissed my neck multiple time. He keep saying I'm cute and talk about trying 'it' again because I was drunk and didn't felt much the first time. So I don't really know what to think about it.

Since online classes started, my entire progress seemed to have gone away. I'm now far worse. I'm in desperate need of advice. This year matters a lot to my grades.

991,"Ok so just a heads up this is prob going to be long 

I am a 26 year old who had their education paid for, truck given, and currently lives with their parent. So why am I so miserable? Well I don‚Äôt have a life. To pay for school/education I care for my parent by cooking, cleaning, organizing a house that not even two people could keep up with, pet care, and general care (getting drinks for them when they ask etc) 

This was all fine until I started to feel lonely, and regretting my decision to become a teacher..(rushed decision after high school ) at first I was like hey maybe I‚Äôll just work really hard the first year as a sub and get some savings to eventually move out! (The very thought of a full time position almost makes me panic ) but then I ended up helping my parent secretly with their bills which I will admit I practically just gave away all my money and all my EI when summer came. I saw some money coming back but I was also pitching in for groceries and paying truck insurance.

So I figured this year I would work really hard in subbing and NOT give it away and actually save it... then covid happened and I used up what little I had made in EI before applying for the help fund.

Now I feel...stuck. I‚Äôve been considering taking some courses to earn a degree I‚Äôve dreamed of (art diploma) since I already took 3 courses while in college but I don‚Äôt know if I could handle the commitment for even one course, or if I‚Äôll even be happy.

(Especially when I‚Äôm working) sometimes I don‚Äôt even get a lot done bc I just can‚Äôt pull myself away from laying down (I think that‚Äôs just me being lazy.) 

So what should I do? I keep having these episodes where I‚Äôm miserable and it affects those around me who are genuinely in a good mood and I don‚Äôt want to wreck that. I‚Äôve been thinking of maybe having days set aside for friends and such but they are not always available... also since I don‚Äôt really have weekends I don‚Äôt really have set days where I‚Äôm not busy.... should I take the courses and add more to my plate or just make a bigger effort to get out of the house/take days off?

Note: I just got a therapist on an app this last month and I‚Äôve been talking to them about some of my issues, and I didn‚Äôt mean to paint my parent in a bad light. They have done so much for me and I feel selfish for wanting more. 

I know I have to move out (and I planned to come back and help out around the house pretty much every third day) but not only am I broke, but I don‚Äôt want to up and abandon them leaving them alone (they have problems to and tend to get lonely)

My sophomore year, I became very active in my school's robotics team, in which I met the then junior (but my age) crush.

Extraordinarily funny, pretty, and smart, this girl was the effective leader and mascot of our robotics team... and I was infatuated.

Obviously, I did nothing, just bided my time through school and focused on my academics. Simply because of my continued presence on the robotics team into my junior year, we became incredibly close, with her driving me around late at night and coming over to my house to work on painting stuff for our robotics booth. As my school is somewhat small, we talked a lot there too, with her constantly providing useful advice for high school and the college application process.

I had some grand master plan of confessing my crush sometime as this school year drew to a close, but Covid drove those plans to impossibility. So instead, after online school ended, I sent her an email just kinda telling her how I felt.

All things considered, she responded really fast (interesting given that I'd sent it at 11:45 in the evening), telling me that she had a lot of platonic love for me, that she was sorry that I'd had the unfortunate experience of having a crush on her, and to reach out if I needed anything at all, as she plans to visit when/if school opens back up.

So, it's been two months since then, and I have been really busy with my summer job lifeguarding and college apps, but my rash decision to send her that email has again and again come up in my mind.

She will be a freshman in a college in the capital of my state, but given the situation, may remain at home.

So, my request for advice is simply this: how should I proceed, or should I try at all?

For the record, she is a lean, average height brunette with an incredible smile, and I am a rather chubby, goofy looking Hispanic teen.",23Jul2020,1

(For context: I am 23, female, and living in Ontario, Canada)

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the issue: I don't feel that any of my friends are truly ""my type"" of people. I always feel some level of disconnect, and more and more want to find an absolute bro. I have people in my life that always have my back and vice versa, but I don't have anyone in my life I can be fully uncensored with and that I truly just enjoy my time with. I find that most of my friends are very sensitive, which is not a bad trait, but it causes me to change my behaviour because I'm a very empathetic person at least overtly. It's also partially because I have tried to initiate the type of banter I want in a friendship or tried to do certain activities and it just doesn't come naturally to my friends. This next comment may seem rude, but I really don't mean it that way... I also find that there is an intellectual gap between me and most of my friends which causes me to disconnect from some conversations and gets in the way of me feeling close to them. I find myself connecting to my boyfriend's friends so much more than my own but obviously want to expand my own circle outside of his. His friends are very, very intelligent which makes being stupid together all the more fun. That's what I want... some smart people to be borderline brain dead with. I know that this sort of disconnect is a common problem for people, so I'm wondering if anyone has any advice?

I've always had these thoughts but quarantine has intensified them. I just want to enjoy company again rather than feel like I'm trying to maintain friendships that I don't genuinely enjoy and get happy about.

1022,"TW: sexual assault 

Fake names + I'm sorry it's so long

Last week, my three friends (Beth, Martha, and Ezzy) and I (17F) planned a picnic for this Saturday, beginning in a group chat on Snapchat (this will be relevant later). Unfortunately, that chat got too big with 16 people, and so some people expressed their apprehensions for going (including Ezzy). One of those 16 people, Guy, was upset that Patrick was going. Earlier this summer, Patrick was revealed to be and confessed to being a sexual assaulter. But since Martha and I pitied him and used to be close with him, we invited him (before Guy), which I know was wrong (not inviting him before Guy, but inviting him in general).

This past-Monday, I called Guy to explain what happened, with Ezzy listening in as she was with me in person. He gave me a wakeup call, saying that just because Patrick and I were friends in the past, doesn't excuse what he did in the past. Then we agreed to make a smaller picnic on the same day, same time. Next, I called Martha to tell her about what Guy told me and the smaller picnic (with Ezzy still listening in), explaining that it was partially because of there being too many people and partially because of Patrick. Martha responded by saying that ""just because Guy doesn't like Patrick doesn't mean the rest of us don't."" Then the call cut out, either because of her phone dying or loss of connection.

But both Ezzy and I interpreted Martha saying that as defense for Patrick, so when I made the second group chat (again on Snapchat) for the second, smaller picnic, I only added those who already canceled going to the first, big one. I didn't include Martha because I didn't know whether or not she'd cancel going to the latter.

Later, Beth texted me and asked why Martha wasn't invited. The conversation went like this.

B: Why isn't Martha invited?

Me: About that. So I told her about it and she kinda defended Patrick

B: ü•¥

Me: So idk if she'll cancel \[going to the bigger picnic\] 

B: Aight 

And that was what I thought was the end of it. Later I learned that Beth didn't agree with me on this and showed Martha everything the following morning, without telling me she disagreed and debating with me beforehand, which was odd since she's openly done it before. And I don't know what happened with Ezzy either, who also didn't disagree with me on it and said it made sense. 

However, hours later, at around midnight, Martha texted in a group chat that only has the four of us (Beth, Ezzy, her, and me), saying that no one informed her that we weren't going to the bigger picnic and that we were all fake. I only saw the message 2 hours later and responded that I tried to but the call failed. 

For more context, the four of us usually go running together in the morning, but the day right after this, I slept in and didn't show up, (which Martha has also done before). I checked the new picnic group chat to see Ezzy and Beth both saying it was unfair to exclude people from the first picnic and that if Martha wasn't invited, they weren't going. But no one said, Martha couldn't come. That's where this being on Snapchat becomes relevant. I wasn't the only person who could invite new members into the group chat, Everyone could. Guy added three of his friends. 

And I was immediately hurt and angry that they seemingly changed their minds overnight when they both apparently agreed with me literally a day before. I didn't understand why they wouldn't tell me that they thought not adding Martha looked bad. If they had told me, I would have added her. 

My logic was/is: since Martha already confirmed to go to the bigger first picnic, there was no way she could go to the smaller second one since they were on the same day at the same time. I did not mean to purposely exclude her. And I was also confused by Ezzy, who said she wouldn't go to the bigger one since there were too many people an wanted a smaller one. How else was I supposed to make the picnic smaller without inviting certain people?

And so I was upset and messaged in that same group chat asking ""wtf happened."" Afterward, both Beth and Martha called me multiple times and texted me. I didn't answer either. It was wrong of me to, but I was too angry too, considering what happened just hours before.  I should've at least texted either one of them and said I couldn't talk and again, I know that is on me. 

When I finally cooled down, I texted Ezzy (who I considered myself closer to than Beth). The conversation went:

Me: Are you home

E: Yeah, I'm here. I was calling you a bunch this morning. Why didn't you pick up?

Me: High emotions, talking to some people, and a most definite misunderstanding on my part

E: We've all gotta talk about this together in person

Me: What happened this morning? What made you guys change your mind?

E: It's just fucked up, all of it. It isn't fair to the people we didn't invite, saying we have plans that day when in reality it was bc of Patrick and just that there's too many people. If anything, we should've been truthful from the beginning and not putting Martha into the group chat is just so wrong

Me: Any of us could've added her. She wasn't not invited

E: But Beth did bring up inviting her

Me: Yeah I didn't tell her not to. I just told her that Martha kinda defended Patrick and that I wouldn't know if she would cancel in the other picnic or not

Ezzy stopped responding after that. I texted her again a couple of hours later to still nothing. 

In the late afternoon on Martha's snapchat story, I saw that Beth was at Martha's house along with Ezzy. Don't get me wrong, the three of them have hung out without me separately before, and I wasn't hurt by it. But I was hurt by the fact they were doing something the four of us planned to do together, and also the fact I noticed that Martha took me off of her private Snapchat story. 

Then I find out that Martha texted Sara to find out what happened, and Sara tells me to call Martha, which I admit I should‚Äôve done before but I was just so angry at all of them. I call Martha, and I tell her my side.

Long story short, she didn't believe me. She called all of my reasons excuses and says that she ""really knew what \[I\] was trying to do."" Except I wasn't trying to do anything at all. I didn't mean to hurt anyone. I know I did, and I apologized. 

I genuinely apologized to Martha multiple times, both over the phone and on text. She kept pointing out all the things I could‚Äôve done to avoid it, such as:

\-calling or texting her back when our phone call failed

\-not assuming that she was defending Patrick

\-yelling some sense into her just as Guy did to me

\-picking up Ezzy's and Beth's calls in the morning

Along with some others. I apologized for each point she made and lamented that I was sorry I couldn't change what happened.

I didn‚Äôt know what else she wanted me to do, and I even asked her but she said she just wanted to know the truth. Except I told her the truth. She just didn‚Äôt believe me. I grew tired of repeating the same things both in-text and on a phone call for 10 minutes. So I told her that I already apologized and that it‚Äôs up to her whether or not to accept it.

So she and I are not friends anymore. Neither are me and Beth. Or me and Ezzy. And it hurts because this is the first falling out I‚Äôve ever had with any of them, and I‚Äôm already out.

I know I should've invited her to the chat first and foremost, but I didn't and I'm sorry and I had no ill will or bad intentions. But none of them see it that way. They see it as a case of black and white, where I'm the vicious villain.

This all happened on Tuesday, and some more things happened on Wednesday too (regarding Beth mostly. Feel free to ask in the comments if you would like).

So I don't think I want to be Beth's friend anymore, but I do want to reconcile with Ezzy and Martha. What should I do? Is there any way to fix it? Or to just wait?",23Jul2020,1

1024,"So my good friend and old college roommate presented this great app idea to me. I'm pretty sure we can make it profitable and I will get stock in the company. Everything looks and sounds good and he sent me the paperwork to sign to officially onboard as an employee. The thing I am concerned with is what if my company deems it a conflict of interest and fires me. 

The new app company does not compete against my company in anyway, but we may offer a service that if our competitor signed on with would bring them in extra revenue. The thing is that my company could also accept this service for no charge and profit too.

So I'm wondering if it is a conflict of interest because my friend wants to run a beta/test run just with our competitor, which will allow them to profit using our app. My company can also use the app and profit, but we aren't going to expand the app until there's proof it works with our first client, my company's competitor.",23Jul2020,1

He tells me he won't give it back to me unless I ""beg for it"" and that I'm on my phone way too much.

Mind you, I'm a rising *college sophomore* home for the summer. The past week, I was also in a kind of depressive mood and didn't feel like talking to my parents. I kind of lost my shit at this, since my dad has done this so many times, and start yelling at him that I'm not nine years old and he can't control me like that, and that it's my possession.

He looks genuinely upset and tells me how rude I am - that he was never as rude to *his* father and my sister is way nicer to him. He then says he legitimately feels like crying. I crabbily tell him I already have my own emotional burdens to deal with and I can't bear his too.

Since then, he has absolutely REFUSED to speak to me or acknowledge my existence. We spent time with family friends this weekend and even then he ignored me, and now it's almost Friday. Normally, I would apologize, but I feel so tired of him infantilizing me all the time.

1034,"My ex-girlfriend and I broke up on July 1st, which is 23 days ago at the point of typing this. I thought after some time that the feelings of sadness would go away, and to be honest, they have only gotten worse. I did not do anything wrong to cause a breakup. I just woke up one morning wanting to discuss a communication issue we had been having then all of a sudden she didn't love me anymore. That hurt a lot because I put so much effort into that relationship just to get my heart broken. I tried very hard to keep the relationship going but I couldn't. Our situation was difficult, her mom basically controlled every aspect of her life and she is 20 years old. Which meant being a ‚Äúslave‚Äù to her mom. Her mom had 5 other kids from three different dads so it was safe to say that my ex was in a bad situation. It was bad, she was verbally abused every day and isn't able to have her own life/make her own decisions. She will most likely be trapped there for many more years unless she is able to stand up for herself. So we had to work with what we had, meaning we had to have most of our relationship on facetime when she lived down the street from me. But there was an end in sight, she was getting ready to finally move out and have her own life, we got to that point together. Then just like that, it was gone. I don't want to sound cocky, but I was one of the best things that will ever happen to her. I was the person that would never play her, always treat her like a queen, always be there for her, and always love her unconditionally. That is what keeps me going, the fact that she just lost one of the best things that ever happened to her. I can guarantee you she knows it too, how can she not. She messed up, not me. I can hold my head high knowing that I gave her the world and I loved her from the bottom of my heart. She knows I did too, and she screwed up because she will just get treated badly by other guys that come her way in the future. As time goes on, she will realize this more and more. Saying things in her head such as ‚ÄúHe truly loved me and cared about me, why did I want to break up with him‚Äù and eventually the feeling in her mind will get so bad that she reaches out to you. But sometimes girls just don't do that, it's just the way it is. If she truly loves you then she‚Äôll come back, if not then keep your head high and find someone that will give back what you put in. I promise, if you truly loved her and cared about her more than anything in the world like I did, your ex will always regret her decision because you are the person your ex was always looking for all along.

I almost feel sorry for her, now she is stuck in her abusive house with no future/dreams or anyone who even cares about her anymore. I was the reason she would have a happy future, now she is stuck. She doesn't have any future or goals in life and even during the relationship she didn't stand up for herself at all, she accepted that her life will forever be like it is. Good luck to her and if she needs me she knows where to find me.

On paper, it seems like I should be over this break up but I'm not. Probably because it was my first real relationship, also because I am human, and you don't just get over someone that you truly loved with all your heart easily. The breakup itself is still tough for me, the key is to let yourself grieve and have those feelings. The first week I was a wreck, I didn't want to do anything or even go outside. Then every day up until about three days ago I almost completely forgot about her. Then recently I've been feeling sad and lonely because of the breakup. People don't get over breakups in 23 days, I am being patient and allowing myself to get over it. It might take a while, but it'll help me in life because I‚Äôll eventually find the one. If somehow that is her great, if not then that's great too. I'm not going to sit here and wonder that all my life. But if it is true, then she will reach out to me. There are amazing people out there who will love me way more than she ever did, you just have to be patient and let things happen naturally because the wait will be worth it.",23Jul2020,1

My mother is especially strict, so long story short I ask her today about going on a date with this guy and she has loooooads of questions. Where and how we met, who he lives with, what he‚Äôs like, what we talk about, how long we‚Äôve been talking, his schooling, his ‚Äúethnic situation‚Äù, his financial stability.

After all this I called him and explained everything and we had a good laugh and he agreed to study up on my fibs, but I can‚Äôt just leave the last name situation unresolved.

1040,"My mum and step dad split up about 6 years ago but have kept contact ever since. Initially it was for the sake of my younger sister who would have been about 9 years old at the time but eventually it became obvious as my sister got older, that it was more about my mums feelings towards my step dad. 

My step dad was very emotionally abusive towards me as a child and favourited my sister (probably because she‚Äôs his biological child) so it‚Äôs hurts that my mum could hold feelings towards him despite how he treated me. He‚Äôs also abusive towards my mum but this is where it gets complicated- she now has a baby with him. He‚Äôs made it obvious he doesn‚Äôt have feelings for my mum and never will. He‚Äôs extremely snappy and irritable with her for no reason. Yesterday she couldn‚Äôt fold my brothers pram down properly because she has a sore arm and that set him off screaming that she was a f****** idiot, she was useless, she can‚Äôt do anything right etc. 

I have no idea why my mum still holds on to her relationship with him. They don‚Äôt get on at all. He‚Äôs not a pleasant person to be around. He brings her down 24/7. And she can see how much his abuse has affected me. I suffer from depression and anxiety as a consequence of suffering from his abusive behaviour my whole childhood. I feel terrible for my baby brother who now has him as a dad. I pity my mum but I feel angry at her for always enabling his behaviour. She threatens to cut contact with him, not let him see my sister or brother anymore etc but goes back to normal with him a few days later. He never apologies. He will never change and she‚Äôs admitted this herself before. Yet she still holds on to their relationship for some reason. It‚Äôs so frustrating.

1047,"I am going into my junior year. Since I‚Äôve taken so many online classes as well as normal 8 periods every year, I could graduate early. I‚Äôm in Utah, a very motivated person, and a girl if that makes any difference. 

Pros: I go to college, do one semester for my generals and 6 semesters for my bachelors in finance, then I get my masters in real estate. This all happens a year earlier than planned and I‚Äôm already the youngest in my grade which lots of college credit so I‚Äôd pretty much be 3 years ahead of everyone. COVID might make high school unbearable so I‚Äôd be there a year less. 

Cons: I miss out on social things my senior year such as prom and dances (which are not for sure happening because of COVID.) I leave my friends early and who knows if I‚Äôll even stay close with them because I‚Äôd be like 3 hours away. It might be hard to make college friends at 16 going on 17 because everyone will think of me differently. I‚Äôd miss out on the swing dance club and archery club and chamber choir. 

Or I could go my senior year and take a marine biology class, choir, and a religion class. But I feel like I would be disappointed with so little to ‚Äúlive‚Äù for that year and I don‚Äôt want a dumb teenage job making $10 an hour to pass the time. But at the same time it would be a break from working so hard the other years. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated!!",23Jul2020,0
1048,"This year has been one bad event after another. 

First, COVID ended my wonderful life on campus living in a house with my 5 friends + girlfriend. Me and my gf's plans to live together for the summer was cancelled for the same reason. Long distance strained our relationship and we broke up. 

All my internship apps got rejected or cancelled leaving me with nothing to do since March. Quarantine in my parents house, unable to see my friends or even go to the gym to workout has been suffocating. 

Political climate is the worst I've ever seen so I got off social media aside from reddit. My PI called and told me and told me I was unable to come back to the lab in the fall. Working back at the lab and living with my friend in the fall was the last thing I was looking forward to. Now, all my classes are online and I'm stuck here for at least another 5 months. I'm graduating next May and I have no idea what I'm gonna do. 

Now that unemployment is ending, I have to start working another shitty job instead of my lab job I love so much on top of all the effort I have to put into online classes (which I despise).

I'm trying to find a reason to keep struggling. I'm outta shape, jobless, and in a horrible mental state. I thought I was gonna marry that girl, I don't want to try again with another girl. I tried being productive and diving into all my hobbies now that I have the time, but I have no interest in anything anymore. 

I feel suicidal, only reason I'm here is because of my friends who will be hurt if I do. I need a reason to keep living, because what's the point of putting so much effort again?",23Jul2020,1

A day ago, my 11 months boyfriend (17) and I (17) had PROTECTED sex. I am not on any form of birth control. Here‚Äôs the thing, this was our second round and he was only semi hard when he went in. Halfway through it, he tells me that he‚Äôs getting soft so we stopped. When he pulled out, the condom was all wrinkled and has a hint of white inside the condom. Reminder, he was still wearing the condom. When I saw that, the first thought that popped into mind was that he came in the condom and some of it could have leaked out of the base of the condom and seeped into my vagina. To me, he unknowingly came and kept going. After, I immediately had a panic attack. He reassured me and told me he DID NOT cum at all and that he was just tired. Mind you, my boyfriend is the type of guy that is always completely honest. The next day, I ask him again just to make sure and he kept telling me he did not. We used a Trojan condom which is silicon based so it already had a slight tint of white to it. There was no rips or anything on the condom. My question is, am I overreacting?

I can tell that she's breaking and though she isn't actively suicidal, I believe she is still a danger to herself and she needs to check in somewhere. I have been to an inpatient facility twice, so I'm familiar with them, and she isn't against going, but here's the catch. 

She has 3 dogs, 2 cats, and another small animal that need to be taken care of. I don't know if there's some kind of help offered for people in this specific situation but I just feel so strongly that if I don't help her now things will be really bad. I don't want to see her suffer like this. I'm worried she'll have a psychotic break or end up homeless. I can't take care of her animals and I can't think of a solution.

1052,"I‚Äôll try not to over complicate things.  I work in a government job, I started in January after leaving a government fellowship. In actuality I came back to an old government office.  It‚Äôs really true you can never come home.  My new supervisor has handed me all the odds and ends in the office to do, my director does the same thing.

At one point we were reviewing a huge NYC agency and their documents all have to be updated within the last 2 months.  And because it‚Äôs government it all has to be printed off.  First off, she wouldn‚Äôt let me work directly with the agency because they would get confused???? I continue to ask her because I could work then directly and resolve most of the issues in a week. She won‚Äôt even talk with me about it.Then she kept wanting me to print everything off so we could get it up quicker. Only problem everything kept expiring because of the pandemic. I printed out and organized over 1000 pages which then were all recycled because it took so long, they expired. When it‚Äôs my responsibility, I need full control, I‚Äôve worked with these people before, what‚Äôs with the need to keep me from the working with them?!

During my performance review she said I did good work but didn‚Äôt like that I waited til the last minute to do things, something that wasn‚Äôt in my control because I‚Äôm waiting on other people to submit things. She also said I dismiss her when she tries to teach me things, which she has done a total of 1 time.  When I‚Äôve asked her to train me on things, It‚Äôs always, I don‚Äôt have time now. 

When I was hired it was supposed to be for higher level policy and management.  Now I‚Äôm stuck with this shit.

Also, 75% of the office is out and I have to come in.  The last week I can in an hour later, but just stayed later. She took issue with that because I hadn‚Äôt told her, but I was still working from
home, catching up on other work.  The new work policy allows you to split your time.   But it‚Äôs perfectly okay for everyone else to be working from home, doing nothing, not responding to emails.  But I get reprimanded for no reason.  

I‚Äôm ready to take my four months of vacation and then quit.

TL;DR: Boss never communicates with me.  Says I do good work, compete my work, but takes issue with how I do, and dismisses everything I try to do.  If it weren‚Äôt such a crazy world, I would just quit.  It‚Äôs stupid little things which drive me over the edge. Genuinely look for perspective cause I‚Äôm just fed up.

1057,"Covid19 firing from Job

Hi - I‚Äôm posting from a anon account. I‚Äôm going to use letters to represent each person at my employer. I work for an agency to assist people with developmental disabilities. 
L - HR 
A - direct boss 
R - supervisor 

On March 23 my daughter (4 years old) daycare announced closure due to COVID-19. I am a single parent (my job has always been aware of this), I don‚Äôt live near family or friends. I took a leave of absence to care for my daughter since her school closed and I could no longer fulfill my hours at a consistent basis. My work approved a LOA on March 24. My last day of work was March 31st because my daughter was able to go to her dads for thay period of time while he had a week vacation. 

On June 2nd, A (my boss) texted me and asked how I was doing...I answered and told her I haven‚Äôt heard anything from the day care center reopening as of yet. 

On June 11th, the daycare center announced thay they will reopen July 6. That same day I reached out to A, making her aware of this and stating I could come back to work then. We went over hours. 

On June 25th, A texted me stating that her and her supervisor, R, would like to have a meeting with me in the office since my LOA ends June 29 (this was the first time that date was ever made aware to me). I explained that I couldn‚Äôt come into the office as I‚Äôm still home with my daughter but we could do a zoom meeting. They agreed. 

On June 29, we had a zoom meeting going over my schedule starting July 6. They had no issue with me returning to work that week..never was I made aware of the possibility of me losing my job if I did not truth June 29. During the meeting, we went over my schedule and hours I was able to work. They agreed. 

On July 5th, A, texted me a schedule stating Monday July 6. We confirmed. 

On the night of July 5, I was admitted into the hospital with acute pancreatitis and needing surgery. Before admitting me, they tested me for COVID 19 - my test came back positive..I then texted A and R making them aware that I now have to self quarantine at home due to a positive result. Again, at no point did anyone tell me I was no longer an employee. 

On July 7, I asked A if she could have HR call me to go over my insurance...no one called me 

On July 8, when I returned home I called HR (L) and left a voicemail, I received nothing back. 

On July 15, I sent an email to HR and asked for answers, no one got back to me. 

On July 17, HR assistant called me and said ‚ÄúGo ahead and apply for NJ family care, your insurance ended July 6th‚Äù. Again, no speak of my current employment status... 

Now that I lost my employers insurance, I am now waiting for approval from the state which could take 30-45 days. At this time, I called R to ask if I could work part time or per diem hours because I didn‚Äôt want to sit home doing nothing and I was cleared of covid from the health department. 

She called me back Monday 7/20 and stated that they aren‚Äôt willing to let me do per diem and are not willing to offer me part time hours. She made several comments about me having covid 19 and being more susceptible, she mentioned my health issues such as my surgery. Again, no options were given to me. My surgery isn‚Äôt dire - I could push it back a month or so if that‚Äôs meant I wouldn‚Äôt lose my job. 
 

I‚Äôm wondering if this is legal, do I have some sort of case against them? Disability or FMLA were not offered to me. Again, my employer had no issue with me returning to work 1 week after my LOA ended - they had an issue once I was diagnosed with covid. 

Any advice would be great. Thank you!",23Jul2020,1

one of my first posts so i apologize if it is not to standard.

we are going to call my friends 1( 17, M), 2(17 M), and 3(16 M).

I text friend 1 on tuesday afternoon to see if he is free wednesday. He tells me he is going fishing on lake ontario with his father. I wish him luck, i then call friend 2 to see if he is free, He tells me him and Friend 1 are going to mow lawns in 20 minutes. About 30 minutes later i check snapchat to see that friend 3 has a long car ride ahead of him, I ask him the destination and he leaves me on open.

The next day (wednesday) i wake up and go about my normal routine. I check snapchat to see friend 2 post pictures of himself and friend 1 with nice sized salmon. I then see that friend 3 has also posted pictures of himself on the boat. i then blocked them all and am trying to figure out what to say to them when we eventually talk.

I have known friend 1 and 2 for 6+ years and friend 3 for about 4 months. Right now i feel betrayed and forgotten about. None of them told me they were going together and friend 1 and 2 lied to me. Friend 2's birthday is in 4 days and his plan was to go white water rafting, i am unable to go due to my immune system being shot.

yes, i know that it should not matter much that i did not go on the trip, you are right. However this is not totally about going on the trip it is about my friends leaving me in the dark and lying to me.

i asking if i should drop all of them or some other solution.

1074,"So this is kind of a long story so please bare with me. I live in a pretty large apartment complex and there are a couple of ""outdoor"" cats. One of these cats (Luna) is very well fed and has a collar. I've never met his owner but Luna is very well cared for-he's kind of chunky and always clean. 

The other cat, Momma, is not so lucky. 
Apparently her owner had shaved her at one point because her fur got matted, and momma is also kind of skinny and has no collar. I have met her owner and she is a very nice lady. She seems to be ill, I believe that she has cancer, and so she is usually home. Let's call the owner Kim. I met Kim for the first time when I was carrying a very large and heavy box by myself, and she saw me struggling and helped me. We chatted just for a few mins and it was a pleasant meeting! The next time I met her, I was walking through the complex and saw a shaved, weird looking cat meowing at someone's back patio door (it was Kims door and her cat). When she saw me, she started talking to me and was very friendly. She told me that Mamma loves to be outside and goes crazy if she's not let out for a few days. Apparently Momma even broke the screen patio door once in an attempt to get outside. That's the time I also learned about why momma was shaved. We ended that conversation also on a friendly note. That conversation was about two months ago. 

Fast forward to this week, momma has been left outside for the past three days. Momma has been whining to go inside for these last few days and has not been let in. I know this cat likes to be outside, but momma is not an exclusively outdoor cat. I have seen her in and out of kims place multiple times. Momma has water outside and there's some scattered cat food on the concrete patio. Kim has been in and out of the house these last few days so I know that she is around. Her car has also been in the parking lot for the last two days. Kim also must hear Momma as she keeps a window cracked open in her apartment, and mommas meowing to be let in is very loud. I have become friendly with Momma, and every time she sees me, she meows and goes to the window that is cracked open. I know momma wants me to open the window so she can get inside but it's clearly not my place to let this cat in Kim's house. I also want to note that Kim clearly puts things out for momma, like chicken, but it's very dry and old and I'm not sure that it's good for her to be eating. 

I am just at a loss at this point and really need help with what to do. I want to knock and ask Kim what's going on, but I don't want to seem condescending or imply that she's being neglectful (even though she kind of is).

1077,"I know this will sound really silly to a lot of people, but its causing a lot of discord in our family and I'd appreciate any advice that could help me out here. 

I'm F(19). I have a younger brother (M16) and a younger sister (F13). We all live together in one house with my parents. Because of COVID, my parents dont want to let me live on campus, so this is an issue that I want to get to the bottom of before I start classes so I'm not stressed out and upset all the time.

Whenever I clean the kitchen, I: 
-Wash the plates
-Arrange everything into its correct place
-Scrub and wipe down the counter 
-Scrub and wipe down the stove
-Sweep and mop the floor 
-Tidy up the dining table

This is what I do everytime my kitchen day rolls around (Sundays, Mondays and Thursdays.) 

My siblings however, ONLY wash the plates and wipe the area around the sink/plates. I've brought this up multiple times to my parents but they havent done anything about this. When my day comes by, theres so much to sweep, so much stuff caked on the counters/stove, etc.

Now here's where the problem comes in: 

Everyone eats and sleeps at different times because of quarantine. My siblings and I now sleep from 6am to about 2pm. Then the rest of the afternoon, night and early morning, we're awake. My parents have work so they sleep normal hours (11pm to 6am). So it's hard to wash plates immediately after a meal time because everyone eats at different times. So my siblings and I all decided we would clean the kitchen before we went to bed (2-3AM).

So now, for example, when my brother ""cleans"" the kitchen on early Thursday morning, he will only wash the plates, leaving the kitchen looking messy. Now its officially Thursday (my day) and the kitchen looks like a pig sty, and since he's already handed it off to me, everything in the kitchen looks messy and it's now considered my fault that the kitchen is messy.

But when I clean the kitchen and I do everything that is stated above, their days dont look as messy because I've cleaned everything already and the most they have to is tidy stuff up. 

My mom came home from work today and the kitchen was messy and she started shouting at me about how I can never do anything right. It really hurts my feelings because I put so much time and effort to ensure my kitchen days are sparkling once I've finished cleaning up, but my siblings get all the credit for clean days and I'm being shouted at because ""my days are always dirty"". 

I guess I'll just start washing twice a day but I feel like it's not fair that not only will I be taking my college classes come August, (and my class schedule is really full on Mondays and Thursdays) but I'll have to basically do my siblings day and then also do my own day.

I feel like no one is appreciating what I do. I cook lunch and dinner for my parents everyday on top of all the cleaning and the cleaning has gotten so much since everyone is at home at the same time. I havent been allowed to leave the house since March.  I'm just starting to feel burnt out. 

I would appreciate any advice on how to approach this problem. I know it's kind of silly. I'm really sorry for the rant.

TLDR: I clean the kitchen really well but my siblings dont. They dont clean the kitchen as well as I do and when it falls on my day, I am being blamed for the messy kitchen. However, when I clean the kitchen, my clean kitchen day falls into their day and it looks like their days are more clean than mine. I'm being accused of always having a messy kitchen day  and not doing anything. I dont know how to move on from this issue.",23Jul2020,1
1078," This sounds really stupid but before lock-down I didn't have much social anxiety. I could talk to girls and guys without feeling really on edge and looking awkward. However since lock-down I've been doing nothing but university work for 4 months straight with minimal social interaction. I went out to the pub today with my friend, and I hadn't been to the gym in ages so I felt self conscious that I lost loads of muscle, and that I was to short because I'm only 5 ft 8. There was a girl who was definitely into me but I didn't feel confident enough or mentally awake enough to flirt back. So in the end I kept going to the toilet whilst not being comfortable enough to talk to anyone in the bar.  


What the fuck is wrong with me. Why do I feel so self conscious, and how do I get my old confidence back?

1083,"Sometimes I find myself stuck while trying to complete a certain task. For example, when I am writing a response to someone in the programming community, I can spend hours trying to come up with a simple message. The worst thing is that I totally don't feel that I made a progress (which triggers a ton of negative thoughts because I spent hours for nothing). If I put aside the task for a while, I will have to return to the task as if I did nothing. Sometimes I cannot finish the task after several tries, which hugely impacts my self-confidence.

My observations on this. I think that the root cause of it is that I tend to leave some thoughts 'unfinished', i.e. my thinking process is a series of undeveloped assumptions and conclusions. For instance, when I write an email, I build my message on sentences that are poorly connected with each other. I write in a style as if I am googling. As a result, the message barely makes sense and I find myself stuck because I confused myself. Similar stuff happening when I write the code: I write pieces of code that make sense once I write them, but later I am jumping from one to another and don't understand how to connect them all together.

Do you know the reasons why it happens?  what advice can you give to overcome this?

 I am a 15M almost 16 in a little under a month. So obviously I need my own space which I have but due to the virus my little cousins (6F and 8M) and their parents are over at my house because their city (New York) is a hot spot granted I live in Florida which is now a very hot spot. But anyways they came down here about a month ago. My parents are a bit on the richer side so I have a lot of things that most people my age don‚Äôt have. (A 5,000 dollar gaming pc, a Samsung curve monitor, a go-kart, expensive soccer and football equipment that I don‚Äôt even let my parents touch only me.) well anyways on the first few days they go around touching my stuff even after I tell them to stop. Eventually I go and tell my mom that they aren‚Äôt stopping she goes and tells them to stop. They stop while she is there and watching but once she leaves they start again. I told my mom and she told their mom. Their mom comes into my room yelling at me because I can‚Äôt handle her kids. I told her to get out of my room and take your spoiled entitled kids with her and she flipped at me. She was calling me a spoiled brant and a rich kid. (I understand i have a habit of being spoiled) i just walked out of my room and when to talk to my mom. She got my aunt out of my room but the kids stay. At this point I don‚Äôt care anymore and just try to ignore them. A week or so goes by without much problems. My little boy cousin wanted to learn how to drive the go kart which I don‚Äôt mind him learning how to drive it figuring it would get him to leave me alone. But his sister has other ideas she went in the house crying saying I‚Äôm not letting her learn how to drive it (keep in mind she‚Äôs 6 and she‚Äôs very short for a 6 year old) she goes to her dad (my uncle) and says that she‚Äôs not allowed to learn it. My uncle tells her that she is too young (my uncle is the one blood related to me, him and I get along well) but spoiled little girl comes back out crying at this point I just snap I told my little cousin (the boy) to get out and I went to put away the go kart. They chase me to where I park it crying. I y‚Äôall at them telling them to shut up and stop being cry baby‚Äôs and that I‚Äôm sorry you guys aren‚Äôt mature enough. I then go inside slamming the door in front of them. I went to my room and locked the door. A few more days go by and i haven‚Äôt allowed my little cousins in my room and I haven‚Äôt even left my room besides for food and drinks. But then my friends birthday party comes around so I leave the house for what was planned to be 4 or 5 hours but my friend is my ex‚Äôs brother (we broke up around 5 months ago so I could focus on sports) (the breakup was before the virus when sports where still going on) but now that they aren‚Äôt her and I start talking again and I end up staying the rest of the day till about 11:30pm when she drives me home. I come into my room to tired to notice anything wrong but in the morning I see that my gaming pc is flipped over and the glass is shattered on it. (The glass is very hard to shatter) so I call my little cousins to my room and ask who did it they weren‚Äôt saying anything but were smirking so I knew they did it. I yelled at them and told them and their parents to get out of my house and leave me alone. The kids ended up crying and their parents and I got into an argument. I told my mom to make sure they didn‚Äôt touch anything of mine and when out to lunch and spent the rest of the day with my now girlfriend again. My girlfriend (we will call Kate(not her real name)) end up going to my house and go up to my room. We chill and watch some movies and around 1:30am she falls asleep spending the night at my house. I wake up around 9:30 and Kate is still sleeping (I feel it‚Äôs important to point out that Kate and I have been friends since kindergarten and before we broke up we‚Äôre dating since I was 11 and she was 12 so my parents are very comfortable with us sleeping ‚Äútogether‚Äù (not sexual most of the time) so my parents don‚Äôt care if either of us spend the night at each other‚Äôs houses) but I go into the kitchen and start making breakfast for myself and Kate. I finish making breakfast and take it to my room but my aunt saw me and asked why I needed to plates. Apparently she didn‚Äôt know that Kate stayed over. She started yelling at me and I just told her to F off then went to my room. A few hours later Kate goes home and I go and get ready to practice soccer with my dad. I go into the room I store all my equipment and find that someone has gone through it all and messed it up. I go to my parents and asked if they went into it and they said no. So I asked my little cousins and they started smirking so I yelled at them again and their mom walks into the room calling me nasty saying I had sex with Kate while her kids where in the house and how I could‚Äôve scared them for life. Kate and I didn‚Äôt have sex. She was just thinking of excuses to take the blame off of her kids. I go to my mom and tell her everything. Now my uncle is understanding and is siding with me along with my parents but my aunt is siding with her kids. My uncle offered to get a hotel and take the kids and his wife and leave but I feel like I‚Äôm making their life much rougher than it has to be so I told him if they can just leave me alone and don‚Äôt touch any of my stuff. He said he would try and that‚Äôs where we are at now. Sorry that this is very long and probably makes no sense at all. My little cousins are banging on my door and aren‚Äôt stopping so I keep losing my thoughts. What should I do now?",23Jul2020,3
1089,"So, a follow up to my crazy mother. She still hates the fact that im taking antidepressants (which btw are helping!) 
But today was a whole shit show. This morning i woke up and has breakfast in the kitchen like my mom tells me to do. So i did and then i put my dishes in the sink to clean later.
¬†¬†¬†¬† Well, that's illegal apparently, because she yelled at me and told me ""you make to many dishes"" my solution? Lock myself in my room and don't touch anything of hers, that way, NO MESSES. That way if there's a mess it's all her, because i stay in my room. 
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† After that i was drawing like i usually do, I'm an artist after all. So i always listen to music or watch YouTube while i draw, but that's no good because then i can't hear my mom telling me what to do. She asked me to go buy cat food, which i would have to carry home by hand because she uses the car, clean the backyard, and check the air in the tires for the car. I didn't hear her say this so i didn't do any. 
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† She didn't like that, and went to the store herself, she drove, but i would've had to walk because she wont let me drive. So when she gets back she starts yelling g at me saying im lazy, and proceed to try opening the 9kg bag of dry food. It won't open, she she gets angry and starts yelling and rips it open, flinging the whole thing at me and throwing cat food everywhere. 
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† After that she calls me a lazy bitch and tells me ""i don't want you to go with me, you're lazy and you're staying home"" (note: i am in the car with her right now, going with her) she kept yelling at me and saying she ""will never ask for help from me again"" and ive just decided to ignore her. 
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† So for the past week or so I've been spending all my money on her and buying her coffee and making dinner, and i told her this. She has the audacity to try to one up me by saying ""well I've spent money on you all your life, and ive made you food all your life."" Like wtf? That was your choice, you wanted to have a kid.
So about 30 minutes pass and we're in the car, she doesn't know the address to where we're going, she gets mad because i wont talk to her, and she throws her phone at me. Ok? I'm still ignoring her now, with a migraine because she wouldn't stop yelling at me.

1090,"Throughout the entirety of my academic career, from elementary to where I am now (third year community college student) I have done rather poorly. My work ethic has been the absolute worse. I constantly get these episodes of extreme motivation and inspiration that always fall short and result in nothing but stagnation. The only thing I can say for certain is that whatever I end up doing must allow me to create and to some extent give to others in some way. For quite sometime now I have been obsessed with the dream of being some sort of writer. I have considered teaching English as a foreign language so that would open up the possibility of traveling the world while teaching a subject I enjoy immensely and I could write in my free time. Although I am fortunate enough to at least have some narrow idea as to what field I want to venture in, my issue comes from not being able to take that first step. It's as though the dream alone is enough to sustain that incredible feeling of knowing your place and having a sense of direction. I don't read or write nearly as much as I should, I don't study enough, I always have a strong start each semester and routinely fall off after exhausting my effort.

However, this is where it gets sticky. Since he was 17 Bob became addicted to cocaine, I don‚Äôt think this makes him a bad person in any way shape or form, I feel sorry for him to be honest.

I‚Äôve borrowed Bob money on several occasions and never received a penny back, I think I‚Äôm around ¬£500 down now. Bob likes to blame his drug addiction on everything and anything but himself, his mental health being the main culprit. He claims he sniffs coke because he‚Äôs depressed and he‚Äôs depressed because he sniffs coke, a sad, vicious cycle.

1096,"I'm going to post this here because I'm tired, mentally, of sending this message to lots and lots of redditors through PM who have helped tremendously and supported me positively. I'm going to post this publicly now as my way of ending this once and for all. It's been too long:

""This is a message I also sent to another redditor on r/breakups about a situation with an ex but this time I want an answer in a r/exnocontact context. 

Yes! Thank you. I'll split my situation into parts so its easier.

 1. Well, from the beginning. In June my ex girlfriend broke up with me because she said she didn't love me anymore. I was very sad because it had been a 1 yr 9 month relationship so evidently that's a nice, long time. The problem is that on that day I got sent a screenshot from a friend showing me her profile on tinder. Well the break up stemmed from that. I couldn't stay quiet so I sent her a text asking her why she has a profile and she said she had created it a week prior just out of curiosity. My memory fails me but to sum it all up I surprisingly didn't have any hard feelings. She initiated the usual unfollowing in social media and I noticed and I told her no because regardless of what happened I still considered her very important in my life and didn't want her out of it. Was I weak? Who opens up tinder while in a relationship? Should I be more mad than I showed?

 2. Well, this is the part where I talk about MY mistake that I'm not so sure how to feel about. Fast forward to early August, j was bored one night and I download bumble the dating app. I swipe right on everyone to see what comes up and to my surprise I matched with a girl that I recognized. Well, this girl went to High School and is friends with my ex. I have this girl on snapchat so I sent her a message asking her if we matched for real or if it was a joke. She said she swipes right on people she knows. We got into talking and she said she would date me if the situation were different but she doesn't mess with friend's exes. I asked her how she thought I looked and she said I'm pretty attractive. Well I asked her what if we got some ice cream and we did. That's all fine until we start making out. The next she tells me how she feels like a bad friend and a bad person for doing that with me and all those things. Around the weekend she tells me how she told my ex about it because she didn't want to lose her in her life and because she felt too guilty. Well I noticed a change abruptly because my ex blocked me on her phone and her WhatsApp and snapchat. Since then, I messaged this girl again asking her if she made me look bad with my ex and she swears she told the story completely including how she held me back a few minutes because she was enjoying our kisses. I have tried to message my ex to tell her I'm sorry and all this nice stuff but it won't work. Considering she was on tinder behind my back, what's my position on apologizing to her? I was single when that happened and her friend is also guilty. Why would you think she blocked me? Another friend told me she didn't need that kind of toxicity in her life? Thank you""",23Jul2020,1
