It’s getting quite chilly where we live and we have a heater to put in our room. We previously lived in my parents house which has fancy heating systems in the floor so never needed to use a space heater. Is this enough space from the bed? It’s about a metre and a half. Is there any danger with the drawers if there’s no clothes sticking out? Ignore the stuff next to the drawers, it’s going to be moved.

1,"Hi,

I want to make clear that I'm not being hurt physically, it's more psychologically hurt.

B: person that I'm having trouble forgiving

It is someone I live in the same house as, I'm not able to move away from this person, I am also not able to get other outside help/advice. I have tried speaking to family members but I feel that there isn't really anyone currently in my life that would say something other than to forgive and have faith that B will change. I also can't buy anything or make calls to anyone without permission. I don't think I can approach B, I feel that they only feel sorry when they get caught, they regret nothing.

B has been this way for as long as I can remember. I would end up forgiving and forgetting, but eventually, I would get hurt again whether it be something rude/offensive B said, talking bad about me behind my back just to make themself appear to be the better person, stealing something of mine or just destroying my stuff. An incident that happened about a year ago, justice wasn't served, my parents lessened the punishment B received to practically nothing. It was the last straw for me, I decided that I would no longer forgive and forget, I would resent B no matter what B did unless they were to change their behaviour, I would prevent the incidents from happening in the first place. B has still been rude and steals sometimes but showing resentment toward them seem to allow me to be alert so that my stuff wouldn't be stolen or ruined (or at least I would be able to recover my stuff).

I know that it is wrong to be resentful toward someone but I don't want to be hurt again. When I think about the things B has done, it still hurts. When I see them/think of B I can't help being resentful toward them. I'm not openly mean to B and don't do to them what they did to me, but I am not nice to them, I favour other people over them. Sorry that this is a bit long, I hope I'm making sense though. Thanks for hearing me out.",06Apr2020,2
2,"Im aware this question has probably been asked but whatever. Im not gonna give a whole ass life story but the last few years I’ve seriously fucked my life up in a whole lot of ways, but now I’m doing a lot better comparatively. 

I feel I can finally start making positive changes for myself but Im constantly trying to shake off this phantom that lurks behind me - procrastination. 

Ive spent too long living in anger and pushed myself into adopting an ‘I don’t give a fuck about anything or anyone anymore’ mindset just to escape, but now I can see a distant light at the end of the tunnel, I need to shake that mindset or I don’t know if I ever will.

I don’t really know if any of this makes sense, I hope it does cause this was just a spur of the moment thought that I really need advice on this. thanks

3,"Hi, I’m 15. My Father, aged 56 now, had a very rough upbringing. He was blamed by his father (my grandfather), who was an abusive alcoholic, for the death of his mother when he was 9 years old. He was, both literally and figuratively, the punching bag of his 2 older brothers, whom he has now become largely estranged from. For the past 20- odd years, my Mom has told me that he’s been very depressed; he’s been in the same job that hasn’t been providing him enough financial security, he’s been very inactive in his relationship with my mother, and a number of events - including a bad car accident of my Mother’s 2 years ago, the death of his father, and his brothers’ unfair alteration of my grandfather’s will (which essentially stole the house that should have gone to my Dad) - have compounded to create the state my father is in today. He rarely talks, will often leave the table while we’re eating to go to bed, and doesn’t come home until late at night.

Recently, one of his friends let me know that he’s been courting another woman without my mother’s knowledge, and has been following her to her home, and ‘touching’ her without her consent, to the point where it constitutes sexual harassment. After this event, he left a note apologising for his actions.
He’s confided in his coworker that he ‘doesn’t want to come home’ after work, due to his relationship with my mother, as - due to my little brother’s high anxiety - he has to sleep on the couch; my brother only feels secure sleeping with mom. On top of this, he has been ‘roaming the streets’ of our town at night, and to his co-worker seemed ‘like a lost soul’. Said co-worker also informed me that he’s suffering from suicidal thoughts; this is by and large the most concerning aspect of my father’s condition. He has been on antidepressants for a number of years, but they really don’t seem to be helping at all.

My Mother was only recently informed of Dad’s behaviour, and doesn’t know that I’m aware of it too. My mother has often said that she’s ‘given up hope’ on dad. She’s been pushing him to attend various psychologists for the past ~25 years, and has on multiple occasions urged him to seek a better job, or change his conditions - but he seems stuck in his ways, and to some extent it feels like he’s ‘shooting himself in the foot’, to gain sympathy. His co-worker has offered him a number of business opportunities, all of which he has declined, yet he still very often complains to our family and his few friends about his lack of financial security.

To my father’s credit, he was heavily drinking for a period of time after my mother’s car accident, but gave it up cold turkey after she was hospitalised and he would have to drive us to school and back. He has also recently been making the attempt to go to counselling, although his coworker informed me that he had bailed on at least one of those appointments. He’s also - despite our financial circumstances - spending extra money, as he’s recently picked up his drinking habit again.

Whenever the rest of our family tries to bring these issues up with him, he’ll withdraw into a ‘shell’, often getting defensive and basically mute. It’s at these points at which he most resembles a child, and our theory is that he actively reverts to the 9-year old version of himself that he was never able to surmount given his ‘responsibility’ for his mother’s death. Personally, I’ve tried numerous ways to get through to him: going on walks with him to get him to open up, giving him books that helped me through my own bout of depression, and simply sitting down and talking with him, but all things considered, it seems like none of these things are effectual in getting through to him, and they feel like they fall upon deaf ears. I’ve asked my own psychologist about the issue, and she has mentioned that we can lead a horse to water, but we can’t make it drink. I understand this notion, but 20 years of depression is too long for anyone to endure, and with my dad’s recent behaviour, I feel that we’ll have to take action soon or risk something drastic happening.

I really don’t know what to make of this or how to deal with it. It’s certainly a lot to take on at my age, and I largely feel alone in this campaign: my little brother is only 12; my mother has ‘given up hope’. In some ways, I feel as though I am going to have to parent my father through this experience, but I don’t know how. Should I consult my mother first? Bring it up directly with Dad? Organise a whole-family meeting? I am honestly lost in all of this, and genuinely don’t know where to take it. I’d massively appreciate if anyone would be willing to provide their input for the best way to tackle this situation; I realise it will be hard work, but I thank you for any information you can provide.
Cheers.",06Apr2020,1

I’m a female if it matters...See I would really prefer one of those cool inconspicuous gamer tags like secret muffin or some shit, *specifically* so guys don’t just outright know I’m a woman in games by my name. I don’t dig the harassment. Any advice on coming up with a good tag??",06Apr2020,2
8,"Okay, so some background.

I used to use an app that i'm not going to name that let you join different communities and talk to people with your interests. I met two people, and we talked virtually for a while. One of them was trans, the other was bi, and I'm straight as an arrow. So, i leave my phone at home, and my brother goes through it, sees the conversations (some of them explicit) and acts like he didn't go through my phone.

Cut to now. He's been blackmailing me for close to two-theee years now, after I quit the app. He says that he'll expose me for being gay and make me ""come out"" to pretty much everyone I know. I can't do anything about it. He has complete and total access to my phone, since I have Face ID on my phone, and we're identical twins. He knows my password (I can't change it without telling my parents, they just want to go through my phone without  a hassle), he knows every app I have, and he just keeps BLACKMAILING me.

If I say ""I'll beat you in [Insert game here]""? ""Guess i'll have to tell everyone you're gay."" If i don't get him something he wants? More blackmail, and more and more every day. It's gotten to the point he can hit me and batter me, with the threat of saying I'm gay and me not being able to do anything about it.

I can't fight back ( I'm 130 pounds, 6'1, he's close to 170 pounds of muscle and 6'0), I can't tell anyone, and I can't stop him hitting me every day and blackmailing me.

Any advice is welcome. I need to change my life and get this off of my chest and figure out how to stop this from happening again.",06Apr2020,1
9,"I gave up my job and my apartment so I could help my step dad out with my niece that he and my step mum have full custody of while he went to work,  because my step mother is in a different country after the death of her mother. 

My niece is type 1 diabetic so it's not a matter of putting her in care or with another family member you have to have gone through alot of training. 

Now, this is going to sound awful but just keep an open mind. I dont like my niece. She is a horrible, spoilt and very violent child. She threatens me, hits me, throws things at me and tells horrific lies when she doesn't get her own way. 

She was pulled out of school because of the virus so I'm stuck at home trying to get her to do her school work. Because she has no respect for me what so ever she flat out refuses. All she does all day is scream. And scream. And scream some more. Like blood curdling screaming because I dont give her icecream for breakfast or make the sky pink. 

I made the stupid mistake of leaving my car with a friend because my step mums car was available for me to use so I can't just pack up and go home (I have friends I can stay with until I get another job and house) and Im about 40 minutes away from any public transport. My step dad wont drive me home because he doesn't want me to leave because he cant find anyone else to stick them with her. 

Nothing he or I do is working. He threatens to send her away if she doesn't stop, gives her a hard smack on the leg or butt rings my step mother and has her tell her off but nothing works. So I need some advice. What can I do to stop the violent attacks and the screaming. 

I've tried everything, distracting her with other activities, threatening her with time out, following through with time out (she just follows me anyway) taking away toys/devices/tv remotes, ignoring her and walking away (again, she just follows me around and if I lock a door she body slams herself into it).

He has 2 children with 2 different mothers. 4 year old boy and 10 year old girl. I met the boy and he was the sweetest, we got along so well. I haven’t met the girl yet, she is raised by millionaires and apparently doesn’t want to see her daddy unless he’s spending money (at least that’s what I was told). She’s a girly girl like me so I think we’d get along anyways. 

I’m new to this though.. am I supposed to just be friends? Discipline them? I don’t want to step into the way of their actual mothers. I don’t have kids and my parents are married so it’s all new to me.

&amp;#x200B;

College Student

Age 22

Major Public Health + Biotechnology  w/ Biology &amp; Computer Science Minor 

Issue: 

I feel like my life is a mess and I don't know how to fix it. In  middle school and in high school I was a B+/C+ kid but I was program orientated. I worked for my neighbor council, I actually assisted in the making of several health policies for my area. I worked two jobs during high school, one in art the other in stem. The things that did back then have actually impacted my community for the better now. Unfortunately for me it was never enough. I was never good enough, I needed to do more, be more it was one of the reasons I manage to get a full ride to my top college. Once in college I struggled immensely, I had severe depression, I was sexually assaulted and stalked  for 2 years. My grades went to shit I couldn't get an internship because my grades went to shit. I was in and out of inpatient for suicide attempts. I just broke, and during this time I still picked myself apart. If I got anything lower than 90 on a test I would rip into myself. There were days I thought I had to earn the right to eat, because if I wasn't exceptional what  use was there for me? My junior year of college I managed to grab the reins and pick myself up. I kept my scholarship, changed my major added a minor and discovered I loved programming. First semester senior year my gpa was the highest it's ever been 3.59. I couldn't  believe it and still that little voice in my head told me it wasn't enough.  I only got the grade because people felt bad for me. At best I was  a diversity hire no one wanted to let fail and no matter how hard I worked I would always be what I am. I believed it. Now 19 credits in and my A's are slipping. I struggling to find an internship and pay for my extra semester. I feel like I've blown it and I'll never do well because I can't get passed this barrier that ill never be good enough. I don't even know what I want to do with my degrees. I don;t think I'll ever be able to find a job because I'm caught up on how much money I should be making. Maybe it's being locked up in quarantine but I  genuinely don't know where or what to do to help myself.",06Apr2020,2

So basically my boyfriend grew up with a friend group that call each other ""f*ggots"" and what not. My boyfriend supports gay rights, and has never said a negative thing, beyond using this slur. My two best friends are gay one male, one female. My male friend has been my best friend before we even started dating, maybe 7-8 years, he has a very cold sarcastic personality. My female friend is a newer friend, she is very sensitive, and emotional. We have been dating 4 years, i will say, i was fucking blind to how much he used the word. He used it while gaming with friends and i just never noticed until one day around my female friend he said it and she called him out. I later talked to my friend apologizing and made her aware he will never say it again, she was okay knowing that he isnt a homophobic person just ignorant and knew he could learn. My bf said my male gay friend uses it as well and doesnt care. i dropped it and he stopped. months later(today) i decide to message my male best friend asking him how he felt. apparently he was bothered by it.that straight people go around thinking they can say whatever. i feel extremely bad and assured my best friend that it had been handeled and that i was sorry for being blind to it for so long, he is not mad at either of us but he said he appreciated me reaching out about it. I feel like a terrible person, i had no idea, we had so many fights about this way before this happened but now i know it really does bother my best friend. What does that make me for letting it slide so long? I told him i love and support him and i made him understand edgy teen humore isnt funny its homophobic.

17,"I’m staying in my bedroom at my moms house because of the virus sending me home from my out of state college, which evacuated the dorms. This is also the same bedroom that I cried my eyes out and went through some deep emotional shit a few months ago when I went through a nasty breakup. When I got on the plane to go back to college after that breakup, I left it all behind me and restarted my life. He was from my hometown so it made it easier to separate that trauma from the life I have at my out of state college. 

For context, over winter break I ripped the bandaid off and dumped my abusive ex. He was the epitome of an incel living under the disguise of being the “shy nice guy”. I was his first everything. He did everything he could to make it known to me that I was beneath him, would rub his engineer money in my face, erase my bisexuality and insult my intelligence on the daily. He also put me in danger a few times. We dated for an entire year; it’s like I blinked and was suddenly in an abusive relationship. When I threatened to leave, he texted my teenage brother his suicide plan. Needless to say I dumped his ass when he brought my family into this. 

I moved on. I met someone new a bit into the next semester when I returned from winter break, and he is everything I’ve ever wanted in a partner. I feel so supported. There’s just something about being back here in this bedroom that is making me relive the trauma of leaving the abusive ex and I can’t stand it. My mom suggested that maybe I’m not over the ex yet, but I feel like I am. The breakup over winter break wasn’t sudden, it had been building up for months at that point. If anything, I’m more so reliving the pain of what it feels like to be abused rather than it having anything to do with him himself if that makes sense. 


TL;DR - I dumped my abusive ex over winter break, but now that I’m back in the bedroom at my parents house where it all happened, I’ve been reliving those moments again.

Well, due to coronavirus we had to socially distance ourselves from everyone and not have anyone over so we can't see Blue for a while. Then a 2 days ago i hear my sister crying and my mom came to see what's wrong. my sister told my mom that Blue's brother (who is about late 20s- early 30s, Blue is 16)
was coming into her room at night and lifting up her shirt/pulling down her pants to take nude pictures of her while she slept. Blue can't tell her parents because her brother pays all the bills and her parents are unable to get jobs, So if they told the police their family would be homeless. My sister asked if Blue could stay with us for bit since she's too scared to be at home and my mom said no. She's really strict about the quarantine and wants nobody over since my other sister (lets call her Green) has asthma. she straight up told my sister ""i really love and care about blue but right now her life isn't more important than your sister's"".

I'm transgender male and started presenting as male  about four years ago. I came out to my family and hoped it'd click for her without my help that she should adjust, especially for the kids sake. I can partially understand why she didn't, as my closer family also had trouble coming to terms, I wasn't out everywhere (ca. 1 year of school left, wanted to spare me the trouble) and she didn't want to confuse her oldest who was three at the time. However, I really think it would have been easier for them to change back then as he probably wouldn't even have remembered. I told her to contact me for coming out to them, because I thought it would be right to do it together. She knows her kids best and I know about the topic; I'd be open to any questions and she could child-proof my answers.

As you might have guessed, she did nothing. By the time #2 started using my old name my heart broke a little. He was so proud and now he'd have to relearn. That was maybe two years ago when I was living male fulltime already. She since had a third child while I started hormone replacement therapy, had top surgery and changed my name legally.
A few months before the latter two she accompanied me to my therapist because my oldest godson is a little shy and she was still worried for him, claiming starting school soon was already excitement enough for him. Later she disregarded everything we talked about as ""That women doesn't know [Godchild]."", which I understood but she could have told her right there that she didn't think her advice would work and we would have come up with something different.

After Christmas I asked her if she'd done anything yet to which she basically texted me the equivalent of ""Oops, guess I've missed a good opportunity.""
Similar thing when I had surgery: The kids only new because their dad asked about me in front of them. GREAT way to stir the conversation that way, but no.

She lived in a different state 2000 miles away from me. I thought she was fun and cute. We talked every day for months and FaceTimed for hours almost every night. After a few months of this we both fell in love and confessed our feelings to each other. This girl also really struggled with depression. Things between us were good, the long distance was hard but I guess you could say we were getting by. My depression started getting worse and worse and I was feeling lost. At the time I was seeing a therapist twice a week and taking medication for my depression and anxiety. 

Last August I decided to save up money and book a flight to go stay with her for 2 weeks. She lives with her mom who is very open and supportive of me and her relationship. She offered to let me stay and live with her. After returning home I saved up enough money and moved across the country right after Christmas. It was a very hasty decision which I know was a bad thing but I had a reason which I’ll get into now. 

She was really struggling with her depression as well and there were a couple nights where I wasn’t sure I’d hear from her again. She kept saying you need to get here already cause she wasn’t sure how much longer she could last being alone. I love her very much and can’t imagine anything happening to her. 

So now we jump to the present day. I’ve been here for a little over 3 months. I haven’t been able to find a job because of the quarantine and the job market here is already bad. They want to move into a new place that costs a lot more than I was prepared to pay when I moved. I’m almost out of money cause I had to pay some expenses I didn’t plan on. They can’t move into the place without my money and as it stands right now. I don’t have the money. I’m scrambling to try and find a job. 

I don’t know if I’m happy here anymore or if it’s just my depression. I miss my family. I miss my friends. I miss how things were. If I move back home the chances of me losing her are extremely high. I don’t know what to do. I’m scared and I feel trapped. Please give advice. Idk what to do.",06Apr2020,1

31,"I'm starting to feel ignored and very annoyed. I have brought this up a few times, but nothing seems to change.  I live with my girlfriend and her 14 year old son. We have all lived together for 3 years now. I understands social distancing has been hard on them she has been working from home and it has been 3 weeks since the schools closed. It's a little different for me because I work in the transportation industry so I do leave the house for work and I'm an introvert so I don't care much for social interaction anyways. The thing is my girlfriend is in the high-risk category for complications from covid 19 due to her underlying heart condition. So when we first started hearing about cases in the US we had a talk with her son about washing his hands really well and also stopped making unnecessary trips out of the house. Well starting last week she started letting her son go out of the house to visit friends or to go ride his dirt bike with friends. And she has had the attitude ""well they are out in the desert away from people"" I keep trying to explain to her that that would be solid logic if he was out there by himself but he is with friends. Now this weekend her friends who have been horrible the entire time about staying home have started stopping by the house. I'm not too concerned about myself I know I'm healthy enough that I probably would survive getting infected. But I told her it's not about us it's about stopping it from spreading so that someone's grandma that is in poor health doesn't get infected. I think what it comes down to is she doesn't want to be told how to parent her child or how to live her life but this affects all of us since we live together. any advice on what to say?",06Apr2020,0
32,"Okay so i’m gay and my old guy friend from 4 years ago recently reached out to me

He wants to get to know me again and he usually is very cold in texts or unclear on what he really wants. He drunk texted me saying he really is looking forward to meeting me, but when we were gonna meet he flaked and came up with a excuse imo. He also recently texted that he wanted to talk call me, he was drunk partying, i texted saying i was gonna call soon and he texted back a heart? When i called he asked about my sexuality but he couldn’t really get it out of his mouth and just ask it. But he also talked about girls so i got weired out. He wants to meet me but i don’t want to give mixed signals, how do i go about this? I don’t want to be hurt like i usually get but also don’t make him uncomfortable because he might not be out of the closet.

33,"A little relevant background:

I (26f) am the oldest of 6(ages 21,16,15,14,12), my parents had myself and my brother, got divorced,remarried, and each parent had two children with their new spouses. My dad married someone very young and immature. This over time ruined my relationship with my father. Him and his wife would regularly talk very poorly about my mother in front of me and my brother. This came to a head when my stepmom told me, to tell my mom that my summer job was an inconvenience to my stepmom and when I was at their house my mother would have to be the one to drive me to work(i was 14 and my parents lived about 20 min apart. It was also my dad and stepmoms idea that I get a job). I responded with a “why don’t you let my parents figure that one out” she ended up giving my dad an ultimatum and he picked her. This happened like I said when I was 14. Some time has passed and some events have come to my attention, I made the decision a long time ago that I did not want my dad in my life and ended up changed my last name. I’m very sad I do not have a relationship with my two siblings on that side. I found them both on Instagram, my sister(15) denied my request but my brother(12) accepted and we talked briefly today. I don’t know if my biological father/step mom know about this. I would love to reconnect with them and have a relationship. It’s hard because there is such a gap and there is a lot that has happened. Anyone out there have a similar situation? How did it turn out? Or how do you guys connect with a sibling 10-16 years younger than you?

36,"My relationship with my parents has never been great, my dad I have been told is abusive, he'd hit me for ""discipline"" but I'm actually terrified of him and can do anything, he's extremely controlling and tracks everything I do, and decides everything for me from whho I talk and when to what a wear say or do. He tracks my msgs calls, my location, decides who I talk to and when and is not supportive of anything. My dad and I get in fights sometimes and the last one we had was because he told me my mom doesn't care about me and basically tried to emotionally manipulate me into thinking I had no one but him but ultimately I think he's right concidering everything in my life is his choice

My mom and I have a ""lightswitch relationship"" we will be perfectly fine best friends for a while and then have lots of problems, my mom favourites my younger brother and it causes a lot of problems between us, the main on is regarding ""bed time"" if mom feels like it's time for me to go to sleep it's time for me to go to sleep, even if it's only  9 o'clock, even though I'm almost 16, and brother (just gone 10) doesn't have to and I argue with her over this.

Despite all this since half way through last Yr my relationship with my parents levelled out and things were getting better, bedtime thing and contill thing still happen but I've learned to live with it. At around 11 tonight we'll last night, my parents came upstairs drunk (at the minute I have no bedroom door due to decorating and general repairs in the hallway and a new doorframe being fitted atm so they can communicate with me from the hall now) my mom starts insisting I go to sleep, but I refuse and say only if my brother had to. She makes a squeakt sound as if to mock me and says ""who do u always bring it down to you and him"" ""stop being a little bitch""  

Following this I shut television off and get ready to go to sleep, my mom decided It was time for a drunk shower and got in, my dad in the bathroom with her. Not doing anything just lagmughing as she galls over a lot and the shower doesn't heat up because the hot water wasn't on. From my room I can hear her mocking me and saying things about me ""I'm irritating"" ""annoying little shit"" ""little bitch"" and telling my dad to go ""deal with it"" (it being me) my dad comes into my room and asks what's wrong I say nothing and insist I just wish to be left alone. (bearing in mind I have literally done or said nothing but question why I have to go to sleep now when my younger brother does not) he starts to get mean and his voice is angry, ""you know thhat shit don't work with me girl"" I asked him what he Is talking about and started crying, I suppose because I was scared, his tone of voice made me thhink he was going to hit me, he tells me to lie down and goes back to my mom in the bathroom, joinign in saying things about me. He comes back in all nice and sweet asking me what's wrong and its okay just go on my phone for a while don't worry. 

At this point I was angry and kind of glared at him he said what and I told him I can hear you both saying things about me from the bathroom. He says ""we didn't"" I can hear u I insist. He says oh and leaves. Going back into the bathroom. About 5 mina later they both come out asking what's wrong, I quite angrily say I can hear you chatting shit about me from the bathroom what the hell have u done seriously. My mom sighs and says soo needy. Tells my dad to deal with IT again. So my dad asks what's wrong and I say again. I CAN HEAR U. my mom yells so now it's all my fault whatever, do u rlly want to fight me right now now she's blaming me. Qt this point I'm not entirely sure what she thinks I'm blaming her for. She says fine and that she's going to bed an dmy dad joins her.

I don't know what to do, I don't want to be in this house anymore, I don't have anyone else I can live with, no money and I can't work until at least May (I get my national insurance number) I have tried to get a job already and have been told I need it first. I can't move out (even if I had money) until July when I turn 16 at minimum. Im scared and really confused at what happened or why. I understand they were drunk but this is the only problem influenced by alcohol so I don't think it had much to do with the problems. I have no idea what to do. Sorry this was so long.",06Apr2020,1
38,"I have a friend, I’ll call her A. She is such a great friend and i recently came to her with my mental health, which has been slowly deteriorating for about 4 years now, to the point I want to kill myself (which I never told her). 

To cut a long story short, I ended up having an anxiety attack through text (corona time) and she comforted me. Then I purposely unfriended her on a bunch of social media because in my head, she hated me now and I wasn’t good enough for her. I was too broken to be loved and especially by her. She wouldn’t like me after that so I cut her off. I have done this before and it has costed me a friendship before (totally different situation, we both needed to focus on ourselves and we couldn’t help each other, the friendship was just hurting us both so we made the decision to separate). 

It’s been 2 weeks. I miss her and I don’t want to lose her as a friend since she has been so amazing and kind and supportive as a friend. A also has mental health issues, but hers are much more tame and have been dealt with in healthy ways, while my parents have played a huge part in my horrible mental state, and I’m not allowed to get help until I’m 18 and can seek it for myself. 

How do I reconnect with her, what if she hates me now because I stopped talking to her suddenly? Or should I just wait until school starts again and hope she seeks me out?",06Apr2020,3
39,"Posting this on a throwaway account because the people involved with my main one might see it otherwise.  


I'm a 22 year old Male and over the past 6-7 years, I have developed an awful system that traps me in an unhealthy cycle that I have no idea how to break. I do not currently have access to professional help and all the support groups I tried didn't end up doing anything for me.   


In a normal, everyday state I feel almost nothing but apathy about myself. I feel for myself as much as I feel about a random stranger on the street. If I see them struggle, I go ""shame"" but keep moving. And I treat myself the same way. I had a lot of issues at home as a kid but was never able to voice them anywhere for a few reasons. And over the course of time, I really did not want to voice them anymore because I stopped caring about myself in that way.  


The only reason I still keep my body relatively healthy and my mind quick is because I care about others so much. Especially my friends and family and my amazing girlfriend. But that is also where the problem is. I only really live for them and not for myself because I just can't feel anything about myself. No like or dislike, just apathy.   


Recently, my girlfriend tried to coax me to speak more about my past or any problem I encouner during the day really but that is where the second part of my system snaps in place. Whenever this general state of apathy about myself gets disturbed, either by accident or on purpose, I instantly dissociate right then and there and feel absolutely nothing anymore. No physical touch, no pain, no stress but also all the affection for my family, friends and even my girlfriend is gone. I become absolutely hollow and numb for around 1-8 hours.   


Right now, I just came out of one of these cycles and I can see how frustrated and hurt my girlfriend is. I really just need anyone to give me some opinions about what I can do. If I don't care about myself and let the apathy reign, my body starts to suffer and sustain injuries and if no one is around to please, I cease to do anything until there is someone again. But if I do care about myself (or try to), my body forcibily shuts down all emotions and feelings and leaves me as a numb shell.   


Doesn't matter if it is advise, help or just opinions but I know something has to change so i'm ready for anything",06Apr2020,2
40,"* My husband and I are still fairly new to this building and are so mad currently. I just want to I that our apartment always smells fresh and clean when you walk in and always looks spotless even with having a 4mo old. We live on the west coast of Canada *

* this has been posted in r/tenanthelp but decided to post here too * 

So we have just received an anonymous, and somewhat upsetting hand written letter from one of our hallway neighbors. In the letter it said that the hallway smells like diapers and that they ask we take our garbage out more regularly. I am not sure why they have said this, to be quite honest this is very disheartening. We take our garbage out every single day, sometimes twice a day. We keep everything sealed so no odours escape, we keep our floors, surfaces and laundry, etc. clean and tidy. There are no smells that come from our apartment, which is why both my husband and I found that letter to be quite unusual and upsetting. 


We try our very best to be great neighbors, either by keeping noise to a minimum, saying hello and even being respectful in the aspect of cleanliness. Unfortunately we are not sure who wrote it as no apartment # or name was left on the note. But we are feeling hurt and saddened by this. What would you suggest we do? We want to have this dealt with as peacefully as possible but we are not thrilled with being wrongfully blamed or accused of creating smells that we never made. What irks me more is that we are all adults on this floor, and they could not bother to act like one and talk to us face to face or at least identify themselves. Very annoying. 


Last year, just after we moved in and and before I had our baby, the hallway smelled unpleasant as well and none of us were sure what had caused it. We had kept everything neat and tidy then as well. So I'm not sure what to do here sadly. Any ideas are appreciated and welcomed. We have emailed the building manager so hopefully she'll have an idea.

41,"Okay, so some background.

I used to use an app that i'm not going to name that let you join different communities and talk to people with your interests. I met two people, and we talked virtually for a while. One of them was trans, the other was bi, and I'm straight as an arrow. So, i leave my phone at home, and my brother goes through it, sees the conversations (some of them explicit) and acts like he didn't go through my phone.

Cut to now. He's been blackmailing me for close to two-theee years now, after I quit the app. He says that he'll expose me for being gay and make me ""come out"" to pretty much everyone I know. I can't do anything about it. He has complete and total access to my phone, since I have Face ID on my phone, and we're identical twins. He knows my password (I can't change it without telling my parents, they just want to go through my phone without a hassle), he knows every app I have, and he just keeps BLACKMAILING me.

If I say ""I'll beat you in [Insert game here]""? ""Guess i'll have to tell everyone you're gay."" If i don't get him something he wants? More blackmail, and more and more every day. It's gotten to the point he can hit me and batter me, with the threat of saying I'm gay and me not being able to do anything about it.

I can't fight back ( I'm 130 pounds, 6'1, he's close to 170 pounds of muscle and 6'0), I can't tell anyone, and I can't stop him hitting me every day and blackmailing me.

Any advice is welcome. I need to change my life and get this off of my chest and figure out how to stop this from happening again.",06Apr2020,2
42,"To give some context, my sister is in between the ages of 15-18 (not going to give the actual age due to privacy reasons). And I'm an age below her, I'm saying this because she isn't a small age like 6 or something and someone just say ""it's her age"" or something similar.

We got a 7 and a half week old kitten. I'm not gonna say where we got her from to spare some time. It was for my sister.

She is playful, she loves to run and pounce around, attack ankles, and attack things that make noise, like crumpled up paper. 

My sister likes to sleep during the night, and i stay up in the night and sleep in the morning (sleep 5:00 AM to 3:00 PM). My sister during the night would be waken up during the night to the kitten Meowing at her to play. So my sister decided to deprive the cat of sleep during the day for it to sleep at night, the kitten instead hides away from her under my sister's bed to sleep and doesn't like to come out.

Let me give some context on the beds in my house: My sister's bed has a tight squeeze to get under it, the kitten can crawl under and crawl around, but putting your hand under will hurt you because it's too tight, I have hurt my hands a lot from trying to get the kitten out. Every other bed in the house you can put your arms under fine, and even grab her. My sister's bed has a tight squeeze, and the kitten knows that. So it has gotten to the point that the kitten hides away from her when she sleeps most of the time, I've only seen the kitten sleep with her once since my sister started to deprive her of sleep, my sister hasn't seen to have done that in some time now so I think she has stopped.

I have searched up if you can make a cat sleep during the night, but they say ""play with it a lot during the day"" my sister doesn't play with her AT ALL. My sister ""playing with her"" is my sister on her phone (instagram and snapchat) looking at posts, and handing the toys to the kitten. My sister even for a few days made my play with her when I woke up, before I even eat, and then waits til she falls asleep, I can get food, but the kitten will whine for me to play. I actually play with her out of all my family in the house (dad, mom, sister, and me) I'll let her bite my hand playfully while petting her belly, toss paper balls, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Recently my parents got the kitten a new litter box with walls and a roof to stop the litter from getting on the floor so much. My sister put the kitten inside it, and went pee in her original litter box that had no litter in it, the two boxes were right next to each other for some reason, they should've been moved but I wasn't there to tell my sister otherwise. So my sister goes out and yells to my dad downstairs what has happened, I came out of my room to just watch what happens. My sister realizes that the pee is on my paws and goes and picks her up and tells me to wipe her off... but with what? I had nothing on me and I don't know were because my brain forgot in the moment, and my sister walking over to me says

""wipe her off"" multiple times

once my sister gets to the steps my mom throws the wipes up. and I grab it to take a wipe out and wipe her down, the problem is, the wipes had this tiny hole in the packaging to get them through, they're stuck, like when you have a can of beans and you pour them out and they're still stuck in the can shape, that's how the wipes were. So as I'm trying to get a grip on the wipes and get them out of this tiny hole, the kitten gets restless being held awkwardly and starts to shake around to be put down. I get mad because she's holding her wrong and these damn wipes won't come out so I throw them to my sister's feet and say 

"" do it yourself""

because it's not my cat and she's yelling at me the whole time to ""hurry up"" and then as i walk away my sister calls me ""useless""

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier I went downstairs to get a drink and I go over to the kitten in my parents room, my tiny dog (maltese and yorkskire mix) comes up, the kitten and dog are fine with each other (my dog is kinda scared of her tbh). So the kitten watches the dog but doesn't like it when he gets too close to her face to sniff and backs up/runs away or tries to hit him. 

The kitten is a messy eater so my mom gets a wipe and wipes her chest and chin off. She's a medium hair so gets poop also stuck in her hair. So I grab the kitten gently and set her in front of my mom to, now listen to me here, TO PICK HER UP, NOT for ME to HOLD HER, BUT for MY MOM to HOLD HER and wipe her poop out of her hair. But then my mom, as i set her down, grabs the kittens tail hard to hold her whole body from moving, and starts to wipe. The dog gets close to sniff so the kitten hisses at my mom and dog and I yell at me mom as i notice that she isn't holding the tail gently but hard, then my mom let's go and the kitten runs to the other side of the bed away from my mom and the dog. I tell my mom to NOT hold her BY THE TAIL, you don't do that to animals. Yet my mom replies

""but you weren't holding her""

You blame ME for YOU holding her tail hard and not letting her go?? I'm sorry but you're the one who volunteered to wipe her not me.

Then my family was in the kitchen talking about dinner, and I go to walk out and I realize that her toys aren't spread about, their bundled up like they were placed there, so I spread them out for her. Now, she had tons of strings and ribbons she plays with so all of her toys almost got into knots with the ribbons and strings.

So this whole time she was down stairs all she had to play with was a bundle of knotted toys? As I explained before they don't play with her and the ""playing"" they do is handing her the toys. But she could've been asleep and my sister could've put them together for there not to be a mess, but my sister doesn't clean her toys up like that ever. 

&amp;#x200B;

My mom and sister now are blaming me for ""stealing my sister's cat"" n' stuff because she seems to trust me more.

I told my sister about her sleeping under the bed and she says ""she sleeps under there for no one to bug her"" yet when she sleeps in my room she doesn't hide away and go to my sister's bed to hide, nor under my bed, she sleeps and cuddles with me in my bed. and she started to hide because my sister was depriving her of sleep.

I don't know what to do, I don't want to be blamed for ""stealing a cat away from my sister"" yet I'm the only one that really plays with her and stuff like that. The only thing my sister seems to do right to take care of her is clean her litter box and give her food and water.",06Apr2020,1

47,"Note: This isn't 'Murica, so my education is free. I'm only losing the money I've spent on food, housing etc and have saved up enough for a while during summer and weekend jobs. I have an almost guaranteed job if I want it. I'm not overly concerned with the economical side of things.

Some background: So I'm 20yo and I started college last year. I'm almost done with my first year. I'm going for what I think is equivalent to a Master's degree in engineering with a focus on AI. The full education is 5 years, with a few more optional years to get a Doctorate.

I do absolutely think that this is the education for me. I think it's super interesting and definitely want to work with this or something similar in the future, but recently things have been a bit tough. I wasn't prepared for the difference in teaching or speed from my previous school. This caused me to fail a few early exams and also having to really cram a couple of courses. This in turn has really made me lose interest in subjects I really used to like, like math and programming. They have now become a chore and not something I actively want to learn more about. And when math and programming makes up a solid 70% of the time I will spend here, I feel that the upcoming years will not be much better.

&amp;#x200B;

So what I need the advice for, from older and more experienced redditors, is should I take a sabbatical year in the middle of my education, to study up on the subjects I'm lacking in as well spend some time on my own projects?

Anyway my dad is actually usually very caring and kind but has explosive bouts of anger every so often. So for some context, I was feeling very depressed lately and got back into self harm, which made my parents upset. But more importantly, since it was a difficult time for me I did not complete some homework I was supposed to do. So when my dad saw me playing video games, he banged my laptop repeatedly on my desk, loud enough for the whole house to hear. Because of this I ran to the kitchen to get a knife (which I very much should not have done, so that’s my fault, but it’s also a behavior I got from my dad) because I felt so physically powerless against him. Except before I could grab one, my mom stopped me but this created the opportunity for my dad instead to grab the knife, and then he told me he’d kill me, and so my mom tended him off before he could hurt me with it and now I’m hiding with my sister. 

For some background, my dad lived a hard up life back in our home country. His parents physically abused him, and due to civil war he has killed people before, which is why I feel his threats aren’t so empty. 

Tl;dr my usually kind dad flared up over my homework and tried to kill me. I don’t know what to do.",06Apr2020,2

51,"pretty much the title. my brother is 20 and hasn’t lived with us since he was in like seventh grade. he has a different dad who died when he was little so he got a bunch of money from it and moved in with his grandma. he doesn’t have a job and now lives with his girlfriend. they have a pretty nice house and have more money then compared to what i have had growing up. 

recently i have been struggling with depression and loneliness due to my cousins moving out of our house so i am now the only kid left. just me and my parents. it really sucks but hey, i can live with it. my brother noticed and told his girlfriend, who suggested i move in with them. 

now i like my brother. and his girlfriend is awesome. but i don’t think i could move in with them. i have a lot of issues with anxiety and he really doesn’t help with that. if i say anything that he thinks is stupid, he will make sure i know it’s stupid. i cry super easily and he makes fun of me for it. 

another problem is that he is extremely racist. not in the way that he actually hates people, but he thinks it’s funny. he thinks it’s hilarious to say slurs about people. he’s not meaning it in a rude way but it still makes me uncomfortable. he constantly says the n word or homophobic slurs which really hurts cause i am a lesbian myself. and he knows it. but he thinks it’s funny. 

i really don’t want to move in with him. it’s an hour away from my parents and i have really bad separation anxiety. i just really don’t know how to tell him no since i technically already agreed with him. i don’t want him to get mad.

52,"How do I approach this with my friends without being accusatory/seeming like I don’t trust them?  

Info:
Two gaming controllers have been stolen from me (different occasions) and I’m assuming smaller things we haven’t noticed (I’m a cluttered person). It’s only been when we’ve gathered in groups of 4 or larger, so it’s hard to tell who it could be.

I only found out recently when my dad told me the correlations, so I didn’t get the chance to act right after it happened.

I trust my friends, even though we haven’t really talked during this quarantine or a few months before it, since we’re all in different stages in life (2 college, 1 nurse, 3 business people). But obviously someone doesn’t deserve the trust I’ve given.

54,"Hi! 

My best friend (22F) has been struggling with perfectionism, worrying and extreme fear of failure for years. She is highly intelligent (skipped two grades in school) and studies law. This fear is impacting her to the point that months before an exam she can't sleep properly, so she's constantly tired and unable to focus on studying, which then increases her anxiety and that in turn keeps her up at night ... as you can see, a devilish cycle. She saw a doctor because of her insomnia recently, but he didn't really help her, other than giving generic recommendations for healthy sleeping habits. She has been seeing a therapist for a few months now, but at the moment she says she's not really getting much out of that.

At this point, I feel absolutely clueless as to what might help her. Does anyone have experience with this? How could I support her, and what should she do...?

Thanks in advance!",06Apr2020,1
56,"I am in year 10 this year, but to prepare us for the IB our school has started doing the course in year 10.

And with the classwork we've been set while doing homeschooling, I'm not sure what I can do because it's incredibly difficult for me to learn the content without being taught it.

57,"My dad recently was told he had skin cancer, and that it is believed to be bad. He is 100% convinced he will die. This was all within the last week. 

I (19F) found out I was expecting my first child in February. I told my dad, and the only thing he said was “Well that’s great someone’s going to die”. “When you were born my dad died.” “When I had your brother your grandma died.” “Now your having a baby and god is taking me from you.” This obviously has put me in an odd predicament. I am personally not religious. I wouldn’t even consider my dad to be. But possibly because I think he is a hypocrite. He preaches the book to me, but has lived the opposite life. This phone call happened around four hours ago. And it has me so messed up mentally. For him to act like me getting pregnant is the reason he will die?? I don’t even know how to talk to him now. Does anyone have advice on how to deal with this? Confronting him is not an option, he will just tell me to open my heart to god. And well that’s not going to happen because I don’t believe in it.

59,"I'm asking for advice after I had a fight with a friend over something that is not worth the fight. Let's call my friend D. Sorry if I did something wrong, I'm new to Reddit and this subreddit. For context, I am a kpop fan while my friend is not. I like to share what I think about my favorite singers and I admit that I've had the usual celebrity crush on them.    However, I am not delusional and I don't believe that I'm going to marry my idols or date them. D doesn't have an issue with me bringing up kpop, and I try to minimize doing so since he won't be able to relate. 

Now, we had a fight two days ago in a Discord server. I was sharing that I got into a new boy group via a friend and was gushing over a guy from that group. Then, he proceeds to tell me that I should stop having these crushes and living in this ""fantasy"" because it'll ruin my relationships in the future. He also says that it's unhealthy, and that those idols are just putting up a mask.

Although I do have a lot of celebrity crushes, I tend to crush on the idols I have a lot of respect for. Ever since getting into kpop, I've developed more self confidence and self-love. I've seen how my idols are patient and understanding with people, and so I've learned to be more patient these days.

I got really flustered after D said that to me. I was telling him that it was just a simple crush, it won't hurt anybody. I'm not unhealthily obsessed, and that he's making a big deal out of a simple crush. And to be very honest, I felt frustrated that he only saw kpop as this big, terrible thing that took over me when I don't even know if we would be friends if I wasn't a kpop fan. 

Moreover, I was upset that D was saying that it would affect my future relationships by having me expect my significant other to be a kpop idol. For the record, I don't expect a kpop idol. Kpop has actually raised my standards of people in a good way, but that's for another story.

Now, from D's perspective, he was coming from a place of hurt. He's been in relationships while I have never been in one, due to personal reasons. He thinks I will get hurt when people won't reach my expectations or when I fall for someone's ""mask"". I understand where he was coming from, but I still held on to my view.

So after the mask comment from him, I tell him that any person can put up their own mask, him included. He's admitted to putting up his own mask in the past. 

I also add that although he's been in a few relationships, he's still not mature enough to love fully, so his advice might not be as helpful as he thinks. Then asks me why I might think that, and I said that all he cared about was s*x.

For background info, he has shared with me on how guys care about boobs, butts, etc. He's even said how he wishes his girlfriend had bigger boobs, to which I told him that he needs to love his gf for her and he acknowledged that.

However, I regret the s*x comment very much. It was the worst thing I could have said, and I know it's not true. I was really immature when I said that.

After the s*x comment, he kicked me out of the server and we haven't talked since. My other friend thinks that he should make the first move since he started the argument when I was just sharing a crush of mine. However, it's been two days and I've been getting anxious. I know I should apologize for what I said, but my friend said that I should after he makes the first move.

Should I apologize first or should he?

Tldr; I got in an argument with my friend about my celebrity crushes. He thinks it's unhealthy, I told him that he shouldn't act like an expert on relationships if he only cares about sex (which I regret) and now I'm wondering if I should make the first move or not.",06Apr2020,1

I'm 16 (m) and I have kind of  a problem. I'm pretty shy and I think I have a crush on a girl(she is 15 and we're in the same class ), look I like her voice ,her face ,her character just everything but I don't know if it's because I'am lonely and just want someone who cares about me and I can tell everything.She is pretty nice to me but I don't now if it's just beeing nice or morAnd even when I love her I'm too afraid too ask her because nobody likes her not even her ""friends""and it hurts me when somebody is talking shit about her but I'm too afraid to stop it because the they maybe don't like me anymore. And since another girl hurt my feelings pretty hard I'm afraid to open to other people. Another point is I can't talk to people in general and I start to stutter very fast and with the whole quarintane stuff I only can talk to her on Whatsapp. So should I use the time and just write her so when she do not answer I know she don't like me that way (I mean isn't it akward when I write her out of nowhere) or is this whole thing just a call for attention?

I’ve been with my boyfriend for over a year and a half and he has always been inconsistent. We’re serious, talk about a future together, he’s very close with my family, etc. But sometimes he randomly goes ghost. He switches up on me - refuses to see me, posts weird things on Snapchat (from sad song lyrics to “someone come lay with me” to make me mad when we’re arguing (but makes the settings to where only I can see it)), and won’t talk to me about what’s wrong with him. I love him so much and he’s an amazing boyfriend when everything is good but about once every month or two, he does this. Today he broke up with me and won’t give an explanation - this is probably the 15th time he’s done it. He says some not so nice things to me when he’s in these phases so it’s hard to handle.

68,"right so this has started becoming a problem about 18 months ago . my aunt has always had a couple cans but it was never anything major until 18 months ago i started to see her either asleep ( i say asleep because i wouldnt be able to tell is she had pass out because other than this i havent seen anyone pass out) on the sofa with a drink in her hand or on the armrest of the sofa. one night i wake her up and tell her to maybe cool it a little but she takes so much offence to it saying i dont' know what its like to live with someone with a drinking problem after a minute of her not listening i just go back into into my room but she follows me and tries to rant at me at the door of my bedroom but i am in no mood to deal with it so i try to close the door on her but she gets angrier things were said which were not the nicest but then the next morning she comes in starts crying saying she does have a drinking problem and that she will stop being naive as i was i said dont fully stop. 

then around 14 months ago its after christmas and the family dog died naturally were all depressed so when i go back into to school in januray i take a day off saying i'm not mentally up for it but later that night im saying the reason i really didnt feel like going in was because of my dog dying my aunt who has had a couple cans says thats okay but then goes on about how i shouldn't use it as an excuse. i said i didn't i even say wasn't feeling up for to avoid using that as an explanation but she i know just don't use it. the next morning she wakes me up to sorry and that that happened because she had a couple to drink and that its okay to say that what happened wasnt okay. i wanted to have a go at her but didnt feel it was to do so because of the state she was in after we lost our dog. 

so after around 5 months of tension due to other conflicts of personality she is again asleep on the sofa with a drink in her hand. i also forgot to mention when im talking to her after she has a couple cans she gets this attitude thats real passive aggressive and she goes into a good rant about a few things there was couple of those scenarios where she was like that because her and my ma are always asking me to have a drink with them. after i bring up how shes doing drinking so much she falls asleep with a can in her hand we get into a fight that was really bad where for two weeks i only spoke to her in one word answers and when ever i was in her car i had headphones on. eventually the fight stopped when she agreed to stop drinking but then later that day she asked was it okay to finish the drink that she had left in the house something i agreed to however ive noticed she ocassionaly  has a glass of wine however when quarintine started for the corona shes been having cans again and last night i saw her asleep on the sofa with a drink on her arm rest  and i had to shake her twice to wake her up. then i asked her how many she had she answered and asked why do you ask in a very defensive tone. 

what should i do to help her im out of ideas at this point",06Apr2020,1
69,"That probably sounds dumb but it's true. I don't get drunk drunk, but I do get really tipsy and I'm genuinely just a better person than sober me.

80,"I'd had an inkling for a while that my manager didn't like me and thought I was an idiot. Her behaviour, mannerisms, tone, words, and attitude all conveyed it, getting slowly worse for months. One day recently she was being exceptionally condescending and said sorry she was sounding condescending but didn't actually sound sorry at all, and continued to be so in later days and weeks, increasingly so. Until the other day I overheard her discussing one of the emails I'd sent to her with another manager and she was outright calling me stupid. (We have an open office and I sort of can't believe she chose to have that discussion where we could all hear it.) The other manager disagreed with that assessment, thankfully, which is probably another indicator that my manager's personal bias or dislike or whatever it is is colouring her judgement. I don't believe she could provide an objective, professional reference of my work history and performance anymore.

I have thought about resigning 100 times because getting treated like I'm an idiot has crushed my already practically non-existent self-esteem. My manager is not the only person at that job who is difficult to deal with and communicate with, but is the only person out of those difficult people who I get the distinct impression has a personal dislike or distaste for me. The others might think I'm incapable of doing the job or an idiot or whatever they think, but I don't get the impression it's a personal or active thought. I doubt they care less about me one way or the other - they just want things done right as they see it. 

All together I'm entirely baffled by my managers attitude. I really don't understand it. I haven't said anything because she hasn't been outright or blatantly hostile yet, but I'm really worried it's going to get to that point. I have been trying to do the best job I can and be the best employee I can, and to always try and learn and improve. But for whatever reasons she has, I get the distinct impression she would like nothing more than to not have me around.

So, the main issue with that is who to put on as a reference when applying for new jobs. I wouldn't really feel comfortable asking my colleagues, although there's one that I could potentially ask. My manager's boss actually seems to like me and doesn't treat me like an idiot, so I'm contemplating asking if she would be a reference. We don't have a great deal to do with the boss, although she does work in our office and as part of the team, and I've been working more directly with her recently as part of a project. She's sort of on the executive level of the company, so I'd be nervous asking her if I could put her details down as a reference.

I don't know how to deal with the situation with my manager, truth be told. I think it's almost unsalvageable. I don't know what I could say without her becoming defensive and getting upset. Everything I do seems to irritate her as it is, even the most benign things. I think the safest thing to do is just stay out of her way and not interact with my manager whenever possible, and not have her as a reference while I apply for new jobs. 

The whole situation has really upset me because I thought she was a wonderful, kind, and warm person for the first few months and she made a great impression on me, and because I really don't understand what I've done to so thoroughly change her attitude and behaviour. If I could find viable reasons for all of that I'd probably be fine, because I understand you don't need to like the people you work with and not everyone is going to like you. People just need to be able to work together professionally.

Problem is, my only other reference is a supervisor from two jobs ago. The previous job I had before my current one was an extremely toxic workplace with the highest staff turnover out of any organisation I've ever come across, and I left after 4 months. I've been in my current job for 7 months and I don't want to leave early if I can avoid it because job hopping doesn't look good, but the poor relationship with my manager causes me an enormous amount of stress and anxiety, hence the job hunt.

Any advice or recommendations are most welcome.",06Apr2020,1
81,"Hi, so

To start this off I met a really sweet guy who's 19 and lives a good few states away. Me and him met online (I'm 19 as well in NY).

We hit it off right away and kind of realized we had a thing for each other immediately by the playful flirting. We spoke out one night, and I bantered with him a bit that he sounded really interested in me, in which he replied he felt I was doing the same. Then, from there we both confessed we had a crush and decided to get into a relationship.

Now, I've dated before many times, but for some reason I feel really introverted to express myself to him. He's understanding that I'm a little shy and also is aware of my anxiety, which relieves me that he's understanding. But, I notice he's not always the type to initiate convo (Which I have nothing against at all.)

I also have a computer which does not perform well, while his is a good PC for gaming. We both share playing LoL but I've not really felt like touching the game in a while. I was wondering on some stuff I can offer to do with him or some ways to initiate really nice conversations to get to know each other better? I don't wanna go too fast, but I also do want to just know what some people think as to ways I can spend time with him and also fun things to talk about? 

ATM all I've been able to ask him is how he's slept, what/how he's doing, and just sharing some stuff I've been doing IRL to him. Thanks to anyone who's able to help. I truly care for him and wanna make us both more comfortable around each other :) And I know he cares for me too.",06Apr2020,1

 We have 2 car payments rent and phone bills not to mention gas for getting to interviews and groceries...with 68$ a week.... we have called and searched everywhere for help and received as much as we could get however...these bills will eventually be due in April and we're at an absolute loss.... I feel we can't be the only group of ppl in this boat. If you're in a similar situation id love to hear your plans or how you're coping because we both are in the mindset of everything we've worked hard for is all going to crash and burn because we have no means to pay for anything.",06Apr2020,1

85,"This is a throwaway account and email, it would be mortifying if anyone I knew read this. So basically to start from the beginning I go to a really small school that is basically catholic school. I can't really explain why the school is so small no one really knows. There are very few students and a lot of the students that are there are international students. That really isn't the issue but there is a significant language barrier that keeps us from interacting and in the end, both parties give up and since there is already a group of international students they feel at home. I am gonna try to limit the description of myself but just for some background, I am much younger than all the students I am in class with and it's pretty isolating. I don't have any close friends as all the ones I've had in the past left due to the situation in the school and we end up naturally drifting apart. When I entered 9th-grade last year every single classmate from the previous year transferred and I was alone, despite that fact I became close with two girls in my class that I had a large age gap with. It was pretty stressful being friends with people much older than me because I was always thinking ""do they think I'm annoying"", ""am I too immature"", ""I am scared to come to them with my insecurities or concerns because won't they think they are silly and would think poorly of me"". Despite that, the year went mostly smoothly and although I was aware of the situation in school I was pretty happy. Then come this year the situation changed dramatically. The previous 5 teachers we had for the entire school, including a member of the administration who taught classes, turned to 3 and the school shrank farther, and the most hurtful part to me for some reason I wish I knew and I spent so much time trying to figure out why I was iced out from my 3 person friend group. It still affects me today and although I understand I could die right now and those girls wouldn't care I still cry thinking of the days when they would say good morning, shared funny posts on Instagram, or sat and ate lunch with me and wonder what did I do and what is wrong with me.  My education isn't very good as my math and science teacher is an administrator who teaches alg 1,2 pre-calc, calc 1,2, bio, and physics. You probably don't believe me but if you saw how it's taught it makes more sense. I don't have a history course or what some people call social studies and my English or writing course is taught by a teacher who 1. doesn't have credentials that relate to the class, 2. can't teach, and 3.  admitted themselves that the only reason they teacher here is because their spouse's job was outsourced and she needs to pay the bills. Them my civics teacher, ugh where do I start; he doesn't teach the class instead he takes some passages from the internet and asks some questions for hw. We have a book but have used it about 3 times the whole year. Also, I've never tried and ended the 3rd quarter with a 98. And the part that makes him the worst is how uncomfortable students, and I feel around him. He is very touchy, makes comments, and has wandering eyes. I really care and want a good education but all I get out of this place is a nice grade on my transcript. Also, the environment is so toxic and it's very tense. No one is happy to be there and it's very isolating. To get a feeling of how a day in my life goes, I get up in the morning knowing my day will be just as shit as the last,  I get on the bus which is a broken van which  I'm 40% sure failed inspection but it's cool, arrive at school and try to speed walk past THE teacher before I bang my head so hard against a wall I won't wake up, get completely ignored by my ""friends"", then go through all my useless classes that I don't learn anything in and no one complains about, then I go home on a different but equally as hazardous bus and when I get home I have to pretend I don't feel what I feel. I've had urges to harm myself and unfortunately, sometimes I give in. I've had thoughts of suicide but I know my pain is temporary and as much as I understand no one in my life cares about my mental state I hold on to the bit of hope it will get better. As anyone in my situation, I want to switch schools. The public school I'm districted to is pretty good and I know someone who goes there. The only problem is my family doesn't care about my loneliness, my stress, or deep sadness. I talked with them about switching and they say sure but you have to have all grades 95 or above and 1400 or higher on the SAT which I will be taking for the first time at a young age. I am studying as hard as possible to get my SAT  that high and with online school, it won't be too hard to get my school grades to their liking. They have done this every time before when I wanted to switch and when I give them what they want they always scream at me till I'm shivering and an empty shell of a person about how I'm ungrateful and am too young to understand what's good for me. I don't want anyone to get the impression I'm abused or something like that. I know my parents love me and work as hard as they do to give me the best life possible but I wish they could just understand where I'm coming from. When I came to my family previously about my suicidal thoughts I was told this is proof I don't study hard enough.  This crushed me because the only reason that I study or try to geta good resume for college is so that they would be happy to have me as a child and be proud; I don't have any motivation to better myself as a person or have a good future. I can't really see myself in the future nor can I really imagine myself making it to college as bad as it sounds. This year is my last hope at a chance. I don't have a plan b and if I don't switch the faint light at the end of the tunnel disappears. As of writing this, my parents are in their room discussing how lazy I am and how I won't achieve anything in life. This may get lost in translation but I am apparently blood sucking because I was asking my mom to have a conversation with me. That's all I wanted, just a plan not all these uncertainties that lead to hopeless crying nights covering my mouth or breathing into my pillow so no one hears me. I'm sorry this was so long but someone please tell me I'm not just immature and need to listen to my parents, please tell me how to manage my thoughts because I'm tired. I don't know if everyone goes through this but the constant disappointment, betrayal, and loss of hope is exhausting. I decide to continue to wake up every morning because of the little hope I have for friends who will facetime me randomly, send me posts on instagram, ask how I'm doing, say good morning, and come to me for advice.

88,"My wife(f 26) and I(m 27) bought our first home and everything seemed fine during the buying process including during inspection. The inspector told us that the only thing he could see that needed replaced in the near future was the roof and windows. We havn't even been there a month and we noticed a leak during a thunderstorm in our bedroom. Then when we ripped the wallpaper off to paint in the closets in the 2nd floor bedroom, which just so happens to be the top floor(there is no attic), we noticed some black mold growing. We had a Roofer come out to give us an estimate on repairs and that's when he told us it isn't even worth doing repairs as it would cost much more money in the long run. The typical price for a roof replace in my area is about $10k. I called the company that provides my home warrenty. They will only cover up to $550 and only towards very small repairs. We have homeowners insurance but I think it only covers for fires. We are at a loss of what to do. We don't think we will qualify for a loan to fix the issues being that we took out our mortgage on the 13th of March, but we can't just let water gather inside the roof and cause more damage over time.

91,"Hey all! First time poster, and throwaway account. Need some unbiased college advice.

&amp;#x200B;

So, after months of applying to colleges and communicating and negotiating, my family and I have boiled down my college decision to two options: College A, which offered me a bunch of scholarship money (but I would still end up about $80k in debt after 4 years), and College B, which offered me full tuition (excluding room and board).

&amp;#x200B;

College A is a great school. It has a ton of programs which fit my interests perfectly, and it's the perfect distance from home (far enough away to feel away from home, but within driving distance for holidays). I've visited it and spent a week there at a summer camp before, and it's a sweet place I could see myself studying at for four years.

&amp;#x200B;

College B I've never been to, and with the quarantine I doubt I'll be able to before it's time to decide. Their programs are decent, but are dwarfed in comparison to College A's. The level of academics and engagement at College A seems superior, too. However, College B is close to home- about a thirty-forty minute drive- and I could take the train/bus (they have a sort of student discount and a station on campus, I'm not really sure how it works). The reason this is important is because, as I said, they offered free tuition except for room and board. Which means, hypothetically, I could take the train or commute to and from college every day, and without tuition fees I would, more or less, go to college for free. (If I don't commute and pay for room and board at College B, then I would likely end up paying, after four years, a similar fee as I would for the totality of College A, since room and board at College B is about $20k a year).

&amp;#x200B;

I believe I have until June to decide, but with this summary of my current situation, what would you do, those of you in college, out, or deciding like me? Should I seize the opportunity to pay as little as possible, or bear the debt for a potentially better experience?

For less confusion, i will be reffering to the owner of the puppy as *NL* (neighbor lady) and the puppy as *NP* (neighbor puppy). Also apologies for formatting/spelling, im on mobile right now.

I understand there may be legal ways to solve this but i am NOT looking for legal advice, my family does not have the money for that. 

(Edit 2.0): Thank you for the animal control advice! I know the animal control in our area can be very timid to do anything, as they dont even catch wild dogs, so as much as that helped any advice NOT related to animal control would be wonderful as backup as well

We just got a new naighbor in our community. She recently got a new puppy, only a few months old, and has decided that because me and a few other people have dogs we let run without leashes, that her new puppy can do that too. Keep in mind, my dogs (Lily and Daisy) are 7 years old and small miniature dachshunds, and both have gone through off leash training as well as commands and basic training. Same with the other dogs in our community. 

Today, while going for our nightly walk, NL was talking to her neighbor and had NP on a leash running around the yard. At this point in time, we did not realize NP was out, as it was digging in a bush. NL was not holding on to NP, so it was running around freely. Me and my mom had both our dogs on leashes, as we do when we walk them off our property. As we walk by NL's house, NP runs after my dogs, which are half her size. Lily, our shy dog, attempted to hide under my moms legs, but before we could pick her up, NP bites her repeatedly on the nose. She begins shrieking, and NP continues to attack her while me and my mom attempt to kick it off Lily. Daisy runs up, as she is protective of Lily, and begins to bark and jump on NP, which in turn makes it attack Daisy. Daisy will and did fight back, although neither Daisy or NP were injured. NL comes running down the driveway, yelling about how our dogs should be trained not to attack and that it is our fault, and that she will call the cops and animal control if it happens again. My mom tells her that if she has a leash on NP and knows it attacks other dogs, that she should keep a hold of the leash, and that if Lily is seriously hurt she will end up with a vet bill. 
We checked up on Lily after NL dragged NP away, and thankfully she only had a few small scrapes, nothing major, and when we got home we cleaned her up and made sure again that she wasnt seriously hurt. We were beyond pissed, and upon informing our HOA got a lovely ""We cant do anything about it"" as a response. 
Just a few minutes ago, we let Lily and Daisy outside to go bathroom before bed. Both were not on a leash, however as I said previously both are extensively off leash trained and will NOT leave our property without  either me or my mom giving them a command. 
All of a sudden NP runs onto our property, and Daisy runs after it as it tried to go after Lily again. NL blamed us again, saying that our dogs are horridly off leash trained and that we should be paying attention to people outside our home. 

What should i do? Im afraid to walk the dogs anymore without my mom or another person with me, let alone let the dogs out to even use the restroom. The HOA wont do anything, and theres nothing legal-wise ive been told we can do. (We dont have the money anyways)

103,"TLdR; Went on an over year journey. A lot of areas of my old life fell apart before I left. Friendship betrayals, ex coworker put downs, family putting me down, no support. Lots of resistance for what I wanted to do. The theme of my journey was self compassion and taking my power back. A particular Aunt asked me to come over to her house before I left. Open up. I did. Then she took the chance to beat me down. Now I'm coming back. That same Aunt is texting me on Whatsapp. Do I bring up the past or just be ready to be assertive if it happens again?

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many messed up betrayals and put downs occurred from family, friends and former coworkers before I left on my journey (no contact to anyone). One of them was an Aunt that invited me to her home to open up about what's going on in my life. Then she took the opportunity to put me down, call me a ""little boy"" and suggested I get a transgender surgery. I have a feeling the attack came about because I told my father I am keenly aware I am the last man to pass our name down the line. That Aunt is a strong feminist who thinks she is the ""patriarch of the family."" My father never admits it, but I think he told her. I never told any relatives I was aware of this .

Very classic - Woman - ""I want my man to be more vulnerable."" Man - ""Okay strap in for this ride..."" Woman - ""You disgust me and I no longer respect you..."" Famed TED Talk Psychologist on Vulnerability, Brene Brown, had a man ask her why she doesn't study men. She said she didn't have data. He said oh that's convenient because my wife/daughters would rather me die on my high horse than see me vulnerable. 

Now I am isolated during the corona virus. I decided to go to a foreign country to take care of my grandfather who is all alone. Luckily, none of my family members can just barge in and see me (borders to US closed). Family is doing weekly Zoom meetings and Whatsapp. This particular Aunt solo messages me saying, ""thanks for taking care of Gpa. I am reading this book called ""Late Bloomers (link below)."" Every word reminds me of you...and me.

I gracefully thanked her and mentioned all my above average achievements. I just burnt out. I was living the vision of someone else for me and not me. She hasn't responded in three days. 

It came off as really condescending, but that book she recommended looks great. Prior to this I confronted my Grandpa asking why the men of the family don't defend each other. He basically said that Aunt did a lot for him and I had to forgive. When I had the courage to ask that directly I realized how much hurt I was in still. Despite all the meditation.

**Question** \- do I confront this Aunt in an Assertive way or keep working (meditation) to get over it and be ready to be assertive when she tries to power play put down again? 

Unfortunately, I was about to settle into a city, get a job then a therapist, but Corona threw that off. Therapists cannot practice with clients from another state. 

I feel like leaving everything behind no contact is the silent treatment. An ultimately passive aggressive move. You can only: 

A. Change the situation,   
B. Accept it, or   
C. Walk away. 

I chose C since it was shitty so B was a no-go. I had no energy for A. Now I am slowly coming back to the family but have trust issues. It's only a matter of time for a narcissist to resort back to their old ways once they feel like they are in control of you again.

104,"It's been going on for a while, since last year.


It makes me feel uncomfortable. I'm 17, and when I was 13-14, a 17-18 year old guy online kept hitting on me and asking perverted questions. I found it unsettling then, and today, I don't have any tolerance for things like that. 

As I've gotten older, I've preferred to hang out with people my age and not much younger. I don't closely monitor my sibling's activity online, but I've noticed that they mostly chat with younger teenagers, around 14-16? And I guess that they think it's normal?

I don't think that the lives of a 14 year old and a 17 year old are similar at all. They're typically at drastically different levels of emotional maturity. I am a very different person now than I was at 14 and 15, and I wouldn't date anyone younger than 16. However, my sibling's not even 17, but almost 20. An adult.

I don't like to say such things about my sibling, but it seems disturbing to me that they're still attracted to people as young as 14.


My sibling told our parents the age of the person they're dating. I was listening, and that's how I found out. Neither of them forced my sibling to stop getting involved with this then-14 year old.


I can't really pretend that I don't know about it. My sibling mentions their ""girlfriend"" so frequently that I can't ignore it. Usually I believe that people should have the right to do whatever as long as it's not hurting anyone, but it just disturbs me so much how young she is. 
It's only online and they don't have physical contact with each other, but I can't see it as appropriate...

I had hoped that this kid would grow up and realize that this relationship isn't appropriate. 


They act like their relationship is romantic and caring, but whenever they talk about it I just feel like yelling at them, ""that's a kid"". If I confronted them about it, I really don't think they would take my words to heart. It seems like they believe it's perfectly normal. They might think I'm trying to ruin their ""happy"" relationship. Honestly, though, I literally couldn't care less if it wasn't a kid they were dating.
I don't want to start a fight with them and say things like ""why the fuck are you not attracted to people in your age group"" but I just want to make them *understand* that it's not okay...I would like to keep a good relationship with my sibling.

Is it normal for him to not know how to read simple words like “head” and “beetle” and “your”? At what age should a child know how to read?,06Apr2020,1
106,"I am a 25 yo university student, I suffered from panic attacks for 4 years, I spent every single day for those years reading self-help books non stop for hours, listening to podcast, understanding why I was feeling that way and learning how to have a good mindset. I now think I hacked it, I have been happy and grateful everyday for several months now and I am just so happy with myself for having saved my life (I was suicidal at times, couldn't get out of bed in the morning, etc), I am in good shape, I eat very healthy, I never smoke or drink, I resolved my childhood traumas, I am dating a nice guy, I think I could buy a second home and be financially independent very easily thanks to property income from a house that I inherited (it isn't much, but £1000 a month with work or having to pay rent is pretty good). The things is, all I want to do now is to learn art, music, dance, read, sing and enjoy all these things that I always dreamed of doing but that I never had time or support to do. I don't want to get a job (I would like to build my own business, but I don't want a normal 9-5 job), and I just want to learn new things and take a sort of gap year enjoying my hard earned peace of mind - am I being lazy? Should I be more ambitious and want to get a career like everyone else? Will this lead to me having no experience with a proper job and having future financial problems if my business idea doesn't go well?is it weird that I just want to spend my days learning arts (I am a stem student atm) and not do anything with my degree and not really have a desire to have a job?

I understand this post might be a little confusing and all over the place, I guess what I am trying to say is: can I take a gap year just learning arts and building a business? Am I being lazy for wanting to live off an income that I was basically gifted and should I be harder on myself and put more pressure on myself to just have a job like everyone else ?

Sorry if these questions sound obvious to some of you, but I am genuinely confused and I would appreciate any sort of point of view from other people, positive or negative, Just please be kind if you got some criticism to do.",06Apr2020,2
107,"I cannot press charges against him in the country I live in,and I feel so hopeless and sometimes even suicidal.
He has a general idea of where I stay, he has told me on numerous occasions that if ever he were to find me that he would rape me , he knows who my friends are , he knows who some of my family are and he knows my name (obviously).
It’s tricky because he doesn’t live in the same country as me but is here regularly which makes this all much more confusing, and hard to know how to handle the situation. He has some explicit content of me which he has used as leverage against me a few times . I block him every time he makes a reappearance but he has about 8-12 accounts at a time he uses to get to me or he starts messaging my friends and family. I don’t know what to do anymore.",06Apr2020,1
108,"I apologize for the long post here.

So,,, I’m 15, female, and I’m currently on quarantine with my family. Both my parents are out of work and and I’m genuinely happy that I get to spend more time with them. However, it’s been kind of hard to deal with as I’ve been feeling quite lonely on some occasions. 

I made the mistake of voicing this to my mom, because she basically placed the blame on me, saying that i disconnect from everyone because I always listen to music. While that is true, I don’t listen to a lot of music, I often try to connect with my family; I offer to play cards with them, and watch tv with them. They get very annoyed when I ask them what they were doing, they see it as nosy, which is understandable in sorts. My brother completely ignores me if he’s playing video games or watching TV, saying stuff like “you’re annoying”, and honestly it hurts a bit since I told my parents and they didn’t really seem to do much/care. 

Back to the music thing, music has helped me so much. The artist that I mostly listen to has really healed me with their music... I know it’s really childish but it’s the truth. And she KNOWS that. She even pointed out before how I seemed happier after listening to them. I was glad she acknowledged that at the time.

Now today, my mom was watching a “conspiracy” type video. She’ll listen to everything he says (I’m not gonna name the ytuber) and she tries to enforce their opinions on the family. Perhaps some stuff I could see, but others I don’t but I’m genuinely scared to disagree with her and I know that a problem in and of itself but it’s the truth. She watched something about earbuds giving people brain tumors or something along those lines. She told me not to use them anymore and play music on the speaker. Very hypocritical because she HATES the type of music I listen to and even specifically told me once to use earbuds to listen to it so she didn’t have to hear it. On top of that, even if I WERE to get a tumor, she doesn’t take us to the doctor or hospital, so we would even know lmao..... I was pretty taken aback. 

To me, it all seems like she just wants to take the one thing that’s making me happy during this time away... and it’s scary. Seems like she’s just using the conspiracy video as a way to take it away from me for whatever reason and I’m mad. She caught me trying to listen to it (I know I shouldn’t have) and she actually yelled at me. The fact that she yelled at me and also I get anxious when hearing sudden loud voices made me upset. I cried because I cry for everything, and tbh I feel there’s  a lot of underlying issues with myself as well.

I noticed that every time we get into a fight, she acts overly joke-y and funny with the rest of the family and/ or talks about me like I can’t hear shit. It makes me sad. And I can’t talk to anyone in my family about it because no matter what they’ll agree with my mother. I’ve never ever talked about my feelings regarding our relationship because I’m scared of her reaction. It’s not something I want to delve into; I’ve written notes to her before but they didn’t turn out good, so I just don’t do it.

You know,,, it’s just been hard ig lmao and I can’t imagine how other people are feeling during these times... I just need some advice.

Tl;dr: at quarantine with my family, mother is trying to take away the one thing that makes me happy; really going through it.",06Apr2020,1
109,"Ok, this girl and I have a lot in common and we are close friends, but she rejected me because she got a wrong impression about me and doesn't think I'd be a good partner for her, but she thinks I'm a good person overall and didn't close the door. I feel the opposite and think we're very very compatible, we share the same values and beliefs. I really, really like this girl and think she's the one and I already told her I won't give up (in a non-persistent way haha, she still respects me a ton). What do I do? I don't want to remain just a friend to her because I was honest and made it clear to her the moment we started talking that I liked her and would like to get to know her better. My plan is to disappear from her life for 2-3 months (while maintaining contact), work on myself a bit then try again. Would that work better?",06Apr2020,1
110,"I had been with the company for about five weeks when this happened. On Wednesday, March 11th we were told the hotel would be cutting hours. Two days later, on Friday, I was told I would be laid off for two weeks.

On week later, the 20th, I got a call saying they won’t be bringing me back and I should file for unemployment. I ask if I’m being fired or laid off and she says I’m within my 90 days so they aren’t bringing me back. She then says it wasn’t a good fit for either of us. I ask if it’s about my work ethic as opposed to lay off’s because of the virus and I don’t get a specific answer.

I go in a bit later to collect my stuff and we talk a bit. She still doesn’t say whether or not I’m being fired or laid off but says that what I’m studying, mba, is too advanced for the work, I was entry level hr coordinator. She said the questions I asked when speaking showed how knowledgeable I was. She also said the longer I worked there, the less excited I seemed to be.

She then says they had different expectations when hiring me and it sometimes took me longer  to do things which is why I think it had to do with work performance. The work was super basic though i.e. making birthday cards, creating a weekly newsletter, making name tags, hiring people in the system exc. I will be honest, there were times where I didn’t have much work to do.

This is where it gets tricky. She then says that if they do bring someone back, the position will be part time not full time and it will be an admin assistant not an hr position- that’s the field I wanted to grow in. She kept saying I should file for unemployment. Position elimination is considered termination, from what I understand which is why I’m confused. 

She asked me for my opinions, kind of like an exit interview and I was kind, but blunt. She gave me a form for the work number and said they can verify my dates of employment if I needed a reference.


I know I was paid more than anyone else has even gotten for the position. I already filed for unemployment but I need some more insight (:",06Apr2020,2

Anyways I haven’t have sex with her yet but we plan on doing it after the corona shit, I am kinda thinking about me coming quick tho, I heard it gets better ‘the more you do it’ but I have had ‘dry rides’ with her and even naked ‘rides’ (without PIV action) and I almost always come relatively quickly, within a minute or 3, should I be worried?

116,"I'm 24. I'm an only child. I graduate college next month. I've always been introverted and socially isolated to a degree but I made a handful of decent acquaintances and a few friends in college. 

I dated a girl for basically all of 2018. She was my 2nd relationship ever. We met at a job that I had worked at since high school and returned to help out during holiday breaks from college. Long story short, I truly did love her, but I treated her poorly and was going through a rough period of depression. I was lost and this was before I committed to a major in college. So, we had some good times but a lot of heated conflict and even though she was really into me she eventually left me. It didn't really affect me much at the time because I was struggling personally whether I was with her or not.

After that, I got very invested in my new major and now I'm graduating with a great record of academics and involvement. However, I do not have concrete plans for what I want to do with my life and do not have any jobs lined up. Actually, I'm disinterested in most jobs. And there aren't many good paying jobs in my hometown area for my major anyway. My whole family has never really moved out of our home area, but I may have to be the first because I don't really have much left here besides them. I don't have friends here anymore.

Since I dug myself out of that hole I was in 1-2 years ago, I've begun to realize how bad I messed up in that relationship and how I could've had this girl who I loved. But it was my fault. I didn't treat her right. I've tried to reconnect with her since she still lives near me, but our conversations have gone badly and she has changed in ways that I don't like. She also has friends who truly are bad influences. I wish I could go back in time and have what we had in the beginning. I really did want to be with her and I'm sad at both me messing up and not treating her right and her changing in ways I don't like.

I come from a family that basically all just got regular jobs after high school, married someone from childhood or the same area, and settled down. But I don't know if I can ""limit"" myself to that anymore. Like I said, there's not really anything for me here besides family and the girl I still love. My life is dull and boring and I want to change that.

I really want to join the military and am going to hopefully be applying to be an officer later this year. But, if I commit myself to that path, that means I'll be moving somewhere else, and likely moving every few years to different locations. Goodbye home. Goodbye chance for a life with this girl who I love. 

I really don't even have any interest in girls anymore. Only the girl I dated who I truly did love and hate myself for not committing to her when we were together. I've been too heartbroken to even be interested in anyone else, and since I'm an idealist, I'm already by default not interested in most women, or people, for that matter. But I do want to have kids someday and want to be a father. And I know if I join the military, it makes it a ton harder to have the typical family life.

So I feel like I'm at a real crossroads in my life. I either 1) Commit to joining the military and using the field skills I have from my major, leave my hometown (for 11 months a year, at least), and achieve a lot career-wise. Or 2) Do not leave my home area, settle for a crappy job here at home with a lot of student debt that I'll struggle to pay off, have no friends here, but at least have a chance to be with the girl I still would prefer to be with. That's even if she ever wants to give me a 2nd chance.

I know option 1) is the most logical, but it's just such a scary thing. I've never even traveled much. I know I have a lot of potential and should live up to it, but it's just scary going out into the unexplored ""world"" like that not knowing what will come of it, especially as a more introverted person.

Am I thinking about this right? What would you do in my shoes?",06Apr2020,1
118,"For context, we live in an apartment building so we use the same door to get in and out of the building. He walks everywhere so he’s outside all the time.

119,"About a year ago, I lost a really good friend of mine. She did a lot for me, and even took me in for a little when I couldn't stay where I was living.

A year ago we stopped talking because I let my insecurities and anxiety take over me, and instead of talking about it, I lashed out on her. I said some awful things about her, and since then she hasn't spoken to me. *To sum it up, my partner at the time had wrote me in a text about how he wanted to have sex with her, and I took it out on her instead of leaving him.*

Now, especially in this really difficult time, I can't stop thinking about her. I've had nightmares where I wake up in a cold sweat, crying about her dying or disappearing. I worry about how she's doing with her family and her problems she used to talk to me about.

I haven't tried to contact her since then, and I'm afraid to, because I know there's a chance she might lash out at me.

122,"I am an Asian 25 yo female and lived with my family of my two parents and younger sister of 20 until a few months ago when I found a new job. I had been desperate to move out because of the emotional disaster that is my home.

The biggest events that have damaged my relationship with my parents were me lying about getting kicked out of college and pretending I was in school for a year and them finding some weed on me (legal in my state). Since then I went back to school and landed on my feet perfectly fine. However when they found out about the college thing a few years ago, my dad hit my head and kicked me. He had previously hit me in my childhood and a few times in high school when I “did something wrong”. After college I was emotionally put down, constantly being asked if I am talented enough to be an engineer because I was unemployed for a few months.

Another big reason my life at home was so difficult was because my younger sister is a survivor of life threatening diseases from her childhood including cancer and now she is struggling with major depression and severe anxiety where she cannot function in society at the moment. Her multiple suicide attempts and lack of ability to do anything even at home has made my personal mental health deteriorate. I have been suffering from depression since middle school as well but have hidden it and my problems at home definitely go to the back seats because of my sister. 

After I moved out, my sister has been behaving more and more erratically, crossing to things we could have never imagined. She has been shoplifting for years and was recently caught and went to the police station. This was a huge shock to my parents.

Then came yesterday..

My parents found out my sister had used their credit card to spend nearly $2,000 on iPhone game purchases in a span of less than a month. Our parents work very hard and my mom works over time to provide for us which is physically very hard on her. I have always been frugal since childhood with my family’s financial situation and haven’t asked for a present in over 10 years. So this behavior of my sister made me extremely angry, considering how difficult it is for my parents.

However I am livid with my dad. I wasn’t there but my sister told me today. After finding out, my dad dragged her by the hair and beat her up. He punched her in the face that she now has a black eye. She attempted suicide yesterday with pills but my parents didn’t take her to the hospital because of her black eye and that my dad could get in trouble (this made me sick). A few months ago, my sister was having a big depressive episode and throwing everything in her room. My dad broke her finger while trying to contain her. She had to lie about how she broke the finger so my dad wouldn’t get in trouble. My parents told her to.

Writing these out, it seems clear my dad has a big problem. However living through this, because of my faith that my parents love us, it is difficult to stir away from my perspective of them. Everything they do, they supposedly do because they love us. 

My sister wants to come over to my place but I am experiencing covid-19 symptoms and she is at a high risk with her health history. I also don’t know if I can mentally handle taking care of her. Should my dad be reported? And how much of myself can I put forward in this situation and let my sister and parents figure this out? I am drained and when something like this happens my depression comes back like a huge wave that I cannot handle..",06Apr2020,1
123,"My parents officially told me that I can only leave the house once a week because of the corona virus (I’m 22). This feels very hypocritical because my mom invites several people over at least 2 times a week. 

We had an argument and she agreed she wouldn’t invite any more people over but she wanted me to stay home. 

My boyfriend (22m) of 2 years  and I hang out every other day and this has kind of left me feeling like a bad girlfriend. He tells me that I’m 22 and pay bills and should be able to whatever I want. Coming from a Hispanic family, the only way to act like this is to completely be disowned. On the other hand he’s allowed
To come and go as he pleases.

Aside from that, I know I should be staying home but at the same time my bf and I just walk the park where everyone follows social distancing rules. I wash my hands and change my clothes as soon as I get home. My siblings all go to the store and just wash their hands. 

I am stuck feeling like a bad girlfriend and a bad daughter.. I am so over this virus..

I always kept my room clean and I always put my laundry up right after it came out of the dryer so my clothes wouldn’t wrinkle. As time went on, I started feeling uninspired to do these things. Now, I’m messy, I haven’t cleaned my room since Christmas, and I slacked a lot on my schoolwork. I hardly do my makeup the way I used to, I gave up all my hobbies, my friend circle shrank drastically, my plants are dying, and I just throw my laundry on the floor because I am not motivated to hang it up. This is something that has been bothering me for over a year. I cry about it at least once a month or more. Every time I try to get back into a hobby I start feeling guilty because I used to be so much better and I always quit and cry. I miss having talents and I miss being “put together”.

129,"I am a planner since I was little (32M). I plan things. Planned trips years before, planned stages/goals in my life when I was in High School. I pushed myself to respect my tight schedule. I had setbacks and hard moments, but then I just made a new plan.

My current one is to get a promotion (confirmed but now being frozen due Covid19) and leave for the West Coast where a girl from my uni days lives (31F). Both ""infatuated"" with each other since last spring. She told me in a explicit way that she would love to give a shot, if I moved in the area. I suggested to start with a light LDR, since I do travel quite enough in her area but she told me that she dates around and feels like long distance relationship are not worth it.

Since I feel things for her. I am attracted to her psychically and so on, I believed that she was worth it. She is my ""type"", very ambitious, feminine and put together. I always had relationship with women who are hardworking and very career (or school) driven. I found it challenging and more exciting. Even when they dumped me for a job in Europe or for PhD somewhere else.

Around November, I met R.

She is 35 years old. Oddly enough when we started to chat on the app, we both recognize each other. We work in the same complex building, which is not that crowded and both park in one specific corner. She is not the classical type that I go for, but she is a good listener and a very kind person. Well, from just talking here and there, we both jumped in a FWB. I was very honest in telling her that I plan to move soon and she told me that the breakup with her partner still haunts her and she just want to have sex and having a movie-night sometimes.

Until the quarantine orders, I never spent more than a handful hours with her and we always talked about normal stuff. She doesn't like to talk about herself and I never asked more than the minimum. Just days before my company decided to go for the WFH thing, I got in a stupid accident (me in a bike vs kid in a bike), I broke some bones and got a ugly concussion. My best friend wanted to stay with me and helped me for the lockdown, but his family needed him, so R. jumped in. She insisted to stay temporarily at her place and live there until I feel better or the quarantine is over. It's a small space, very spartan but she has a very large and comfy bed and one of the old armchair where you can literally sink in. Got my desk to fit in her bedroom, while she works from the dinner table.

R is the most caring human being I ever met. She is constantly helping me or the neighbors or half town. She bakes for the elder center, works in a food banks when she has time, helps kids from poor background to get better grades with tutoring or school supplies. Before, I had glimpse of her life, but now, when she sit on the table, completely exhausted and her shirt dirty with flour, managing all her work as admin, plus all this time spent in the kitchen or around the associations, insisting to cook and I can't keep my eyes off her.

She is not a classical ""instant"" beauty. She likes to describe herself as ""normal ugly"", but she is not. She has the most bright smile, beautiful eyes and others millions of things that I can see and admire better. But she is hurt. Her smiles are rare. Her past is heavy with disappointing boyfriends, estranged sister and the death of both her parents. She wears their wedding rings on a chain as necklace. I found it weird, but now, I can see how devoted she is to their memory. They had a shop and they were very famous as caring people with tons of charity initiative and things like that. The mother died when she was a kid and the father got cancer and tried to fight for years before succumbing when she was 20 something. Her sister was a teen and the only thing I know is that R pushed her too much to get better grades and sold the childhood house to pay for the college fees.

To me the sister is brat, since she went to a top university, got a very spendable degree and dried up financially her sister so she could go on around the world with nearly 0 debt. But I don't have a younger sibling and my parents are still alive. This all situation shows how caring is R and how selfless she is. She didn't had to give all the money to her. 50/50 deals was fair enough.

I made the huge mistake, recently, to talk to her, half baked from the meds, about the girl that I am infatuated about. She knew about the promotion but nothing more. This is after she told me that her ex, a dude that lives 1 block from her, after years just left her when she started to ask him about their future together. She wanted to start to working towards a deposit for a house and fertility treatment since she has issues. He took time, give her half answer and left in one afternoon, taking all his stuff and furniture. The dude got pregnant another girl in less than 3 months and married her fast. She told me that now, due to her condition deteriorating, she unlikely would have a kid biologically. The way she told that, the sad voice, well, she is convinced that she can't be a mother anymore. At least biologically.

Let me tell you, I am not very good on the emotional side of things, but that fucked up her mentally. She doesn't have self-esteem. She likes to make fun of herself in heavy way. I didn't really notice before, but living together all day, is making me more aware of it. She has a beautiful skin, but no skincare products in the bathroom. I asked her randomly if is because she doesn't need it or use some kind of homemade potion. She laugh and told me that there is no point to do that since it's a waste on her. She has a baggy style but then I discovered dresses, skirts, nice blouses in her wardrobe in colors and shades like pink which I never see on her. Even the few times that we met at lunch at work.

Now, I can't stop thinking of her in general. I like her more than I am willing to admit. Every morning, I wake up close to her, and the only thought makes me smile. She met my parents, who were worried about the concussion and broken bones, via videochat. And they like her. My older and only sister was nearly moved when she sent some homemade masks with superheros to give to my nephews that are confuse about why their parents are sleeping in another house while they are with the grandparents (they both work in hospital, now doing only covid19)

I tried to tell her. That I like her and she told me that she likes me too. But then, she added this is not the plan. That my feelings are more related to the quarantine and to the fact that she is taking care of me. To her, my feelings, are just amplified by gratitude. By the domestic bliss.

I can see her point. I can see be back in my house after this month and go on with the original plan. She is not my ""type"". She a gentle soul and I am don't really deserve her in that sense. She is still hung up from what happened, even if more than one year is passed. She thinks that she needs to live for one now, making arrangements and saving money for her one ticket to the elder facilities. She likes to jokes about becoming a cat lady, even with the allergy, assured me that she is over her maternity desire, but she would spend a good 15 minutes watching toddlers and babies video or posts from the ex and gush on his daughter.

Do I go after her, knowing that maybe she needs time to heal? Knowing that she could ask for more than anyone asked from me? The idea of wife and kids are something distant and not part in my 5-years plan. Yes, it would be nice, but not now. I want to explore and maybe move closer to my sister.

I don't want to make promises and then broke them (even with valid reasons). She doesn't deserve this. And the plan is still there and the other girl still ""available"".

Any prospective, suggestions, opinion or similar experience is welcomed.

TL;DR! I have feelings for my FBW. She has issues. I had a plan for this period of my life and she is not in it, another person who I am infatuated is. The feelings for FWB could be real and strong, or just a domestic bliss thing.

130,"I’m genuinely starting to question my sanity. I’ve never been tested or anything, but I see that I’m starting to show symptoms of psychopathy. What follows are my common thoughts. 

What I think about daily is not normal. It’s usually murder or rape. Two of my fetishes, really. I don’t know why I wonder what the inside of a human body would look like, but I do. I’ve taken to watching isis execution videos online to satisfy that. Think of it like going on a rollercoaster. When you start going down that hump, your heart is racing. It’s a rush. That’s how I feel when I watch that stuff. It’s exhilarating. It’s like asmr, I can almost feel that knife going through the neck. 

This same feeling is what pushed me to join the military. I want the opportunity to put a gun to someone’s head and pull the trigger. Just watch their lights go out. Imagine finding a militant, tying up their arms, fucking them and strangling them with shoelaces. Feeling that struggle. My heart is racing just typing that. Having my way with someone like that is my dream. The power that comes with that, there’s literally nothing they could do to stop it.

These aren’t things that I’m necessarily proud of, but I don’t really think it matters too much so long as no one finds out. I’m still a functional person. I think it would be more productive to be able to focus on something else for a change.",06Apr2020,2

                *      *      *

Freshman year I made friends with a group that consisted mostly of seniors, juniors, and few sophomores.  I loved/still love them to freakin death.  I was just always so happy with them because I’ve just always been “mature” for my age, and I don’t mean that I was like an adult doing their taxes mature, I just was not as ... excitable as the people in my class, so being friends with these people was great, ya know? They were my type of people.  And unfortunately, since they were older they graduated sooner and the group got smaller each year. 

Now (I’m a junior), it’s really just me (there’s this other girl in my grade who I’m cool with, but we’re not like best friends), but I have this other group of friends.

This other group of friends are not my main people (they’re in my grade), and they are cool and all but they are so childish and it’s annoying since we’re practically adults.  Yeah, I could make new friends, but I don’t have the best rep in my grade, it’s not like I’ve done anything terribly wrong, my resting bitch face is just out of this world and I squint at people which doesn’t help, so next year I’m definitely wearing my glasses all the time. And I have a really sarcastic humor and some people don’t like that, but hey you can’t please everyone.  But the people that got past my evil face, rumors (with my face comes rumors), and dry humor always say I’m the chillest person they’ve met.  

I don’t want to spend my last year like I’m in middle school again.  I have distanced myself from these people (before quarantine) and I’m happy with the result, we’re still civil and all that jazz and I’m happier but lonely.

Like I said, I’m not really close with anyone else in my grade than I was with these people, probably because I’ve spent it with mostly upperclassman and my face was/is a repel spray.  I’m just worried that people won’t give me a chance before they get to know me and I want to spend my last year hanging out with friends that make me happy and not spend it alone.

135,"Hi guys :)

I’m an extroverted female, but I think I take texting way too seriously. I text my introverted boyfriend too much for him, I nag him about texting and keeping his word with calls and hanging out, and get on his nerves to where we end up fighting most times. We have fights over communication constantly. I’ll get naggy and he’ll get defensive and mean back. I’ve tried to make the relationship work and I try so hard but we keep coming back. We’ve been sort of on and off with dating. We had a fight yesterday that was real bad. He stopped replying in the middle of a conversation over text, I got mad, he got mad, called me a bunch of names, and then I ended up screaming over the stupid little text messages. I stopped texting after he backtalked me and haven’t looked at my phone since. I’m thinking that I’m going to take a break for a while for personal growth and hopefully realize that texting isn’t that important etc. And I get the feeling my parents don’t understand. I go to them for help a lot, so they know the situation pretty well. They say we aren’t compatible, and when I say I’m often at fault for the fights, they tell me to stop blaming myself. But I personally think I’m accepting my faults. I’m too obsessed with talking over the phone and he can get angry and rude easy. We both have our own things. I feel like we can fix this but I’m often the only one putting effort in fixing things and trying to work it out. Of course he could be very exhausted and stressed from all the drama and complaining I’ve caused but I feel like if he was serious about making this work, even though he’s introverted, he would put more effort too. But he might be giving effort and it’s unnoticed, I don’t know haha. I just would appreciate if anyone in a similar situation could help me out with these questions:

1) Do you think it’s worth trying or do you think we are incompatible? 2) What can I do if it’s worth trying and what should he do to help make it work? 3) Do you think my plan of not looking at my phone or texting anyone will be effective for myself and the relationship? 4) What do I say when I talk to him again and do I talk through text, call, or irl when the pandemic is over? Of course, when he is in the mood to talk, and not too busy with his alone time XD

136,"
I’m so full of emotion right now I just need to get this out. My little sister went away to college last fall, but she decided college wasn’t for her and moved back home, and has been living with my parents, who have always been strict. They also have a tendency to change up the rules they have for the household. They have rules about going out or cleaning up, as any parent would, but then they change their expectations and threaten to cut off all financial help if we can’t follow their rules(which, again, tend to change). Additionally, they are very religious/conservative and it’s always been their expectation that we believe the same thing they do. I’ve been away at college, so I don’t deal with it as much, but on one occasion, I went to a class walkout to protest gun violence, and once my mom found out she threatened to make me come home from college, because she couldn’t morally support me going to a school with that sort of influence over me. (To be clear, I hadn’t really held conservative/Christian views for quite a few years before college.) 

While my sister was away at college, my mom found one of her journals, in which she writes about being gay, and totally flips out. She talked to me about it and I told her that I supported my sister no matter what, even IF that’s what the Bible taught, loving my sister was most important to me. This made her upset, but not as upset as I thought. Some time goes by and it’s not really mentioned by her again. Of course I told my sister that my mom knew, but my mom never mentioned it to my sister.

Flash forward to today: my whole family is stuck at home bc of COVID-19. While my sister was gone to college, she got 2 tattoos on her arms. They did tell her not to get tattoos while at college, but never told her what the consequences would be if she did. She hid them by wearing long sleeves ever since she’s been home. Since we were all home and it was a warm day, she told them about the tattoos and said she hoped they could forgive her. They simply replied that they would no longer help her pay for her phone, car insurance, or life insurance. While she (and I) are aware that a lot of people aren’t fortunate enough to have that help from their parents, it was still a large blow for all that financial help to be gone at once. 
Following this, my sister and I were both (separately) questioned about our belief in God. We both have roughly the same answer: as we had grown and been able to contemplate things for ourselves, we just weren’t sure we could truly call ourselves Christians anymore. My mom was upset that this was my answer and offered to pray for me (which I respectfully accepted), but when she and my sister had the same conversation, it didn’t go the same way. They both unexpectedly left for a car ride around 4pm today, and when they came back to the house they were both crying. 
My mother told me that my sister had chosen to move out because she didn’t want to follow household rules. When I asked my mom if she had given her some sort of ultimatum, she said no.
I asked my dad, and he said that my sister had chosen to disrespect everything they had taught her, and he was worried for her salvation, so this was the best option.
I asked my sister what happened, and she said our mother admitted to reading her journal, told her she thought being gay was wrong, and then told her that she physically couldn’t watch her walk away from God each day, so she either needed to “follow the rules” and come back to God or she could leave. She elected to leave.
And now my sister is staying with a friend for the night and moving in with my aunt as soon as possible.

&amp;#x200B;

Am a minor in Canada, the only fam in Canada is my parents (who I live with). The rest of the family (extended) is in another country. Am a Canadian citizen, have been ever since I was little. I think I'm being abused by my parents (emotionally by both, physically by the mom, although dad has never intervened). Neither have sexually touched me, neither have neglected me by not giving me food or paying for my activities. They have gone above and beyond with the vacations and my sports. Recently I've been considering (after we go back to school after this pandemic) to go to my counsellor and spill. My mom said today that she was waiting for me to defy her one more time (her definition of defying her is my self harm, which is like my coping mechanism, but I did it more the more she got pissed to cope with her belitting me and hitting me because of it). She said that if I defied her one more time she would kick me out or call the police to take me to jail (I know, its weird). She also said, this was really scary, in a rage induced voice, that she wanted to stab me with a knife. She also said she didn't care whether I lived or died, and hit me more today. They make comments on my weight, my acne (I get so many insults about that one, God). She gets these rages that set her off over every minuscule thing I do, its really weird, and my dad doesnt get in the middle.

The concerns I have if I decide to go to my counsellor and spill the beans:

1. What the hell would happen in terms of how I interact with my parents? I really don't want a social worker coming to my house, interviewing us, and leaving me there, since they would be pissed, obviously. Would they just take my parents into custody, and do a trial thing?? With the knife comment, I'm not sure how seriously to take that one, but it scared me.
2. This is super weird to say, but my mom stands and watches me shower since she thinks I don't clean myself. It makes me uncomfortable, but she doesnt do any weird sexual stuff, just micromanages how I shower, and insists I show her my body covered in soap before I wash it away. Is that weird, and could it be used agaisnt her?
3. Let's say that they loose custody of me. How would I get money to pay for university? I really want to be a specific career badly, but I'll need money to pay for my future studies obviously. Would they be obliged to give me money?
4. Let's say they loose custody of me. Since I am a Canadian citizen, would I go into foster care? or would they send me to another country with the rest of my extended family there, whom I BARELY know, and my parents have said they are very shady, even when I am not a citizen there? I want to remain in Canada badly, and I am a citizen here. I do NOT want to leave the country, and be sent there when Im not a citizen of that country.
5. Let's say that since mom does the hitting, my dad gets sole custody. Would she be still allowed to interact with him? even if I live with him?

I have been friends with this girl for three years. About a year ago we because extremely close. She started to constantly ask me for things. If I didn’t have them she wouldn’t hang out with me and would go to the next person. It didn’t happen all the time but enough where it bothered me. Eventually I never had anything she wanted so she made new friends who did. I was still considered her best friend though. We had gone through a lot. I was always there if she needed someone to talk to, somewhere to stay when she needed to get out of her house, stuff like that. 

A few months back she started distancing herself from me. She would talk to me less, not ask to do things, etc. Eventually, we talked about it and she said it was because I’m always bringing people down. Of course I took a hard look at myself after she said that and talked to my boyfriend to see what he thought. He said I can be at times and I agreed. 

She stopped talking to me for a month or two and I was obviously very upset and stressed. I blamed it all on myself and didn’t once think that maybe it was her. 

I got better at being positive. I was a lot happier with myself as a person too. I decided that maybe it was for the better that we weren’t friends anymore. 

A few days ago she texted me. She said that she was sorry for being a b**ch and that she loves me and misses me. I said that I missed her too. We talked for a little but it wasn’t anything about what happened. 

I don’t know if I still want her in my life after that though. Maybe I’m just being dramatic but I really need some advice. Thank you in advance.",06Apr2020,1

160,"I’m a 16 year old female, surprising right? We all go through this and what not, but I’ve been really breaking down over this issue lately. I’ve become overly obsessed with my looks and very insecure, I’ve felt this way ever since I was 10, when I got my own smart phone and was able to browse the internet freely. I’d cry because even at such a young age I felt insecure to post on social media like all of my other friends. Social media has really damaged me, I do my best to avoid it.

Anyway, I posted on one of those “am I ugly” subreddits and I’ve been getting reassurance that I’m “not ugly” but I can’t help but feel that they’re mocking me. I’ll see pictures of them and being that they are actually attractive people I see it as them taking pity on me. I can’t stop myself from comparing myself to other people, especially in this field. I want to delete the post with all my heart because I look back and see how amazingly ugly I am, but I know that if I do I won’t get over it. I’ve always hated pictures. 

People tell me I look fine or that I have nice eyes/hair but I just can’t believe that my face looks fine. I honestly feel really nauseous and dizzy after going back to that post and seeing all the comments. This is clearly out of hand but I don’t know how to help myself. I’d love to hear any sort of advice",06Apr2020,1
161,"The other day I had an argument over a trivial matter with my bf and I came to reddit for advice: [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/fv4v3u/an_argument_with_bf_over_a_trivial_matter/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x). Today I called him, but the entire day we basically said nothing to each other. Just the usual ""did you eat?"" or ""did you sleep well?"" I apologized again about being pushy and he did apologize for being defensive, and I thought our relationship was good. But the rest of the day while on call (we usually talk to each other the entire day) he said nothing unless I said something to him. He just gave short replies and it was hard to initiate a conversation. While we were in silence during the call I realized that it's always usually me starting a topic or talking about something and I started wondering if he even wants to talk to me. Then around 8pm I asked him if he even wanted to talk to me. He said he did and he was just tired. I told him I want to talk to him but I'm not sure how to start the conversations anymore. But then he says he's going to go to sleep early. I know that he rarely sleeps early unless we had a disagreement over something, even the other day after our argument he just texted me that he was going to bed and didn't bother saying anything on the phone. I'm not sure what to say or do anymore. I'm afraid of saying anything at this point because it might sour our relationship. Am I irritating him? I know the whole quarantine thing is tiring for everyone and I hope everyone is well, but I don't think that's the reason he's acting weird. Now I'm just overthinking everything and feeling so alone. I don't even have that close of friends to talk to. He's my best friend and my boyfriend.

I'm very concerned but dont want to say anything in fear of coming out as a bad person or my bestfriend would just be mad at me and just not talk to me anymore (my bestfriend hates people for one certain thing and as no other reason for hating them) my bestfriend has also become more cold/harsh towards me. This person is a horrible influence on them, and I'm afraid they are becoming them, it's starting to scare me, I know others in my group thing this person is bad just by how they avoid this person and the looks they give them. I cant blame them though this person has screamed and smash things and is very abusive towards others (mentally abusive) I have no clue what the fuck to do I dont even enjoy hanging out with my bestfriend anymore, should I just let us drift apart or tell my bestfriend?

164,"(22M) Hi there! So just like the title says I go through bouts where I just stop texting everyone back. I'm not sure when I started this, but the first time I realized it was about 6 months ago. It really doesn't matter who it is, I just stop texting everyone back all at once. It could be my roommate, my friends, a girl I like, work people, heck even my mom isn't safe from the habit (note: I have a great relationship with both my parents). I'll be fine and normal, holding healthy conversations for a while (weekish or more), but then one day I just stop texting everyone back. I see the texts, open them, maybe even think of a response, but for whatever reason I don't reply.

It's really hard because I don't why I do it, and it's seriously damaging to my relationships. I miss opportunities, people think I don't like talking to them, they don't reach out in the future, etc. And I have no excuse because I DO like these people and I DO want to keep in touch. When I finally do text back, it's awkward and I can't really explain myself. It's frustrating.

I know that I don't like digital communication as much as face to face, and even calls (although intimidating) are better (I guess) than messages. However, I've was able to make my way through all of high school and most of college just fine without 'forgetting' to text people, so why this has suddenly flared up I have no idea. 

So my advice request is this: how can I be better and more consistent at texting back? I don't need you to solve the mystery of why I don't do it (but if you have an insight or idea - by all means). How can I break the cycle of no texts for weeks, then a flurry of conversation? Please and thank you to all who have thoughts about this

(side note: this is a throwaway account, as plenty of my friends know my main)

(other side note: I think of myself as an introverted extrovert. I get my energy and excitement in life from being around others, whereas being alone is draining. That being said, I have a lot of introverted tendencies that I don't need to get into here. On tests between the two, I usually score ~60% extroversion over introversion)",06Apr2020,1
165,so my best friend and I (19F and 21F) have a complicated relationship. Last night we went camping and got a lil drunk and we had a coversation that i remember but idk if she does. Our relationship is complicated bc she’s my ex we dated very briefly and now we’re good friends and things have been good. Last night she said she needed to tell me something and it was about how she gets moments that bring her romantic feelings back like we will just look at eachother and it will just FEEL that way u know? anyway there was some crying and heart felt shit but we never finished it bc we both were tired and drunk. I couldn’t sleep that well last night and she was cuddling me so i let it happen. I live with her for the moment (bc i got kicked out) i don’t want to bring it up but we kinda left it mid conversation but i don’t know what to say bc she hasn’t said anything about it and i don’t want to make things weird. I didn’t think this would happen bc i thought it was just me but apparently she was feeling it too. Do i bring it up? Do i forget it happened?,06Apr2020,1
166,"Please, I am in need of some advice.

On March 30th or 31st a stray gave birth in our garage. Shes a stray but not feral, she let me get about a foot away from her and her nest which was hidden in some couches. I have been leaving some food and water right outside the nest location for her, and when I check on her I shine a flashlight inside to check and see if they are ok. She never moved her kittens during this time so I am led to believe she trusts me slightly. However tonight we thought they were dead so we moved one of the couches, picked them up and brought them inside for about 20 minutes. I put them in a basket from the garage with a heating pad.

While we were moving the couches she fled the nest but stayed in the garage. They turned out to be alive so we put them back in the nest. She was in the garage when we went out to put them back, but she might have slipped out as we made a lot of noise putting the couches back. I handled them (for the most part) with cheap knit winter gloves but now I am extreamly worried and anxious that she is now going to abandon them, or not know they got put back. There are also feral males that try and get in and out of the garage sometimes that I'm very worried about now that shes not sitting on them.

What should I do? Take them in and try to care for them, or hope she comes back to them? The nest is not in a position that we can sit and watch and wait to spy on her to see if she comes back. We are equipped with kitten formula and a bottle and have done some reading but we have never cared for neonatal kittens before. We have read that they have the best chance with their mother and dont want to take them if unnecessary.

I was shaken up but figured the mouse would have ran somewhere dark and my room had its lights on. 
Once I turned off my lights to sleep, I heard squirrels in the walls. I know the squirrels were in our attic but I figured they could also get into our walls. I've heard them a lot over the past week every single night when  I go to bed. They scamper and I hear them nibble. Sometimes I think ""This sounds like they're actually in my room.""

This might be a bit of a Lengthy Post, But I desperately need your Help/Advice 🙄

So, Until the Age of 17, I Used to be the guy that believed in ""True"" Love, Fairytale romances etc. (Looking back, now i can see how stupid i was lol)

And Then I met a Girl, That I fell in love with.

She was, at the time, had a guy that she talked to, But said that I shouldnt worry about it (Found out later).

So, We were talking all night everyday for like 2 months, And things were great.

Then she suddenly started not returning calls, Texts etc.

I was naive, But not that stupid, So I broke up with her, Without even trying to explain everything, 

(She got the idea that i found out about her on and off thing with the other guy)


SO, GETTING TO THE MAIN POINT, 

Since the Incident that occured in My Life, I can Never Trust a Girl/Woman when It comes to ""Love"" , Relationships, Dating etc.

I have had a Lot of other girls approaching me, Or showing Intereset in me, Directly / Indirectly,

But I have been Ignoring/Rejecting all of them, Because i get a feeling that its not worth my time. (Partly why I dont have Social Media Accounts)

There are much better things that i do every single day, Like Hitting the gym, Reading Personal Development books etc,

Now, I am starting to think, Maybe I should give it a go again, and Life is too short to Not have some fun.

So, What Can/Should I do to get that 17 Old Lovey Dovey mindet back? One that doesnt stop me from letting a girl into my life?

I can answer more questions if the post isnt Clear, Thank You for Making it until the End,

Much Love.",06Apr2020,1

He's never done anything bad to me or (as far as I can tell) anyone really. But when I'm around him, it's like we both are just the worst versions of ourselves. He uses the n word way more than anyone ever should. It got so bad that for a while, I became totally desensitized to it and even said it a bit myself. I've broken out of that, but it made me uncomfortable.   
  
Apart from the n word, he'll just be generally racist. Never to other people, just when he's talking to me.    
  
We'll talk about things that I wouldn't talk about with anyone else. All kinds of ""edgy"" jokes about rape, pedophilia, race, whatever. And they are jokes, I truly believe that, but it's still things that just aren't acceptable, generally speaking.

186,"My bedroom and the living room at separated by one relatively thin wall. Most noises made inside can be heard on the outside.

My mom is a... well, not what many would call a great parent. The kind that'll make comments about how I look, enter my room without knocking (even after walking in on me changing. Multiple. Times.), humiliating me by making me wear clothes that I'm uncomfortable in because I had bad grades, yelling about every little thing to the point where I'm in tears, and generally has the emotionally maturity of a 12 year old.

My mom has this friend that she's had around for years. She's nice. Only now, this friend is around all of the time.

My mother and her what seems to be live-in friend have developed the uncomfortable habit of sleeping out in the living room. And spending all day in the living room. They're taking the whole ""living"" part of it a bit too seriously, it seems. 

Because of this, I can't do any voice calls for fear of her hearing and walking in to spout some shit about how I shouldn't be talking to strangers online, despite this being one of the only forms of social contact I get with people not in my immediate family. Since the living room is open to kitchen, the den, and the hallway (which leads to various places, most importantly, the ""common"" bathroom that everyone but her and her friends use.) she can see where I go and what I do outside of my room. When I let the cat out, when I feed the cat, when I grab water, and when I go to the bathroom (which I have the unfounded paranoia that she's going to time me and make fun of me for taking a crap). This makes me incredibly uncomfortable, because it's almost like she's monitoring my door. As if the camera pointed at my door wasn't already bad enough. 

Now, I haven't been a bad kid since I was a toddler filling the dish washer with an entire bottle of dish detergent. I've never done anything, aside from the occasional hiding/making of bad grades. Never sneaked out, drank, had sex, done hard drugs, or even been to a party not hosted by someone she knows. There is no reason to watch me. 

I've talked to her about how it makes me uncomfortable and to please sleep in her room again (which I feel most adults would be okay with), and her response was essentially a drawn out, meaner ""too bad,"" which I pretty much expected. 

Moving out isn't an option, nor is moving rooms.

189,"Hey guys, 

So I wanted to make this post for awhile now and ask if anyone knows if maybe my SO’s mother has NPD or what or how to handle what she has been doing. So basically I’m a 19 year old female and my girlfriends mother offered for me to come and live with them due to abuse I was facing at home. Now my own mother I strongly suspect has NPD but that’s a story for another time. Anyways, my girlfriends mother who I will refer to as “B” FaceTimed us one time when my gf came to visit me and was in tears on FaceTime because she knew of the abuse I was dealing with at home and asked me to come live with them. I thought she was being really generous and had no reason to think at the time that this woman was anything other than nice and generous. However things got sour pretty quick after I moved in. She never gives us privacy at all. She started out by not even knocking on the room door before she entered. She would just walk in. My gf kept asking her to please knock and ask if she can come in, but this would either result in B getting angry and walking out and slamming doors around the house etc etc or she would just start knocking as she walked into the room. One night sure enough she walked in while I was changing. She luckily didn’t see anything as my gf and I both starting shouting “no shut the door please” and she did and claims she didn’t see anything but since I was turned around I can’t be 100% sure if she didn’t see for sure or not. This was really embarrassing for me and she just gave me a quick and very insincere apology. I’ve also noticed that every time anyone tries to talk, she interrupts and starts rambling about her past or just anything that revolves around her. It just seems very one sided whenever you have a conversation with her. I used to think it was just me she was doing it too but quickly learned she was doing this to everyone. She also forces her husband to cook and clean for her. He makes her every meal and all she does is complain and freak out on him. He’s not even allowed to talk about his work since she thinks his job is meaningless and that hers is the most important and only she can talk about work. He can’t talk about anything really it seems, as she starts yelling at him if he does and says he’s annoying and talks too much.  She controls everything he does. She acts very childish as well. Once she kept telling him to pick her up breakfast from Tim Hortons first thing in the morning and he told her he couldn’t, as he was going to be late if he did. She reacted by loudly going “UGGGHHHHH!” and stomped away loudly into her room and slammed the door closed. This woke me up very early on a day I had to work. That’s another issue too. Nobody is allowed to make a sound when she goes to bed. If anyone even whispers she will start calling or texting them telling them to be quiet or to go sit in the basement. Meanwhile she stomps outside our room door every morning and makes loud noises and I’m nearly sure she’s doing it on purpose to wake us because she hates when anyone sleeps late and I actually could see her feet pacing back and forth under the door from where I was laying in bed. Another incident that really bothers me is basically I had to get medications from my doctor for anxiety and depression and this was my first time going on meds for it. Her mother did not know about this, she only knew I went to the doctors. So I left my meds in their bag just sitting in our room and I went to go out for a bit. When I came back, I saw the bag was moved around. Now I know my girlfriend couldn’t have done it seeing as she was with me and her mother was the only one in the house. This makes me uncomfortable because if her mother did in fact look at my meds, I feel violated as that is my own private business and I didn’t want someone to know unless I told them specifically. I also consistently find my journals moved around a lot after my gf and I go out places. I’ve also caught her looking around our room on Christmas Day but she still has no idea I caught her. I just went to walk into the room and saw her in there but she wasn’t facing me so didn’t see me. I just walked back out and told me gf and she was angry about it but we never said anything. She treats my gf terribly too. My gf was sexually assaulted and B literally called her perverse and made it out to be her fault. I will never be able to forgive her for the way she treated my gf over that. I feel terrible for my gf. She pushes my gf around by calling her a whole bunch of times and making her do ridiculous things. She criticized her and pokes fun at things she cannot help, such as her anxiety disorder. I am unsure of what to do, so any advice would be helpful.",06Apr2020,1
190,"So,  I am 18 almost 19, and I live with my mom. Now, I know that a lot of people will come at me and be like ""well its her house and her rules"" yes, I know that. I'm having a lot of issues though because I feel that because I'm an adult, that I should be able to have certain freedoms that I couldn't have when I was a minor. My mom is a total control freak, and doesn't like it when things don't go her way and will make EVERYTHING 10x more dramatic than what the true situation is (she's also a total et lol) but yeah. I have responsibilities and things like that, but even when I get done what she wants me to do, it is never good enough. She also for some reason always has an issue whenever I want to go to my boyfriend's house, which I should point out that we have been together for almost 2 years, and any time I ask if I can go over there it turns into a fight and she has told me before that it is because she can't control what happens there. I should also mention that he will spend the night at our house ALL the time, but if I want to spend the night at his house she will through a fit. Every time she is mad or frustrated, she takes it out on me and will then blame me for things happening to her even though I have no control on it, and she will also say I'm extremely selfish because of wanting to have some freedoms and wanting to do things. I really need advice as to how to what I should do so that I can try to have a discussion with her about boundaries that is actually going to have an effect.

I also know that I can move out, but I don't have my license because I have no one to teach me how to drive, and I'm not allowed to get a job because I have no way to ger there because I live in a rural area that is a 20-minute drive from everywhere. Any advice as to what I can do would be very helpful because I really don't know what to do or how to handle her.",06Apr2020,1
191,"Hello! I posted this on r/askreddit and wanted to try here as well.

I wanted to ask you teachers, specifically in the arts, where you went to school for your credentials. I’m in California, and have been researching schools. So far National University, CSULB, CSUN and Point Loma Nazarene have great secondary education credential programs. But I wanted to ask you all so I can explore further. I also understand that sometimes an English credential is a requirement to teach drama. (CSUSM has this but no art :( )

I have a BFA in Illustration, and have a ton of experience in teaching/volunteering theater and art for grades 1-12. I’m looking forward to your answers/suggestions!

She is bi which I'm fine with but now she thinks I'm not fine with that. She springs on me that she also wants a girlfriend and is mad at me because I assumed she only wanted to be with one person. She is telling me most bi women want a girlfriend and boyfriend and I should have known that. Then she gets mad because I said I assumed she only wanted me. There were never signs that she wanted a girlfriend too. I don't care she is bi but I do care she wants to love someone else. I think we should only be only be with one person. I'd be less upset if she just wanted someone else for sex but she literally wants two relationships and even said she'd marry two people. We are only 5 weeks into the relationship, I'm glad this came out now. We never have discussed being exclusive but still this floored me and apparently I'm the bad guy here for not ever asking her. Am I wrong? How normal is this? I have no idea if should just end this now or see if she ever changes her mind or jump board?

198,"I live in NYC in my own apartment, with my baby. 

A month ago, my mom said that there will be an outbreak soon and to come to maryland to hide from it. I agreed and my baby and I have now been in maryland for a month.

When I was a child, my mom was abusive (would rip up my artwork, curse at me, made me kiss her feet once, etc) and now she is better but she will still do 2 emotionally abusive things: make constant snide remarks about my parenting, and she will invade my privacy. It never goes above this level but it gives me flashbacks to my childhood every time she makes a snide remark.

I do not have any other place to stay.

Should I go back to NYC? I do not want to  infect myself or the baby, with the rona. I have huge amounts of food provisions in my NYC apartment and would not have to go outside at all.

Extra details: for example, I'll be breastfeeding and she will barge into the room.

Another example: Constant remarks accusing me of things I didnt do. For example, I'll be breastfeeding the baby to sleep, she'll barge in and say ""why are you putting her to sleep when she is hungry!!"" and I'll be like, ""how do u even think to know whether shes hungry or not? You've been outside for 6 hours. I actually fed her oatmeal."" and then she will still insist im wrong and refuse to believe me. THINGS LIKE THIS 10 TIMES A DAY.

What I've done: Ive spoken to her extensively about this and set down boundaries. she continues to break them. I've given examples of her bad accusations and she says ""ive done NOTHING wrong. my back is hurting!!! I dont even have energy to do anything wrong to you!""

I know the virus is bad. I know the hospitals are full of people already. And at the same time, her abuse is causing me to have horrible flashbacks to my childhood and is making me unable to work.",06Apr2020,1

I keep changing my plans and goals because I keep finding out there are better options than I knew before. It's really difficult to complete a goal when I keep changing it. It really delays any progress. I just wish I was more informed. It's until I have finally reached my goal and say ""ok this is what I want"" that I find out there was a better option the whole time and I'm just finding out. I do my research just to find out it has changed and the information I go was outdated when I finally get there. I guess it's what I make of it. I sometimes feel I didn't aim high enough because I am too much of a realist, but I guess I'd rather be safe since I really want to finish on good terms. I'm not taking enough risk in my opinion but I don't really think it's a bad thing since I made it quite far and who knows maybe if I did take risks I would have fallen real low. I don't regret it I think  I handled as much as I could.

I never understood why we were meant to make really important decisions at such a young age, I wouldn't trust a child to decide my entire future, but that's reality when you don't have anyone to guide you.

202,"A year or so ago I began to develop feelings for a coworker friend of mine, John. In the preceding months, he and I had became increasingly closer work friends and would spend hours talking, flirting, etc. I had started to suspect he also was catching feelings due to his behavior (flirting, body language, touching me) but I was hesitant to admit my feelings for fear that they weren't reciprocated. Around this time, a mutual friend of ours approached me at a party and told me that John expressed interest in me. Additionally, later on that night John drunkenly confided in me that he felt like we had a ""connection"" and he could tell me anything. At that point I began to think that maybe John had also caught feelings, but afraid to act on them. 

A few days later I approached John and asked him if he had feelings for me. He told me that while he had considered it, he was not planning on acting on his feelings because we were coworkers. He also told me that he wasn't 100% sure where his feelings were at, but expressed an interest in us getting to know each other better and seeing where we were both at. While his answer was more lukewarm than I was expecting, but I had tried to give him an out and he didn't take it. I had told him that if he didn't have feelings for me or did not think there was potential between us for anything more, that that was completely fine but I needed him to be honest and tell me that - but he didn't. 

John and I got together once but in the weeks following he never made an initiative to see me or talk to me. We carried on as friends but never brought up what had happened earlier. To me his lack of initiative indicated that he was not into me and never actually wanted to take things further. While I was definitely disappointed that he didn't have the same feelings for me, I was mostly hurt that he just had not been honestly with me about that from the get to. After about 4 weeks I, again, approached John and told him that I felt that we needed to clear to air so we could move forward as friends. He told me that the reason he did not pursue things further was because he did not want to go down that road with a co-worker. He also took responsibility for hurting my feelings and not being upfront with me and telling me sooner. Although I was hurt, his apology seemed genuine and he told me how much he cared about me and valued our friendship so I forgave him. John and I went back to being friends pretty easily and I felt really lucky that he and I had been able to maintain our friendship.

In the following months John and I became (I thought) even closer friends. Many times he told me that he cared about me and our friendship and I completely believed him. At the same time I noticed that John had started to grow closer with another female coworker of ours and would openly flirt with her in front of me. While that did make me feel insecure, I knew that it was not my place to be upset about it. He was also a huge flirt with all women and he explicitly told me that he was against pursuing relationships with coworkers so I chalked it up to just harmless, friendly flirting. 

I was completely blindsighted to learn, though, that he and the girl had begun hooking up shortly after he told me (to my face) that he did not want a relationship with a coworker. Up until that point, I thought that John was a genuine friend who cared about me and valued our friendship. I honestly was shocked that he would lie to me so blatantly about something so sensitive and then throw it in my face like that. I know for a fact that John knew that I knew about their relationship shortly after I found out about it. John did not (and still has not) ever tried to explain/clarify things with me or try to patch up our friendship. Unsurprisingly things went cold between us pretty quickly. While I don't think that John intentionally tried to hurt me, I believe that actions speak louder than words and that John's action speak volumes to his lack of regard for me. I cared about John a lot and thought highly of him, and it stills hurts me to think that maybe our friendship was never genuine and that he maybe never really cared about me. I have many times questioned if he was just friendly towards me because he wanted attention and the ego boost from flirting with me, and then threw me to the side once he had something better to move onto.

While John and I can be professional and courteous, it has been about six months and I am still very hurt. Because of the lack of closure and that fact that he and I still work together my wounds have not yet scabbed over. I have tried being distant towards John, being friendly towards him, and everything in between but I still can't figure out how to get over it and move on. I don't have romantic feelings for him anymore but I am still grieving the loss of a friendship and am constantly being reminded of that fact. I frankly am just looking for advice on how to move on. I don't want to be with John and I don't want to reconcile our friendship but I want to get over the pain that I am carrying and I don't know how at this point.",06Apr2020,1

My ex and I have reconnected months ago. We talk almost every day. He has been so empathetic with this situation and gave me free n95 masks (which is impossible to come by) and we went on a walk on his property that day and maintained a distance. He has been focusing on exercising, reading, learning, and creating innovative ideas for his business to continue to work to educate children despite the pandemic. 

My bf just drinks, plays video games, eats fast food, smokes, and dicks around while working from home. Drinks on the job. It’s embarrassing. 

Meanwhile I find it hard to relate to my bf just leisurely having fun when I am at work potentially exposing myself to these patients and putting people younger than me on a ventilator. I have cried to many times about how the government and hospital corporations have let down the American public in this time of crisis. So I have to become innovative. My ex has helped me innovate new ideas to protect staff and other patients from The virus. 







My ex seems more interested in me, or is he just being nice? 
My ex texts me long long paragraphs like this: 


I bet you felt like a badass! Makes total sense! Oh this will be history and you’re apart of it! It’s amazing! And y’all are amazing! I hope this is turning point for how we view healthcare professionals as well as some other disciplines!

That’s good you do that! Honestly it’s that kind of behavior you have to!

Hmm so underprepared in so many ways! Michael Osterholm talks about our dependence on China and it makes us vulnerable! You should listen to him! 

Well I’m glad to hear it will be a little more chill for you but still be careful and protect yourself! You never know who is asymptomatic or who was breathing a couple hours before you get there!

Oh I’m just chillin in my space! I’ve been reading my book Gone World (no idea what it’s about and I want to keep it that way, not knowing - just a book that was laying around haha), watching YouTube videos, I worked out, idk just keeping myself occupied! May listen to a podcast to wind down! Just chillin and doing my duty and staying home! It’s hard work I tell ya lol 

Yeah I read about that! Gah what a bunch of entitled selfish dumbfucks! I am sure you’re right, it will cause an outbreak! And it will lag about 2/3weeks, so thanks y’all for making this last longer and killing people! Just terrible! 

I woke up with a sore throat. Well I’ve had a sore throat on and off for a little while but idk! 
I am okay! 
I hope you’re doing well! 



Hmmm Im sorry:( we’ll just know there are also plenty of people out there who value y’all so much!! Like so much! It’s unfortunate that many people and authorities don’t and I am sorry for that:(  I am sure it’s hard to stay positive but remember history and that you’re a badass! Because you are! No doubt, I know it super hard on you:( 
Ah It’s tragic the nature of death and how it separates loved ones during those last moments! It’s tragic:( 
Do you work tonight?



Wow! That’s awesome you made your recommendations known and what quality recommendations! I so agree with the idea that we should assume everyone has covid and protect yourselves with that concept in mind! Because it would be terrible if staff or random patients were catching due to poor practice! 
I hope some, if not all of your recommendations are followed through! I’m glad you’re getting a night off!! 

Yeah it’s ridiculous how hospitals were telling staff at one point to not to wear masks because it could scare patients! Idk I think things should be hardcore strict for a shorter period of time as opposed to half-assed measures for a longer period of time! 



Yeah weeks ago I felt really achey! Yeah I have been saying that for weeks on and off! 

Gah that’s really cool you have Animal crossing and it’s so fun I bet! I bet that’s so engaging and life that’s better than this one at the moment! Making good progress?!

I’m just watching standup, cleaning up, getting ready for tomorrow, lifting weights occasionally! Idk just get ready to wind down!",06Apr2020,1

If someone believes they can't work, hasn't done much of it for their life, is scared of it now, it's a new experience and they've had negative experiences and are worried and anxious, don't believe they're able or capable, feel they're physically weak and unable (even though they physically can work), what can I do to communicate through that?
This person is dealing with a very difficult financial situation and waiting for things to get better is probably even more stressful than taking the initial stressful leap and beginning working. This person is smart and talented and seems fully able to work. What can I do? I'm so sad about forcing myself to not say anything, only to hear two days later about the ongoing financial situation that they are able to take steps towards helping but see walls in front of them. This person has an immediate family member who is doing the breadwinning but they can benefit from another income. When this breadwinner is searching for supplemental income I can't help but think about how there is another relative who can do that, and that the breadwinner doesn't need to do two jobs while the other continues living in fear and feeling unable

207,"I'm conflicted about the relationship I have with my mom. I'm only 17 which means I am still dependent on my parents for everything.Because of that I try to be respectful and not argue. I used to allot because I didn't understand it was useless until I talked to my brother. He is 26 and has put some distance between himself and our mom. 

When he was 19 she still had access to his bank and took out $1000 without telling him. Yes he did owe the money but she went into  his bank account without permission. She also shows up to him and his wife's house without warning and will let herself in if they aren't home. She shit talks his mother in law to me all the time and also complains about his wife. 

 something doesn't feel right between us either. She does nice things for me and it makes me feel like I'm being ungrateful or unappreciative at times. But then most of the time her good deeds are used as leverage against me when we get into a fight. I try to keep things to as little conflict as possible now which means camping out in my room downstairs. She doesn't like this and confronted me about it. She said I never talk to her and she feels like I hate her. I tried to explain that I was removing myself from the situation because every time we try to ""talk"" we just end up fighting and screaming. The fighting is pointless to me because she never listens and just ends up cussing me out and calling me a bitch. Nothing is ever resolved and she either moves on or demands my apology (I always just apologize to get her off my back). Because of my age I am thinking of my future and I'm getting worried. I'm trying to become financially independent in case this ship sinks and I'm left with no support but, anytime I bring up anything related to financing she brushes it off and says ""later"". It got to the point that my brother saw how clueless I was and snuck me out for a secret appointment with an adviser. My mom eventually found out and was hurt. She asked my why I didn't get her to take me and I explained that I wanted to get things going and she kept stalling. 

I also came out to her this year. Well I was technically forced by my dad to tell her because he threatened to if I didn't. She hit me with the whole ""Oh I knew it"" and the ""Are you sure?"" I tried not to hold it against her but when I asked what we where going to do about my super homophobic aunt if I got a girlfriend she brushed it off and said it didn't matter. Later that year we also got into an argument in the car and she told me that ever since I came out I changed and that I'm too involved in liking drag queens and that she misses the old me. Now I don't talk about any personal relationships with her to keep things calm. 

Even though she has done all that I still feel bad for being weary of her. She said they would buy me a new mattress when I move out and are helping to pay for my university. she isn't always bad and she takes care of me something just feels wrong.",06Apr2020,1

209,"I've been in band for 4 years now, starting from 7th grade to 9th grade. I absolutely loved playing my instrument (the euphonium) and adored the people I was with in middle school. I adored being around everyone in my band. My teacher really pushed us to learn and improve, which could be hard at times but it always paid off. It finally felt like I had something that I really, truly loved. 

I moved to a new town in my 8th grade year, which also means a new band. This band was a lot smaller and we only had classes every other day, despite our teacher being a full-time middle school instructor, unlike my middle school instructor. This was only a minor inconvenience, though. What I felt like I was really missing out on was the sense of community. 

I'm in 9th grade now. When I started band this year, I felt like I would regain my motivation to stay in band because of the upperclassmen. I met a lot of them at the pep band games. They all seemed like they were having a good time and they also urged me to stay because I'm one of the few low brass players in my band (same with my BD). That's really the only thing keeping me from quitting band right now. I have other hobbies/extracurricular activities other than band, such as theatre, which is also very important to me. If I quit band, then I will have more time to dedicate to theatre and also a free elective space to try something else or get a credit out of the way.

I reported this to my guidance counselor, which got them in minor trouble, but I'm thinking about doing it again. They mock the things I say, throw things at me, don't even treat me like a person, make rude faces, and say vulgar things. this happens every single day. Should I tell someone in higher power about this? should I feel guilty for telling my guidance counselor and getting them in trouble? please reply if you have a helpful answer!",06Apr2020,1

I am 19 years old and just recently came out as gay to my very religions family (father is a pastor). Back in December 2019 I met up with a guy visiting Hawaii on Grindr hooked up and then we really hit it off. Turns out he has a husband and is in an open relationship. Me and this guy would text literally every second and have up to 7+hr FaceTimes while his husband was at work. He ended up moving from Colorado to Hawaii (which is where I live) and I helped build his house, met his husband etc. we are all really good friends but I am deeply in love with him and can’t stop thinking about him. I told him that I think I was falling in love with him on one of our FaceTime calls and he said he was having the same feeling but it’s complicated.

218,"So my ex girlfriends/fiancé’s dad just died. Due to the circumstances, they’re not having a formal funeral, but rather a memorial lunch type thing on an undecided date, once this virus thing is all over.

I’m debating whether or not going. A little background. I (now 29) have a lot of respect for these people (my exes parents), who housed and fed me for several years from my last year of high school, though college, and remained close with until I was 25 (when my ex and I broke up). They were like a second set of parents to me. We even kept in touch afterwards, but nowhere near as close. They even sent a card with some money when my son was born last year. I have a special place in my heart for them. 

My current girlfriend and mother to my child totally understands why I want to go, and is totally fine with me wanting to pay my respects. My only concern and it’s something I have a hard time discussing with my girlfriend, is how my ex would feel. Our relationship ended badly. It essentially ended because we wanted to go in different directions in life, and we both were too stubborn to compromise for one another. For instance, one of the big things was having kids. She was very firm about never having kids, and I wanted kids. After we had moved out of her parents house, we lasted in an apartment together for about 6 months. They were the most miserable months of my life. It got to the point where we were arguing over nonsense every day. I think she has some commitment issues. Anyways, we haven’t spoken since the day I moved out of that apartment.

I’ve never stopped loving my ex. She’s super talented, caring, loves her family, and we had many amazing years together. I only wish that she finds what she’s looking for in life. She’s dating someone new, and from what I see online, she looks like she’s doing alright.

I just wouldn’t want to ruin such an important day for her and her family. But maybe she would appreciate it?

I only know about the memorial service because my mom showed me her dads obituary in the paper. I don’t have her parents contact anymore, only know where their house is, and I haven’t seen them in years.

How do I go about paying my respects? Her dad really liked me, and he was really upset by our breaking up. I just want to do the right thing here.",06Apr2020,1
220,"He reported 3 break-ins just this week. He has done this dozens of times over the past few years - but I find it especially disturbing that they are doing it now because it is putting all of the people involved at an unnecessary risk of exposure to the virus.

Basically - he claims to own the house next to his. The house is in foreclosure and no one lives there. The house is owned by some over seas real estate company that buys up American foreclosure properties, fixes them up, and then sells them. They are impossible to contact. We all tried. The house is still in the name of the previous owner who died - this is a public record.

He tells everyone it's his house. So when workers come to you know - work on it - he calls the police on them accusing them of breaking into HIS house. He literally called the police on some guy who showed up to power wash the mold off of the outside of the house.

Over and over again the police believe him and send the workers away. Neighbors think the police are working for him and are afraid to talk. Warned me not to say anything. He has started reporting crimes at other peoples houses now - getting really scary - especially because they always believe him.

221,"Throwaway, I want this post to be anonymous.

I believe my friend has a drug problem.  I don't know what to do.  One of my best friends is heavily abusing weed.  I know that weed is not a bad drug and benefits many peoples lives.  But, my friend has taken it to a whole new level.

My friend (19M), started smoking weed before we became friends.  I believe he first started smoking around 14yo.  We became super close in our junior year of high school.  At the beginning of our friendship, I used to smoke weed too.  We would smoke with each other on the weekends, and at parties.  We never went to school, or work high.  This continued for a bit until my friend started using more, and I started using less.  By the time we graduated, I did not smoke that much, and he started to smoke regularly.  I didn't think it was much of a problem.  Then university came, I gave up weed completely and overtime my friend started smoking every day.

My friend began failing school and losing his interest in a lot of extracurricular activities.  He no longer wanted to work out (he was super into powerlifting), didn't want to study, or try anything new.  He always opted to stay in to get high and game.  He also started to become less sociable, smoke inside his room (multiple times a day), drive high, and experiment with shrooms and acid.  He also looks super unhealthy.  I don't know how else to say this, but he basically became unrecognizable and became a bum.  He now drops acid alone in his basement regularly and smokes all day, every day.

All of his close friends became worried, his sister is worried about him.  We feel like he's drifting.  He won't be attending university next year and doesn't really have a plan.

Another friend and I recently asked him if everything was okay.  We wanted to know why he smokes all day, why he feels the need to drop acid by himself, if he has a plan, etc.  He got super defensive and mad at us.  We haven't spoken to him since then (this was St. Paddies day).  

We put off asking if he was okay for too long.  I feel guilty about that.  I don't know why we waited so long.

This is one of my best friends.  I want him to get better, but I feel like he's ignorant to how weed changed him.  I don't know how to approach this since last time we tried to bring it up he got super defensive.  Does anyone have any advice?",06Apr2020,1
222,"Me (20f) and my boyfriend (21m) are celebrating our 4th anniversary in May. We also intend to move in with one another once I can start my new job which got delayed because of coronavirus. 

My parents dont view us as a ""serious"" or committed couple because we dont intend to get married. They think my boyfriend isnt treating me right because he doesnt want to propose. They're religious and got married young and have a happy marriage. 

My boyfriends parents have both been divorced. I dont have a single other person in my life whose parents have been happily married through their whole life. I am also 20 years old and do not feel comfortable committing my life to someone at this age. And finally, I'm not religious. I dont believe in unionizing under god as man and wife etc. Etc. Because of this, I see no reason to make the decisions my parents want me to, but it's annoying as fuck that they dont respect me or my partner. 

How do I tell them politely to fuck off? We MAY want to get married some day. It's not that we don't want to spend our lives together, we just dont know enough about life to promise it.

228,"My middle sister is a heroin addict. I’ll call her M. She got pulled over by the police 5 years ago. They found drugs and needles in her car and took her 1 year old son away from her and her boyfriend. She took off and I’ve had zero contact with her for 5 years. 

My parents have recently reconnected with her over Facebook. She says she’s been clean for 3 years and is doing well. I’ve got a mug shot of her that shows that is a lie. She’s made plans to visit them and has bailed 3 times already. 

I have another sister who I’ll call N. N happened to run into M at a grocery store yesterday. N told M she doesn’t want anything to do with her and to stay away. M called and whines to my mom that N won’t speak to her. Mom called and tried to guilt trip N into being friendly to M. N is very upset that she is being guilt tripped and reaches out to me. I tell her she doesn’t have to talk to M if she doesn’t want to to. That it’s none of my mom’s business and to tell my mom to back off.

I have also heard from my nephew (M’s oldest child) that my dad is guilt tripping him to forgive his mom for abandoning him. This makes me furious but I let him know that this is his choice. If he wants to see his mom I’ll support him, if he doesn’t I’ll support that. 

I’ve been having bad dreams about my parents having a family gathering and trying to force me to reconcile with M. This whole situation is giving me horrible anxiety and I don’t want want to be pressured by my parents. So today I decided to preemptively call my mom about it.

I told her it’s great she’s reconnected with M. But that is her thing and separate from me and N. That N feels like she’s trying to guilt her into a relationship with M. That she is not allowed to try and guilt me at all about M. That I felt like our relationship (mine and my mom’s) has been going quite well and I’d like to keep it that way. However if I feel like you’re pushing M on me  that I’ll have to distance myself from her. That I will not be attending anything that M will be at. 

My mom cried a lot and said I wasn’t being fair. That I shouldn’t make her choose between her kids. I told her I’m not making her choose anything. She can still have a relationship with M but to keep me out of it. She says she can’t believe how heartless N and I are. I told her that unless M has gone through some major therapy that she’s still a toxic person and I don’t need the drama in my life.

M isn’t just a drug addict. Drugs I suspect are just a symptom of some sort of mental illness. M has always lied for no reason. Just lies to lie. She’s lied about having cancer twice. She tried to rope me into a scheme to kidnap her boys the first time she was under investigation from cps. She’s just trouble.

229,"Hi all. Let me preface this story with this : I ( 20F )  don’t really have many friends. I have a boyfriend i really really care about. But normal friends? Not so much. So in many ways , I consider my dog my best friend. I tell her everything and she makes me the happiest person in the world. Her name is Daisy. 

So i live with my sister , brother in-law , and 2 year old nephew. My mom and dad ended up getting stuck in Washington state due to the pandemic. So , I came home from work ( woohoo to being an essential employee ! ) and my sister is in a pretty bitchy mood. it’s whatever. My nephew , who i love very much but is basically a demon in a 2 year olds body , was eating a box of raisins. When he decided he didn’t want them anymore , he poured them out on the ground. Daisy rushed over and ate some. I wasn’t there so , i’m not sure how many she ate , but my sister said it couldn’t have been more than 4. 

As i’m sure a lot of you know , grapes/raisins are very dangerous to dogs. And daisy is a little lady , so i THINK i’m freaking out for good reason. 

I called ASPCA poison helpline , paid the fee , followed their instructions to get daisy to vomit , and nothing. now i’m thinking i have to get her to the vet tomorrow. 

Problem is , i just got hired at my new job. I signed the papers on wednesday. and due to things closing due to the virus , i have been unemployed since february. so i do NOT have the money to afford a vet trip. 

So i called my mom , and in hysterics explained what happened. As i mentioned , Daisy Dog is my best friend. I have raised her since she was a little baby and when i’m home she doesn’t leave my side. This dog means the WORLD to me. Well my parents think i’m being insane. telling me dogs can’t die from grapes , she’s just gonna have a tummy ache , and that if anything i should be the one to go to the doctor since i’m freaking out about this. 

the ASPCA says i NEED to get Daisy to the vet. But i don’t have hundreds of dollars at all right now. I’m scared and don’t know what to do. Not asking for medical help , however , what I am asking for is advice on to how to get my parents to understand how important this is. What should i do?",06Apr2020,1

234,"My grandfather has had lung cancer for slightly over a year, though he was coughing blood months before he was officially diagnosed. His health has drastically declined lately, he has no energy to stay awake and has lost close to 20lbs since January. Anyone around him can tell that this is finally an end to his year-long battle.

I've never lost someone I cared this much about. When I first learned he had cancer, I was in shock and obviously upset, but he seemed to be doing fine for awhile and I almost forgot he was even diagnosed. Now that he's declining and close to death, all the emotion has set in again like the first time, and I feel terrible.

235,"I've been with my boyfriend for 11 months now and things have been going really well. We've had ups and downs and a really tough start but we've been happy for so long. 

Here's some backstory. Boyfriend and I met through mutual friends. He lives an hour away but we saw each other every weekend up until corona quarantine. By rough start, I mean that I broke up with him and cheated (yes, I know it's awful. I don't need to be made guiltier than I already am) because of my insecurities. There were also other issues as we're from different cultures and we didn't know the customs when with the other's family. We also didn't speak the same language, but I learned his and he's learning mine. I was awful to him in the beginning but he stuck with me and we've both made sacrifices for each other. There was a lot of reason for him to be rude, but he's never even yelled at me before. He was everything I needed and more. He's taught me how to be mature, responsible, and less bitter (I grew up in a toxic household and have a lot to unteach myself). 

He was such a gentleman until a few weeks ago. My boyfriend called me that night and told me that he didn't know if he loved me as much anymore and that he wasn't sure if he wanted to be with me or with a woman from his home country. This of course upset me and I started crying over the phone. I asked him why he felt this way and he just said he was sorry. He told me to forget what he said- that he didn't mean it and that he was crazy for ever thinking that. I decided that I could forgive him if he told me why he said it (still hasn't btw). I also decided to let it go in the moment and made a personal note to ask about it when we weren't so emotional.

I thought that was the end of it until tonight. Tonight, we were on the phone talking when I said that I thought about going for a walk tomorrow. He asked me if I was going to run or do other exercise and I said no. I asked why and he said ""I would prefer it if you were a bit skinnier"". I am overweight bordering obese, and he knows that I was anorexic in the past and still struggle with my weight. He also knows that I care very much about my health, so this comment was unnecessary. I've never had him or anyone besides family make rude comments about my weight before. I asked him how long he had thought that and he said for about a month. Then, he asked if we could talk tomorrow so he could watch a movie. I was so shocked by the entire conversation that I just said yes without thinking, and he hung up immediately without telling me goodnight or anything like we always do.

It seems like he has had a sudden personality change. He went from being the sweetest man I know to someone who I have to beg for attention. He barely talks to me now and we haven't called for days until tonight. Has anyone experienced a similar situation with a partner. If so, how did you handle it and why was your partner acting so rude and strange?",06Apr2020,1

241,"Hi all, 

Made a new account to post this on, just because I’m a little paranoid about privacy. Also forgive me; I’m on mobile. 

So some quick background. I have suffered with anxiety for quite some time now, and was diagnosed with that and depression about three years ago. I saw a therapist and was on medication for quite some time, but am proud to say I was able to get off meds and see my therapist a lot less than I used to. 

And then COVID-19 happened .

Without getting too specific, I’m a local journalist in New York. Needless to say, this whole entire thing has led to long, stressful, extended work weeks (not nearly as long nor as stressful as it is for our healthcare professionals, God bless them). I thought I was keeping a solid focused head on my shoulder at the beginning, but I’ve noticed the worse this gets, the worse I’m declining. 

It has gotten to the point where my anxiety is not just manifesting around the pandemic, but other things as well. I splashed water on myself while washing my dishes and later in the day accidentally hit a pothole with my car - both things led to me in tears, focused on the fact that my dishwasher is broken (which sounds so insignificant, I know) or that my car was damaged (it wasn’t). 

After work, the only way I can get myself out of the work headspace is to drink. I KNOW this is a slippery slope and I’ve always tried not to self-medicate, but sometimes two or three glasses of wine seems to be the only way I can stop thinking about all the deaths, all the desperation. 

I by no means have it the worst than anyone. My immediate family is healthy, and they are in a financial place where they should survive this. It almost feels selfish to think my mental health is declining, but the long, six hour work weeks are starting to take their toll, despite the fact that I do have a continuing passion to help in anyway I can. Any advice on how I can pull myself back? How are you all coping with this?",06Apr2020,1

I was laid off back in November 2019. I was an Underwriter for an insurance company. I took a month or so off of job hunting during the holidays and really started looking around late January. I started getting discouraged in early March because I wasn't landing the jobs I was applying to after having some really great interviews. 

I ended up landing a job (selling insurance - something that I used to do but dont really enjoy) that I applied to as a backup if nothing else worked out. This position doesn't pay well (but covers the bills plus a little $2500/month) and I later found out has no benefits. 

Since accepting the job, my start date had been pushed back due to COVID-19.  I've been grateful to get a couple more Skype interviews lined up (one I have a good referral to as well) for positions  I would love, pay great ($4,000/month) and have full benefits (401K, medical dental, etc).

My internal dilemma is: 

Do I take the job I got an offer for that doesn't pay as well, no benefits and dont really like (bc I used to do it)? I worry that landing a better job will be hard during this pandemic and part of me feels like I should be happy to have something. Or do I risk it and hope to land one of the two I have been interviewing with?

We left off on good terms and remained good friends. Sophomore year happened, he made the effort to hangout here and there but we never hooked up or anything.

When school started, he immediately asked to hang out with him which then became a consistent thing throughout the school year. He would always pay for my coffee, always try to hold my hand, cook for me (specifically bought me steak cause I asked for it), bought wine, asked to go to the city and FaceTime over winter break, invited me to his pregame with his friends (which he has never done before). We were at 2 parties together and he would always stay by my side and try to get with me which was unusual because the past 2 years he would be hooking up with other girls. One of those parties I was dancing pretty close with another guy and I knew he was mad but just didn’t say anything. He remembered my birthday and bought a bottle to my party after I jokingly asked for one too. I got kinda touchy with some of his friends cause I was so drunk and one of his friends the next day told me he looked stressed when I did that. All of these things happened from August-March by the way.

Anyways, because of the coronavirus, our classes got moved to online. He asked to hang out with me the last day of college because he said “this might be the last time I see your face.” Once again, he pays for my coffee and holds my hand. We then go back to my room and we cuddle for a little bit. Finally he asks if I wanted him to kiss me and I say no. He asks why and I said I’m really nervous and bad at this stuff (I have no experience lmao). He ensures me that it’s fine but I say only on the cheek. So he basically kisses me cheek and goes for my neck and we then cuddle for 2 hours. Later that same night, I go to the bar with friends and I get a text from him saying he’s coming. I dance with my guy friends and then I see him hooking up with another girl.

I’m confused; did he just put all this effort throughout the year to just hookup with me? Or was he actually trying for a relationship? He has never had a girlfriend before if that makes a difference. What do you think? Do you think he thinks about this too?",06Apr2020,1

253,"Hi Reddit!

The tenant in the unit below ours is hording trash in and around his apartment. The smells go through his ceiling and our floors into our unit. For that reason we already vacuum and wipe all floors every weekend, have an air purifier running 24/7, and keep some windows open most of the time. We already live in this unhealthy situation for more than a month.

We are in contact with the landlord and she gave him a 90-day notice to move out till mid of April (he's on section-8). She already had police officers investigating the apartment more than a month ago (he won't open the door if the landlord knocks on the door). We also contacted the tenant directly, but we only received promises and didn't notice any change. In addition, he mentioned he's working in a restaurant which I find very troublesome.

On last Thursday I had an extensive call with my landlord. She's not sure if the tenant will vacate his apartment soon and she's unsure what she can do. We already contacted the Sunnyvale Department of Public Safety. They responded that they will send a Neighborhood Preservation Specialist to conduct an inspection of the property. However, we didn't hear back from them afterwards and I assume that they don't work at this moment or have too many requests to deal with.

My wife and I stay at home most of the time for the shelter-in-place. She has light asthma and has trouble breathing with the smells from our neighbor. We are not sure if it's just smells or unhealthy fumes, but it certainly affects our health. Thus, we have the choice to comply with the shelter-in-place and stay in an unhealthy environment or leave the apartment and risk unknowingly spreading or getting the COVID-19 virus.

Today I asked the neighbor if he had a new apartment already. He responded that he can’t reach anyone at the affordable housing office and he can’t afford renting on his own. Thus, I expect him to stay even though his lease expires.

Does anyone have an idea what to do? I feel I already tried everything possible. But, no one replies. I guess due the virus outbreak and the shelter-in-place. The smell is getting worse every day :(

Any advice?",06Apr2020,1

Hi Name of person who runs drawing class

I hope you are well considering everything.
 
Could you please advise me when the payment for my life modelling on the 12th of March will be processed? I realise I was five days later sending the invoice so I may have missed one of your payment schedules and also there may be further delays with how everything is is at the moment but I would be grateful if you could let me know a rough time of when I should be expecting it. 

I appreciate the work you have given me and have always had great experiences working for your classes and feel very sad such wonderful drawing groups cannot go ahead for the time being but I hope they can again in the future. I hope you and your loved ones are coping as well as possible with the lockdown. 

Thank you again and kind regards

257,"**Background:** I'm 19 and my friend is 20 (I'll call him Kinder). I'm in my second year of college right now (still living with parents) and Kinder is a full-time worker at a retail store.

This usually does not matter, but I'm Asian (particularly Vietnamese) and Kinder is white. Now we're not good friends, but I have enjoyed his company over the years. I've known him for 4 years (since junior year of high school).

I've had a lot of changes in my beliefs ever since graduating high school. Growing up in a conservative Vietnamese household, I was taught to not surround myself with gay people, Chinese people (for those who do not know; a lot of Vietnamese parents have a thing against Chinese people due to China's power and other factors), and black people. I was a hardcore conservative in high school. Kinder was and still is. I would make self-deprecating jokes about my heritage and get stuck in that ""white = good"" circlejerk.

Ever since graduating high school, expanding my circle, and thinking for myself, I have changed a lot in my beliefs: I'm way more liberal now, I'm proud of my heritage, I support gay people, and I don't have hate for Chinese or black people (or anyone for that matter). In other words, college changed me a lot.

I started hanging out with Kinder two months ago again after not seeing him since I graduated high school. We were cool until I realized how much I have changed and he didn't. The only thing we still seemed to have in common is video games.

Some examples of his racist behaviors would be when we drank together at a party (I didn't drink that much). I was the designated driver and during the drive, Kinder was talking about how black women are inferior and ugly while Asian women are submissive. I told him that I was actually currently seeing a girl (who happens to be black) and he said something along the lines of, ""Well black women and Asian men are the most undesirable specimen so you guys can fuck all you want because no one else wants y'all."" I took so much offense to that. I fired back saying that my dating life is awesome and said he's never even had a girlfriend. He then said that PC culture is ruining the image for straight, white conservative men. After a long-ass argument, he apologized. I drove him home and I was so angry, but I was able to control my anger.

After hanging out that night, I honestly thought to myself that Kinder has not changed a bit since high school and I was questioning whether or not I should stay friends with him. However, he was drunk. People say dumb (and sometimes racist) shit when they're drunk.

Later on, Kinder asked me if I wanted to hang out again in downtown Seattle. I accepted the invitation.  When we were together, we were talking about the coronavirus (at the time of this happening, coronavirus was not all over the US yet; it hit Seattle, but the number of cases was really low at the time of this story taking place). He was telling me about how Chinese men are so weird and that they need to stop eating disgusting shit. I told him that every culture is different and he just shrugged it off. That same day, Kinder and I were visiting Capitol Hill and he kept making comments about how much Asian people there were in Seattle. And he kept pointing out to me how there are so many ""skinny-ass"" Asian guys with Asian girls and complained about how Asian girls need to just drop the ball and go for the ""stronger"" white men. I asked Kinder if he realized that I'm Asian too, but then he responded by saying, ""Nah. You don't count. You're one of the good ones."" The funny thing is that Kinder is really short and skinny. He's like 5'4"" and 90 lbs. So he should be the last one talking about ""skinny-ass"" Asian guys.

After our trip to Seattle that day, I drove him home. I again thought to myself if I should even still be friends with this guy. You know how I said that my beliefs changed a lot since high school? Well, Kinder does not know that: he still thinks I'm that same ""based"" Asian Trump supporter I was in high school. Politics never came up ever since we reunited.

Two months have passed now and obviously with the coronavirus spreading rapidly in the US, I haven't had much time to hang out with anybody (especially with WA state in quarantine just like many other states in the country). Kinder shot me a text today telling me to get on PS4. After those two months have passed, I have decided I am not going to hang out with him anymore.

My question to you guys is this: how should I handle this situation? Should I just ghost him? Or be upfront about his racist behavior and tell him how we don't vibe anymore like we did in high school and then delete his contact?",06Apr2020,1

262,"
My LDR gf (23) and I (24) have been on and off for about almost two years but we’re officially about to be 3 months soon. She lives in California and I live in Texas. 

Recently there’s been some tension. It’s mostly been about the lack of communication and reassurance coming from my gf. During one of our recent arguments, she went ghost on me for a few days and I thought that was her way of letting me know that she didn’t want to be together anymore. So I unshared my location with her. We kinda moved past that, and I let it go and tried to give myself another shot at trying to not be so high maintenance. 

Well this past weekend, she randomly unshared her location with me, to which I responded with “?”. Her response was “You stopped sharing yours why should I share mine”. I assumed she said it with attitude, that’s the tone and vibes I got. It seemed so immature and gave me mixed messages, and a little suspicious tbh. It didn’t make sense to me. I got upset of course. From her perspective, I popped off on her because I was having a bad day, but that wasn’t the case at all. i was fine until she unshared her location. I let her know I was crying and she replied that she didn’t even do anything. She said that I make her feel like she never does anything right, and that made me feel like shit because I feel like the main concerns I express about our relationship was the lack of communication/reassurance, which we’ve had conversations about three times before. 

She believes I overreacted but I honestly think that my reaction was normal. It’s not even about me being controlling and knowing her location at all times. I’m not like that at all, I don’t care about that. It’s just the principle of it I guess. Like why? What was the true reason she unshared the location? Because I’m not buying what she told me. 

We haven’t talked since it happened two days ago, which usually happens when we argue. I just want some other perspectives before me and her have a talk about it on our own...",06Apr2020,1

267,"Hello Reddit. It took me a while to have the courage to post this but I am worried about my relationship with my older sister (23/F) if this problem isn't resolved. I'm feeling anxious just typing this and I will probably cry. I will try my best to keep it short, but for a situation like this you need all the details.

 About two months ago, my older sisters bf (23/M) was caught by my little sister (16/F) peeping on her while she was coming out of the shower and drying herself. While drying she looked down and saw an iPhone under the bathroom door with the camera facing up towards her. (there are two doors leading into the bathroom, one from the hall and one from my older sisters room). The door the phone was under was from my older sisters room. My little sister saw the phone and opened the door to see my older sisters bf there with his phone under the door. 

Long story short of what happen after: My little sister called me (I wasn't home) and told me what happened, I rushed home and exposed my older sisters bf to my older sister and father, my older sisters bf confessed to what he did, and now he is banned from our house and to never show his face to us ever again. If he does my father will probably call the police on him and he will be listed as a pedophile.

I have consoled my little sister and have done the best I can for her through this traumatic experience. What I am seeking advise for is what should I say to my older sister? Even after what he has done to our family she has not broken up with him. 

She has been with her bf for over five years (since high school) and isn't letting go because they have ""made plans for the future"" and she doesn't want it to all go to waist and start over/learn to live without being with someone. From what she has told me, this behavior of his stems from sexual abuse he experienced as a child that he did not tell her about until after what he did. He kept it hidden prior and started to go to therapy a month ago for it. He is ""trying to be better"" so it is another reason she wants to stay. I don't know how to make her realize this is no longer a healthy relationship and carrying on is only going to hurt her. 

I am concerned for my sister and what the future will hold if their relationship continues. I afraid my older sister will be stuck and if they have children what will happen to them? 

If you made it to the end, thank you.",06Apr2020,1

269,"So, I've received all of my college decisions. I got accepted into all of the ones I chose, but most of them were safety choices. None of them really offered me financial aid except for Mount St. Mary's, a private Catholic University. I'm at a complete loss at which school to pick because the question at hand is: Do I pick a school based on the money they give me? Or do I pick a school that I'm lukewarm about?  I don't love any of the options I applied for because there are pros and cons to all of the options I chose.

All of the colleges I applied to were ones I were lukewarm about. I've never had a dream college, but all I know is that I want to pursue higher education so badly. I was going to visit these schools to get better information, but I only ended up visiting Mount St. Mary's before the whole coronavirus thing happened. So, I have this issue where all the universities I applied to gave me no money, only loan options i.e. UMBC, UMD, Salisbury, Towson, etc.

I don't know which school to go to because I'm not in love with any of them or demanding I have to go there, but I'm not sure if I like Mount St. Mary's since I'm not a Catholic person. During my visit there, it felt very isolating to be one of the few non Catholics and the educational programs felt very small. Not only that, but I don't think I can handle the fact that it's a school within the mountains with no public transit options to leave or escape, but it's the ONLY school that gave me any money. I would only have to pay 13k out of my pocket if I go to Mount St. Mary's. They are offering me a merit-based scholarship due to my grades, a grant, a loan option, and a federal work study. However, I don't know if I'll be happy there or if my impressions of the school were correct/unfair. My dad is pushing me to go to this school since he thinks I will do best here.

UMBC and UMD ended up giving me no money. I would have to pay 29k out of pocket for UMBC and 20k out of pocket for UMD. Everyone in Maryland raves about these schools, so of course, why wouldn't I look at it like this awesome opportunity despite never visiting them. I also heard that their computer science fields are great, but very competitive which is extremely intimidating for someone as introverted as me. I'm also scared that these schools are too big and that I won't be able to pay off that money and it would burden my parents since they have my younger brother and grandma to look out for. We don't have an income that is considered below the poverty line or low income families, but it still impacts them to have to help me pay 20-29k for an education. My mom is pushing me to go to this school because of its reputation.

I'm scared of committing to one of these schools. I don't know if I should go to Mount St. Mary's or if I should pick UMBC/UMD. If anyone that knows of these schools can attest to them, I would love that. I just am at a complete loss because I don't love any of the options. I'm so indecisive about it all and the financial part of this decision is overwhelming me. I have to commit to a school in about a week or two and submit my deposit before it's too late. I'm so stressed and I just don't want to make such a big decision that will impact me for 4+ years. Did anyone have to experience this? How did you decide your college? Please help, any advice or input would be lovely.",06Apr2020,1
270,"So... Obviously this is just a question of willpower but I don't get how exactly you just start choosing to have more willpower when you don't have any to begin with, and when I ask people I know, the best advice people give is ""just do it"". 

I'm trying to draw on an tablet I bough as well as paint. I really love art and would love to make paintings and comics to show to people. However, I'm just not good because I don't practice. Reason why I don't practice is because I get incredibly frustrated and unreasonably angry whenever I make the tiniest little mistake. Without going into too much detail, I have something wrong with my brain where  (I think this is what it is) fine motor skills, stuff like drawing, painting, anything that requires careful handwork is incredibly hard for me. My hands are very shaky, and while it isn't impossible for me to do stuff like drawing, it's just a lot harder than other people just starting out. So, when something doesn't turn out the way I want, even a little bit, I get angry, get frustrated, and beat myself up.over it more than I reasonably should and just give up.

Same learning the piano or guitar. While that's a bit different than drawing and it isnt as hard for me to learn, I still get overly frustrated and angry over the tiniest mistake. I don't get why I immediately get furious since I KNOW I'm still learning, so no duh I'm gonna make mistakes. That's not unreasonable. But I still just give up and act immature and I'm not really proud of it but it's hard to get over it and work past it.

277,"So today was a terrible day. 

It was Sunday so that meant online mass. I get woken up by my parents and they tell me to get up. I fall back asleep and next I know I’m being told in a disappointing tone of “how dare u continue to sleep when there’s mass” which is still quite a ways away. I eat and then go to the living room. I’m invited into the middle of the couch but it’s next to my Dad. Lately I’ve been extremely annoyed by my dad. He’s always touching me whether it’s unwanted kissing on the forehead as my body language says I don’t want to be kissed or guilting me into a hug. And then if I pull away he puts on the act of “oh I guess u hate me”. 

So I sat on a separate sofa. 

Mass took forever. Even though it took the same amount of time as last Sunday. Then after it was over I got some water and then went back into my room. I was annoyed and wanted to be alone. 

And then my Dad pops up and even though my body language is clearly saying “go away” he doesn’t budge. I would just say “leave me alone” or “I want to be alone” but my dad is so sensitive that he would probably get angry with me if I did. So I finally just close the door. 

Then I fell asleep. I slept for several hours, hating everything and wanting to escape feeling angry. I woke up and eat some pancakes. I expected my parents to be angry at me for sleeping so long so I tried to be quiet. 

Then we had another event and it involved going into town. It was church related and I was debating on telling my parents that I didn’t want to go. However I wanted to avoid conflict so I got showered and dressed and then ultimately decided to go. However when I got there I felt so ashamed that I couldn’t bring myself to go to church so I ended up in the bathroom. I realized my acne was so bad my face looked like a connect the dots, and I knew people would ask me what I was up to for school (I was on a break and every time I told someone this they would give me a disappointed look which I can’t take anymore). So I camped out in the bathroom. Which is pretty pathetic I know. 

Finally it was over and my mom found me in one of the stalls and was actually being nice to me? So she said she would be in the car. I tried to get into the car but there were so many people. Aren’t we supposed to be social distancing? And then what do I find but my parents (both over 60) NOT social distancing but being less than a foot away talking to this guy in the car. So I wait. And wait. And then after like 10 mins I finally go to the car. But of course my Dad has to comment on my presence (which points out my now obvious absence) before saying goodbye to the man who also knows me. 

We drive home and my parents have this belief that I had a stomach ache, and not that I was just fed up with everything. 

I go back into my room and my dad starts a fire outside while my mom plays cards. I had talked about wanting to do a fire but of course my dad does this fire with WET WOOD. Which fucking sends so much smoke in the air that it seeps into my room. So then I have to leave my room. I was so close to just stomping outside and filling up the pit with snow. But I didn’t. 

Finally I decide to head into town to access the internet and stay there vey late. When I come back I am encountered by my mom who sits down and says I need a schedule. But she doesn’t just talk about a “schedule”. No. She then proceeds to question why i was in such a bad mood today, and when I explain that I don’t want to talk because she will just get angry no matter what I say, she says she won’t but then proceeds to rant to me ANGERLY and then on top of that insult me in multiple ways like bring up how “dad and I leave at 7 and you just have no schedule” and when I do bring up something where I explain that I felt insulted with something, she then takes a right and points out another thing that I’ve done wrong. So just shifting to another topic and ignoring what I just said. 

So I just didn’t talk because what’s the point? She just twisted my words and then she gets so heated that they “can’t seem to help me no matter how much they try” and they’re just so blind to their own faults. 

So what should I do? 

I’m so depressed because it’s like I have no motivation to do anything and then my parents take my depression as “you have no schedule!” Vs actually I’m just sad and hate life and you constantly guilt-tripping me isn’t helping. 

I would live more than anything to be far away from them off doing my own thing. But I just get so scarred and I just break down crying because everyone I know can just have an apartment (I’m 23) and live life to the fullest and I’m stuck with my stupid, idiotic parents.",06Apr2020,1

Nope.

289,"When I was a little kid, I would play with toys. I would pretend the 25 cent figures weren't just smiling little pieces of plastic with swords but rather descendants of elemental warriors. I had about 5-10 of these figures to start and I loved the storyline and characters so much that it became a reoccuring story - almost like in Mario how the story doesn't change much bit the adventure does. As I got more and more figures, the universe became more and more complex. The floor was ALWAYS lava and the bed was the land. They all carried around weapons and fought each other in the ever growing story. The characters had clones, siblings, there were mechs from Lego Ninjago being used, etc. It was like a Nintendo/Ninjago type universe...


Fast forward like 10 years and I am not only still doing this but I used more and more figures to make more stories into some massive interconnected Smash Bros type universe. I've come up with new stories based on new toys I got growing up. The stories in different worlds all had characters that were different and unique. They'd grow and change over time. And every single universe connects. It's been to the point where I've started putting characters against each other in a huge Smash Bros esc world. The thing is - I could never make anything that existed beyond this big universe. Like every time I collected a new 50 cent toy from the machines, they'd usually just be a character added into the universe.

Now my problem is that this universe won't leave my head. My heart skips a beat at the thought of selling them. Every time I just dump them in a toybox - hoping to mature and say ""I don't need these, I'm 16"", they always find a way to come back to me. Each and every character holds importance. I'm not exactly sure if this all is normal. On one hand, adults still play DnD, on the other hand, no other 16 year old my age does this. I mean I do this privately so I can't say I know I'm the only one but I feel weird. The realization that I will have to be an adult and abandoned this whole world kind of hurts.

Hi, I’m 21 female in my third year of college. I have a very complicated relationship with my family. I’ve always loved my family because they have a lot of great qualities and no family is perfect. My parents are a lot of fun, and they give me everything I need. To give some background, my dad was raised by a single mother who died unexpectedly in his presence when he was a teenager. As the second oldest, he had to pick her casket out and everything. Then, his aunt was supposed to take him and his siblings in, but she couldn’t afford all of them, so my dad and one other sibling went to live with their dad, who was a terrible father. My dad’s dad had multiple wives and many children. My dad moved into a garage with his brother for a year and then graduated high school. Luckily, he is incredibly smart and was able to overcome his circumstances. He put himself through school, moved far away, got a job and worked day and night to work his way up. He had $50 when he left for college, one pair of shoes, didn’t even have sheets for his bed. His 20s were a struggle and he often ate bar snacks to get by because he couldn’t always afford his meals. But he saved like no one else and now is incredibly successful and we have a very nice life. He pays for my tuition and sent me to private school my whole life. I’ve always been spoiled with physical items and given whatever I needed. My mom also had a difficult life. Her father was bipolar, and she was raised by a single mother. I suspect my grandmother was abusive to my mom as I’ve heard stories that indicate this but I’m not entirely sure. I also wonder whether my mom’s boyfriends (some were alcoholics) mistreated her. Regardless, she had a very difficult childhood. As an only child she was often left alone at home after school at a young age, for example. My grandmother did pay for my mom’s college tuition but my mom was mostly on her own and had jobs from a young age. As an adult, my mom’s father (who actually did hurt her as a child one of the times she was with him and maybe more) tried to get in contact with my mom through my grandmother to apologize for being a bad father. My grandmother did not tell my mom about this and refused to give my grandfather her information. Eventually, he committed suicide, which my mom was never made aware of until after his funeral, when she was researching her ancestry and found his obituary online. Long story short, my parents went through a lot, and they have worked harder than anyone I know to provide for me and my siblings and to give us so much, much more than a lot of people our age have. We can go on nice trips, are members at a country club, etc.- things that are hard to afford by working your way up in the world when you were in such terrible circumstances. In fact, most people in our situation came from good families, had connections, or have old money, so we are a unique situation. Anyways, my parents experienced a lot of trauma throughout their lives, and although they do their best, their relationship is complicated, and I have always felt that they take out their problems on me. When I was a child, my mom made me feel guilty and worried for things children shouldn’t feel worried about. I have blocked out a lot of things but remember instances of my mom grabbing me tightly and squeezing my arms when she was mad at me, slapping me a few times, throwing things, but more often she would scream at the very top of her lungs and curse and call me, “lazy, spoiled, ungrateful, a bitch, an asshole” etc. I know I am not always a perfect child. I can be stubborn, which results in more problems because when my mom does things that I know are not okay, I push back or “talk back” to her, sometimes I even yell back, which is disrespectful and I know that. But it is so hard for me to just take this kind of treatment and not react- no matter how hard I try. And no matter how hard I try, I never get used to it. As I got older, my mom became very controlling. In high school she would take my phone away if I did anything that upset her and would track me but less for my safety and more in a way that I felt like she didn’t trust me, even though I was a really good kid. She was hard on me, and would make comments about my appearance. She told me my hair didn’t look good in a pony tail, that i had a long torso and should only wear high waisted clothes, that although i am thin i have my “fathers slow metabolism” and other negative features, etc. In general, she never said “you’re ugly” but she made me feel self conscious by criticizing me constantly, which i don’t think she realizes and would deny to this day. In general she would get mad very easily, though she was less physical and more verbally hurtful always. At one point, i had a family friend babysitting for me and i told her about my mom’s behavior. She told her mom, who told my mom, and my mom got very mad at me. Later on, i told another adult, who told my mom, and my parents sat my siblings and i down to tell them it wasn’t okay we did that. In general, I’d complain To my dad when my mom would fly off the handle and he’d get mad at her and she’d get mad at me for telling him and threaten me that i was going to cause them to get divorced (she still does this). My parents don’t realize that just because they give us financial support and can be very loving they can also be very toxic. My mom has said me complaining to my dad about her behavior is a root of their problems in their marriage. My dad worked so much and often traveled so when I told him this he would play the good cop. It was immature of me to do that but as a kid I just wanted my mom to stop. Like I said, I’m not perfect. I’m sure at times I could be a little asshole and I know I still can be- everyone has their moments. But her reactions were over the top. She is also very OCD and has many rules around the house. It is very easy to upset my mom. My sister made pancakes the other day and didn’t put the ingredients back in the pantry exactly how they were before and my mom was pissed. I also remember being anxious whenever I had to get a ride to go on a play date because she constantly complained about driving, and for my entire life has always treated me like I am a burden. She always complained about cooking, cleaning, and driving and made me feel guilty for everything. I hated asking her for small things because she acted like it was a huge deal.  My dad used to tell my mom to stop but now he doesn’t want to hear it anymore. He just yells at me and tells me I’m an adult and to work it out with her. So I can’t really count on my dad for his support and in general I don’t feel like he is emotionally there. With the corona virus going around, I’m home. My doctor who prescribes my medication told me not to go home because he knows how bad our relationship can be but I had to. My parents made me and I would have been isolated by myself for 2 months if I didn’t. However, I realize now he was right. At first I felt like my mom was really trying to be supportive and there for me and I don’t discredit that but she still picks on me. Also, my siblings are younger than me and now they gang up on me with my mom and treat me like I’m the bad guy. I often find myself crying, storming away from sinners because my sisters or mom will criticize me and no one will stand up for me. I don’t know why I am always being ganged up on but I truly feel like this is the case and like I am some kind of scapegoat. I think it weirdly helps my sister and mom get along better when they are mean to me because I react and then they treat me like I’m the crazy one for getting upset and slamming my door (which I shouldn’t do but after a long time it gets so infuriating being treated this way that sometimes I will admit I storm away and slam the door). However, I always find myself apologizing. But hardly ever do my mom or dad or siblings apologize to me. Even when I know I’m not really in the wrong, or when I know that we both are at fault, I will be the only one to apologize. I also feel like the only times I “do something wrong” are when my mom says something out of line and I call her out or argue back and it escalates because then I match her behavior which I absolutely hate. I believe my relationship with my parents has caused me years of anxiety and depression which impacts all aspects of my life and even my relationships with my boyfriend and friends. I am so scared I will turn out like my parents, where I am sometimes nice but mostly mean and critical, my children have to tiptoe around me and I justify my behavior with money. I tell my parents that when I am on my own I wont have a relationship with them if they continue to treat me this way but now I am at a point where I desperately want to walk away. My sisters are no longer nice to me. They are mostly mean and act like I am the problem in our family but I know I’m not. It’s really confusing and I don’t know what to do. Being at home for the corona virus is the last thing I could have wanted and I am absolutely miserable. This is impacting my school grades and mental health, and on top of that my internship is cancelled, so I may be stuck at home this summer which would mean I have to continue living with my family. At one point I tried to leave to go back to my housing at my university in the heat of an argument at 9:30 at night because i couldn’t take it and had an early class the next day, and my parents threatened to completely cut me off if i left and said that I would never be allowed back. I don’t know what to do. I’m so miserable and upset. I can’t tell anyone this besides my boyfriend but he doesn’t understand what it’s like. My friends love my family because my parents are so fun and nice when my friends are around. I don’t want anyone to change their perspective about my family or stop living them, and sadly i do care what people think of me and prefer to give off the impression I have a nice family life. People even tell me they envy me because my parents are so cool and fun but at home they aren’t like that. My dad is so stressed out with work he refuses to address the situation and I don’t know what to do. I can’t leave because they will cut me off and I only have one more year of school to get through. I don’t want to lose my relationships with my siblings also, even though they have been horrible to me too and get in my mom’s favor by being mean to me. I’m so defensive around my family, that even if they are being nice I assume the worst. I hate how anxious, on edge and unhappy I am and I don’t know what to do but I’m tired of being told I’m lazy, selfish, and ungrateful when I’ve tried so hard my entire life to make my family proud. If anyone has advice about how to live with my family during this time I’d be incredibly grateful. I don’t know what to do and don’t feel like anyone would understand if I confided in them. I hope I did a good job of explaining this because I have never used Reddit before but I thought this could be a good place to get advice without upsetting my parents or exposing my family problems to other people that we know because it is embarrassing and I know my parents would say that I painted this in a way to make myself look better and make them look evil which I really tried not to do because they care about me and love me but I’m tired of being treated like this. I just feel sad and like something is wrong with me because I will never be good enough for my mom.",06Apr2020,1

Long post, TLDR at bottom

I have absolutely no idea what to do with my life.

I'm 29. I graduated from a Brazilian college and I have a bachelor's degree in Visual Arts (emphasis on Design). They trained me mostly to be an art teacher for kids, but I don't like kids, I don't like teaching and I only got my degree for my parents.

After I was done with that, I got accepted into a very good 3D school in the US where I got my certificate in Animation. It's a world-renowned school and one of the best, and it's supposed to open a lot of doors in the industry just by having it in my resume.

I'm an artist and I can draw, and I love doing it. I love animating and I love anything related to animation. I thought all I wanted to do was produce games and movies and just see people have fun with my work.

Or so I thought.

Thing is, my art school was so strict that it completely killed my passion. Before I had passion and no technique, and now I have technique and no passion. Even though it was both the best and worst 3 years of my life, I was so traumatized by everything that happened there that I can't do art anymore. I get panic attacks if I try to draw, I get super anxious about animating and I can't even stand the thought of merely doodling something on my sketchbook.

To make things very complicated, I was in a toxic relationship until last year. This made me even more anxious and depressed than I already was and I haven't been able to update my portfolio since 2016, when I graduated from animation school.

Despite everything, two years ago I managed to get a job in a gaming company and I was an animator in a really big game. It was a contract position, and I worked there from 2017 to 2018. It was stressful, but fun, and I really enjoyed it. I left on good terms once my contract ended. I thought my school, plus that as work experience, would allow me to have good chances at landing other gigs in the animation industry even though I had my anxiety looming over any of my art related stuff.

Well, I didn't. I've been unemployed for over a year, divorce pending, living in LA with rent I can barely afford with my savings, having to take care of four pets (one dog and 3 rats). Honestly, my babies are the only reason I get up from bed in the morning and they make my life bearable.

Now, I managed to make a deal with my parents and they've been helping me financially for some time while I try and find a job.

I tried looking for all sorts of jobs. Animation, illustration, concept art. I tried more simple jobs like receptionist, post office assistant, transcriptionist, librarian assistant. I applied for whatever I could find that my anxiety would let me, but I still can't apply for jobs with too much people interaction because it's not really a cool thing to have a mental breakdown in the middle of your shift.

I got an ultimatum from my parents and I need to find a job by August, otherwise I'll have to move back in with them in Brazil. There's basically no jobs for someone like me there, and I really REALLY don't want to go back for the sake of my mental health.

I've been taking voiceover classes and I'm doing my best to study and learn whatever I can to maybe do it as a side gig, or even change careers and turn that into a living. I'm definitely not at a point where I can do that just yet though.

To make things even better, now there's the whole virus thing and I'm in the risk group, so I'm terrified of even stepping outside. I also have back issues and I can't lift too much weight, so that puts grocery stores and physical jobs out of my list.

I should also mention that I've been in a long distance relationship with an AMAZING guy from Denmark who is literally the only thing keeping me sane. I do have an EU passport/citizenship and I did consider maybe moving in with him. However, before me he was also in a super toxic relationship and none of us is ready to have a roommate just yet, much more a partner living in the same space.

So here is my question, for anyone who got this far: what, in the name of fuck, can I do right now? What should I do? I literally will take any ideas whatsoever.

TL;DR: I'm an artist who can't draw, an animator who can't animate and a voice actress who is so amateur that I probably would never be able to find gigs on the area at this point in time. I don't know where else to apply for jobs, I'm in the risk group for the virus and I need to find a job by August. My boyfriend is half a world away and I'm slowly losing my barely existent sanity. I gotta pay rent and eat, and I have to take care of my pets. What do?",06Apr2020,1
294,"I live in a house where I rent from an older, very cohesive, hetero couple in their 50's and another couple that are both my age (late 20s) for almost two years. The older couple are great, super generous and welcoming. In the peer couple one of the two is very easy going and the other makes me feel like I'm back in junior high with all these weird passive swipes that aren't really swipes at all because they're so difficult to pin down... It's hard to figure out what's my own internal bs and if she is actually intentionally doing stuff to put me down emotionally. This is getting especially difficult because the couple that's my age is now home all the time (stay in place order) while before they were hardly ever around and all the weird shit that the challenging roommate (lets call her Rhonda) is doing is happening more frequently. 

Ahead -&gt; two paragraphs of me bitching, two paragraphs of reflection bitching and questions:

I would say the beginning of my frustration towards Rhonda really started to build up when I first moved in and she would organize ""house dinners"" over group text and never include me. I would get invited by one of my landlords since I would see him in his office since I worked in the same building some days. He would assume that she forgot to add me... every time. Eventually I overheard her saying to the landlords that she wanted to have a ""house dinner"" and the next night I came home and they were eating a dinner that I am not physically capable of eating. Then, she stopped doing the texts about house dinners for a very long time... But two weeks after that dinner she came crying to me because she had been excluded from a brunch party since her friend in that group that usually invited her moved out of town....

Some of the other things that really rub me the wrong way are income and lifestyle based. She makes significantly more money than me and lives a lavish lifestyle, while her parents pay for her brand new car. However she talks about money to me in a way that I feel like is supposed to make me feel sorry for her for not having any... She also is very entitled to my kitchen shit, even lies to my face about taking my stuff from my drawer. If I do something that benefits her/a favor, more that half the time she doesn't acknowledge it. This includes feeding her cat when she goes away for a weekend and doesn't say anything to anyone in the house.  In group settings she often puts me in ""last place"" - this could be written off as just a seniority/respect thing in some situations. However, she can also be extremely rude and condescending towards me if I ask for a small and fairly insignificant favor. Because of this attitude I find it really hard to just be direct about boundaries and using my stuff. A lot of the kitchen stuff I wouldn't focus on her using, if she was nice towards me. The petty passive aggressive b*ch in me doesn't want her to use my stuff and I feel like if I'm straight up about it, its just going to make the weirdness worse, since I feel like I would look like I'm setting irrational boundaries. 

Without writing a longer laundry list of all the petty bs how can I approach this situation and not feel crazy and not feel like I look crazy? Tonight I got pissed because everyone else in the house used the broth that I made to make a meal and didn't include me. While, Rhonda has been drinking it for her wellness... I made it with the intention of it being used for a meal for the house -the house that I feel should include me. In one part I'm frustrated in my elder and far more mature landlords for not noticing/addressing it. I find myself wanting to say passive shit about ""not making that broth for Rhonda""... I would also like to just say what I need to say to her, but considering stories I have her about her fall outs with her actual friends and the insights she appeared to have about her roles in them, I would almost rather just keep that fake girl layer of ""friendliness..."" But it's driving me crazy and I've already started to do dumb shit like hide my vitamix from her and not replace the filter in my brita filter because I don't want to spend $5 on her since she uses it more than me but doesn't offer to do any up keep... (I don't use any of her kitchen stuff or help myself to her food, but she does eat and use my stuff... When she does own up to it, I have a hard time saying it's not okay, because with most roommates it wouldn't bother me because it's not really about the food.)

I'm almost effing 30. I don't want to be dealing with this stuff and other than Rhonda, my roommates and situation are great. However Rhonda alone makes me want to move out (the housing market isn't too great here). How much of this is my own doing and how can I best approach the situation while keeping it classy and mature? I think about what I would tell someone in my shoes, but I feel like Rhonda thinks she's the type of person who you can be direct with, but isn't and unfortunately I've experienced many female roommates who do not respond best from a direct sit down - this is how I feel and this is what could help convo and I think she is one of them...",06Apr2020,1

299,"A little back story, my brother has always struggled with mental illness, he has a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder and bipolar 2. He had only started seeing a doctor before he uo and left to run off to a hippie gathering where (he has no experience in this lifestyle, basically went in to it blindly. He ends up getting brainwashed by this much older man, around 45, (my brother is barely 23, super sheltered, spends most of his time in front of a computer screen reading conspiracies). That story is for another time however, but he was fed high doses of LSD and DMT.

He came home finally a few weeks ago and he is not the same person anymore. He thinks he can talk to aliens, believes he's psychic,.he thinks we're living in the movie the matix and that he has been.gifted intelligence by a divine being, etc etc. Back to the point. He believes that the virus is fake however, he believe hospitals are all empty, and he believes this is just a big media study so that Trump willl Finally take care of us, or something. But okay, whatever, believe what you want, I don't care, to an extent. 

However, our mom has serious lung problems from smoking cigarettes her entire life, nodules on her lung that she can't even  afford to get looked at more in depth, she basically has an overall  weak immune system. We live in louisiana, and he has the fucking nerve to invite two strangers from Kanas to come and stay with them out of nowhere. They are travelers, there is no  telling if they're sick or carrying anything. I'm furious that my brother put her in that position. I've explained to my mom how unsafe that is, but she doesn't want to deal with my brother's tantrums.

300,"I’ll (21) preface this with saying this is a 2nd account to remain mostly anonymous.  For what it’s worth, my entire life I have dealt with various forms of mental illness.  I’ve witnessed a lot of death and other toxic behaviors my whole life, not to mention a lack of understanding from family.  I have tried various medications and therapies but they have not helped me.  And most importantly, isn’t a sob story though, again, this info is for what it’s worth.  

Recently, I have found myself having panic attacks rather frequently.  My anxiety is out of control to the point where it is crippling me.  I’m not bed-ridden but I am just constantly in my head.  I have noticed my general outlook on things to become more and more bleak and it worries me that I will eventually kill myself to escape my head during a panic attack/breakdown.  It pains me because there are a lot of people who I love and a lot of people who love me.  I am very, very involved in my community and receive good grades at my University.  

I want to check myself into a psychiatric ward.  However, here are my main concerns:

1. I have a very influential role in my community.  I’m in the spotlight often and a lot of people look up to me.  I am first-off afraid that not only will I lose my roles in the community, but also the general respect of people if I decide to do this (ex. “Is he capable of doing that?  I heard he just got out of a psych ward..”). 
2. Even though classes are online, I have come to the understanding that I will not be able to use electronics at all (which I totally understand).  But I want to finish this semester strong but again, I am afraid that I will tank my GPA this semester or even forced to take a temporarily leave from the University.  This is also an area of concern for myself because my grandfather is very generously paying for my tuition.. I don’t want to waste a large amount of money that is not mine. 
3. While I believe that it would be in my best interest to eventually tell my parents about my decision to do so, I want to tell them on my own terms.  They are good people, but they have a tendency to helicopter and make things about themselves.  I want to do this for myself, by myself (I do however plan on telling my two best friends about this beforehand if I do decide to admit myself, while I have never broke down in front of them or to them, they are understanding and are aware that I deal with a lot of these problems).
4. The cost.  Plain and simple.  My family has insurance that may cover this, but again I do want to enter this experience by myself and I am still not certain insurance would cover this.. me nor my direct family has a lot of money.  

Any and all advice is very much appreciated.  Thank you folks.",06Apr2020,1

My lease officially ended at the end of February. My landlord, who lives in China, (her niece handles the leases) reached out to me via email tonight to renew my contract. In the email, she also stated how she has someone eager to take my place if I choose not to extend, a tactic she's done numerous times to have me renew on her terms. In these leases, it's in writing that I cannot sublet my apartment. We're in outstanding times right now and while I have a job, I may not much longer. I also don't plan on living in San Francisco for longer than 3 more months, anyways. Moving for a short term place would be a major pain, heck moving in general is a pain during these times.

302,"Two things you should know about me:

1. I have a vocal chord muscle spasm that affects my breathing sometimes. This is a relatively new condition that not many know about, but my younger brother's gf suffers the same thing bc for the longest time they thought she had asthma when it was just a muscle spasm in her vocal chords. It only flairs up when I've exercised too hard, I'm having a panic attack, I'm really stressed out, or when the air quality isn't that great. When people smoke around me or while walking ahead of me, I need to cough to clear my throat before my vocal chords act up, but at the same time I don't want to sound like I'm ""making a statement"" by coughing really loudly or hard near the smokers. It's incredibly rude, and I come off as a self-righteous jacka\*\* to those around me. But if I don't cough, then I start to wheeze and get short of breath and I end up looking like I'm having a mild asthma attack. I do not have asthma, and I don't need EMS called for me if I just need some clean air.
2. I was in a car accident within the past two months. I won't go into the nitty gritty but I rear ended the truck in front of my and I miraculously came out without a scratch except for a slightly sore neck the next day, and a faint bruise on my shin. The problem here is that while I collected myself after being hit with the airbag, the cabin started to fill with that white, acrid smoke. I wasn't able to immediately unlock my seat belt so I tried to crack the door to vent the smoke out. At first the door didn't budge and that's when I first started to panic bc I didn't realize the door was just caught in a way that I would have to use more force than normal to open it. In other words, it wasn't completely stuck, just needed a hard shoulder to open. As this was my first accident, of course I cried and panicked a little and cried some more, but as far as my vocal chord spasm goes, it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. Once I was out of the white smoke and I regained my composure, I was about as fine as one could be walking away from this accident. Now obviously the vape smoke and car crash smoke smell very differently. But it's not about the smell. It's about how it looks curling over the dashboard and in front of the windshield. It makes my throat close up and really stresses me out. And it's only when we're in the car when it stresses me out, especially if I'm the one driving.

Thank y'all so much for any advice! I really appreciate it, and I hope y'all are staying safe, smart, and healthy!

TL;DR: I have a vocal chord spasm that causes me to appear as though I'm having an asthma attack even though I'm not. I was in a car crash which caused the cab of my car to fill with white smoke and now whenever I'm driving and someone is vaping in the car, it really stresses me out and causes my vocal chords to get tight if I see the smoke moving between the dash and the windshield. Outside of the car, however, the smoke from the vape doesn't bother me.",06Apr2020,1
303,"I'm in the training period of my job, almost on my third month out of a year.

306,"Background info:

I met him 5 years ago. In that time, I’ve only actually known him for about 2-2.5 years. I have always known he was religious. His WHOLE family has been Pentecostal since before he was born. I was raised Catholic, went to CCD, did my communion, blah blah blah (all for the sake of my parents), so I do know some of the contents of the Bible. I knew I was bi since age 4 when I met my best friend and secretly fell in love with him (he transitioned FTM only 3 years ago). I stopped believing in God because I thought it was ridiculous to be told I was wrong for loving other genders. My bf is fully aware that I am bisexual and have had relationships with other genders. I even cross dress, and have gone out with him in gender-non-conforming clothes. Recently, I found out that he thinks my sexuality is a sin, which has been devastating to say the least. I have been crying about it for the past few days. Despite this, he has always treated me well, he practically lives at my house, and we have always been each other’s rock when things get tough. My previous relationships weren’t great (I’ve been in multiple abusive relationships, only 1 of which were physical), so finding someone like him means the world to me. 

How I found out:

My bf decided he wanted to get back in touch with God, saying he was gonna start going back to church every Sunday (he stopped going for a while since his scheduled got a bit hectic). I am totally supportive of that, and I didn’t mind at all. His church is down the street from my house, and I know he’d come to my house afterwards. Then, he informed me that this would require him to be abstinent. We don’t have sex too often because I suffer from depression and my sex drive is almost nonexistent. Which isn’t a big deal for him anyways because not everything is about sex. But from time to time I get in the mood and even then, it doesn’t always go right. He always gets off too fast the first time around. He quickly tries to fix himself so he can come back and pleasure me, but usually by then I’ve lost my drive. I don’t blame him at all, I know he can’t help it. And It’s not like he has never gotten me off. But I do feel left out and sometimes start to cry when I lose my drive. It is very obvious that he feels really guilty about it. His solution was to buy toys so I can feel pleasured and included. It has been great and he even planned to buy me more stuff down the road. 

Not even a month later he hits me with this news, so naturally I felt a little upset. (Not that I didn’t agree with his religion because I honestly want him to do what makes him happy and I will try my best to support him. But in the heat of the moment I was being selfish of my pleasure and my newfound love for it). I got defensive and told him I’ve always thought religious people were hypocritical because they are always picking and choosing what to believe. The Bible preaches about homophobia, sexism and slavery, but not everyone follows everything it says. Following up with a rhetorical, I asked him if he also wants to believe homosexuality is a sin. To which he replied, “it is.” 

I was in so much shock after hearing that. I cried and cried because I just found out that the person I love most in this world doesn’t truly accept me for who I am. He argued that he loves me so much and that he does accept me in every way. How can some one accept you, yet think a key feature of your personality is sinful and wrong? What sense does that make?

He hasn’t been over since last week, and the texting/ calling has been minimal. With quarantine, self-isolation and depression all keeping me in bed, I’ve been alone in my thoughts. I haven’t told any of my friends about this situation and since socially isolating myself has become very easy, I haven’t actually spoken to them about anything. I really want this to work out, but I can’t just convince him to not be homophobic, right? 

I really wanted to get this of my chest, since I haven’t told anyone I know. I don’t know how to go about this and I am extremely scared, so if anyone does read this—any advice would help me dearly.",06Apr2020,1

317,"I have this one friend group on Discord and we’ll sometimes talk and play some games together. I’ve always wanted to become better friends with them since the entire group seems to be close but me, and the quarantine just makes me want to talk to them more.

(By the way, these online friends, not my school friends.)

Normally, I wait for one person to invite me to the call or to play games. That’s how it’s always been. I’m too scared to ask them, “Hey, what are you guys doing?” or, “You wanna play [game]?” I’m that person who never starts a conversation because I’m worried that I’ll just annoy them or think that they don’t want me there. But because of that, I also have to worry about if they think I don’t really care about them or don’t want to play games with them. I do, but I just can’t bring myself to ask them. I’ve thought about starting a conversation, but I get this heavy feeling in my chest like a sense of dread, and that something bad might happen even though I know nothing will. Also, the person who invites me is always the same person, so I tend to think about if the other people even want me there in the first place.

It also doesn’t really help that I go silent during the call a lot. I don’t put myself on mute, I just don’t talk. I find that a lot of the things my friends talk about are drama that I feel like I shouldn’t give my opinion on because I don’t know the whole situation. If it’s not that, it’s about other people that they’re friends with but I’m not, so it’s difficult for me to involve myself in the conversation. When they don’t talk about either of those, I still stay quiet until someone is directly talking to me or asks a question.

I really want to be better friends with them, but the things they talk about just make me feel like I’m left out even though I’m not involving myself with them, so I can’t even blame them.

What can I do to stop worrying so much and how do I become better friends with them? I’ve thought about talking to them about how I feel, but it’s something I’d rather not do because I’m worried that they’ll think I’m silly or something for thinking like this.",06Apr2020,1

No matter what is going on in my life, or how good things are going, or how good I’ve been feeling lately. This feeling always comes back. And i just push everybody away.

Every time I talk to someone I feel guilty for being there and saying anything because I know people just don’t like me. No one likes me. No one can like me because I’m just so bad.

My parents have always been like this, and I just absolutely hate it. We are on the wealthier side, and I go to boarding school in the other side of the country(Mass), but right now I am in Seattle with my parents because of Covid-19 and doing online school stuff.

I used to think that hate being in Seattle because of the weather and some random things, but I realized around last year that I just hated being around my parents. I realized that even though I love them, I have absolutely no respect for them as adults. They are the biggest hypocrites, and it is just exhausting for me mentally to be around them as they get irritated extremely easily. 

They always barge in my room without knocking, and always want me to leave the door open. I’ve always had to comply before because I would often get beat by mom or dad, but after the one time my dad tried to hit me but I grabbed him and pushed him back, and also because I am a hockey player so I am bigger than them, they have backed down a bit on the physical stuff. 

However, they refuse to leave me alone, and constantly threaten to stop paying for my school if I don’t listen to them. I know that they will pay it at the end because they like not having me around, but school and sports is the only thing that keeps me going so I can’t risk it. 

Our house is fairly big and is split into two parts. The parent side with the master bedroom, and one side with my brother(college student) and I with the kitchen and the living room dividing the two. Because of this, we have two wifi routers.

Recently, my dad has decided to cut the wifi because I was playing too much video games. I was just playing some warzone with my buddies, and like what the fuck am I supposed to do when I can’t go outside? 

My dad seriously has some “asian parent” tendencies even though we aren’t asian, and I don’t know how I’m going to do online school with the wifi off. 

TL;DR: 16yr, go to boarding school but currently at home, parents don’t respect me and my privacy, I don’t respect them that much, dad decided to cut my wifi.

Any advice?",06Apr2020,1
320,"(F13) I haven’t been truly happy in 5 months, this passing time I’ve felt overwhelming sad, if not sad I feel nothing, numb. I can watch a movie I like and laugh and things like that but right after it’s back to normal. I don’t want to die, I don’t think I could ever commit suicide, yet there’s always this thought in the back of my head saying that if I can’t take this feeling anymore just end it. This thought comes in my head everyday, like a plan b. I don’t want to think like that. But I feel so unbelievably sad. I can’t make myself happy, no matter how hard I try, I want to be so happy so bad. But I can’t, and I don’t know what to do, other than ending my life. I feel so guilty for feeling like this, just last year I was the most cheerful person in the world. I hate talking about my feelings, I never have, to anyone. I’ve only expressed how I feel on Reddit. I just want to feel better but I don’t how. I have family and I love them but I don’t feel comfortable telling them this.  What do I do? How do I tell some one I don’t really have close friends. I just want this to stop, I’ve tried so hard, I feel like there’s only one way to make it stop. I don’t want to seem dramatic or ungrateful, but telling others is very difficult for me, I’ve tried to fix this by myself but I don’t think it will work. What do I do? How can I get better?",06Apr2020,1
321,"My girlfriend (21F) and I (21M) met at university and have been together for two years. Because of the COVID situation we are long distance right now. A few days ago, I was asking to talk with her because I have some family matters that I wanted to vent about (like we usually do), but she told me she had an exam to take so I eventually let her be. While I was waiting for her to finish her exam I started writing a letter to her for our 2 year anniversary because I wanted to let her know that I love her. After her exam ended , I asked to talk again but she blew me off. I waited a few more hours until I told her that I was done waiting because I just wanted a few minutes to talk with her. I felt completely dismissed and invalidated. I messaged how I felt but she responded after a while with a few low-effort almost not reading remarks like: I’m sorry ;(

I told her that I felt like I wasn’t getting the opportunity to talk about my issues when she always gets the opportunity to talk about hers whenever she calls or talks to me because I drop everything and prioritize her. She responded after some time with a simple “oh sorry I fell asleep”. I called her and broke up with her even though I didn’t really mean it. 

I just genuinely don’t know what to do and I feel like she is losing interest. After a while talking with her we settled and everything was fine until after about two hours when I jokingly told her that we should have each other on our profile pictures (because up until this point I had her on my Instagram profile picture but she didn’t have me on Hers) she was completely against it and said that I was being weird for having her in mine. It hurt a lot that I put her on my profile picture because I’m proud of being with her and our relationship. She completely shut down any possibilty and even said “It’s my personal life.” I don’t know what to do because as much as she disagrees recently (last week or so) she has been very distant . She told me at some point in her argument that she has been reconnecting with friends in her spare time instead of talking with me.

I don’t know what to do. I am so confused, out of energy, and depressed. I try so hard to give her attention but she seems unwilling to reciprocate recently. I am very sensitive recently so I do not know if that irritated her or what. What’s worse is that I messed up my sophomore year grades by prioritizing her, hanging out with her, and helping her out while she studied and now she has good grades and I have terrible ones. She is going to go to mes school and the fact that she is distant right now makes me think that she will eventually end this easily in the future when she moves and everything. I don’t know what to do and I hope that any of you talk some sense into me as to what I am doing wrong or what to do.

Please help, my mental health has taken a drastic downturn recently and I appreciate infinitely any effort .

Thank you reddit",06Apr2020,1
322,"Hey all! This is my first post, and I need some advice. 
I’m a F(20) about to turn 22. I’m a 3rd year in college and I just switched my major from CHEM to KINS, so I’m basically back to square one in school. I still live with my parents and siblings, and we have an awesome relationship; I love them all so so much. I also lost my job due to COVID-19, and still looking. (Btw all this info is important)
Basically, my mom wants me to move out with my sister by the end of summer, and I’m not excited AT ALL, even though she’s helping me. My sister is ecstatic, but I’m actually at my wits end and I avoid the convo every time. I’m stressed out because I don’t even have a job, school is getting extremely demanding, and I’m worried that after paying for rent,utilities, necessities, I won’t have any money to do anything. On top of that, my mom is trying to get me a job with at least 24 hours, on top of being a full time student. Overall, I feel like this is an awful transition. Not only will I be going to school full time, I have to work way more than I have before, and end up with no money or free time for anything. I am comfortable at home and I don’t see any reason why I have to move out right now. I realize I sound spoiled but everyone’s situation is different, and I just really need advice. I thought your 20s were supposed to be a balance between hard work and fun, but by moving out all I’m seeing is all work, no time for any rest or anything..... 
Am I being too pessimistic? Is there a bright side to moving out? How can I overcome this anxiety I have about not having any free time or money? I want to be a full blown adult, but I just don’t think I’m ready to embrace all aspects yet....Any advice is appreciated :)",06Apr2020,1
323,"Hi everyone I dont know if this is the appropriate place to post this but I'm feeling desperate and would appreciate any help/opinions. 

My family and I are currently renting a townhouse in Northern Virginia and our lease ends at the end of May. Its 60 days before our lease ends so I understand my landlord has a right to put the location up for rent but what I'm worried about is potential renters coming through our home for unit showings. 

I emailed our landlady and she said basically if we wear masks well be fine..when that's not true at all. I suggested virtual showings but she ignored my suggestion completely. 

I'm at a loss idk how to convince her to not let strangers into our home and adopt virtual showings only. I think legally she can still show places even though VA has a stay at home order but I'm not sure as the Executive Order [53] doesnt really touch on real estate.

324,"I know this post is going to make me sound at least somewhat shallow but that's okay. I met this girl somewhat recently that's honestly nearly perfect for me in like almost every way, at least so far. She's super physically attractive and everything too. Really meshes with my personality. But I've always had this tiny ""flaw"" with some people that would always make people less attractive to me, ""too much"" gums when they smile. Which is dumb and shallow.

This girl has a really pretty smile overall besides this one damn thing and I'm worried I'm going to let it get to me and make me fuck things up with this super great girl. It's not even massively noticable with her, most people probably wouldn't even notice it, it's just a thing I've always kinda found unattractive in general.

I just looked up ""woman smiling"" and found a picture as an example https://img.over-blog-kiwi.com/1/49/25/24/20190816/ob_2593a5_capture-d-ecran-2019-08-16-a-06-31.png

It's only about as noticable as that (aka not very noticable), but again, it's the type of thing my immature self kind of always said to myself was a dealbreaker and I want to get over myself because I really like this girl. I'm 25, this is childish of me. Do other people find pictures like that above even unattractive at all? Obviously that (random woman) in the picture is still good looking, that small nitpick shouldn't detract much?

Please forgive this rambly dumb and shallow post. I guess I just wanted to sort my thoughts out and I need to get over this and stop thinking about it. Please tell me if you were ever in a similar situation, faced with a shallow ""dealbreaker"" that wasn't one.",06Apr2020,1

334,"I have terrible dreams, and insane bizarre ones that scar me.  Is there any recommendations you all have for stopping them?  I don't want them and they are seemingly unrelated to anything that happened the day prior or is going on in my life... For example:

1) Last night I had a dream that somehow tapeworms could eat flesh, and one chewed into my wrist and up my arm and was trying to get to my heart to eat at the tissue there.  I looked at my wrist and I saw the tail of the worm wiggling around as it dug further up my arm, and I had to grab it and yank and pull it out.  At this point I could physically feel it inside of my arm, all the way up to my shoulder as it slid out.  It hurt pretty bad, and then I woke up and my arm was fine.. but I couldn't help but check my wrist x(

2) The worst dream I had was when my entire family was abducted, each one of them one at a time was laid on a slab in front of a camera, broadcasting live to the whole world via TV, and starting at the feet were sliced into 1/4in slabs one slab at a time.  This was while they were alive and in front of me.. proceeded through every member of my family until it got to me and I was the final one put on the slab and sliced, I could feel the blade cutting through every 1/4 inch up to my chest and then I woke up.  It was at this point that I never wanted to dream again. 

Is there any way to block dreams?  I know some people can control them and I have tried but I always lose control... In fact, in some dreams that I have tried to control (and am aware that I am dreaming) I gain control for a split second or two, before my mind overpowers me and does something in retaliation, as if to make fun of me or shun me for even trying to overpower it.

The one time I said something mean to a girl, my parents told me if I did it again I wouldn't get any new school clothes and would have to go shop at goodwill and give that girl my school clothes budget. I was raised to be EXTREMELY kind and considerate. I'm not meek, but I do not control anyone.

Well, my boyfriend's best friend's wife is the most overbearing person I know. She first off sat down with my boyfriend when we were still just dating (she set us up) and told him I was too emotional, he'd just end up hurting my feelings, etc. She then meddled in every single part of my relationship where she could. She told people I had threesomes with a mutual friend (I didnt).

The obvious answer would be to cut her out of my life. And I have, for the most part. But we live in an EXTREMELY small town and everyone in their early twenties here worships her. The few times I see her she talks down to me SO HARD. It got so bad that on new years eve, I was having a panic attack due to other things, and she kept yelling at me to calm down over and over and over. I told her to leave me alone but she wouldn't hardly let me walk into my own house, she refused to stop telling me to calm down and talking down to me in front of everyone. I literally screamed that she made me want to kill myself, because for years, she did.

She says all the time that she's the ""mom friend"", but shes really just strongly controlling.

I dont know how to handle it. Shes popular, we're going to see each other. Her husband is my boyfriend's best friend. She talks down about me to people in a way where it seems like shes just being nice, but it makes me look terrible. And on new years all I did was confirm to everyone that I'm some emotional, crazy bitch.

I can't handle it anymore. I cant drown it out. Hwe husband came over to get some kayaks today and she was there. I was at the grocery store thank god, but knowing that she touched my dogs and my duck and everything just makes me mad. I dont know how to get past it anymore.

342,"I’m a university student, currently in my second last semester. 

Last semester, before this whole covid-19 thing I’ve noticed I stopped getting bothered by things like deadlines and exams. 

I’d have no motivation. None. 

I started submitting my assignments late, and started studying 2 hours before my exams. Then I got holidays. And I just slept. A lot. I would go to sleep at 8pm then wake up at say 9am. I’d check the time, roll over and go back to sleep. Wake up at 2pm. Check time, roll over, back to sleep. Then I’d get myself out of bed around 6pm and eat something. 

What I’m going to write is going to be disgusting. I know it is, and I don’t know why I’m doing it. 
I can go 2 weeks without taking a shower. This is the part that I’m most ashamed about. I know taking a shower will make me feel good, but I just can’t get myself to make the effort to do it. 

Now, due to covid-19, I only have online classes. I so far have managed to wake up for any lectures after 10am, but even then I don’t shower. I don’t eat. 

I had assumed back then that I didn’t want to eat because I kept sleeping so much but now even while I’m awake I don’t want to eat. I’ve reduced to eating one small meal a day. 

As for my assignments, I submitted my first assignment 2 days late. My 2nd one 3 days late. Now I’m on my 5th assignment and it’s 6 days overdue but I still haven’t submitted. For some reason, not submitting doesn’t bother me. 

Recently, I’ve ran into some issues with my student visa. My uni told me 2 weeks ago to come down when I’m free to fill out the new forms. Today is the last day offices are open. Tomorrow, all offices are shutdown until May. 

However, I still didn’t want to get up and go. If I didn’t have a visa, I could get deported and not finish my degree but I still couldn’t. go.

As a kid I was sexually assaulted by who I think might be my adoptive brother but my mother just shut that down and told me I was being a pussy, when I asked for therapy to deal with symptoms of depression and anxiety in my middle school years she also called me a pussy and shut it down. She also favors my brother who I think might be my abuser since I can't remember much from the trauma. 

This year I've managed to get into therapy and so far I've been told I have severe symptoms of anxiety and depression by my therapist, due to the trauma I endured and other things.

The bother that my mother favors is in juvenile hall for aggravated assault after he threaten the family with a knife for his phone after he got on trouble with us, and my family blames me for this, before my brother was arrested he threaten to kill me once he came back. All my family say he's a changed person after being a month in juvie and my mother and sister want me to go juvie too as pay back for him being there, they've been acting very passive aggressive with me and my mother having a history of abusing her partners and abusing us mentally, said that she didn't care about going to prison for whatever reason while looking at me.

Now cause of my anxiety I'm not doing okay and I don't feel safe at home and I've realized I need to get out of here.

I never wanted to go onto have a college education so now feels like I must go into the trade i want to sustain myself without my family's help.

So now I need to have a path on how to drop out of high school get a GED and obtain a electrician apprenticeship as well as a driver's license. I know this is a lot but I just don't know what to do and I need help, my father will be willing to help me be able to get all of this but I need to know how to do things right please help anything helps.

I am currently living in California.",06Apr2020,1

351,"I’ve been friends with this girl for about 6 years and she’s my best friend. She’s always really nice to me and we know each other pretty well. She’s very good looking and, to be honest, I’ve been attracted to her for about a year.

The problem is that I’m at a really big disadvantage here. First of all, I’m not the only one who hangs out with her. We’re part of a really close group of four friends (her, two of my other best friends, and me) and if for some reason I tried something, I’m pretty sure there would be tension within this group, which I really don’t want because they’re the only close friends I have. Second, I’m (hopefully, after this damn crisis) going to study in another country, which just reduces the possibility of an effective relationship. And third (and I think it’s the most important), she doesn’t like me back. I know that for a fact. She likes another guy and she always comes to me for advice.

Of course she doesn’t know I like her and I’m not planning on doing anything at this point because of the reasons mentioned above, so I want to stop liking her in this romantic sort of way.",06Apr2020,1
352,"Hello. So I am a closeted lesbian who has immensely (and still am) struggling with homosexuality. I was on the phone with my secret gf (who my brother assumes is my friend) and we were playing a game together and he kept roasting this guy and trying to bring him down by calling him gay and trying to make what I call ""femme boy"" roast. It made me extremely uncomfortable and kind of made my day not so good. My gf also agreed but she didn't want to say anything because it's my brother and not hers. I'm definitely planning to talk to him about it so how should i go about it? We don’t have the closest relationship but I'd like to think we are at least ok with each other enough to play games together and talk to each other and watch some shows together. I also want to bring up how he gets aggressive at times when playing games. How should I do this? I want it to not be so harsh because I know he can be sensitive but I also want him to listen and not come off as naggy. 

Edit: a bit more missing enough. So I don’t want to say i got upset because I don’t want to out myself and neither does my gf. He knows I don’t have other friends so what should I do to show that what he said really hurt me (because it did) while also not outing myself or make it too obvious.",06Apr2020,1

The other day my boyfriend told me about a woman he saw on the bus who was good looking, attractive etc. When he fell in love with me he'd always call me beautiful, and all those other compliments you can think of. Maybe I'm just being overly sensitive when he talks about other women on how attractive they are, it lowers my self esteem and idk what should I do about it. I don't look at other men nor do I talk about how attractive or good looking they are in front of my bf. It gives me negative thoughts like I'm probably not good enough for him nor do I deserve him.

There was also this one time I was with my bf, while walking through the park, I saw my male classmate, ran up to him and greeted him then later my bf told me he got jealous and started acting a bit mad. I get jealous over my bf looking at other women and he gets jealous when I run to my male classmate and greet them casually.

I always felt that something was up so I would suggest therapy but as it turns out, she isn't open to the thought of sharing that stuff with a stranger

367,"Hey everyone 4 months ago I met a girl in Australia she was from Vienna and we hooked up I am a 22M she is 35F. We spent a week in Australia and I basically took her all around the coast of Queensland camping and showing her around. After the week had ended she went back to Austria and invited me to come to Vienna saying that if I came she would pay for the things we would do. 

A couple months later I flew over to Austria and things didn’t really seem so great she had changed heaps and was a completely different person. I told her that I didn’t want to spend anymore time with her and she had told me that she already booked us to go on a trip and that she had paid and I had to go. I didn’t have the guts to tell her no and ended up going we spent 2 weeks more on a trip and on this trip I paid for all of the food, alcohol and everything as a thank you. 

At the end of the trip she got really drunk and started an argument with me and started hitting and screaming at me because I told her I was leaving and didn’t want anything else to do with her. I left and we didn’t speak again until she acquired my mums email through her work somehow and now she says that she is going to sue me for personal debt and said if I don’t pay her she will send videos of me doing drugs and other things.

370,"Hello guys.

A little background info. I'm 23 and my best friend is 22. She lives in Belgium and i'm from Germany. I've been suicidal for the most part of my life and a lot of shit has happened to me. 

Now to reason I'm asking if I might be an asshole. We had some very minor misunderstandings and a small fight which we (and mutual friends/my husband) resolved. At least I thought so. Now she keeps saying she hurts us and she deserves to die etc. Every small disagreement resulted in her shutting us out and threatening suicide or self harm. (This is a situation going for months now.) I know that she has tried to kill herself in the past. I/we told her over and over how much he like her, that she never hurt us, that we are not angry etc etc. That she's worth of being loved and warmth. That she is not the vile monster she sees in the mirror. Sadly our words couldn't reach her and her threats became more sincere. We told her over and over to seek professional help.

So I told her parents about all of this. I messaged her dad and we talked a lot. I showed him a lot of tweets and conversations. He agreed with me and got her a therapist. I'm very glad she has help now. She doesn't trust me anymore though because I told her parents. She says I was supposed to keep this private (even though she shares it on twitter with everyone else). I lost her as my best friend and I wish I had her back.

Should I have kept this to myself? Am I the asshole for telling her parents that she is suicidal?",06Apr2020,1

372,"I’m absolutely horrible at reading people when it comes to the difference between flirting &amp; friendliness. Before this distance learning happened, I never really noticed him doing flirtatious acts around me. The only thing that pops in my head is he chuckled one time when I told him i didnt know the answer to something. Also, I once emailed him asking what was appropriate for me to refer him as (since he’s not a professor, if i should call him by his name or Mr.___). He responded with a joke saying to call him the best teacher in the world (lol)

Since this distance learning happened, I would crack a few jokes in our class group chat before class would start, and he would respond with another joke. But nothing obviously flirtatious, considering it was a group chat and everyone could see it anyway. 

Here’s the part that confuses me. One of my classmates asked in the groupchat if any of the classmates could add him on facebook to keep in contact about assignments (class of 9 people), and I told him he could add me. Then my instructor said to everyone, “i prefer u use my school email as a means of communication”. He thought my classmate was asking if he could add the instructor on facebook. So he’s basically saying dont add me on facebook. 

But literally the next day, I see my instructor added me on facebook and isn’t friends with any of my classmates (we do have a few mutual friends cus he’s only two years older than me). I panicked and I accepted the friend request and i feel too awkward to delete him. Quite honestly, I don’t mind adding him anyway cus i dont see the harm in it. He’s just a TA and he’s cool.

MY QUESTION is why do u guys think he added me on facebook? My friend thinks that he probably finds me attractive. I dont really talk to my professor or anything and I don’t necessarily ‘stand out’ in terms of my academic performance.",06Apr2020,1

I asked her to show me any written evidence, any studies, any interviews with qualified doctors (she claims that not even doctors want to get vaccinated), just anything to show that she might be right. Her answer? Big Pharma controls the internet, OF COURSE you won't find any studies backing up her claims online for that reason.
I tried telling her that what she is saying is bs, but I haven't tried much yet because I really want to hear y'alls advice.

Why do I say that he is rude? Cause he makes everyone in the house want to die. He treats everyone except his friends rudely. 

When I told him to lower his voice because his shouting was bothering our sleep, he said:""Do I look like I care?"" with a face that I want to punch real bad.

Whenever he tells me something that I don't know, he asks if I am stupid. Just today, I needed my air conditioner cleaned, so I asked him how. He called me a dumb fuck. In this house that nobody had publicly swore. I was surprised that he dared to curse at me. 

You might say that our father's death impacted him a whole lot, but I would say maybe it did. But years before our father's death he was already a rude person. He always argues with the family. Whenever an argument broke out, my father tried to stop it but it was no use. My brother wouldn't listen to anybody else.

I don't hate him. But trust me when I say that he is the black sheep of our family. Whenever we go to an aunt's place to eat, he is rude towards everyone. He treats his friends better than he treats us. 

I do not understand him. My brother keeps saying that if I went to his school, I would get beaten up because I don't know anything. If not for my meditating lessons, I would have immediately said that if he went to anywhere he would get beaten up with that attitude.

381,"I've suffered in the recent years (3~ years) a loss of interest for things I used to be interested in such as art, riding my bike, talking to friends on games, and even playing games. All I want to do is browse my phone and lay down. I've also been too mentally unprepared to respond to text messages I receive so I take a long time to respond to people now and on games people will ask to play and I don't even have the desire or motivation to play anymore. 

I also don't have the motivation to brush my teeth and hair or shower or really any basic self care and this has always been an issue for me growing up. Its really hard for me to stick to anything for a long period of time as well. 


Growing up I was abused and then my parents divorced and I went to live with my dad around 13. I had an adult tell me later on she susoected I was depressed but its hard for me to believe since I didn't have the main stream depression symptoms. Since then I have had such a better life but I still have no motivation for anything.


Some days I can do everything such as shower, do my laundry, or even clean and some days I can play games with my boyfriend and some days I can party with my friends on ps4 and when I do I have a blast but as soon as the period of time is over then I'm back to 0 motivation. I also have trouble doing my school work consistently and I've noticed I've been taking longer to do chores. I suspect I may have ADHD. 

For example, I went 2 days of playing with friends and having so much fun but then then today I had no motivation to talk to ANYONE but my family and boyfriend and even then all I did was lay down and did nothing, not even browsed my phone. 

And now I'm having a hard time dealing with the isolation because I'm extroverted and I can't go ANYWHERE so I can't talk or hang out with my irl friends unless its through text and lets be real texting isn't as fun or fulfilling like hanging out is. 


I don't think I have depression because I don't feel hopeless or anything. Some days I'll wake up and think ""What's the point of waking, there is nothing exciting about today."" Ever since isolation started but a lot of what I mentioned earlier such as losing interest in things I previously adored and taking a long time to respond to people and hang out has been going on for maybe 1 or 2 years?

Sister's boyfriend, who lives with her, will be going back to work very soon (employer has been given the okay to be open). He'll be around people all day, and my sister has expressed worry because she doesn't want to be exposed to anything (she has asthma).

My sister wants us to drive back to our hometown and stay with our dad for the time being. We could make sure our dad is doing okay, and it would help out a little financially.There is the added benefit that rather than being stuck in our tiny city apartments, we'd be in a house with a big yard.

If I did order this stuff would I be putting myself/ my family/ anyone else at significant risk? If I am I won't order anything. I'm in the North East of England if that helps?,06Apr2020,1

393,"This Will Be A long Story

My mother was born along with two sisters, she is the youngest. From the beginning on she was always the most helpful and she was writing good grades etc..

My Grandmother is one of the most loving people i knew, my grandfather is 86 years old now and in his time with our family he worked so much that he barely saw his children, but he always had a particular love for my one aunt, lets call her K. K always got the most expensive clothes, shoes etc from my grandfather and was never punished for her Mistakes. She was always jealous of my mother though because K was never good in school and such things so there was always a rivalry going on.

Fast forward a few years, my mother studies and starts working but K didnt study and just kept on having lots of boyfriends and always lived on support of my grandmother. 

Then a few years later, my mother starts working at a market research Company where she meets my father, lets call him H. H finds out that our family is quite wealthy and we know lots of people so he starts pretending that he has lots of friends, beautiful houses etc. My m. was very gullible and believed him because H invented his storied quite well. Fast forward a few months, my mother is pregnant with me from H. During the pregnancy, K suddenly becomes a different person. K was born infertile so she was extremely jealous of M. When i was born, my mother starts realising what a psychopath H is. 

Shortly before i was born, my parents search for an apartment and find one but H refuses to pay a single cent. My mother had to support it all from her own savings. This all begins to escalate all the while K becomes more jealous. A few months later, when my M was driving to shop with H, she looks at Hs phone and finds out that he made nude pictures of her while she was sleeping \*without permission\* and distributed them on the internet. She also notices that H always had a parallel relation with another woman who was drug addiicted and highly suicidal. It turns out H is also drug addicted and a heavy alcoholic. After all this, my mom had enough and started a divorce when I was about a year old. The divorce goes on and while that happens H continues to abuse my mother and stole valuable things from her. WHILE all this is happening K still continues to see me at least three times a week and starts writing threat emails and messages to my M. She blackmails her and says that if she cant see me at least a few hours every day she will write letters to the court while the custody process is going on. The custody process goes on and horrible things happen. H lies to the court and says that my M regulalry abused ME and also says that she is emotionally unstable. Just for your information H is a diagnosed perverted narcisst. K has a psychological episode and sends a letter to the court at the most critical moment short before the court process decided what to do. In her letter she details horrible lies about my M and obviously the court thought that the letter is credible becuase my Ms sister sent it to them. From there it all spirals downwards. The court decides to give H full custody of me and my mother would only have the right to visit me all 3 weeks. My m is obviously shocked at this and contests the courts decision. She notices that she doesnt have a chance so to save me from having to go to H she flees to a foreign country with me. We live there happily for four years and then my mother says we should return because i was old enough to talk to the court and tell them  where i want to live. We return to Switzerland and the court case continues. But while this happens, H starts a case and accuses my M of kidnapping me to a foreign country. In the latter case the court has already made a decision which would be 3 years of prison time for my mother and a fine of 200000 swiss francs. Obviously my mom is contesting this devastating decision. My aunt also influenced this case.   Both cases are still ongoing and my mother is starting to lose faith.

At like 2am my guy friend texted me and asked me if I wanted to hangout. I told him I was at my mom's house. I told him he could come over to my mom's if he wanted. When he got here we just sat on the couch and talked. After a little while I got on top of him and we started kissing and making-out. My mom came out of her room to go to the bathroom or something.

396,"I've recently come across a book review. It was one of those reviews where the book that is being talked about is complete trash. Think of a youtuber talking about a so-bad-it's-good type of movie. Anyway, the guy in this video talks about a segment in the book where it's so boring and unengaging that he has to take a break every paragraph and watch a youtube video to get himself engaged again. And as he was describing this, I realized that I was going through the same thing, only all the time. With everything. Reading a really good book? I've got tears of boredom in my eyes and my mind has completely flown elsewhere. Practicing guitar? I go from whatever exercise I was doing to just noodling around without even noticing. Studying French? I'm sorry but you don't get to just sit there, your mind has to think of [flying whales!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eg_OyqkITSE)

397,"Hello everyone. This is my first time on Reddit since I clearly don’t know how to talk about this subject with anyone around me. So why not unravel it to the internet? All jokes aside, I’m actually really freaking sad and I don’t know how to handle this. 

Here is some context: a year ago yesterday (5th) marked the one year anniversary of an ex’s death. 

He wasn’t just any old ex that broke my heart in the past (even though he did). He was my first boyfriend. The one that I shared my first kiss by the rose bushes in front of our high school, the one who waited for me after class to hold hands with and wrote notes in a purple spiral everyday in. He kinda had a phone but had to share it with his mom for whatever reason. 

I was 16 turning 17 when this was all happening. To say the least, I was a late bloomer with any type of dating bc my parents didn’t allow it. They had a rule that I needed to wait blah, blah, blah and I listened up until this point. Which meant I had to be extra careful on who I was talking/texting to (like changing his name to a girl’s name) and just in general, not mentioning anything to my parents. I trusted my sister and close friends only.

He was the whole package. Smoking hot, super kind, sarcastic af, had great taste in music and that was a perfect enough reason for me to date him. 
**To clarify, there were other times that I’d get asked out, which I’d said no to and up into this point of my life I was going through my “rebellious” phase**
To continue, I was just so hooked on this guy that I changed some of my ways for him. I lost around 20 pounds during the time we were together. Honestly, pure infatuation at its finest. Which also meant the moment I saw him, my friends knew I’d ditch them. So yeah I was that person, too. 

We shared personal things and specific songs that reminded us of each other. All kinds of emo shit and I loved every second of it. I only had time with him at school and I didn’t mind that much. On the other hand, he did. Which made us breakup in the end. They’re these lyrics that I cried/sang to after we broke up it goes like “4 weeks felt like years, since your full attention was all mine. The night was young and so were we. Talked about life, god, death and your family didn't want any promises. Just my undivided honesty.”  That was the epitome of us. We lasted ironically a month and that killed me. I thought he was the “one”. He broke up with me right before our classes started that morning and my little brain and heart couldn’t handle that. To make it worse, it was my parents wedding anniversary and they wanted to go out to dinner and resulted me ruining it bc of my attitude lol. They still don’t know about it and literally 2 days later he was with someone else. 🙄

Fast forward 4 years, we reconnected with no hard feelings. I’m already living out of the house and doing my own thing, so is he. We were not looking for anything, just starting out as friends. During this time, he gifted me my first nice glass piece that I’ll never forget. It hit so smooth and the bowl was deep. I gave it away and I hate myself for it now. We had our fun moments reconnecting and then that slowly stopped. Our personal lives got in the way but we were friends and that was good enough for me. 

Until one afternoon I read a post about his passing. I was beyond confused not thinking it was him. It was *insert nickname I forgot about*. Then I searched everywhere and sure enough it was him. 
I was at my job when I read the news and I had to get out before anyone saw me. In the building I was in, there’s a stairwell where I hid, bawling my eyes out for god knows how long. That heaviness in my chest is how I felt. And that I still feel as I’m typing this..
It’s even harder bc I’m married and I love my husband to death it’s just that I feel like I can’t go to him and express it. I told him when it happened last year and he wasn’t all that supportive. 
I feel beyond guilty and I don’t know why I’ve been thinking a lot on it as the days led up to it and even after..

TL;DR: my first love passed away a year ago and I still don’t know how to cope with my emotions being married to someone that’s not as supportive as I’d like.

401,"After I got accepted into a prestigious university, I spent four years struggling in a program I didn't like (BS Applied Physics) and finally shifted to my dream course (BS Architecture). The problem is that I had to move back to my hometown to take it, as it was the only uni that would accept me despite my poor performance in my previous degree program.
I also seemed to have developed depression and anxiety through the four years away from home, and am now still struggling with them. I find that perhaps because of the new school or the new program I'm in, academics aren't far less difficult. I do, however, have a problem adjusting to how the people are. They're just /different/. I've had trouble making friends and spend most of my time in school alone, not that I have a problem with that.
The main reason I started to entertain the thought of dropping out, is that my mental health has been on a downhill ever since I moved back. I do have a psychiatrist, and am taking medications, but I still tend to have panic attacks in the middle of a studio class, and sometimes I miss requirements and even exams because of this.
I've never been truly suicidal before, until recently. It's when I realized that it's been bad for my mental health.
My situation has been straining my relationship with my family, as they've already invested so much on my college education with only negative outcomes.
I'm not sure if I can do it without a degree, but here I am considering dropping out.
I need help, and if you could suggest things I can do if I do drop out. My parents suggested culinary school, and I'm very interested in baking. I just have no idea how to start again if ever I do give up on uni. Any response or input would be appreciated.",06Apr2020,1
402,"I’m a biochemist by trade but with sufficient knowledge in various other areas in science (just knowledge gathered over the years) so I’m pretty well informed in regards to most scientific matters.

So it’s really annoying having a family who believe and pass on misinformation that makes zero scientific sense. They see conspiracies on facebook and believe them as if it’s gods word and then imply that I’M the sheep who’s blindly following what everyone says. This morning they saw this video about 5G towers causing corona virus and i just don’t understand how people can just believe this rubbish without knowing anything about radiation, ionising and non ionising radiation, the difference between electricity and radiation, the functions of a virus, the fact that there’s various sorts of radiation, or even what a fucking 5G tower even does. 

I am far from being a sheep. I do research and base my facts on the work and articles of ordinary people, like myself, who dedicate their lives to research and spend time experimenting and collating data on various scientific questions. I hate the news and I don’t believe the information that is handed to me unless its backed by reliable sources.

It’s not that I’m completely oblivious to the things that happen in this world. I know there are external agendas and things bigger than us out there that’s going on, but I just don’t understand how people can formulate decisions and beliefs without basing them on hard proof? 

How can these people (like my family) take panadol and nurofen and use all their ipads and iphones and laptops which was ALL DEVELOPED THROUGH THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD one way or another, but then pick and choose or disregard the success of vaccines and the way a 5G tower works which was ALSO developed through the scientific method because it suits some stupid mindset they have?

404,"The root of what we fight about is how my mom wants to start a YouTube channel to make extra income. She started it already and wants it to be a family channel and wants us to help support it which during our talk we agreed we will but my siblings just do not want to be on camera being put out into public. After she would say well tell me what you want to do with your life because while we aren't sure we should at least do Youtube while we search for it. She will support whatever we want to do yes. 

I personally don't mind being put out into public and YouTube but my siblings don't want to and offered to help edit the videos and give their opinions when needed instead. However, my mom would say we can't just do one task and how the channel is a family business so we should all be shown. Also questioning why are we making it such a big deal. She gives points saying yeah it's embarrassing and uncomfortable but it's another way to train us to get better at speaking and become more confident. (My siblings and I have always been shy but I love performing so I'm slowly growing out of that) Also it's a free way to start a business and just a little task to do, it's not costing you an arm or leg.

My perspective is that I don't mind being on camera but I understand that some people do not want to be like my siblings. But I also see where my mom's coming from in some of her points.

My sister says she thinks we all just have different perspectives and our mom refuses to stray away from what she believes as right.

I am newly single at age 29, European national, live in Europe. I've worked in product management for around 5 years, moved to being a junior recruiter a year ago and to be honest, I am not super satisfied nor excited at the prospect of staying in the field. With the breakdown of my relationship and practically non-existing family in my country, I am thinking of completely changing the air by moving out.

My questions would be:

1. **Is age 29 too late to start a new career by doing a traineeship or get back to university**? I feel like my degree (general communication) is completely useless to me. I took it because I had extremely strict parents I was afraid of and then thought I better go along with it cause studies were done.
2. **Is age 29 too late to plan a move to another country**? The only family I have in my country are my parents (relationship is fairly bad as they are very narcisstic and have been abusive) but I feel like if I move to another country it might take ages for me to move and then I'll have to restart all relationships and being an introvert it's not that easy.
3. **I'm starting to feel some pretty damn intense pressure from being 29 without family or relationship.** Is it really too late? If I move from this country now, I feel like chances of meeting someone new ""in time"" to start a family are zero.

I would be grateful for kind words, opinions or similar experiences where you had to take some major decisions like these in order to be happier :)

""That's the best I can do. It's not perfect, but it's the best I can do."" And my mom proceeded to freak out at me, and got angry when I cried and kept insisting I was spending more time crying than cleaning. She doesnt think she did much wrong.

409,"**TL;DR It would be healthier for me and my husband if I tell my elderly father I no longer believe in this cult. But I'm worried that if I do he will cut me off, leaving him with no-one to look after him, and he could potentially even become suicidal.**

Thank you for any advice or perspective you may have to offer. 

I was born and raised in a high-control group/cult that engages in organised shunning of members  who openly state they no longer believe it's The Truth. It took me an embarrassingly long while, but I recently figured out it's a cult. My husband is still a believer, as is my father. My husband is the only person who knows I no longer believe.

The choice I have to make is whether to tell people openly that I no longer believe, or just stay quiet and try to fade away from the group. There are three people's needs I'm trying to balance here:

**My own.** I am tired of pretending and lying to people. I would be heartbroken to lose my friends and my father, but it's a price I'm willing to pay to live honestly and have mental freedom. 

**My husband's.** He is taking immense strain feeling like he has to ""cover"" for me. (There are other very stressful things happening in his life right now and this situation is making them even worse.) He is also devastated by my loss of faith and he needs to be able to get the support he needs by talking to his friends and family, which he can't do now.

**My father's.** I have two concerns about what may happen if I'm honest with him. He will likely feel compelled to shun me, which means he will have no-one to help him as he gets older. He's already elderly and has various health conditions. Secondly, his mental health is fragile. He suffers from depression and has suicidal thoughts. I worry that this could push him over the edge. 

I do not feel like my father would be the bad guy for shunning me and therefore has to take what comes to him. He'd be acting on a genuine belief that if he didn't do it, he would be killed at Armageddon, and that by shunning me it might convince me to come back and therefore save my life.

He would either come with me or stay with my mother. As I plan to move around a bit I think the latter would be optimal. I’m at a stage where I’m not sure if I wish to remain in the industry I’m in and I really have no schooling or degrees to go back on to go into another field due to dropping out of high school very early and working from a young age, I definitely wouldn’t wish to remain here knowing I could earn more money, but be doomed to be in an industry I think I no longer enjoy. I certainly would not be able to make nearly the amount of money I do in any other industry given these reasons. After the coronavirus settles is when I would look to move. I had a friend do it with his girlfriend for about 18 months and really enjoyed it. I guess my reasons for moving would be that I really have nothing here anymore that I would like to do or that excites me. The thought of starting a new life regardless of monetary position does however. Ever since I sold my business in December (thank god it was before the virus hit) I have been drinking a fair bit and using a cocaine to try to find some enjoyment and excitement  in mundane life. Now I certainly don’t feel depressed in any way. Just bored, so so bored with every day life.  I am not looking for someone to tell me to find a hobby or see a therapist. I’m merely looking for other like minded people who have experienced a similar stage in life and have had the means to simply drop everything and move away. Whether or not they or others think the experience was/is a good idea. But most of all whether or not it will reinvigorate my life. I don’t really care what job or money I earn in Canada as I will have money from the sale of my business there to keep me living comfortably.

I (24 M) feel like i am going through one of the hardest times in my life right now. And i only sort of understand why but on the other hand i also feel so lost.

Quarantine is fucking me up and could not come at the worst possible time.  I do not have much family, and those that i do have they do not treat me right and i carefully distance myself from them emotionally to not be dragged into their toxic realm. I seek support from my passions, my friends, therapist, but above all my daily rituals in an effort to be happy and achieve my goals. Recently I feel as though all of that has been taken away from me and i am at the mercy of the universe, not yet understanding why, or how i am supposed to get past whatever it is i am feeling right now.

Without writing a novel here is what i have faced this year so far,

\- I left my best friend who i have spoken daily with for the last 6 years because I felt the relationship was becoming abusive, and even though i love her platonically i realized she was not meant to be in my story anymore. She didn't respect my trust, made me feel worthless about my problems and mental illness ( anxiety/depression), but above all, it became something that brought me more pain than happiness and i realized i deserve better. I am happy to be without her.  


\-My ex tried to reconnect with me as a friend, but she is in a serious relationship and for the brief two months we tried to reconnect as friends i felt as though her intentions weren't pure. That she was using me for emotional support her new boyfriend could not give to her, would mention our sexual past and how ' he doesn't need to find out', and lastly i felt as though she was trying to prove to herself that she was over me since i broke up with her as i did not see her romantically the way she saw me, like i was some sort of challenge to conquer. While i left and blocked her not even a month ago, i feel used, manipulated, and just gross when i think about how she convinced me she wanted to be my friend and came back for no other reason that that she cared about me, which i no longer believe was 100% true.   


\- While browsing my exes followers on twitter the night she reached out to me (Early february) I found  a girl from high school i had often tried to find on social media ever since i graduated in 2013 to no success. When i saw her profile my heart began racing and i have not been able to think about anyone else since, i don't know what it is about this girl, but i've thought about her fondly every now and then ever since my senior year in 2013. We shared feelings for each other but i was a senior and she was a freshman with a bf and upon graduation i decided it was best to let her go and let her face her high school years on her own so she could grow as a person and have a normal high school experience. I always regret not staying in her life in some way. Well after not being able to find her on any platform after all this time it felt like she appeared to me, after all i began to give up on searching for her, thinking she must have either gotten married, moved abroad, or just not meant to be found by me anymore. Well i sent her a follow and liked one of her tweets including one saying 'trust the timing of your life' and a selfie she had posted recently.   


Things did not go as i had hoped, after all this time upon seeing her twitter i developed such strong feelings for this girl the second i saw her profile, who she became as an adult. While she eventually followed me back after a few weeks and responded to my message, she took days to reply, did not ask much about me other than where i went to school ( our universities are in the same city ) but would take days to reply only to send 1 or 2 messages, and i just did not get a good feeling that she was nearly as interested in talking to me as i was for her. In hindsight i could have played it off a bit cooler and not respond to her messages immediately or not double message her if she went 3-4 days leaving me on read.  But i was kind, complimented her and where she was in life now ( she is pursuing a career of being a teacher as i did), and i know if things were reversed and she was as forward and seemed as into me i would not mind or feel put off by her messages but alas, after not responding and leaving our conversation for a couple weeks, i sent her one last ""Hey, (her name)"", and ive been left on read since two saturdays ago. tonight i decided to mute her on twitter so i will not see her stuff in my feed and i will not reach out to her anymore and just let it be. She was kind when we were talking but did not seem too interested, liked a couple of my retweets, but none of my tweets or selfies i posted despite me liking a good amount of her stuff. I'm just a straightforward person i guess when i like someone. 

This 'event' in my year is so serious because for the past 6 years i have not given much thought to women or relationships in general as a path to happiness. I was in a rough breakup where i felt heartbroken in 2015 and since then i've taken such great steps for myself and towards being someone who i can love and feel happy for myself. I began working out daily again and have the body i've always wanted, I take care of myself and my mental health, began therapy, self care, got into university, started my own business, reached financial independence, and moved out of an toxic home environment, i began to love myself and life rewarded me with self-love, living the life i chose for myself, and feeling happy on my own pursuing my goals and always focusing on bettering myself and my situations. I have had an average amount of serious relationships in life and learned a lot about myself, what i want out of a partner. But when i saw her profile, damn. Its like i was immediately consumed with the idea of reconnecting with her and us being happy together, ive yet to be with anyone who made me feel the night i did when i saw her profile. Im a hopeless romantic, I believe in true love, and that when you meet the right person youll just know, and i understand so little of why this girl i in hindsight know nothing about has had such an effect on me and why after 'shooting my shot' it has been so hard to get over not having her in my life again, while i have dealt with rejection normally this just feels so different and hurts so much. Before i felt so contempt in my own company, could make myself happy on my own, and didnt feel the need to chase after or search for a partner. But ever since i saw her profile its like a fire in me ignited and i cant extinguish it. Since that rejection all i can think about is how badly i long to be in a relationship and feel happy with someone. Why does this girl who i am pretty much a stranger with after all these year have the ability to tear me down and make me feel so vulnerable like this? Is the universe trying to tell me its time i tried to be happy with someone again? Am i just in pain and confused? I never saw a relationship as something I needed in my life but when i think about her my outlook is just so different. Could she just be a fantasy i never let go of and now that its looking like it'll never be anything more than that i am having a hard time letting go? Since being silently rejected by her i went on a spree of reaching out and approaching other women and trying to connect with someone, something i never put so much effort into before. While i have had some success, i know it wont make me feel better and that im searching for the wrong solution to my pain i feel.   


All these things have been so hard to go through and now with being forced to quaratine I have none of the support id normally go to. I dont have my bestfriend who i would normally talk all of this with, although i dont desire to reach out to her again or let her in anymore, i do feel more alone with her being gone.  I can no longer go to the gym which was my happy place or workout the same i would do everynight to help with my anxiety. I cant drive to the beach and read and listen to the ocean waves that would always calm my thoughts, I cant go to my yoga class i always looked forward too. I cant see my therapist because she took time off after this pandemic and wont be back for another month. I cant go to school because campus is closed and we moved online so i cant see any of my school friends and it has been so hard to engage in my studies and use school as a distraction when its like this and i am upset about this girl. And while i am fortunate that my job as a private tutor has just moved to being online as well I can no longer interact or be in the presence of my students that always make me so happy and cheer me up seeing there faces in person. I feel like all of these things had to happen for me to keep growing and move on as a person as i let go of;

A bestfriend who stopped valuing me and became abusive

An ex who i deeply care about but was not meant to be in my life anymore

A girl who i always sought to reconnect with and the memories we had always made me feel special in a way few people have.  


I know i can overcome this and go back to loving myself and being happy just doing my own thing but right now i feel like i have no outlets or anyone/anything to turn too. I am so sad, depressed, anxious, and above all scared. It feels like this pain i am in will never end, even though its always felt this way and ive made it out alright.  


The queens speech today made my very emotional and made me feel a bit of hope but not enough to be positive and get my life/thoughts back on track. I have few people in my life that i can look up too as i've always had to fend for myself and do things on my own.   


I guess i'm hoping to perhaps hear some words of encouragement, some perspective, some clarity, or just that someone cared enough to hear my situation. If you've made it all this way, I thank you from the bottom of my heart &lt;3",06Apr2020,1
416,"Hey guys. 
So to preface this, I have OCD, this causes me to overthink and feel a lot of guilt and doubt. 
So with the whole covid19 situation I am now doing all my classes online. I have an exam tomorrow and someone who I guess I’d call a friend, told me he was going to try and cheat. I absolutely hate cheating but if I’m honest I have in the past and didn’t realize it until this past year or so. A huge and I mean huge majority of the people I have experienced during my time at this university cheat. Again it makes me angry but there’s not much I can do. When the person told me about the cheating I got angry and told him why I thought that it was wrong. I then preceded to ask him if he would still cheat and the end result was no. Do I believe him.. idk. I’ve asked a couple different people’s opinion and decided I wasn’t going to report him because one, it’s not my job and I don’t wanna ruin this kids life (if he gets an FF) and two, the online exam is being proctored anyway. Even though I felt okay about this decision earlier I just feel so anxious I can’t even sleep. I’m not sure if it’s my OCD or a sign that I should tell on him. The only thing is I don’t want to possibly ruin this kids college career over this. Idk I need some advice.",06Apr2020,1
417,"I don't have a goal in like life, like I don't know which path in life I should take and Im nearing college. It worries me since I might make a wrong move in life. I tried a few things that I might be good at, video editing, coding, drawing, but Im not really having fun in those stuff. I don't really share this to my family and friends since I don't think they'll get me.",06Apr2020,1
418,"We were in a 1 year long distance relationship that was pretty on/off, but during all our little breaks, we both never slept with anyone else. After I broke up with him for the final time, I did sleep with someone else 1 week later. It was an intended rebound hookup that led to a 1-month long exclusive-but-not-official relationship. 

About 2 weeks into that relationship, my exbf had emailed me after we had no contact, saying he missed me and wanted to check in on me. I was already missing him at that point so I emailed back and we had started communicating again — while I was still seeing the other guy. 

Eventually, I cleanly ended things with the other guy. Today, I finally told my exbf that I did sleep with someone else after the breakup. 

My exbf’s immediate reaction was that he felt sick, that he felt faint and wanted to throw up. We called. 

He told me that he hadn’t slept with anyone because he said it felt wrong, because he felt he still belonged to me. My ex was very hurt but he didn’t hold it against me. He didn’t judge me, he said it didn’t bring my value down as a woman/person and that I was not a slut. 

And even though he said he felt jealous and hurt that he wasn’t the last guy I had slept with, he said it doesn’t change anything and that he’d still want to be with me. I asked him if he forgave me, and he immediately and confidently said without hesitation, “Yes.” 

I don’t know what to do with this. I know he loves me a lot. 

As a quick background, he had a promiscuous past (one night stands and fwbs) before meeting me and I’m his first real girlfriend. For me, I was saving my virginity for marriage, until I deconverted from religion and subsequently lost my virginity to my exbf. 

I always felt insecure and extremely hurt about my exbf’s past and couldn’t bring myself to accept it no matter how hard I tried. 

Idk, I just feel kinda foggy rn. I feel grateful to my exbf. I know he forgives me and he really loves me. At the same time, I don’t necessarily want to get back together with him. He does. I do still have feelings for him but i suspect I find more comfort in that he still loves me and only has eyes for me, but I have no real intention of becoming a couple again. 

Tldr: Slept with another guy 1 week after breaking up with exbf. I reconnected with exbf after a no-contact period. I eventually told my exbf and although he was very hurt, he instantly forgave me and still wants to get back together with me. I feel conflicted because I suspect I love how much he loves me, more than loving him as an end in itself, if that makes sense. Should I spare him and end things cleanly again?",06Apr2020,1

I have potted seeds that have started growing, made baked goods and painted all my canvases.

422,"Hi reddit, my best friend in the world decided to go on facebook and put me in a blast saying that I owe him 1.5k from 6 years ago. I decided to ignore it, until some friends in common started to ask me to pay up my debt(?) I give my friend ( we are gonna call him jim) a call to ask him what the fuck is he doing? And jim says that I owe him that amount


 I told him that the debt (379$) was paid in full that same year and that he even kept the security deposit we paid together, and he said that 1579$ remained unpaid and that I only gave him a total of 100$(which is insane). When I asked him where he got these numbers he sent me a photo of a notebook that shows several months of unpaid rent(which I paid religiously) 


I also asked him why he had never told me about this before, he said he didnt want to interrupt our friendship? To what I answered, so I owed you 1500$(it might not seem like a lot but we were both college students at the time) and you never reminded me cause you didnt want to interrupt our friendship???


But Instead, he decided that it was a better idea to blast me on social media?? We see each other a lot every week, so we talk PLENTY. Conversation ended with him saying I have to pay him soon.


I dont know what to do. Jim is a very old friend and I feel that more than losing 1579$, I will lose a friend for a 6 year old ""debt"" that feels more made up the more I think of it. But I also dont feel like being friends with him after his facebook post. I feel like whatever happens, I already lost a friend....",06Apr2020,1

24 M. Looking for advise and guidance. I am new to posting on reddit, so forgive me. The COVID has me down, as I think it does most, and I’m looking for ways to keep my mind off things. I have a busy mind and there’s a lot going on right now. I just found out the girl I like slept with a great friend of mine and don’t know what to about it all... I’m single (obviously) and have been for awhile. I’ve never really even been in a committed relationship, just had a couple of “flames” that never stuck past more than a week. I like to think that I’m pretty good with people, but in the long run I don’t really have a lot of relationships, as friends. I always put this on the fact that I hold people at a distance when I get to know someone, but it could really be a plethora of things. I’m currently looking for new ways to meet people (even more difficult with the virus) and it’s not easy, right? I mean there’s anxiety, like with how close you let someone know you... but even with friends, coworkers, colleagues etc...  I just can’t seem to be the person that anyone wants to be around or know/get to know. (It’s not a completion and I hope it doesn’t appear as such) I want to keep up relationships and I know it’s a two-way-partnership, but I’m missing something because it’s all to common with my efforts. I know I have friends that I confide in, very personal and trusting friends (known for years and for the rest of my years. Lol) but all my efforts seem lost in vain. I’m currently debating/wanting to cut out bad habits and fill with good habits, which is also difficult (but time due to this quarantine). I’ve been told I’m shallow and I’d be willing to argue that statement as truth. I think that this come from the connection with people and building/keeping relationships (friendships, dating, colleagues, coworkers etc...).

I tend to be a guy that’s a little smothering at times, and I believe that plays part of the role in all this. I also am very sensitive but play it off as complete chore to have emotions, I guess I’m very anti-dramatic. I really am interested in people, but I feel like it’s intercepted as fake. So there’s a little bit of a cycle here, right? RIGHT! I’ve kind of fallen into a rut.


I hope this doesn’t come off suicidal, it’s not. I take suicide and mental illness very seriously. In fact I work in the mental health industry.

Seeking friends and relationships

Looking for tools and resources that can help growth mentally and physically.

I really think this may have been more of a therapy session, as I’ve learned a lot about myself just re-reading over what I’ve wrote. Again thank you so much to the community we can share openly and safely. 
I guess I’m just looking for guidance though and how to find it. This is a start, so thank you again. 

Also, I fully expect I’ll be back seeking wisdom and virtues. Whatever you can share, please. :) 
Hopefully this helps others as well.

My ex and I have reconnected months ago. We talk almost every day. He has been so empathetic with this situation and gave me free n95 masks (which is impossible to come by) and we went on a walk on his property that day and maintained a distance. He has been focusing on exercising, reading, learning, and creating innovative ideas for his business to continue to work to educate children despite the pandemic. 

My bf just drinks, plays video games, eats fast food, smokes, and dicks around while working from home. Drinks on the job. It’s embarrassing. 

Meanwhile I find it hard to relate to my bf just leisurely having fun when I am at work potentially exposing myself to these patients and putting people younger than me on a ventilator. I have cried to many times about how the government and hospital corporations have let down the American public in this time of crisis. So I have to become innovative. My ex has helped me innovate new ideas to protect staff and other patients from The virus. 


















My ex seems more interested in me, or is he just being nice? 
My ex texts me long long paragraphs like this: 


I bet you felt like a badass! Makes total sense! Oh this will be history and you’re apart of it! It’s amazing! And y’all are amazing! I hope this is turning point for how we view healthcare professionals as well as some other disciplines!

That’s good you do that! Honestly it’s that kind of behavior you have to!

Hmm so underprepared in so many ways! Michael Osterholm talks about our dependence on China and it makes us vulnerable! You should listen to him! 

Well I’m glad to hear it will be a little more chill for you but still be careful and protect yourself! You never know who is asymptomatic or who was breathing a couple hours before you get there!

Oh I’m just chillin in my space! I’ve been reading my book Gone World (no idea what it’s about and I want to keep it that way, not knowing - just a book that was laying around haha), watching YouTube videos, I worked out, idk just keeping myself occupied! May listen to a podcast to wind down! Just chillin and doing my duty and staying home! It’s hard work I tell ya lol 

Yeah I read about that! Gah what a bunch of entitled selfish dumbfucks! I am sure you’re right, it will cause an outbreak! And it will lag about 2/3weeks, so thanks y’all for making this last longer and killing people! Just terrible! 

I woke up with a sore throat. Well I’ve had a sore throat on and off for a little while but idk! 
I am okay! 
I hope you’re doing well! 



Hmmm Im sorry:( we’ll just know there are also plenty of people out there who value y’all so much!! Like so much! It’s unfortunate that many people and authorities don’t and I am sorry for that:(  I am sure it’s hard to stay positive but remember history and that you’re a badass! Because you are! No doubt, I know it super hard on you:( 
Ah It’s tragic the nature of death and how it separates loved ones during those last moments! It’s tragic:( 
Do you work tonight?



Wow! That’s awesome you made your recommendations known and what quality recommendations! I so agree with the idea that we should assume everyone has covid and protect yourselves with that concept in mind! Because it would be terrible if staff or random patients were catching due to poor practice! 
I hope some, if not all of your recommendations are followed through! I’m glad you’re getting a night off!! 

Yeah it’s ridiculous how hospitals were telling staff at one point to not to wear masks because it could scare patients! Idk I think things should be hardcore strict for a shorter period of time as opposed to half-assed measures for a longer period of time! 



Yeah weeks ago I felt really achey! Yeah I have been saying that for weeks on and off! 

Gah that’s really cool you have Animal crossing and it’s so fun I bet! I bet that’s so engaging and life that’s better than this one at the moment! Making good progress?!

Hopefully this makes sense - I'm half asleep.

&amp;#x200B;

He doesn't like talking to people about his mental health. He has depression and anxiety, and when he gets in this space, he will basically shut down, not message anyone unless they text him first etc. He's been in this headspace for the past month or so, and normally I'd continue conversations as best I can, invite him to hang out, just get him doing things and being around people. But then this lockdown for COVID started, and has made it more difficult to continue conversations (since no one is doing anything), to be there in person to help him and to get him doing things. Because he doesn't like communicating much when he gets like this, we basically stopped talking for a week or so, and when I asked if he was ok earlier today, he said he didn't want to lie, but doesn't want to tell the truth since he doesn't want me to worry.

I suffer from anxiety, depression, ptsd, etc, so I totally get what he is going through.

I need advice on how I can support him, since I can't see him at the moment. What are some things you guys would find useful if you were in his situation? How do I continue conversations as best I can if theres nothing for us to talk about?

430,"I fell in love with a girl a few years ago and was fortunate enough to be with her for over a year. I had thought I had loved people before, but nothing had ever felt me feel the way I felt when I was with her, and to this day nothing has. We were inseparable high school sweethearts, and our teachers and friends and families all imagined us lasting forever, just like I did. I still love her and think of her every day, even though she broke up with me after things got rough when I left for college. I'm halfway done with school now, and I've been in a couple relationships since then.

The first college relationship blew up in my face because I wasn't over my high school ex, and it caused me to lose all my friends at school since they were better friends with her than me. It was academically and socially the worst year of my life after not only being hung up on someone who didn't want to ever talk to be again, but also allowing how I felt about that person to destroy my friendships too. 

The second was only really a friends with benefits deal because when I asked her to be my girlfriend, we discussed it and soon realized that I'm still not ready for a relationship yet. Her and I stopped the FWB deal several months ago, so I've been using tinder. I don't really know why I'm on it or what I'm looking for, but I haven't met anyone off of it. Despite how well it goes, I eventually realize they just aren't my high school sweetheart. They aren't the one and only person I want to spend the rest of my life with, and it scares me to even try to get a normal life like the rest of my classmates. I go to a huge school where it should be easy to find friends and start a new life like I dream about, and party and make memories while I'm here. But meeting people means meeting girls, and meeting girls means I might find someone else, which means letting go of my ex. It's been years, and it is still something I cannot do. I still love her so much. When does it stop? I know there are ways to help myself get over her, but frankly I just don't want to.

First of all, I apologize for any mistake, English is not my first language.
I need your opinion because I don't really know what to think. 

My boyfriend (21m) and I (21f)  have been in a relationship for two years. In general, I think we have a healthy relationship, but there are certain attitudes that make me really insecure. 

We haven't been together for a few days because of the quarantine and he doesn't seem to miss me. He's a bit cold about feelings, but it seems like it's always an effort for him to talk to me. We usually do video calls but he is always more interested in anything else he is doing, he never dedicates a little time just to me. Sometimes when we're making a video call, he starts playing with his friends, which doesn't bother me at all. What makes me sad is the fact that he is extremely excited when talking to them, which does not happen when he talks to me. In addition, he shares with them things that he doesn't share with me (for example, yesterday he was telling a friend he listened to a new band and liked it a lot).
Another thing that makes me insecure is the fact that he goes to sleep later than me. The problem here is that he already betrayed me twice (sexting) and did it late at night. I wonder if he is doing it againd and, if it happens, if he is going to tell me.

Just tell me anything please. Thank you for your time.",06Apr2020,1

437,"In the last month I started dating a guy that I've known for a long time. We've been friends for around 3 years and he means so much to me. Recently his mental health has been getting really bad, he has anxiety, depression, a fucked up childhood and self esteem issues. Tonight he said two things to me, and they hit me like a fucking train and I don't know what to do anymore. The first thing he said was how almost nothing makes him actually happy anymore and the second, was how he was trying so hard to change himself but whatever he does he still hates himself. I want to help him so bad, but I don't know how to. Anything helps, thanks :)",06Apr2020,1
438,"Background:

I think a great starting point is that my dad died when I was young. He has two siblings, one married with children around my age, the other just married. My grandmother and grandfather on his side made it known that they did not like my mother. They went so far to blame my mother for his death, and constantly made disparaging comments in letters to me about her and me. 

My favorite was on my 23rd birthday when my grandmother wrote “happy birthday to a grandson that never writes or calls”, which was partially untrue. I did call on occasion, but I was gaslighted to the point that I would regret even calling - not to mention all they talked about was how much more they missed him than anybody else, something my father’s siblings said to me as well.

I feel like the siblings never truly made a connection with me because the matriarch dictated that they should hate my mother. I tried to make a relationship. I knew that my beliefs did not match theirs - atheist(me) vs. catholic, but that’s not really a way to treat family.

I’ve dealt with some pretty deep depression. Nearly committing suicide multiple times over the years. I came to find out that I’m BP2 in the last few months, which only complicates matters. The hypomania I experienced manifested the same ways my father and his sibling’s emotions did - rage. My guess is they are probably in the same boat, just undiagnosed.

Today I go to therapy on a regular basis. I lead a semi-healthy life (picking up triathlons). I’m an awesome dad and effective coparent with my ex-wife. I’m generally happy with life, and looking forward to the future.

The issue:

I don’t really have much family that I talk to on a regular basis. This is hard, because I didn’t have a father figure to look up to growing up and becoming a man - I figured it out though, and am happy where my life is today. 

Last summer both grandparents died. I was cut out of the will for my dad’s share, which is more than ok, but I didn’t learn about it until the end of 2019 - they effectively chose my path for my grief, something not totally earth shattering. I honestly was relieved because the last few phone conversations I had were laden with guilt trips and more gaslighting. I made my efforts to appease them all of my life, but nothing was good enough. 

My friends are my family now, and that’s enough for me most of the time. When it’s not, it can be unbearable. Should I reach out to my dad's siblings and try to pull together a relationship, or move on?

TL;DR: dad died, his family cut me out of my communication. Now I’m at a crossroads.",06Apr2020,1

Our relationship has been rocky for awhile and with our lease ending in July I was going to move out. My plan was to buy my first condo but this virus hit when I had just started talking to agents and it's looking very unlikely now. I really hate the idea of renting again (as prices here are at least 50% of my alone income), burning all that money for at least another year, and feeling like I can never settle in. And short terms lease prices are even higher. I could stay here in a doomed relationship and try to extend the lease just 6 months, but that's awful too and might only have a standard 12 month option.

I'm just feeling stuck. I'll be 30 at the end of this year and I was so planning to have things more on track. I'm grateful to still have my job and health (for now), but I don't know what to do.

449,"Hi All

Here is some advice I can to anyone turning up to mental health support groups (once lockdown is over)

Firstly ask yourself is group worthy of my time , effort and  anxiety
Have I got other things I could do instead ? That are more worthy or essential or more interesting - washing up,  ironing, counting pegs into size order, a project for work or uni?

Still wanna go?

Okay...... bring a good book, you will need it or a pair of in ear headphones (Apple I buds)

Ensure you do not talk or engage with the boring woman whose main conversation is weather, her grocery bag shopping or what she has had for breakfast?

Always have excuses why you have to leave early, I have to catch my bus, pick up my kids,
 Granny Mabel is sick and she needs assistance at home

If doubt don’t turn and remember you are safe at home.

454,"So my friend that I rent to wants me to continue to rent to him (the same place he lives). 2 months ago I ended the contract because of things that I didn't like about the place (messy roommates, electricity often shuts down, he has several projects going on in the apartment, etc.).

Since he still wants me to live with him, and now that the other messy roommates are out, he offers to cut the rent in half the next two months, and after that, 15% less than what I have previously paid.

Sure, that sounds like a good deal, but the thing is, my friend has some serious neurotic tendencies (highly anxious, power-hungry, depressed, restless, disorderly). The other day he flipped for something he misinterpreted and told me to leave the apartment after this period is over in a very demeaning and rude way. And said sorry after that..

On the other hand, a part of me wants the peace of being alone. I am secretly a sort of hermit that naturally likes isolation. And even craves it.

**So here are my options:**

1. Live with another friend, and pay rent to a landlord that is not anyone I know
2. Pay rent by myself somewhere else (that will be expensive), but I'll get the isolation
3. Go live with my parents again. 1 hour away from friends. Save up for a house or camping-car (I believe I can make my job work living that far away, but corona has made things a little unsure)

456,"This is a pretty general question. I'm a 25 year old woman who grew up in poverty, was abused for many years and was supposed to be taken by child services. Over the years I relied on myself and I raised myself in a way. Few teacher's comments gave me the drive I've always had; to put aside the hardships and make the best of it. I did well in school, had many friends, was always fairly good looking and was on my way to get the phd which is what I'm doing now, in a different country in an amazing school. Maybe these two things are not interconnected but I can't seem to draw a conclusion of why this is happening to me. I've been betrayed by literally ever other person I've met in life. My whole wide family hates me because I'm not home taking care of the family. My cousins despise me, some of my long time best friends dropped me out of blue without any explanation other than ''you're an excess to my life''. I'm left with no one and it sucks. I like to act like a tough person but it gets to me, very much so. I even met this older couple from my home country who would invite me for dinners and wanted me to succeed until I opened up about my mental issues which they spread around to everyone and screwed me with few other things. So my question is; why??? Why does this happen to me, do people hate when you succeed? When you don't just play by the rules and other's expectations? Or am I just a narcissist who thinks everyone else is wrong.

To be clear, I've never harmed any of these people. I really can't sleep at night if there is any conflict. Maybe I'm also just a dislikeable person. Any insight would be appreciated, thanks.",06Apr2020,1
457,"This might be a long one, but please help me!

Okay, so the topic here is: Head lice
Yes. Head lice.

And I’ll preface this entire thing by saying that I am INCREDIBLY terrified and phobic of them. Getting them, seeing them, even just typing the word makes me want to vomit. I’m itchy just thinking about this whole situation. I am 7 months pregnant, and the thought of dealing with bugs on or around me makes me want to cry.

How did this situation happen? My husband and I were hanging out with our 2 friends, we’ll call them Bob and Jane for simplicity’s sake. They brought up that they were trying to move out of Bob’s parents’ house and get their own place, but they’d like to move in with us and help out with some bills, learn to fend for themselves, keep me company at night while my husband works as I get pretty paranoid being alone at night being pregnant, and keep us company during the current quarantine.

Now, Bob and Jane have had a running issue with head lice, purely because they don’t seem to want to take the necessary steps to get rid of them. I first saw them myself, with my own eyes, crawling all over Jane’s head when I was visiting them BEFORE I had even gotten pregnant in the first place. So we’re talking a good 7+ months of lice going on, how they can handle it I have no idea. It was to the point that they obviously had spread to other parts of their bodies, because I could physically see the sores on their arms and legs from them scratching the bites. Bob was even seen pulling one right off his head and smashing it on a table while drunk at a party a few months back. Disgusting.

About a month or so ago, before them moving in was even on the table, my husband and I went to Bob’s birthday party. Jane tried to hug me and I asked her if she still had bugs, and I made it clear I did not want her touching me if she had them. She told me no, that they had gotten rid of them, and that was that. So I kept that in mind when agreeing to let them move in, because I had no reason to not believe her, although I hadn’t checked her myself or anything like that. I regret not looking.

So, we let them move in. They have been here for 4 days... sitting on my couches, my chairs, touching things, hugging me and my husband, y’know doing friend-type stuff...

And tonight I found one of them fuckers on me.

It wasn’t in my hair, thank god. I have a dog that has had flea problems in the past, and I felt something crawling on my side as I was starting to fall asleep in bed. So, as a sort of force of habit, I reached down and snatched whatever it was in order to kill it (thinking it was a flea), and turned the flashlight from my phone on so I could make sure it wasn’t just a rogue crumb or something that tickled me (my husband eats cookies in bed sometimes, judge him harshly please lmao). And lo and behold, it was a fucking head louse. An adult one. Huge. I flipped my shit and killed it, but ended up dropping it before I could stick it’s nasty little bug corpse to some tape or something in order to have evidence that I’d found it. Yes, I got a good look at it. Yes, I’m sure it was a head louse. Bedbugs and other bugs look vastly different. It must have hitched a ride on my clothes I was wearing before I went to bed somehow.

So, of course my next plan of action was to have an absolute meltdown. Full blown panic attack, cry, vomit, etc. Again, I am terrified of these things. Other bugs and spiders and shit don’t bother me. I have super thick hair and have gotten head lice throughout my whole childhood. I’d say I’m traumatized by them, because it would take me months to get them out, my family would get into fights over me having them and where they would come from, pretty much a bad situation all around.

Once I had partially calmed down, I woke my husband up and searched his head with a lice comb and my flashlight. Clean. Then I went and violently searched myself, basically going at my own head hardcore with a lice comb and essentially tearing my own hair out in the process, checking each pass until I had done my own head multiple times over. Also clean, which I had expected because my scalp is incredibly sensitive and I would have felt them crawling if I had them.

So, if they didn’t come from us, the obvious place would be Bob and Jane. So my stance on this is: If they have heads infested with bugs, I do not want them in my house getting them everywhere. I don’t want to run the risk of me or my husband getting them. I am nesting now, and the thought of having to bleach my freshly cleaned couches because there are bugs on them makes me want to throw myself off a roof. I don’t want my baby getting them. I am very afraid of head lice and this is stressing me out so much, but I don’t know what the best plan of action should be or if I am being too harsh.

I thought about kicking them out until they can get their heads under control, and my husband is willing to go along with whatever I decide, but I feel like kicking them out over this is going to make me come off as a massive asshole. But yet, I want them out of here. I cannot fathom having lice all over my house, it makes my skin crawl. If I let them stay, they obviously seem to be incapable of removing them by themselves, but do I let them try to do it here and run the risk of them still spreading them everywhere?

How mean would I be if I sat them down, talked to them, and asked them to leave until they could get it sorted out?

Please let me know, and give me advice or tell me how you’d handle this! Sorry it was so long.

TD;LR I am pregnant and phobic of head lice, and my room mates brought them into my house when they moved in. I found one on me and am now losing my mind. I want to ask them to leave my house until they can get rid of them. Is that mean? What should I do?",06Apr2020,1

461,"Long story short I told my best friend about my feelings for her. I pined after her for years I’ve had a thing for her since I was 14 years old I’m 28 now. We grew up around each other and I work for her stepdad. She occasionally helps, like two days out of the year which is usually when I see her. A couple years ago, 2014, out of no where we started texting and it turned into sexting and we got caught up in it. Never did anything and a few months later she was feeling guilty and wanted to stop. It was really hard for me because I thought she was finally showing interest in me but we stopped and it took me about two months to get over it where I wasn’t wanting to talk to her all the time. Didn’t talk for months until she came to work and it was like normal a little flirty, fun jokes, and good times. Fast forward a few years later, summer 2017, I get a pic of her from her and I was like what?!? “You must have the wrong number lol”, it was a Snapchat selfie and said feelin tipsy on the bottom, she said nope and we talked until I fell asleep. Later I found out that night he mmmmm she had a huge fight with her bf, and from that night on she just kept talking to me. Every second of the day, and I really enjoyed it. We woke up and fell asleep talking to each other. I’d wake up early just to talk to her before she got to work. She started sending more pics and then nudes and we went back to sexting like a few years before except this time we started hanging out and then I finally went for it and kissed her even though I know she has a boyfriend. That led us down a few, like 7  months of sneaking around having sex going on dates even told one another we loved each other and all while she was still with her bf. I thought she was going to leave him and I wanted to be there for her. She ended up ending things with me but we tried to stay friends and we were doing ok. She ended up leaving her bf and I was hopeful we could finally be together but she said she wasn’t ready for a relationship. I understood and I was going to wait for her because she was worth it. This was almost a year ago. The past couple months she’s been distant but I understand that it’s because it was my fault. I didn’t realize my constant asking about something more was pushing her away. A couple days ago I find out she’s seeing someone and I took it in the worst possible way. Poured my heart and feelings out to her and pleaded for a chance to be together she knew I was waiting for her and she knew how I felt, been know I told her in a long letter I wrote her back in 2014. I must of overwhelmed her and she blocked my number, Facebook. And I did not take it well. I was scared and floundering and I needed her, she’s my best friend I go to her for everything. I reached out by email because I just wanted to know what happened, can she please talk to me. She said she wasn’t discussing it with me it just happened, and I lost my cool, ultimately told her to fuck off and die. Instantly regretted it but once it’s said it’s said. The next day she emailed me saying that was the second time I cussed her and told her to fuck off and die, I did it once before when she ended things with me and tried to fix things with her ex, and said “why would I want to be with someone that treats me that way?” She’s absolutely right if she would have told me that someone said that to her I wouldn’t have let her put up with that so I can’t expect her to take it from me. She has issues with depression and anxiety, and according to her when we were close, ie during the time we were messing around, I helped her so much that she was able to stop taking her meds and didn’t need to see her therapist so often only now for me to become a cause of all those problems. She’s the best friend I ever had, I’ve never been able to let myself get close or open up to anyone like her. Even though she led me on I still care deeply for her and still hope one day we can be together but I’m scared I’ve driven her away for good because I couldn’t cope with my stupid feelings and just be the best friend that she needed instead of wanting more. I’m such a fucking idiot. I don’t deserve a relationship with her. I need help moving on though, I’ve been stuck on her since the good days we had in 2017. She was always my dream girl, fantasized about her for years. Had a chance with her or at least I thought and it was amazing, everything I thought it would be and then some. I guess I’ve been lonely for a long time waiting off to the side for her sabotaging relationships so I can be ready for her when she wants me, so when I got a little attention from her I was on top of the world. I just miss her. I miss talking to my friend. She also pointed out that I only ever told her I missed messing around never any of the other things that actually mattered. I did this to myself and I feel like such a damn fool. I ruined things with the best friend I ever had. This is just a couple days ago so it’s fresh, I’m going to give her space. If it’s meant to be it’ll happen I guess, but I’m just tired of us coming together for a short time every couple of years then drifting apart for years. She said I have so much to offer and that I can’t give up at her but I don’t want anyone else I never have",06Apr2020,1

Does that make sense” I’m pretty sure this means I don’t work there anymore but it doesn’t really seem fair that some events happened and I have no way of getting there to work because I do have to go with my car to the repair shop so I can figure out what’s happening (towing it). But this doesn’t seem fair because I was ordered by my doctor to stay home till I finish the medication she gave me and I can’t control if my car decides to stop working. I really liked the job.

464,"We met at a cosplay gathering around 2009 with a bunch of mutual friends being weird at a park. We both hit it off and from there we would chat away, go to each others homes, go shopping and even play video games together.

We both go to conventions and she is very into costume design. A veteran of cosplay.

It was all great and everytime we would get together id feel so special and happy. (We are both girls) we never fought or got into any arguments. Eventually she ghosted me for an entire year when she went to college and I felt so isolated.  Even the busiest of people can just look at a text and reply quickly. 

I've known her for 4 years and we only got to see each other 1-2 times a year. The last time we got together was at my place about 2 years ago, we watched a movie and sang songs. It was amazing. Then one night she randomly texted me at 2am and she and I facetimed. She looked stressed and odd..not her usual cheery self. I got worried  and stayed on the phone with her until I felt she was okay.

After that night she never picked up the phone or replied to my texts. I cried thinking she did something to herself. I recently checked her instagram and saw new posts. Shes okay and in relieved. She rarely updates.

I contacted a mutual of ours and asked if they knew anything of my friend and why they are acting strange. From what they say shes a ""friend hopper"" someone who hangs with a certain crowd of friends for awhile, gets bored and moves onto other people.

I couldnt stop crying. I felt so broken and used. Yet I still wanted to be around her. For 4 years of friendship, it felt like I knew her for  2 weeks. Just when I felt like I finally made a sweet and wonderful friend...

That night after hours of thinking it over I collected myself and wrote her a message on battle.net since she was always online she would read my message..even if she never replied.

I told her everything I felt. I told her it was the hardest decision I've made but I couldnt be her friend anymore..I felt lonely and unappreciated. I'd give her all my attention and give my best to our friendship but she never did. I told her that I wanted to hang out more and how she made me so happy.

I told her that I wanted her succeed in her career and I always wish her the best.

Never got a reply.

We are still friends of FB but she didnt update it since last year. 

I just want your opinions...I still think of her and yearn to talk again and maybe patch things up...but is it worth it? My minds is split into 2 parts and I feel so conflicted. I don't feel like I'm good enough to her but she never made me feel less than her..she always made me laugh and smile. Why cant I stop thinking of her..!? I know it sounds dumb but I really want to know what you think?",06Apr2020,1
465,"I understand how incredibly vain and narcissistic the title sounds. 

I suspected I'd been struggling with Body Dysmorphic Disorder for a while, but it turns out I really am just flat-out ugly, and that my peers and family have been lying to me merely to appease me. I don't think I can even bring myself to look in mirrors any more because every time I do, I feel physically sick. 

I know that there's greater issues at hand, and that ultimately I should be happy I've a healthy body that does what it needs to. I know there's a pandemic going on, and that between all this there's famine and homelessness and God knows what else. But this, it's consuming me, and I'm now struggling to leave the house because I feel that every time I do, people are laughing at me. 

I've even started feeling as though my life doesn't matter because of how ugly I perceive myself. I thought that maybe if I'm bad at essentially everything, maybe I could try being pretty? And I know it's so harmful to place your entire worth on appearances, but it genuinely hurts. The pain is real. 

I've tried uninstalling IG. I've tried counselling, and positive affirmations, but my mind is perpetually stuck on this mantra of, ""you're so ugly. You don't deserve to live,"" and even more, I convince myself that I'm too ugly to even feel attracted to people. 

I know these thoughts to some may seem irrational. But they're here all the time, every moment of every day. 

I was given a 4.2 - 5.2 rating and while I appreciate the honesty (to some extent), I'm just so angry at myself for being this damn gross. I can't even afford make-up or surgery, let alone decent professional help and/or medication.",06Apr2020,1
466,"Hi, I'm sorry if this might come out as a little bit long but there is some exposition I need to make.

LB: Little Bro

DH: Dear Husband.

My little bro(20) and my family signed a lease together to cut the cost of rent and utilities. I saw it as an all around way for us to save $ in the long run because on my own I wouldn't have been able to afford rent on my own. (We moved in together because otherwise my family would have been essentially homeless.) 

My husband and my bro constantly butt heads. It wasn't so bad in the beginning, and my hubby was ready to treat him like a little bro himself and had no problem until my bro started taking everything and anything said as a personal slight, even when he wasn't even the topic of discussion. 

My bro has aspergers and so his view of the world is slightly skewed and he tends to paraworld.(his concept of reality is the ONLY truth he'll accept 90% of the time). LB has admitted that with people he doesn't like he'll purposefully be a 'shit-lord' to them. I've been trying to get them to get along, or at least tolerate each other but it's just been snowballing. DH told me that unless LB makes the first move, he's not going to do anything. LB says that DH is on 'strike two.', I'm not even sure what strike 1 was, but strike 2 was LB talking smack, and giving my DH shade behind his back to his Destiny friends and it was the last straw to DH so he burst into LB's room, pulls off his headset and lays into him verbally. This causes all sorts of problems and LB is as he says ""I'm DONE, I'm an adult, I'm 20, I have a job and pay my own bills and I shouldn't have to put up or live with this kind of shit. I dealt with it from Mom, I dealt with it from Sis and from Dad, I'm not going to deal with it anymore."" Since the incident he's felt nothing but oppressive stress and like he HAS to barricade his door. I've tried to reassure him but it's futile. LB has enough saved in the bank to buy his way out of the lease (2x monthly rent at $1045 per month), leaving me and mine completely screwed because DH doesn't have a job right now.

Just recently our step dad passed away (march 20'th) and we were able to come into a little bit of money. It's not much but it'll be enough to invest some and make it work for us. (LB and me.) I'm worried that if they get into it again LB is going to be petty and cut me off completely from the half he promised me. I understand that he needs to do what he needs to do in order to feel safe, but its just frustrating to me that this is happening at all. Both of them are hot heads, DH doesn't know about the money at stake and LB made me promise not to tell him about it (believing DH will just blow it on crap like video games or computer parts. Which is not true, he's still got the $50 in his wallet I gave him from LAST YEAR.) 

How do you think I should approach this to try and smooth things out a little, at least to survive until the end of our lease in August? Should I tell Dear husband about the money so he knows what kind of windfall is riding on them being civil at least?

Thank you for your time.",06Apr2020,1
467,"Long story shot, my father died late last year was recently out of prison, homeless and squatting. Seeing as he was never married or in a de facto relationship I am his next of kin and had to organise everything in relation to transport of his body and dealing with the coroners. 
His ex however is and was the beneficiary to his funeral insurance and life insurance. 
Anyway, I’ve only just received his coroners report regarding his death.
Which details and outlines what happened to him. 
It was put down as combined drug toxicity in a man with cardiomegaly. In other terms an accidental drug overdose of a man with an enlarged heart. 
My grandmother  and her partners health are not the best at the moment. She took his death pretty hard as he was her baby. She supported him in prison both times he was in their in the last 4years, adding to his commissary and talking to him quite regularly and hoping for the best when he was released. Also around the time of his death my dads, step dads daughter committed suicide. So they’ve been dealing with a lot emotionally and health wise. 

However, she doesn’t know he was back on the drugs so soon after his release and I’m honestly not sure what to do. I feel she deserves to know what happened to him, but at the same time I don’t want to be the one that puts the nail in the coffin so to speak.  What would you do in my situation? 

TLDR; passed away from combined drug toxicity in a man with cardiomegaly - should I tell grandparents who health isn’t the best and have dealt with a lot in the last 12months.",06Apr2020,1
468,"Obvious throwaway alt but I’m really at the end of my rope here. I’m lucky that my medication prevents me from a good amount of usual suicidal ideation, and that’s been relatively manageable until recently. Even though I obviously can’t manage social cues, I consider myself extroverted and I rely on physical in person contact to stay sane, especially away from home. I’m a diagnosed aspergers and MDD, and it’s making it especially rough to manage during this whole quarantine. I can’t see the few friends I have (which I’m thankful are really close ones, including my(I’m F) boyfriend of 3 years). I’m still young(about a year until I am able to move out), but this is beginning to feel genuinely unmanageable. I can’t take it anymore- it’s horrible being unable to see the only people I can ever say I’ve loved. I’ve been trying to talk to them on the phone or on FaceTime but it just isn’t fulfilling my social needs. It’s seriously making me feel like I’ve lost all progress in terms of depression for the time being, especially because my therapist says that the best thing I can do until I’m out of the house is meet with others away from home and given my situation I 100% agree with her. I have a hard time understanding my own feelings too, because even though I’m considered high functioning I still feel like I’m made quite a bit unaware by my conditions, and I keep finding myself more and more self deprecating as time goes on. What should I do? I’m really stuck here and I feel like I’m getting more invasive suicidal thoughts in isolation (if it gets bad I will go to a hospital, I’m just asking on how to manage what there is now. Compared to how I used to be without medication or therapy these thoughts aren’t as bad as they could be).",06Apr2020,1

470," 

I've been feeling... wrong for about 3 years. But ever since about Year 3 I've always thought of myself as just a fat shit, and I still do, I know I'm not that fat (I'm 70kg at 175cm). I'll never reward myself for doing well, yet always mentally punish myself for anything I do bad. I can never find motivation in anything I do unless it's got something to do with video games. I use to be addicted to video games but now am falling down the path of drugs, just as my older sister did. I started smoking weed and taking opioid painkillers, I don't know why, it just made me relaxed and calm. I've thought about killing myself for nearly 4 years. I tried self harming not for attention but just to see any appeal, there was none so I stopped. I'm still addicted to video games and I constantly smoke weed, take tapentadol and any other drugs I can find to invoke some sort of high. I've come out before in Year 6 about wanting to kill myself to only one person, they told others and then I got shamed for around 2 years constantly for faking for attention. I felt terrible, it made it worse I didn't know what to do. I have friends, I'm in the Popular Group, but I'm the unpopular popular one. I feel nobody in the group wants me there, except for one, I'll call Matt and I also have another friend from another school I'll refer to as Kyle. Neither know about my struggles, I play video games with them, smoke with them and party with them. Yet, most of the time they'll invite me over I'll never go, saying I feel sick or am tired. I got constantly laughed at by older kids, getting called sloth and everything day after day. Whenever I walk past them they just laugh at me and talk about how ugly I am.

That leads to now, where my parents constantly call me a waste of money, because I use to get such good grades, but now I don't. This whole online school is terrible. I can barely get out of bed in the morning because I don't want to work, I'll procrastinate the entire day, then work all night on assignments that I've left to the last minute. I really want to kill myself, and I feel terrible for putting my parents through such annoyance, because thats what I feel like I am to them, annoying and just a huge waste of money. I don't know what to do anymore but I feel like the closest to ending it all than every before, and to be honest I would've already, if there was a quick, easy and painless way.

I have been to therapy before, it helped for around 10 weeks, then my therapist left for her long service leave, she advised me to continue seeing a therapist out of school, I said I would, I lied. I hated therapy. I hate crying in front of people.

This whole time I never thought I was depressed, just that I was genuinely a hopeless person. But then I found this community and I'm wondering do I have depression or am I just sad for no reason and just have to man up?",06Apr2020,1
471,"I'm a junior in high school, but I'm an anxious person, so I like to have things planned out ahead of time. If I don't, I get nervous and worried. So this is why I come to you, Reddit.

So I'm torn between two choices: Art and Medicine.

I know, completely different. But I like both. I'm really passionate in drawing and painting. But I'm also really interested in biology and the human body.
I know that the good option, given job opportunities later on, is medicine. But I'm not sure if studying medicine is worth it. Perhaps I feel more comfortable selling my artwork for a living, rather than still being in school. But I also don't spend every day making a piece of art. I really like it, but perhaps art is more of a hobby for me than an actual job.

My family says that I have both good memory for concepts and terms in medicine (I'm in a first-aid elective in my school and I like explaining what I learn.) and talent for art. They tell me that they'll support me no matter what. Though, I used to be adamant on pursuing art, and for months I've been considering medicine. A few days ago I decided maybe that it would be ok to be a doctor. And when I broke the news to my family, my dad was really happy and said that I'd be the star grandchild. That everyone would be so proud of me. That was a really inspiring moment at the time.

But now I'm just scared of making the wrong choice.

One thing I do know, is that I could do both. I know I shouldn't stop painting even as a doctor. But the word doctor is bigger and heavier and I just don't know if it's even worth it.

I have done career quizzes and they don't really help much. I've read posts from medicine students saying it's hard. But I also see ny brother's girlfriend (med student) enjoying it. She says it's hard, but if I like it, then it's worth it.
My dilemma is: do I like it enough?

A) A really posh boarding school overseas

Now for this school, I am going here for 1 year only because then, I will be able to apply for a better school in my country which only admits people with 3+ years overseas, and currently, I have 2 years under my belt. This my best-case scenario, but there are obviously obstacles and problems that more or less likely appear during this time period.

Not only is this school really expensive, but it also intimidates me because of its ""boarding school properties"" like bullies and stuff. (Idk maybe just cause I played Bully by Rockstar...?) Also, the coronavirus is also a problem. A second wave might surge in the fall, leaving me to attend online school for another period of time, while my parents are busting their asses off to pay for this ridiculous tuition.

Overall though, I'm pretty confident in fitting in well and I want to go to this school.

This school is as far away from me as El Chapo is from his release date. I have to wake up at 6 and spend around 4 hours every day on a bus just to get from place-to-place. This school is renowned to have entitled pricks and assholes, but to me and my parents, is the safe option. My mom wants me to go here, but I feel like I wouldn't be a good fit here. I don't want to be in this school for 4 years until college, because I feel like this school will change me, too.

Overall though, to me A seems slightly better for me...

488,My girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me right before this virus and I'm feeling really lonely right now. Where is the best place to find people to talk to online?,06Apr2020,1
489,"This is the second time it’s happened but this time the plant was in stage III and my cat ate most of the leaves. It’s still green, and I’m hoping still alive. Does anyone have advice for me? It was originally kept in my closet but it was getting too large and I didn’t want to start a fire

490,"This is not your average scary ex boyfriend story. 

I am a female in my twenties. Originally I made this account to seek advice while I was with my ex, let’s call him James. Now I am no longer with James and haven’t been for a few months, however he recently messaged me and I am very afraid. I believe he is unwell and dangerous. 

While we were dating, James (who is in his mid twenties) was talking with a 15 year old boy through twitter DMs. The 15 y/o boy had asked James for a blowjob, and while James refused, they became close friends. The friendship alone freaked me out considering that the kid is 15, and the fact that he asked for a blowjob and my ex continued to speak with him was even weirder. Even without the blowjob message I found it odd that a man in his twenties would seek friendship with a 15 year old. When I told James how uncomfortable this made me, he told me to stop pushing my morale onto him. I explained that it’s not my morals I’m enforcing, it’s the law. He refused to acknowledge the wrongness of their friendship and they remain friends. 

Because of this and a few other reasons, I have reason to believe James is a pedophile. I do not believe that James has ever physically come in contact with a child sexually, though it is possible, however he seems to be very interested in boys that are around 15 years old. He has always disproportionally followed many very young boys that post things like shirtless photos. He also consistently engages with accounts that are sexual and made by minors. 
James also has multiple nephews that are between 3 and 10 years old, and has sent me odd photos of them with no context. There is nothing wrong with sharing pictures of your little relatives however he’s sent me random photos of them in their underwear with no context at all and it gives me a weird feeling. 

I ended things with James because I think he is a dangerous person. I did not explicitly tell him that it was because of this, but it’s the truth. 

James left me alone for the most part but would reach out randomly in strange ways. I began to block him on all of my accounts but have received strange messages from him, sometimes random pictures of his body that have a weird vibe to them, the pictures are surely no attempt to appear sexy, they’re more just creepy and awkward. 

I’ve considered notifying the police. I do have text messages between us where I say things like “why would you be friends with a 15 year old who offered you a blowjob” and he responded with things like “you just don’t get it, you don’t get our friendship” which is proof in itself of his wrongdoings. However I would never want to create a legal situation if it’s not necessary. 

Last night I randomly received a message from James about how I am crazy and that his friends agree. This was odd because the honest truth is, James does not have friends. He talks to people like his 15 year old “friend” through twitter but James does not have any real life friends at all. 

I’m not exactly sure what I am afraid of, but he has gotten quite delusional, angry and spiteful. He has recently said things to me that are bizarrely insulting and cross multiple lines. 

I am afraid that I am dealing with a pedophilic psychopath who wants to ruin my life. No matter how many things I block him on, he always finds a way of reaching out to me. What can I do to get away from him for good and to ensure that he will stop trying to mess with me?",06Apr2020,1
491,"I (24F) had a bad breakup with my ex (27M) just before Christmas. The fight was so bad I ran across to our mutual friends house (just one apartment building over) to get away and called the cops on him. It's been hard. Our whole relationship was toxic af. But I managed to stay off drugs for 5 months (me and my ex both had drug issues). I got a job and my own place that's subsidized. 

But now I'm lost in my addiction again. I stopped caring or got depressed. I have never been feeling so lonely before. When I relapsed my one good friend also did so he hasn't been able to be a support. 

I'm gonna mention this too, I started sleeping with and chilling lots with the mutual friend of my ex. I think I got attached (and boy do I have attachment issues) to him and he hasn't been around for a support either lately, but I also was trying to distance myself from him a bit.

I know! I expect too much from 2 people in my life. There are other ""people"" I know that could help but when I was doing good I never kept those relationships up so now that I'm not doing great I feel like I have no one. I have my mother and that's it right now. 

I really struggle with fear. Rejection. Codependency issues.

TLDR 
I'm stuck in my drug addiction again after losing a bf and feeling lost cuz I have no supports. 
Worried I'm gonna lose my place/job.",06Apr2020,1
492,"I am an 18 year old male, going to be 19 soon. I've only been in two relationships, and in both of them my girlfriends were older than me. The first was 63 (45 year gap), and the second was 28 (10 year gap).

In both of these relationships my parents were not pleased, with my dad being way less accepting. During the first relationship, my my mom and dad would constantly argue with me about dating someone older, and they did it every opportunity they got. This was extremely stressful. It got to a point where I was sneaking sangria out of the fridge to de-stress.

My dad would constantly tell me that we have nothing in common due to our ages, as if he knows everything. You don't have to have everything in common with an SO, right? As someone who takes an interest in older music, films, and recent history, I do have more in common with an older person than he thinks. There is also the fact that I grew up away from my own generation, so my personality is very dissimilar to people my own age.

In fact, whenever I've talked  to someone my age, it looks like an alien trying to understand a human! I have nothing in common with girls my age and I have no interest in them.

Then when I dated the 28 year old, I thought my parents would be slightly more accepting due to her being closer in age, but NOPE. I was still constantly told that we had ""nothing in common"", and that she was too old for me. Oh, and get this; she was **black**. A huge issue for my parents who claim to not be racists.

The relationship lasted five months. I will give my parents credit with the fact that they eventually did come around to liking her. She even came to Christmas dinner. Of course, we did break up eventually. A combination of her emotional issues, coupled with how I wasn't really attracted to her because she was too young. When the relationship ended, I felt as if things were going to be okay. I mean, my parents actually came around to accepting that the person I was dating was older than me (and black).

Then some stuff happened recently that reawakened the stress that I now feel...

I walked down to the local gas station mart to buy a snack, and I saw a beautiful older black woman. I offered her some hand sanitizer, which led to a conversation that ended in me getting her number and her agreeing to a date sometime. She's 59 (41 years older than me). We actually hung out for about an hour afterwards. She's such a nice, beautiful woman and I have a really good feeling about her.

But yesterday I made the mistake of telling my parents about her. Like I said, the second relationship gave me a good feeling about my future relationships. I told them what happened, and suddenly I was hearing old arguments come back. ""You have nothing in common"" and all that goddamn fucking bullshit. Not to mention that they were even more mad about how she's black.

It's funny, during my first two relationships I attempted to have civilized discussions with my parents so I can explain my point of view. But all they do is get mad, yell, and call me disrespectful. All because I won't date who they approve of.

My dad even said ""This is about morals and values"". What morals? There's nothing morally wrong with an older adult dating a younger adult. It honestly seems like they believe it's wrong because society said so. Just because you don't like something, that doesn't mean it's wrong. It seems like most peoples' main grievance with age gap dating is ""Ew! Gross! Yucky!""

I have had this preference since I was 12. Twelve! It is hardwired into me like you wouldn't believe. Imagine telling a gay guy to stop dating guys, as if he can just change his preference.

Despite this, my father believes I can easily change it. I have told him repeatedly that if I dated someone my age, he would be happy, but I wouldn't. He does not care. Keep in mind, these are parents who have insisted that if I was gay, they would be 100 percent supportive.

Shouldn't a parent want their child to be happy? Dating someone of my preference would make me happy. The usual bullshit I hear from people is ""They just have your best interests in mind"" and ""They know what's best for you"". How is that so when they're incredibly biased and just plain racist.

If two adults are in a relationship that they both consent to, and they both like each other, then it doesn't matter at all what age (or gender) they are.

It's not like I can just move out. I can't even find a minimum wage job that'll employ me. Even if I had a college degree I couldn't go anywhere since those things get you nothing now. Everything is expensive in California so I'd probably be on the streets in no time. Oh, and not to mention the PANDEMIC going on right now. I'm stuck with these people!

I don't even know how I'm going to begin to deal with these new developments. My parents won't accept any new point of view and can't comprehend the idea of their child being right and them being wrong. Should I just stop caring about what they think and pursue what makes me happy?",06Apr2020,1
493,"I have been struggling between being around my mom and cutting her out of my life. I’m looking for others opinions on this to allow me to look at our relationship through the eyes of others. 
My mother is an alcoholic who had 5 children. Her first child, A, was adopted over to her dads parents. My mom would bite my sister all over her arms when she was a toddler. Then my mom met my dad and had 3 kids. She ran away with us in 99. Not even a year later, she called her mom and said she couldn’t take care of us anymore.
Background, my moms mom, R, is married to Ar who raped my mother and beat her and my aunt and uncle when they were children. My mom let R and Ar have custody of us. My little brother Br and little sister Bi and I spent from 99-01 getting the crap beat out of us among other things. 
My mom after that was in and out of our lives. She often showed up drunk or not at all. Sometimes we wouldn’t see her for years.
About 5 or so years ago she met a man, D, that she lives with and she seems to have a lot more sober days. Our relationship is very strange. It’s weird talking to her.
One time she asked me “did you learn to drive in (city of J)?” and I said no. Dad threw the keys at me when I was 13 and told me to go to the store.
Last year around thanksgiving she got drunk and started cooking enough food for 2 families. I walked in and she told me she didn’t know how to make noodles. I took over cooking because my mom is known for making terrible messes and ruining food when she’s drunk. I found out later that she trash talked about me to my husband while I was cooking. 
I feel like the child my mother only cares to have around because I’m the only child that comes around. Br and Bi won’t have anything to do with her and haven’t seen her in 2 years.

497,"Some background information.

I'm currently living with my family in the UK as University has been cancelled. I have a part-time 7-hour a week job working in retail behind a til. My mum is high risk of dying from Corona as she has major respiratory problems. She received the letter from the NHS saying she was high risk and had to isolate. She said she ticked two categories for it.

I've told work I wish to self-isolate they were okay with it for the first week but they changed their mind. My parents, siblings and girlfriend are telling me not to go to work but I'm receiving increasing pressure from my employer to return to work. I usually come into contact with at least 300 different people a day, stood two or three feet away.

Work has assured me they have implemented methods to reduce the risk such as social distancing and they mentioned a screen and a limit on the number of customers allowed in the store (10).

On one hand, I feel like an asshole not coming into work right now. I hate the idea of other people having to cover me or just letting people down in general especially if they are the people I need to spend a lot of time with. I've been working at this place for a year and a half so I  want a good reference and no employment gap, although I'm at university  so I don't see this being an issue in the long run.

On the other hand, I don't think I'd be able to **ever** forgive myself if I were to indirectly cause the death of my mum because of some Saturday job I had when I was a teenager. Also, money isn't very important to me as I have little outgoings and I resell clothes which some months makes me more money than my payroll.

500,"  Sorry about any formatting issues in advance i'm new to Reddit in a way.  
   To give some context, my mom died about few years and my dad now has a "" thing "" with another woman. I want him to be happy, but how can I ask for boundaries without coming off as an a\*\*hole.  
Maybe I was an asshole for doing this, I asked him to just tell me when she was coming over.   
   Its not that I don't like her shes a nice and wonderful woman but I just want to know so I can make sure the house is cleaned and just to be comfortable in my house. ( I have ""mild"" anxiety so I don't like things being thrown at me out of nowhere. ) He said to put it lightly, that I don't tell him what to do and don't have the right to make request cause he's my father and not my friend. Maybe it was a few choice words that he used and how they related to the day before my mother died and mine and hers relationship itself but I simmered on it all day and exploded on him later that night after I tried apologizing that I overreacted.   
   *How do I explain my boundaries to him without coming off as rude or disrespectful?* He assumed we didn't like her when me and my sibling just wanted to know when she was coming over and now my sibling is also annoyed at me cause I dragged them into this without intending to. Don't get me wrong my dad's wonderful but i'm having trouble communicating what I want to him. To explain our relationship, I respect him cause hes my parent and genuinely a good role model but we're able to joke around with each other and be at a mutual standing- I respect his choices and he respects mine. I want to have a healthy relationship with my dad.  
  I'm going to spare the few times he invited her to a few places and it made us uncomfortable. To summarize, I want my dad to be happy but any request I have he assumed I'm being rude or have a problem with who he is with. I want to be able to tell my dad when he's doing something wrong or being hypocritical because I thought we were friends but if I can't ask him to do something or point out his behavior then how am I supposed to talk to him anymore about what i'm going through?  
   I'm sorry if this is silly i'm just in a mix of emotions and don't know what to do or how it led to our fight, maybe I should just leave stuff like this alone and learn not to care but I don't like doing that. I'm most likely the a\*\*hole for asking that of him but I still need advice on him dating and how to "" work"" with it, I don't want to be rude when asking for something or make it seem like I don't want him dating.

That was really hurtful for me, both from his and her side. He then stayed with her and these girls at her house. I was talking to him on text and phone the entire time. He lied that there were no girls, then he lied that he went home, the next day he said that he stayed at her house. We made up, i forgave the lies, we got back together. A couple of days later my other best friend texts me that she found out from one of these girls that my bf cheated on me with another one of them. Several serious points were saying that they were lying, they were laughing and drinking at the time, also they told me about one girl at first, then it turned out to be another, and a couple of other things.

My husband and his sister are not close (though not estranged), and all communication goes through his parents, who live an hour past the SIL, but visit us monthly to see their only grandchild. Sometimes we go to them, and SIL goes to her parent’ house to see her niece. This is all to say that though it’s very different from my In Your Face Loud East Coast family, they’re not atypical for a more reserved, Midwestern family. 

I’m 4 months pregnant with our second. Right after we found out, my MIL told my husband that his sister miscarried her second IVF pregnancy. (There’s never been a conversation between us and SIL about her struggles.) She would have been within a week of me. My MIL can’t talk about it without crying, and refers to it as a baby that died. She is the kind of person who decorated her family’s gravestones for every holiday, so she thinks about the dead often and deeply. 

Now it’s been 12 weeks since then, and the family still hasn’t told SIL about our baby. They’ve asked my husband not to tell her, saying that SIL’s husband wants to be the one to do it and he hasn’t found a good time yet. My FIL told me to go ahead and announce it on Facebook but block SIL from seeing it, which I feel very uncomfortable about. MIL still won’t let husband talk to SIL and cries when he brings it up on the phone. (She is also very stressed because of the virus, so I understand. She misses her grandkid, her friends, and her work, but she and FIL are very high risk.) 

I’m concerned that someone in the family will say something to SIL by accident and she’ll realize she wasn’t told, and why. Or that it will get to 30 weeks when she finds out, and she will know she was excluded. Or, god forbid, we have to announce she has a new new nephew she didn’t know about. Also, I admit I feel like my baby is a dirty secret. Pregnancy is very hard on me, especially now, but this is one of the few good things in our life right now.

520,"That's a very specific thing to get angry at but it's been more than 4 years and we are still having fights on this issue. She promises me not to say anything about saving money but she does it again and again. At first, I did not understand why I get angry at such a thing. After all, it seems like good advice and I am saving money whenever I can. So I tried to trace the problem. I figured out that I do not like any input that seems like a reinforcement to my actions.

I started working out because I was unhappy with the appearance of my body. My girlfriend is happy with the results lately. One day, she asked me if I was going to work out the next day. I told her that I was not going to work out. She asked why and I started to feel like this conversation was shifting to a reinforcement. For some people, such reinforcements are helpful to put their life together but I hate it for some reason. I want to make my own decisions about working out or saving money and I am disturbed by the idea that someone is giving any feedback to my actions.

I am currently writing my thesis. When my advisor gives me feedbacks about my thesis, I do not feel any anger. So I do not feel this anger in every situation which involves reinforcement. It might be a problem with my mother and my partner only. I couldn't understand what is wrong with me. Is it something normal or do I have deeper problems that I should consult to a professional?",06Apr2020,1

522,"My sister has been staying with me since before the quarantine orders and the whole virus. It was supposed to be for a few months until she got back on her feet and eventually I presume got her own place...

Anyway. I still have a job fortunately. However she is trying to refrain me from exiting my home and walk my dogs. She also does not want me going to work anymore (frustrating because she seems to not even think about how I'll pay the Bills nor has she offered to help).

Today was my first day staying home from work for her sake and she yelled at me. She told me I'm walking the dogs too much.  She even cussed at me and blatantly disrespected me. I told her that if she wants to quarantine at such an extreme level that she can stay in the room and not come out. Seems to be she wants it her way and wants to control me so I can fit her into vision of how this is all supposed to go down. 

She said she cant stay in the room because she needs to use the kitchen and common areas...

524,"Writing papers in my bedroom, my parents back to fighting under one roof, ED flaring back up, and just trying to keep my sh*t together.

I'm back in high school. My anxiety and depression are worse than they've been in years.  The constant talks of calories, weight gain in quarantine, working out (obvi in the fams top priority category) are pushing me back into the ED territory I spent years fighting to get out of. The whole family is quarantined together so the parents are at it again. Everyone is at each other's throats over the most minor thing. I get it, tensions and stress are high with valid reason. But why can't we come together instead of making it worse on each other? 

I've never opened up to family or friends the full severity of mental health or ED issues and I really don't think I can start now. But I feel I'm at my breaking point. Even the things I'm trying to do to decompress are being viewed as ""lazy"" or purposeful attacks against someone else. (E.g. any stationary activity that requires me to look at it)

My job is related to security systems and cabling. There is going to be a lot of interaction with other people therefore a higher chance to get Covid-19 (without insurance within next 90 days).

535,"I (20f) wanna start by saying that my dad (49m) is one of the best people in the world and I love him more than anything. About a year and a half ago he and my mom decided to get a divorce, but he can't let her go still. I understand that a year and a half is a drop in the bucket when it comes to healing, but the problem isn't exactly that he's so sad about my mom leaving.

He's turned to drinking. Heavily. He had some problems with it throughout my life when I was younger but for the majority of my childhood he did not drink at all. He works really hard all week and everything seems to be going okay but then when the weekends hit, he turns back to whiskey and beer to take him away. It breaks my heart. He becomes like a child when he drinks, incoherent and rambley and he does almost a baby voice kind of thing. He says really terrible things when he's drunk, talking about how he'll be dead soon or how he wants to die and escape or how much money my brother and I would get from his life insurance when he dies. The emphasis is always on soon. And this is beyond terrifying to me, I don't know what I would do if he died. I would be heartbroken if I lost my dad. It's hard to explain how he is when he gets this way, he says more than just this stuff all to a similar degree showing how depressed and addicted he is. When he's sober, he tells us he's done drinking.

I'm really scared he's going to try to kill himself if this continues. I don't know if it would be at home, what really scares me is the fact that his job would potentially allow him a way to kill himself that poses as natural causes so my brother and I would get that money from his life insurance policy. I don't know how to talk to him about this, I've emphasized countless times how much my brother and I love and need him and how we want to do whatever we can to help him. He said he would go to AA over and over again and never did, even when I offered to go with him I couldn't get him to come. We've talked about therapy but nothing has happened. He got prescribed medicine to help him but stopped taking it, he says it makes him feel sick and dizzy (I can understand this though). 

So what I'm wondering is how can I get him help right now, with so few face to face resources available during the COVID pandemic? I love him so dearly and can't even describe the gravity of the situation in words, it sounds so trivial typing it here. I may have left out details my brain is so fried from everything going on in the world right now. I've tried so hard to be here for him and do what I can but I'm not equipped to do this by myself. I know he needs to talk to someone but I don't know if online therapy is a good option if anyone has experience with that. Please tell me what we can do because my heart has been broken too many times over this and I'm so scared of losing him",06Apr2020,1

I know this is such a small problem compared to everyone else's on this sub, but I absolutely cannot stand being called cute. I can honeslty say over 90% of the compliments I've ever gotten were people calling me cute. Whether it's friends, family, potential dates, random ass strangers, they all call me cute or something along those lines. 

Part of what bugs me is that a lot of the time I get called cute because I'm pretty shy/anxious most of the time so people just assume I have a sweet, quiet personality which I really don't. When I get close to someone they always tell me they're surprised how loud and jokey I am, and they're usually surprised by my taste in music and books and stuff too. And I know if I just came out of my shell and let people see my real personality off the bat they would find something more fitting to call me but I don't know what to do until then.

A few weeks ago one of my friends was joking about fighting with my other friends and then she turned to me and said ""yeah but not you. You look like a kitten I couldn't hit you"" 

And another time, I know this will sound so immature, but I was talking to a guy and I wasn't really feeling it but I was willing to give him a chance. He asked me what I was wearing and I sent him a picture of my outfit.  Leather jacket, leather pants, boots. I even have a damn mowhawk for God's sake. And I still get the response of ""aw cute"". I genuinely turned him down because of that, only because I straight told him I didn't like it and he kept doing though.

So how do I tell people that I don't want to be called cute without sounding rude. I know most of them mean it in a complimentary way but I can't help but feel like they're patronising me. 

(Also side note. I don't want it to sound like I purposely dress in clothes to make myself not look cute. I have been into dark fashion since I was literally like five because my dad is into old metal. I'm more into 80s goth/post punk music and fashion, but the overall aesthetic of dark music and fashion has been there my whole life.)",06Apr2020,2
546,"A while ago I noticed that quite frequently, whenever I have a problem, a neat observation or an opinion about something I wanna get off my mind, I don't run to my best friends, tell my girlfriend whose sitting right beside me or talk to my family. I run to my online friends or distant friends I see once in a blur moon.

Now I know these friendships are super valid and there's no reason I CAN'T share these things with them. But often it comes at the expense of sharing them with the people closest to me, which really isn't great for maintaining a healthy relationship with them.

During my younger years (especially around ages 12-15) my mom was definately a bit of a snoopy parent, with boundary issues. I know generally that doesn't do great things for a child's ability to discuss his thoughts and feelings. I don't want to play a big blame game either because all and all my mom's a wonderful, thoughtful, giving woman.

551,"edit: Me and Ben are males of age 23.

I made a throwaway account for this.

Sorry for the wall of text, theres a summary at the bottom.

For the ease, lets call my friend Ben.

First of all, a little backstory:

Ive known Ben since kindergarden, we didnt hang out with each other until around age 12 though. At age 15, we started experimenting with drugs, we didnt know any better. We tried many things, but i eventually came to my senses and quit drugs, noticing that it started to fuck up my life. Ben however, didnt quit when i did, but continued his usage of drugs for 1-2 years longer.

I stopped hanging out with him, because i didnt wanna get caught up with drugs again, So did his other friends, his life started turning to the worse and he lost his job, license etc. After this, his parents helped him get clean and he has been clean since.

The problem is, i dont know how to describe it, but his brain has taken some damage i think. He has problems socially, saying things he shouldnt, doing things he shouldnt, but he doesnt understand its wrong. He has turned somewhat ""dumb"", thats the best description i think.

ive started hanging out with him again for about 4 years now, because i feel bad for him. All his other friends has stopped talking to him/hanging out with him. I enjoy hanging out with him for the most part, hes a kind person but has a hard time expressing himself.

Problems started happening last year though, i was invited to a party with some childhood friend, and i asked if Ben could come with, since he also knew these people from childhood, and they accepted the request. We all had a great time, sharing memories etc, and Ben ""functioned"" well, until it was bedtime.

I woke up in the middle of the night because of something splashing on my feet. I opened my eyes and  saw Ben standing up, pissing his underwear, it splashed my feet since he stood pretty close and i immediately turned furious, i scolded him the fuck out(I'm not used to waking up with my feet being drenched in piss), and i also have anger issues. Ben wasn't awake tho, he was still groggy and sleepwalking, he didn't know he was pissing himself until i started yelling at him. He got really ashamed and just walked out the apartment.

After some time i calmed down, and i felt very bad for him, i didnt mean to scold him like that, he was sleepwalking, He didnt intend for this to happen, So i forgave him for this.

Now though, last week. I was sleeping over at his house, all was good until the morning, where i woke up to the old familiar sound of masturbation, He was masturbating, thinking i was asleep! I got stressed out, i didnt know what to do or if i should tell him/scold him for it, the situation was awkard as hell, but i couldnt just lay there listening to this, it grossed me out. So i ""faked"" waking up and went to the toilet, this made him stop. But i didnt wanna go to sleep again, afraid of him starting again, so i went to the kitchen, made some coffee and started watching some series instead. He ""woke up"" some hour later and i acted like nothing had happened, but i was grossed out and just wanted to leave, so thats what i did, i left when he woke up and i havent talked to him since.

Its not okay to masturbate when you have your friends over, its disgusting. And now im confused on what to do. I know im the only friend he has, but i cant get it out of my mind.

I need som help/guidance on how to continue on from here. Should i tell him about it now when a week has passed? would that be weird? should i forgive him for it?

553,"Hi,

So I have been working with a business as a business developer since October - until I was laid off out of nowhere 3 weeks ago now.

When I was laid off by email I was told that ""the door is still open"" a few times and that it was nothing personal etc. but they aren't looking to expand the business at this time.

They said they would get back in touch ""in a few weeks"" but i'm still yet to hear anything after 3 weeks.

&amp;#x200B;

So my options that i'm thinking of are below:

1. leave this indefinitely until they get back to me (and risk losing the job ever coming back, also in the past I've often been told they would do X by X and never do)

2)Follow up on the email at say 5, 6 weeks or so - to ask how things are going and if it's looking likely that that job will be back on.

3)Give up on everything and start my own business - I have time right now to create a detailed business plan as I have nothing else to do and there are no jobs available right now because of the corona virus.

&amp;#x200B;

For context this was a really big piece of work that had a lot of potential - a lot of which is also half completed as it stands, so I would feel bad to leave it how it is.

At the same time I was also dropped out of nowhere and i'm unsure if I want to even work with a business that sees me as easily disposable? I put their sales up by 70%.

I was also told just 2 months ago that I am a ""great asset"" to their business so nothing really adds up.

554,"My friend graduated top of his class from an Ivy League university with straight A's. He is very intelligent and has so much potential. However, after graduation, he moved somewhere random to be with a shitty girlfriend (now ex) and just works as a waiter. He didn't even apply to any ""real jobs.""  I'm not sure why he's choosing to work minimum wage when he could be applying for much better jobs and find a solid, stable career path. It feels like he's wasting away his potential.

He is from a low SES family which (I thought) would motivate him to find a more stable, better paying job to pay back student loans and become established. Also, he just got laid off from his waiter job with the COVID-19 situation so he is now on unemployment benefits. I feel like this is a situation he could have easily avoided and it almost feels like he's choosing to live this way by not pursuing a stable career he is certainly capable of having.

I moved my mother out here 2 years so that she could escape her previous husband, start new, and watch my children so that I could return to work.

My husband and I were upset, we can't afford her bills and daycare so when we discussed everything with her and expressed our concerns she called me selfish, to which my husband lost his cool. She hardly helps out around the house and acts like my kids are a huge inconvenience sometimes. (My twins are 3 my oldest is 12). Any ways with this whole quarantine we asked that she not go over her boyfriends house and we explained over and over that this Covid19 is very serious! Our son gets pneumonia every year and we have been able to catch it quick but something like Covid19 could kill him or at the very leastput him in the hospital for a while. When she travels to her boyfriend's house she goes to see his family for dinner on Sundays. When she went this weekend I begged her not to but it didn't seem to matter she went. I asked her at the very least to not see his family and remain inside. She agreed, but I made myself very clear if she did she was not welcome back in our house. 

This week is my mother birthday and so her boyfriends family went to his house to celebrate. I felt absolutely gutted that she had the audacity to return to my home and put my family at risk. I'm really not sure what to say to her. I'm so angry and hurt. Am I wrong? Am I being selfish in asking her not to see her boyfriend.

 Now my husband and I are still working. He is the only employee in his office and I wear gloves and remain in my closed locked office at work (which is only executives at this point) I've not placed myself at risk nor has my husband. I know I have taken precautions but these other people I have asked her not to associate with at this time, one has had a positive COVID19 case at work. I don't know these people, I don't know if they are taking this serious.

Am I wrong? Am I being selfish? What do I say to her?",06Apr2020,1
560,"Not trying to be dramatic. I know there are people who have lost jobs or loved ones to covid. There are also a lot of people who are blessed enough where this is nothing other than an uncomfortable extended vacation for them. I am just speaking from my perspective.

Before this all went down, my life was finally picking up. I lived through the 2008 recession and shitty job market, but I was young and starting off out of college. It took me nearly a decade to get my shit together and overcome my deep issues. 

This year I will be graduating from my masters, but due to the situation, I am now learning from home and will be unable to do a summer internship that is critical to get into the field, assuming that’s even possible at this point. Plus I have debt. Unemployed, debt, and new to my field that may or may not be affected. 

Another element of how this has royally fucked up my life is also dating someone amazing who I could see myself with, but leading up to this school got in the way and he got hurt by my inability to see him, and now we haven’t spoken and I am honestly not even feeling remotely interested in talking to someone over video who I have so much apologizing to do to.

I’m 30 and I want a damn career and boyfriend, I want to settle down and be stable. I had to move out of my city and back in with my parents which has been its own ring of hell because of how toxic they are, plus my siblings aren’t taking it seriously and my parents refuse to stand up to them. I’m starting to think there’s a good chance I’ll be stuck here through July, which makes makes me lose motivation to do everything.

564,"Sorry for the long backstory but I would like to start off by saying I have severe anxiety and it makes it difficult to date a lot of the time so if you're wondering why Im acting a certain way, that's probably why. Im 18 years old, and im a senior in high school. This year I had a class with this girl, and we started getting to know each other a little better and shes pretty cool. At the time though she was dating this one kid for the past 3 years so I never flirted with her or anything like that. We did talk a lot on snap though, and I kinda got the impression that she liked me but I wasn't sure. One night, She told me she was drunk over snap. I started poking fun at her and making jokes (NOT sexual ones) and it made her laugh. She then hit me with the line ""Don't tell anyone, but if I didn't have a boyfriend and It wasnt my senior year in high school, I would totally date you. You're a really attractive and cool guy"". Now I like hearing the ""I would totally date you BUT"" line as much as the next guy, but it didn't really hurt because I didn't look at her that way b/c like I said she was dating a guy at the time and I wasnt trying to disrespect the dude like that. 

Later She actually told me that she had a crush on me all the way back in middle school but I didn't think anything of it.  Anyways fast forward about a month and she broke up with her boyfriend. I decided to wait a little bit to see how she acted around me. Whenever we snapped,  she started asking me a bunch of questions about my hobbies and telling me about her family and stuff which I thought was a sign but wasnt sure if she was just bored. Our table in class was talking and when I mentioned I was looking for a prom date she was like ""Oh my god, you need a prom date? Im already going with this one kid but I would have gone with you If *I knew you didn't have one""*  I laughed and said thanks but said I wasnt too worried about finding someone to go with. She then said, ""Oh but we're all going to this lake house to party afterward, and I would want you to be there so bad, maybe I can come up with a plan to drop the kid im going with now and take you!"" I said I wouldn't want to do that to the kid she was already going with, but she insisted she wanted to go with me and the other kid is from a different school so he'll have his own prom anyways. I relented and she arranged it so we were all going together. 

At this point, I was pretty sure she liked me, but this is when it starts getting confusing. Our teacher walked over at one point and she said ""OH my god mr\_\_\_\_\_, guess who im going to prom with, its \_\_\_\_(me). My teacher smiled and said, ""Oh that's awesome, now are you guys going like... together or just as friends?"" She smiled and said, ""No definitely just as friends"". That kinda hurt but in the moment I laughed it off because she never explicitly said we were going as a couple or anything so I felt like I didn't have the right to get butthurt over it. Later that day she Snapped me and was like ""oh my god when (my teacher) asked if we were going as a couple I ALMOST DIED LAUGHING"" And then she did start laughing. I just sent something along the lines of ""Ya I know right? haha"". But then that kinda confirmed for me that she wasnt into me like that right now. 

Fast forward like another week and we were talking about how excited we were for prom, and she mentioned ""Ya im so excited to get drunk with you! Also, if im drunk Ill probably be all over you so just kinda push me off don't do anything. Cuase that would be rape"".  This just added to my confusion because she literally just managed to say "" I Think your hot but don't want to get with you"" in the same sentence. I respected her opinion though and Said id make sure to.  

Fast forward a couple of weeks and we were talking about the beach and stuff when she mentioned she got this really bad sunburn one time and sent a picture of it. It was literally her without a bra on, but it cut off right before her nipples (and she did actually have a bad sunburn in it mind you). At this point, I was so confused but, I figured im just being a dumbass and she's trying to show she's interested so I shifted the convo towards being tan in the summer, and used it as an excuse to send a pic of me from the beach shirtless to ""show how tan I was"" and see her reaction. Part of the way I cope with my anxiety is by going to the gym every day, so at the risk of sounding arrogant, I do have a decent body that im proud of. She responded with something like ""Damn, not to be too straightforward but you have a really hot body"". At that point, I thought we were on the same page but then she shifted the conversation to something else completely random almost instantly. So I just gave up with it and decided she didn't like me because this was all just to confusing.  

Fast forward to last night, and she literally snaps me saying how horny she is. She told me she was so horny she was about to try to learn how to draw sex scenes (One of my hobbies is drawing painting so I guess she thought it was relevant for me). Now at this point, I was like there is no godamn way shes not into me if shes literally texting me shes horny. She ended up drawing two people making out, and I mentioned how hot making out is, and that the drawing turned me on and she said she agreed and said it was weird how crazily horny she was. This was the beginning of the most confusing sexting convo I've ever had.

 I asked her some building questions like what do you like to do when your horny, and she said ""probably watch a movie or something and wait for it to go away, but that might make me even hornier rn"" uhhh.. ok ill take another shot I guess. So I asked what shes thinking about. she responded with the picture she drew and said ""Im so fucking horny im just thinking about any human interaction right now"" This was still a little offputting but I figured I would just go for it to see her response so I sent a risky message about liking making out with girls, but having an even better place to put my mouth (This is so cringe I know im sorry but it's for the context of the story). She then responded by laughing and saying your one horny mf and said she didn't expect something like that to come from me and that this whole situation is hilarious. Honestly this just kinda hurt because it felt like she was laughing at me so I just said something about it being funny when she said shit like that to and went to bed b/c it was like 3AM. 

That's the point im at rn and im just honestly really confused and have no fucking idea if she's interested or not and could use some advice on what to do or some opinions. Im kinda scared to say anything explicitly saying I like her because I don't want to look like an idiot. Am I misreading the situation? Any help is appreciated.",06Apr2020,1
565,"This is gonna be a long one, because I think there's a lot of discerning details that complicate things, so either please bear with me and read all the way through, or just skip this one. Thank you. All replies appreciated...

So, about 1.5 years into our relationship, my then-boyfriend, now husband, and I adopted a male miniature pinscher (Dog 1.) About a year later, while I was away at military training, hubby and his daughters (11 and 13 years old) adopted Dog 2, a male border terrier mix. Dog 1 and Dog 2 were the best of friends and never had any issues getting along. 

Fast forward about another year or so, and Hubby tells me he wants to get another dog because his 13yo doesn't feel like she ""connects"" with Dogs 1 &amp; 2. I express that I wouldn't particularly care to have 3 dogs. He adopts a female Rottweiler anyway. The dogs get along well enough until one day the rottie takes a chunk out of Dog 1's side because he was being possessive over his dog dish (we have several feeding stations set up in the kitchen and laundry room, so every dog could eat at once if they wanted to.) I was immediately nervous and distrusting of the rottie. Dog 1 healed and was fine except for a scar. We had the rottie for about 2 months and then unfortunately she got severely ill, and we found out she had aggressive lung and liver cancer, and she had to be put down. That was especially hard on my husband and his daughter.

About a month goes by. I was in school, and my older step daughter couldn't stand me because I reminded her of her parent's divorce, so I had an apartment close to school to which I went for half of the week the days the children came to their father's house, to give her some space and time to come to terms. My university is about 45 minutes drive away with traffic anyway, and I had classes every weekday, so I didn't mind staying by myself, other than that I missed my dogs a lot and felt kind of lonely. I entertained the idea that I should adopt a dog for me, and that s/he could go back and forth between the apartment and the house with me. I thought I would just take a look around the nearby shelter, but then I visited with a female, medium sized boston terrier/pitbull mix (Dog 3) and she jumped into my arms and I just fell in love and knew I had to have her, and so we walked out together that day. She was the dog they used to test if other dogs were friendly, so I didn't think there would be any issues with Dogs 1 &amp; 2. And there wasn't.

A week or two into having Dog 3, it became clear to me that she needed more stimulation and potty breaks during the day than I could give her as a busy college student in a one-room apartment. (I tried to run with her daily to help get out some of her energy, but she does not like to and straight up refuses to run.) I decided it would be best if she stayed at the house with the other dogs, with access to a doggie door leading into a big yard to run around in.

Things were fine until about two weeks later, when the adoption agency we got the rottie from contacted my husband to say ""sorry for your loss... We have another large dog whom we think might be a good fit for your family, and we'll waive the fees for you."" Of course my husband jumped at the chance to get his daughter another dog. We packed up Dogs 1, 2, and 3 into our truck and took them to meet Dog 4, a female Great Dane. The dogs seemed to get along, and we took her home that day. Our family had gotten so big and our hearts were so full of love and excitement. 

Well, about a week later, Dog 4 bit Dog 1 because again, he was being a dick about food. He was still okay, but a little traumatized. Even though he was the smallest, he had the biggest attitude and wanted to be the alpha dog, and Dog 4 just wasn't having it... The tension between them made me nervous, but I figured the little dog would just yield to the big dog. Wrongo.

I don't remember how long it was after getting Dog 4, but one night hubby and I went to the gym, and when we got home, we walked into the most horrific scene I'd ever experienced in my life. There was blood, trash, and feces all over the kitchen, and it smelled horrible. Dogs 3 and 4 came in the house to cautiously greet us. Dog 3 had flecks of blood on her sides and forehead, but wasn't hurt. Dog 4 had blood all over her muzzle. Dog 2 was cowering under the kitchen table. We found Dog 1 hiding in a tiny space behind the tipped-over trash can under the sink, trembling, and when we carefully pulled him out, he was drenched in blood from huge gashes in his neck and shoulder. Hubby rushed him to the veterinary hospital while I corralled the dogs and cleaned up the mess. I was deeply shaken and it took hours.

Dog 1 had to stay in the hospital overnight for emergency surgery. The vet said he would have died if we had waited too much longer. Hubby initially accused Dog 3 of doing it, but I knew from the blood on her muzzle that it was Dog 4. The worst part was when we played back the fight on kitchen cameras to confirm who did it... The terrifying growls of Dog 4 and the terrible screams from Dog 1, who literally shit himself with terror while Dog 4 viciously shook him, gave me nightmares. And if we had been home literally 5 minutes sooner, if I hadn't asked if we could get protein shakes from the gym's smoothie bar, we would have been home before it happened. I felt really guilty about it, especially when the massive $5,000 hospital bill came back.

Obviously Dog 1 couldn't come back to the house with Dog 4, so the childrens' mother, my husband's ex-wife, was kind enough to take Dog 1 while he was recovering. This was probably the best decision for the situation, given that she also had small dogs for him to play with and a dog door with a big yard. We never did get him back though, and Hubby says she's grown quite attached to Dog 1, even though he won't stop peeing in her house... I miss Dog 1 a lot, and have asked Hubby to ask his ex if I could borrow him for a day or two when I went to stay at my apartment. Hubby was very much unwilling to even ask her because there is a lot of tension between them over finances, and it stressed him out to interact with her any more than necessary. I eventually dropped it, but it still stings a little. 

Many months went by since the incident. Since then, every day I have feared walking into the house to another bloodbath, or to get that call from Michael telling me one or more of the dogs are dead. Up until two days ago, we still hadn't done anything to resolve that fear, even though occasionally Dog 3 and 4 would occasionally get into fights while we were home, and I was badly shaken and in tears after we broke them up each time. Two days ago, the female dogs got into 3 fights in one day, and I just about lost my mind with panic in addition to getting deeply scratched, bruised, and bitten trying to get the great dane's jaws off of the smaller dog's neck, and keep the stupid smaller dog from rushing back to attack the great dane's legs after we finally got them parted... They are both okay; Dog 3 has some bite marks on her neck and deep scratches, and Dog 4 has some bites on her legs and a badly sprained wrist, but otherwise okay.

The last two days, we have been keeping Dogs 3 and 4 separate, taking turns with who gets locked in a bedroom vs who gets free run of the house, or who gets shut out in the yard vs who stays in. It's not fair to any of the dogs, and it's not only a pain in the butt, but also very stressful to me. Dog 3 is very clever, nimble, and athletic, and can figure out a way to get past virtually any baby gate and barricade I construct to contain her, short of a closed, locked, and baby-locked door. All it takes is one mistake, one miscommunication about who's contained where, and a dog can die. On top of that, I keep having nightmares, and every sound that sounds remotely like a crash or a dog fight sends me sprinting down the stairs, yelling at them to stop. The dogs are wary of me because of this, and I can tell the 13yo is annoyed (We're all cooped up in the house together because of the pandemic, but trying to stay out of each others' ways.)

I feel terrible about it, but I think the best solution is to rehome Dog 4. It would crush the 13yo, being the second time she loses *her* dog, and it would be hard on the rest of us, including me, because we love her. She's the sweetest girl... Until she's not, you know? I thought about giving up Dog 3 (which would crush me because she's supposed to be *my* dog,) but Dog 3 has a greater need for space, attention, entertainment, company of other dogs, etc, and so it would be harder to find her a good home, compared to Dog 4, who is more chill and would be best, I think, as an only dog. On top of that, I worry that one day Dog 4 will attack Dog 2, and Dogs 2 and 3 have only ever ""fought"" (if you can call it that) when we gave the dogs each a bone and Dog 3 took Dog 2's bone. There's an easy-enough solution, which we have successfully implemented: no bones in the house. And even if they do fight, its less likely for one of them to die, given that they're roughly the same size, right...? 

I tried to talk to my husband about this, because the pandemic isnt going to do on forever and we can't be home with the dogs all the time. It wouldn't be fair to crate them all day, with our busy schedules. He is understandably reluctant to break his daughter's heart by giving away her dog, and has suggested getting an ""animal behavior specialist"" to come and try to figure out what their issue is. I pointed out that that's not going to happen until after the pandemic, and would necessitate having the dogs interact with each other again (risky) and probably cost a lot of money (not a concern to him, but still?) Additionally, I'll be going back to school at roughly the same time the pandemic is predicted to be over, so no one will be home and we can't just wait that long to get a damn animal behavior specialist in here, while I'm slowly losing my mind about the situation. It's seriously gotten so bad that I've considered just taking Dogs 2 and 3 to my apartment and staying outside at the fenced in dog park for most of the day, being pissed off and miserable, until my husband misses us enough to rehome Dog 4...but my lease ends soon and that's not fair to our 11yo.

569," Ok to start off I’m a 15 year old boy. 

My parents think I’m a pretty good kid. They think I’m generally smart and they think I should do all these great things in life. They want me to go to an Ivy League college or military academy and nothing less. 

Meanwhile I’m perfectly content with doing something like owning a local skate shop in my home town or being a baseball coach at a local highschool. I just want to live my life for enjoyment and not for accomplishments and money. They don’t understand this concept and say it’s only for stupid people. 

They say if I don’t do something great I will be a disappointment. I don’t really know how to tell them what I want.

570,"So she's my best friend since we're like 10 or so (we're 19 now) and i've been in love with her for 4 years and she knew since the first day, we're not shy about it.

She's not interested in me romantically, but she loves me more than her family.  
And at one point, I asked her for nudes one night at 4AM and she sent me like everything was okay.

One year later she told me that she was really anxious when that happened, and that she REALLY DIDN'T want to send them, thought she acted so okay about it in the moment.

And i felt really bad for that and i scolded her because if she didn't wanna do that she should have instantly told me.  
Well, yesterday, in the middle of  adolescence  stupidity, I innocently asked her if she still felt bad about sending nudes again. And I asked her if ""she would be willing to make that little sacrifice of feeling bad for the sake of making my day"". She told me that she didnt want to, but she will for me today.

Well, today morning I regretted my decision and asked her to not send me anything since I respect her and I dont want her to feel bad. She's the most important thing in the world for me and I would much rather spend the day talking and laughing everyday, instead of... this.

She didn't listen to me and told me ""Dont play nice now, you know you want them, and you'll eventually ask again if I dont do this. This makes me sick and I just want to get over it with.""

I insisted for 2 hours, telling her to not do it.

This is the situation: my neighbors behind me have a yappy dog. I garden every day and as soon as I come outside he starts barking at me. This lasts until I go inside again. I went to their house and talked to them about their dog and things seemed to work out okay for a couple of weeks before it went back to their dog barking, again. 
I will say we have a big yard, but the dog has an issue with us just stepping outside. 

So the other day, we spent the day unloading dirt and working on raised garden beds. I was tired and overheated and got a little cranky. We were planting and trying to communicate on that but it was difficult over the barking. I lost my cool and said some things, such as I was tired of hearing their dog everyday. It's not even my dog, etc. 

After I said that, I heard the old guy at our fence line talking to their dog and bringing him in. He sounded embarrased, like he felt bad. I am pretty sure he heard me. Now, when I go outside, no barking. Today, when I was heading towards the garden, I heard him calling his dog inside. 

Now, I really didn't like their dog's incessant barking but I would gladly take it over making an old man feel bad/embarrassed, on edge, like he cannot sit in his yard. 

I have racked my brain trying to figure out how to correct the situation, what to say, etc. I can't stop feeling bad about what I did. I want him to be able to go outside, again. I feel like if I talk to him directly about it, it may embarrass him more. However, I think the more time that passes, the worse the situation will become. 

What is the best way to handle this?",06Apr2020,1
580,"I’m only going to be using this account once because this is very important.

tl;dr My sister joked about me cheating, and now my boyfriend thinks I’m cheating.

Unshortened version:
I (18F) was on the phone with my boyfriend (19M) while I was working on my homework, and my sister walked in and asked if I was on the phone. I’m not allowed to be on my phone while doing homework, so I said no. She didn’t believe me, and she asked, “Which boyfriend are you talking to?” After that, she said she was joking, and then she walked out. As soon as she said that, I got really pissed and scared at the same time, because I know that those sorts of jokes could destroy my relationship. My boyfriend heard all of this, and now he suspects me of cheating. I’m not trying to get too personal here, but it doesn’t help that all of his other relationships resulted in cheating. He’s had trust issues since then. I’ve always been loyal to him, and I’ve done everything I could to make him feel safe. I wouldn’t change any of that. It hurts to hear him accusing me of cheating after I’ve put in all my effort to make him feel loved and feel like he could trust me. I would be really devastated if he left me, especially over an insensitive joke.",06Apr2020,1

585,"Hear me out please. I know cheating is horrible and I am extremely reluctant to even post this question because I know I most likely will get judged and hated but I seriously need advice.

I feel like I need to give background information on our relationship because to me that's what makes the situation so difficult (sorry, if it is too long just skip to the \*\*\*marked paragraph). So me and my girlfriend (let's call her 'Marie') have been officially dating for 1.5 months now, however, the months leading up to us getting together we were very ""on and off"" - kind of like unofficially dating already or at least acting like it. We met very unconventionally in September 2019 because we both were in an inpatient psych ward for a while. Both of our unstable mental health conditions were partial reasons for us not being more serious beforehand. I am bipolar (got the diagnosis just last year, so still adjusting) and she had different problems, mainly depression though. We got very close very fast because we saw and supported each other in situations you wouldn't ""normally"" when meeting and getting to know someone through uni or work etc. I started crushing on her very early on and lightly started pursuing her although I'm not a very direct person.

For anyone who is not familiar with bipolar disorder - basically instead of unipolar depression where you can have ""normal"" phases and depressive episodes, with bipolar depression you have normal, depressive, and (hypo-)manic episodes which go in the opposite direction of depressive eps. When I'm hypomanic, I am mostly in a good mood, I have loads of energy, sleep less, feel more confident and talkative, and my libido skyrockets.

The reason why this is relevant is because after my initial depression (the reason I was inpatient) my mood stabilized and I didn't have any major depressive episodes during the time of getting to know Marie. On the contrary, in November I started becoming hypomanic again (I would now say in hindsight, it is very hard to tell when it starts because it's not as obvious as the depression). I would go on tinder dates to get my mind of her, thinking she didn't like me that way. In hindsight I'm aware that that could have sent mixed signals but, well, that was just the way that I had learnt to deal with my feelings and heightened libido since mid 2019.

Anyways, December comes around and Marie and I end up sharing a kiss one evening. I had kind of confessed that I like her but the next day she tells me that she is unsure if she has feelings for me too or if she just needs emotional closeness because of her depression. She says it would be more wise to wait for her mental health to get better so she doesn't unfairly give me hope. She then said she wanted to just be platonic friends and that I should continue going on tinder dates etc.

I was pretty hurt. A week or so later I was scheduled to go out to a club with a mutual friend of Marie and I but while pregaming we played a drinking game and in the spur of the moment ended up hooking up. I still don't really know why that happened, I don't like her that way at all - I think it was a mixture of needing validation because of the rejection and the alcohol. I didn't tell Marie about it because deep down I knew she would have probably been upset. I thought me feeling guilty was gonna pass, however, two days later, Marie and I ended up actually hooking up. She, I guess, changed her mind about waiting and told me afterwards that she would appreciate if I wouldn't sleep with other people from then on. We weren't dating but kind of exclusive.

I felt pretty shitty about what had happened with the friend and, combined with other stuff that happened, it led to me actually having to go back to the psych ward. The week before that and the first week I was there I was a wreck and actually stopped texting my friends, Marie included. When in January I reached out and apologized I was relieved that she understood. However, she confessed to me that after I completely cut off the contact for 2 weeks she actually ended up kissing 3 different people, some that she met in that time and one that she knew from before. She also said she was curious about potentially sleeping with 2 of the people and asked how I felt about it. I always knew I couldn't have an open relationship so I told her she had to figure that one out for herself but in the end I said that if she just wanted to try it out (she is less ""experienced"" and felt like she needed to explore more) she should and maybe could let me know then. The day after I decided I should also be honest with her about what had happened with our mutual friend.

When I told her she was shocked, extremely disappointed, and immediately wanted me to leave. She said I (and the friend) had lied to her by not saying anything and couldn't believe how we could do that to her. I was confused since it was before we were even exclusive (never mind dating) but she was adamant, blocked me and cut off all contact for a while. Over the next weeks I wrote her two letters, trying to explain my point of view and then decided to wait it out for a bit. February came around and I sent her a message (she had unblocked me) about a concert that she had gifted me a ticket to for my birthday. She responded and we connected again, her starting to ""forgive"" me for what has happened. Then end of February we started dating officially.

\*\*\*Second week of March I went on a vacation back to the states where I used to study to visit my sister and old college friends. One night I stayed over at a friend's house. He liked me back in my freshman year and we always used to joke about it since I came out as bisexual at the end of that year and got into a relationship with a girl which he saw as the ultimate rejection. We ended up drinking and sleeping together. Looking back now it is very surreal since I don't know what exactly made me do it. I partially think I could have been a bit hypomanic again but I definitely don't want to blame this on my disorder since I still make decisions for myself. This hook up has absolutely no romantic weight because I am sure that I cannot develop feelings for guys - I was merely curious what it would be like to sleep with one (it was my first time essentially) and it was a situation in which I knew I could ""trust"" the guy since I have known him for so long. For me it was also definitely a ""one time thing"", I got that curiosity out of my system and that's it.

The weight of what I had done sank in a few days later while I was still in the states. I felt awful, guilty, and regretted having done it. It reminded me a lot of the terrible feeling I felt when I had told Marie about the mutual friend. When I returned from the trip, I had to self-quarantine because of COVID-19 but I also fell into a depressive slump that lasted around a week. Marie reached out but I didn't respond until a week after I had returned. When I texted she immediately came over to see me and told me I should talk to her about what was troubling me. She even said ""you can tell me anything that is weighing you down, even if you had hooked up with someone else or something"" - it caught me completely off guard and I told her no, it was just a normal depressive ep.

Since then I haven't seen her in person because of the quarantine. We have skyped a lot though after my mood improved again. Now that I am back to a normal frame of mind I have spend a lot of time thinking about what I should do. I really do love her and don't want to lose her (even though I know you will probably ask, why did you cheat on her then) but I know the right thing to do would be to tell her and let her decide if she can forgive me or not. The only thing that made me reconsider was something she told me a while back: We have had a few problems with her not being able to get the image of me and our mutual friend out of her head - she is very insecure, fearing I still think about her and is jealous/hurt every time she pictures it. Several friends told me that they wouldn't have told Marie in my position since we were not dating at the time. When I asked Marie if she would have preferred to have never found out, she thought about it and said yes. If it was just that one time, and since she theoretically knows I don't like our mutual friend romantically, she would have preferred I would not have told her.

I suppose my question is now: what would you do if you were in my position? My quarantine ends in 2 days and then I will see her. Should I tell her?

588,"So, first of all, I want to point out that English is not my first language and I use mainly google translator to write here so it can have some mistakes.


On start, I have a sister (23 years old), our relationships are no longer as good as they once were, but apart from one time she have never been terribly rude to me and usually she respected me and did not take my things without my permission.
But recently, shortly after my nieces birth, she began to be more rude to me. From taking my stuff and using my computer without my permission (she made her own account on him despite having her own computer) and slowly pushing me out of the room so much that I have to sleep with my mother on two sofas.
I am still a teenager (16) and I still go to school, so now, when there are a lot of homeworks and online lessons, I need a place where i can do my homework, without screams of my sister's child ( i love my niece but she still can be anoying) and without my sister who doesn't let me sit at my desk because she wants to.
I don't know what to do, I had a few my cabinets and shelves in my room and my desk, but this unemployed parasite took almost all of them! I only have a desk and two small shelves left, apparently she counting on me to moving out first, but before I do it, it will be a while and I'm not going to sit and watch how she rules everything.
I decided to text to her about that, i said that I have enough of her shit, how much she doesn't respect anything (take and drink my mother's drink without even asking, and when my mother take her drink to other place in house because she was cleaning up, my sister made a affair on the whole house, what a hypocrite) and how nice it would be if she stop pushing me out of us room, treated me like shit and started asking me if she want's something mine, because I'm tired of looking for my stuff just by considering that she have them.
I was hoping that she would listen and apologize, and everything ended, but I was very wrong, she called my grandfather, who is very nervous and went to me and shouted with my sister (she was on the speaker) she said how i'm like my mother, that In our house nothing is allowed, that in the fridge it is even signed what food is who (which is not entirely true because only my lactose-free milk was signed) and that my mother is manipulating me (she also does this shit for my mother very often).
I am very weak emotionally, and i easily panic when someone screams at me, so of course I cried, my sister shouted some insults and hung up.
My main question is that I should do something about this and fight for my things and part of the room or wait until I can to move out, and if i should fight for them, how?
And am I right or exaggerating? My family, and in particulary my sister like to remind me everytime when I have a problem that I'm just oversensitive, are they right?",06Apr2020,2

I told him he'd catch a case as a joke , thinking that he didn't know she was underage, and he said it would be worth it. He then made an extremely crude remark about wanting to nut in her. Super gross and honestly maybe I should have blocked him then. That made me quite uncomfortable but the conversation switched quickly so I forgot about it. Then 15 minutes later, in an unrelated topic, I said ""you do you"", and he said ""I'll do \*insert underage tiktok star\* and at that point I blocked him.

He then made another account to ask why I blocked him, and I wasn't going to reply but I thought maybe I should inform him that his behaviour was really creepy and he shouldn't joke about thirsting after underage girls. He basically replied saying that I need to go fuck myself and that I'm ""a \*r word\* with no sense of humour"", and that I was ugly and he'd been humouring me the whole time.

The short version of this question: Am I the asshole for making money selling cotton masks? Even though I'm donating many more and giving them free to first responders and those on the front line or in vulnerable categories?


The long version: My husband is the sole earner in our household and that has worked well for the last ten years. I make some money selling handmade quilts, paintings, and drawings via Etsy and occasionally have had a part time job. He recently separated from the military and is now a new hire employee at a major airline. Because of the pandemic his training pay (about half of what his military pay was) will be our only income for the forseeable future until he can complete training. We have a decent savings but are moving to Utah in July and will use what we can of that on a new house and some badly needed new furniture. Our new insurance doesn't cover our daughter's speech therapy either so we suddenly have a 400 dollar monthly bill that we didn't before. When the outbreak hit I started making masks to donate but quickly realized I couldn't buy all the necessary supplies I didn't have on hand without blowing our new, very tight, budget. I sold some masks to friends and family to raise money to cover the cost. I am closing orders for purchase today because so many people wanted them I haven't had time to make any to donate. I did raise the money I need though. I said I would list some for sale again next week though once I've sewn up all the donated masks. However, since I am not using the funds raised to make donated ones, I plan on selling them at a profit only to myself to help save money for the move.

Important to note: -I won't be using donated money to do this and will use only supplies I have personally paid for.

- I will still make and give them to the above stated categories for free

- I will be pricing them fairly, paying myself approximately $10 an hour for labor plus the cost of shipping.

Am I an asshole? I've seen dozens of mixed reactions on people ""profting off a pandemic."" I don't feel like that's what I'm doing. I'm sewing things for money like I always have. It's just that the things people want sewn have changed.",06Apr2020,1
598,"8 months ago I (33M) got blackout drunk and groped a friend of 10+ years at a party and also asked their partner if I could make out with them. I don't remember it, I found out later. I texted her an apology and didn't say anything else after that. She did not respond. I stopped contacting anyone from that group of 10+ years because I don't feel like I deserve their friendship. I have been beating myself up daily. I am disgusted by my sexuality and am afraid to get close to anyone.

I was dragged to a party 4 months later and she was there. I asked if she was ok that I was there and she said she was fine but didn't want to talk about it right now. I had an anxiety attack and left, I couldn't just drop it and have fun while my self-loathing was raging so turbulently.

A few days ago she texted me in the middle of the night saying she was past it and wants to be friends, and in my half-awake state I made the mistake of asking for her account of the situation because my info on the situation is second-hand. No response. I realized when I woke up the next morning that I had wronged her once again, that I basically asked her to relive her trauma for my benefit, and that she probably just wants to drop it.

600,"**TL;DR:** Attractive acquaintance needs a place to stay, but there's definitely sexual tension between us. I want to help her out, but for the right reasons.

So here's the deal.

Early last year, I met a woman on Tinder, who I will admit is WAY out of my league. Initially there was some attraction, mild flirting and some touching (hands, arms, etc), but nothing sexual. Her life was a mess at that point in time, so I didn't pursue a relationship with her. Instead I helped her out with some stuff. Not financially, more along the lines of guidance and emotional support. After I helped her resolve all that, we kind of parted ways and lost touch for most of the year. We got back in touch this past December and just talked as friends. She seemed to be doing a lot better now, but was still financially unstable.

Well fast forward to now. COVID-19 and she's unemployed. Her son is an toddler and custody is split between her and her child's grandparents. She hasn't filed taxes in the past two years because she didn't meet the threshold to. The grandparents claim her son as a dependent as well. I told her I'd walk her through registering to receive the stimulus check as you really just need a social security number, which she has since she is a US citizen, and be over 18.

Here's my dilemma. I have a small one bedroom and I want to offer her a place to stay if she needs it. However, there's definitely been a lot of sexual tension between us recently. I want to do the right thing, but I also want to do it for the right reasons. Right reasons being that I want to help her out because she's someone that needs help and not because I'm trying to have sex. I really want to tell her that I'm doing this as her friend and that I don't expect anything, nor do I want anything, except just to keep the place tidy.

I know most people will say that if I'm not coercing her and if it's mutual, it should be okay, but I'm honestly not sure if I'm lying to myself or not. What if deep down I'm helping her out to try to get laid? I tell myself it's not the case and I'd like to think so, I don't know what to do.",06Apr2020,4

Hello me and two other friends from the UK are planning doing a road trip across the USA and finish the trip with a music festival (tickets already paid for)

The whole trip apart from the accommodation has been paid for since October, and everything has been planned out around 3 people.

in the last couple of months one of the friends has got into long distance relationship with an american girl they have already flown to each over a few times.

Just recently our friend wants to include his gf for the whole 3 week duration of the trip, this would obviously change certain plans such as accommodation as they would obviously want their own room etc which would bring the costs up. and could potentially alter other plans we have been looking forward to as a group especially for the other friend that not been to the states before.

Obviously we are happy for this relationship and the girl seems nice and get that they want to spend as much time as they can together but I feel if we go ahead with the holiday we are going to have to make a lot of compromises.

I really, really like this guy. I’m 21 and he’s 24. He’s got a good job, is really sociable has lots of friends goes to raves, etc. I have a good job too, sociable but a bit more introvert, tend to be more comfortable going out with just one other person (especially if I’m seeing them and getting to know them).

I think he’s the only guy I’ve ever really chased haha, I’ve known him for a couple years but we never really got to know each other, kinda just someone you had on Facebook. I plucked up the courage and messaged him a couple months ago asking how he was, what he’s up to in life and he reciprocated well :) I asked if he wanted to meet and he was down for it, we went to the pub and was a nice time. Second time we meet a week later, pub again and we went back to his parents house and ended up fooling around and slept together. Nothing about our friendship/relationship was discussed about. Next time we hung at his place again for the evening, watched a movie and then slept together again.

The thing is, in between these times we met, he hardly talks to me online. I’m talking 2 days with nothing. And when he does eventually message, he’ll ask me what I’ve been up to, my reply doesn’t get looked at for another hour when I can see that he’s online. I know that he’s apparently reaaally bad with texting. I did end up calling him out of upset because it was bothering me so much (I wasn’t upset on the phone!) I asked if this was a fling for him or if it was more, because he hardly talked to me in between. I assured him his answer would be okay whatever it is. He seemed quite awkward but did clarify it wasn’t just a fling and when this lockdown is over that we would ‘start dating and stuff’. I mentioned the texting thing and he said that he is really bad at texting, but I said I’d appreciate it if he talked to me more. Since then he has sent me one text everyday around like 6/7pm but I end up still getting left on read when he has the time to post memes on Facebook etc.

My friends suggested that I ‘ghost’ him back, and he does end up sending a second text... but it’s just nothing of substance, we’re not really getting to know each other. I do know that I could start conversations but it’s made me feel like a burden by getting left on read. I don’t know if it’s just the way he is.

He then asked me if i could pay 180 upfront and the rest after he ships. Biggest red flag but my dumbass goes through with it on cashapp, he kept messaging after the payment and after i made the label. He also gave me his home address and name. Is there anything i can do? I also bought the label myself from usps so i need to get a refund on that as well... i have already emailed offer up, since they dont have any other means of contact.I also requested a refund on cashapp to the scammer ,so that wont happen, but it doesn't seem as if cashapp has more options for contacting them.

611,"So I'm gonna keep this short.


I was with this girl for around 6 months and then broke up 'cause we didn't see the relationship going anywhere. I still have feeling for her.


Now (with the corona stuff) she needs a place to stay for the summer and has asked me if she can stay at my place (sleeping on the couch), she says she doesn't have anywhere to go and doesn't wanna be alone.


She would be paying rent and utilities so she wouldn't be staying for free which would really help as we're all in a rough spot with all that's been going on 


My flatmate is ok with her staying but told me that while talking to my ex (they are still friends) she specifically said she didn't want to get involved with me in any way which is messing with my head


On the one hand, I'd like to be a good friend and let her stay, but I can't deny that I'm secretly hoping something happens.


On the other hand, my more rational side is telling me she's just using me cause she knows I still love her (i told her as much when we broke up about 3 months ago) but then again she would be paying rent and wouldn't be just freebasing here.

613,"Throw away account because my other username is obviously traced back to me.  I'm sorry if this is a ramble or a little confusing.  I'm pretty upset right now and not sure what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm having trouble talking to my boss but I'm not sure if it's the way I communicate or just that I'm in way over my head. 

I'm a paralegal and have been for almost a year.  I've had no previous professional paralegal experience but I did take a classes before being hired.  I do have office experience but in a different field.

I really love my boss and my job but I feel like I'm constantly not doing well enough.  It's an extremely small firm in a legal field my classes didn't cover.  I am extremely interested in this legal field and incredibly want to excel.   I know that ambition and my personal goals aren't an issue because I WANT to do and be better.

I'm in charge of a lot of things for the office including mail, organization of our online database, bills, calendar, office supplies, etc. I also fill out a lot of the forms, put together the packages, talk to clients, and other paralegal work.  It can be incredibly overwhelming when things get busy.   


When I first started I didn't really receive any training and had to do a lot of On The Job learning by myself which was very hard.  I still feel like I'm not sure of a lot of the legality of things so during the quarantine I've been trying to do research so I can catch up.  I'm also supposed to be looking into marketing during this time period which has been going okay.

I'm constantly unsure of the priorities of what we are doing in the office.  At the beginning of quarantine it was going great, but previously it was a mess.  

Previously, I would be working on one client and their items for a full day, or doing an admin task I deemed necessary but then find out another client needed something done and have to drop everything.  I would then begin work on said client and rush it because it was needed ""yesterday"" but then the work would be sloppy and my boss would be upset.  Then when I would submit work on the other items it would be sloppy because I didn't look over it enough/  give it enough time Or if it was an Admin/Office task I would even simply put it on the back burner indefinitely because my boss stopped asking about it and the clients were always more important.    
We had come up with the solution that I would send all my legal work to another employee who would then look it over and send it to our boss, but that didn't solve the priority issues and recently I was told to look over the items myself unless my boss directly told me to send items to the other employee.

At the beginning of quarantine I would email all the tasks I had to my boss and listing what the priorities I thought they were in. My boss would then approve it or correct where things were placed.  We had something similar started in the office right before all this happened, but clients needing something done ASAP still came up and threw the system off.    
Now that work is slower it's been harder to do that and I'm nervous to ask for more because I know there must be a client or case I'm forgetting because there's never a quiet time in our field.

An example of some issues I've had are, the database isn't organized in a way easy for my boss to understand so I reorganized it when I first started (and had no idea what I was doing) and it was made worse.  I am constantly reorganizing it to this day, but after much discussion over months there is now a set way I understand my boss wants it done.  But because clients are most important this is an item that has taken many months and still hasn't been fully accomplished which impedes the work we do for clients and is a top priority until a client supersedes it. It's a bit like a vicious circle with the admin/general office work because of this.  
A different issue is because I didn't understand some of the legality I would check the wrong box on forms.  My boss would either not catch it or get upset that I didn't know.  One of our cases had major repercussions because of my lack of knowledge.  Luckily it was able to be fixed and I've learned to read everything five times and double check it all double that.     

I feel like I'm juggling a lot and it's even harder to do outside of the office.  I really admire my boss and the other members of our firm and want to do my best for them but I feel like I'm failing.  Whenever something is wrong my boss emails me in a very blunt way, sometimes it feels like it gets very personal about my abilities.  I don't think they're doing it on purpose but it can get very upsetting and has been effecting my self-esteem with my work.  I'm a very emotional person in general and try to take things in stride but it's been very hard recently due to things outside of the office.  

When we would work together in the office the emails were the same, but in person I felt as if we could discuss things a little easier.  Sometimes my boss would still be annoyed and get upset with me but I felt like it wasn't as personal in remarks.   
 I know that my boss cares about me and wants me to succeed.  I've discussed taking classes, becoming a notary, reading books, and they've always said they would support me in whatever it took.  My health is also very important to my boss and they made sure I was healthy and doing well throughout this pandemic.  

I don't have anyone in the field I trust 100% to give me advice.  I've spoken to a friend who's a lawyer and they've said they're paralegals have different job duties but I feel like they may not understand all my worries as they're not a paralegal themselves.  I want to speak to my boss about my worries but I can get very emotional if I don't practice what I want to say and I don't want to sound immature to them.

I'm just unsure how to talk to my boss about being overwhelmed/unsure about my knowledge on a lot of things.  Now is a very stressful time and it's very obvious to myself that my boss is under immense pressure.  I know a lot of times when she's upset it's not always 100% my fault but it's still upsetting when I receive harsh feedback.  I'm seriously worried though that I might not be cut out for this job.  
I know I'm not in college or high school any more so people aren't always going to be nice and life won't be easy.  What I'm worried most about is that I'm failing the firm by being in a field where I simply am not, and may never be prepared.  I just don't know if it's only myself that's the problem, or if I'm just not communicating to my boss in the proper way.  I'm worried it's always going to be this hard and that I'm simply not made for a job at this stress level.  


Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.",06Apr2020,2

615,"I broke up with my ex a year ago. We were getting married, after 4 years of relationship, but for me things were very discomforting between us.   She was so frustrated and she couldn't deal with her negative emotions, so she was  rude and unfair with me all the time and I couldn't take it any more. She was somehow so hurt inside and I couldn't help enough to move on and change the way she wanted.

 I couldn't carry the relationship the way it was going and I said that I couldn't find any other way out than breaking up. She obviously felt bad, but I didn't see her reaction coming, she couldn't let her pride aside and said ""Let's break up"". Last year, 8 months after the break up I was missing her, I thought that maybe it was time to get a new opportunity with her, she accepted but secretly she wanted to hurt me as much as she could, and things didn't end well... 

I have self esteem problems (obviously) and clinical depression and anxiety, in that moment I was feeling terrible  because other things were not going well in my life, but she gave me a new weight to carry, she hurt me so bad. I had a break down. I was going to commit suicide, but before doing it, I texted her saying ""I'm not looking for you with no other approach than friends. I'm in so much pain that I'm going to kill myself. PLEASE HELP ME"", she answered all kinds of evasives and finally said nothing to help, making sure of giving me the message ""It's not my problem any more"". 

That situation gave me some other kind of strength and I looked for help in a hospital, I almost end up in a mental institution but I started a good treatment with the support of my parents.

I haven't got contact with her since then, but I'm always dreaming about her, because somehow I still miss her and I don't know why, she was nothing but a dead weight to carry in my already heavy bag. I don't know what to do because I'm always arguing with myself, repeating the reasons why I couldn't bare to be with her, but it's like I don't believe it, because over and over I'm thinking all kinds of thing about her. I don't know what to do to get over her, if anyone has some kind of advice, please let me know.

617,"I'm not very good with my words, so if i need to clarify something, I'd happily oblige.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically I'm a shut-in that's spent most of my life in front of a computer screen. When I was little, whenever I would be upset, my mom would tell me she was going to rip my throat out if I didn't stop, and when I confronted her in one of the many arguments we've had, she said ""well, I asked what was wrong."" Just about everyone on my mother's side is extremely racist and believes in bullshit conspiracy theories, especially my mom when she talks about how covid19 is fake, and the people dying from it are just dying from natural causes and it's a coverup, which was the subject of the latest argument last week. Then she brings up how she's :provided"" for me and just guilt-tripping me into thinking I'm wrong.

My parents got divorced about 10 years ago and I've lived with my mom, sister, and brother (brother is mentally/physically disabled) my dad always offers to move in, but expects me to pay bills, which I understand completely, although the stress of moving is one thing, and finding a job that I can actually do and get to/from safely is a bit much when I'm already stressed out constantly. I've a friend in another state that has a room for rent and it actually seems like my best option, but the one and only job I had was working fast food, and I had left due to intrusive thoughts/generall stress. I believe myself to have some form of OCD as I can check off pretty much every symptom of it, but I'm hoping the neuro-psychologist can help

My mother will just yell louder and louder if I disagree with her, and they (sis,mom,gran) all blame my dad as being some sort of a bad influence and how they were ""abused"" by him, and my memory isn't that great but I know damn well that isn't true and my mother's just jumping to conclusions and letting paranoia influence her so that she thinks that she's the victim when she was yelling/swearing in front of us as a kid, one time at disney world I was anxious about my pets back home and said I wanted to go home, and she immediately yanked my arm in the air saying ""i'm gonna break your arm if you don't shut the fuck up"" as she's extremely into disney anything. She also belittles me during arguments, like if I was playing a game, she would say ""What, are you losing in your little game?"" and Lately I've been going to the doctor which started a huge fight after I said I got medication and hearing the same old generic conspiracy theories over and over again and wants me to use homeopath shit instead and belittles me for being on medication and saying stuff like ""i hope you don't have kids/pets"" 

I've had mental problems since I was little, I remember one time I was at a restaurant with them all, and I just screamed out ""Call the police!"" because I had a feeling of imminent doom I think it's called, I couldn't go anywhere without being anxious. My memory's also been horrible and talking to people about problems is difficult for me. I've been going to the doctor for about 8 months now, I think, and the medication is a good bandage fix for now until my neuro-psychologist appointment comes.

One time, after one argument, I just went outside and walked, went to a nearby park and walked til i was exhausted and whatnot, but after some walks, with my confidence being at an all-time high, long story short at another park I meet and talk to a creepy guy who offered to help me in getting some job resumes as the subject had come up that I was trying to look for a job, so i got in his car and we did just that, and I didn't even process what happened and what could have happened, and as soon as They found out, my sister made a joke trying to play it off which is fine, but my mom was yelling in my ear with graphic stuff like ""He's gonna buttfuck you, do you want that?"" something along those lines.

One time my sister physically assaulted me with a sucker-punch type hit scratching me like a cat and drawing blood on my face, I had remembered what someone said about not doing anything and just calling the police, well I didn't have a phone at the time, so I went outside to one of my neighbors that I thought would've helped me, but instead my sister calls grandma and she comes over and smoothes things out with them over ""gods plan"" (the fight started when I was upset with them feeding outside animals, especially raccoons.) and they weaseled their way out of it. I took a picture of myself from that day aswell.

For 2 years I was pretty much paralyzed with anxiety, and I would develop ticks like having to look at something specific and blink a specific number of times, like another time where I was terrified of hackers online so I stepped away from regular video games for about a year and only stuck with browser games.

grandmother, mother, and sister are just the most bigoted, delusional people out there who're extremely racist and everyone's wrong except them and whatnot, and I'm at my wit's end on what the hell I can even do in my position. I have some money saved up from when I worked but that's about it.I also live in Ohio and am on care source through my mother. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel as though I've rambled a bit much, and like I said, I'd be happy to clarify or add anything if need be. I'm so tired of crying, and being afraid and anxious and alone all the time, and the decade of my mental health deteriorating further because I'm apparently just a ""drama queen"" and faking it even with me pleading to be taken to a psychologist during a few arguments which fell upon deaf ears that believe any medical professional is a dirty pill pusher that just shoves pills at you so they get paid.",06Apr2020,2

619,"I´m in first year of high school and in autumn I became friends with one of my classmates. He is really introverted, smart and nice, we had similar hobbies and opinions and we enjoyed spending time together. Over time, he became more unhappy and three months ago he told me that he wants to kill himself. I tried to convince him to not do that, but he started cutting himself. I tried to talk to him as much as I could to make him feel better. He often said that nothing matters to him anymore, that nothing entertains him anymore, that he is ,,drowning in his own thoughts"" and that he really wants to quit this world. Instead of trying to be happy he searched for things that other depressed people posted on social media and made himself more comfortable feeling this way.

As I spent more time with him I became more succesful in convincing him that this is not the right way. He also told his father about his suicidal thoughts. I was happy, he seemed to be happy too. As the quarantine started, he visited me at my house and everything was alright and we had fun. Few days later he told me that the day he visited me had to be the last time we would see each other and that he planned to kill himself the day after that. He tried to but he couldn´t. He realized that he couldn´t do that, so he wanted to ,,shut down"" in other way. He tried to get drunk but he just got sick.

During the quarantine I still try to talk to him but it´s even harder to know what is going on inside his mind. Today I found out that 2 days ago he tried to buy some metamphetamine on some site. I texted him and asked what the hell is he trying to do. He immediatelly started convincing me that it´s not that bad, that it´s not as addictive as alcohol. I got really angry, I texted him that if he really tries doing drugs then I´m done with him. He apologized to me like 5 times and promised that he will never do it again. He seemed to really regret it, although I´m not sure he won´t do it again.

I have no idea what should I do, he doesn´t have many friend and I´m his closest friend (however now I feel more like his parent than a friend). I just hope it´s some teenage depression and eventually it will go away (we´re both 16) but I´m afraid he´ll do something to himself and I won´t be able to stop it.

So near the end of August we went to a different doctor, he said it’s probably just asthma and gave me an inhaler. He also recommended we get a PCP in case we have any more problems and so we did.

Now he’s working 10-12 hour shifts everyday with minimal to no help and is definitely depressed and has expressed “jokingly” how he doesn’t want to be alive. I haven’t heard from him in a week. This has happened before where he just needs some space but max 2 days. I have texted and called and still nothing. Should I go over to his place?",06Apr2020,1
631,"I am really passionate about a lot of things. Most of it has to do with being creative. The problem is I can only seem to be passionate about one thing at a time and have trouble “shifting gears”, if that makes sense.

One day I might be super into becoming a better digital artist, the next day I might be super into making videos, the next I might be super into making music, the next day I might be super into becoming a master at digital marketing. And sometimes, they aren’t even days apart. Sometimes it varies from hour to hour. But regardless of what I’m passionate about in the moment, I don’t give a fuck about anything else. Even if something was all I cared about the day before or a few hours ago, if I’ve already moved on in the moment then it’s like it doesn’t matter to me at all.

This is problematic because it really only leads to me never completing any projects. And being frustrated because I don’t. I couldn’t even make an educated guess at how many projects I’ve started but never finished. I’m 24 and I’ve had this problem to varying degrees for my entire life. When I was younger, I think I assumed it would go away as I got older. But, obviously, that isn’t the case.

In all fairness, it isn’t like it’s something new every day. It rotates between the same like 10ish things. But all 10 of those things suffer because I can’t commit to any of them for long enough to make significant progress. I don’t understand why. How can I trick myself into staying focused?",06Apr2020,1

Over the phone I helped her realize things, I helped her feel better about the situation, and she also called me to get advice on how to improve herself after this break up. three weeks after her breakup, I ended up going through a breakup myself. Even during my own breakup, she still called me everyday talking about her ex and asking for advice. It’s been about two months since all of that, and she still calls me daily. She will call me now just to tell me good morning, she will call me now with nothing to talk about, and she will call me even though she mentioned feeling ALOT better from the breakup. She calls me 1-5 times a day, and it’s starting to drain me. At first I didn’t mind, but now it’s getting to be too much, she lurks on my social media to see when I’m awake to call me, she texts me constantly to see if I’m available for a call, and she still call me when I’m busy.

But I'm still clinging onto the hope that maybe once quarantine is over we'll magically reunite and everything will be fine, thinking with my mind I know this will not happen but subconsciously I guess that's what I'm trying to work towards. It's kind of destroying my self-esteem and it's all I can think about. I don't know how to stop, and even as I'm typing this I'm thinking, ""Naw, you're being stupid.

636,"So I (F19) fell in love with my brother’s best friend (M18). Christmas of 2018 I got a PS4 and started playing with my brother and his friend. We became close, he began messaging me every day and night, remembering all the little details, there was that chemistry there, that kind of thing. And although I knew it was probably a bad idea, I developed feelings (although I know you mostly can’t help it). Anyway, we became quite close and then started sexting most nights last summer which I’d say was a turning point for us. I admitted I had feelings for him, and he didn’t really say much, just that he wanted to see where things went and he thought there was potential. Well summer ended and the sexting just kind of stopped, and I was pretty crushed. We still spoke every day and there was still flirting and chemistry but nothing happened. And then in December it started again and I became infatuated with him. I again explained how I felt, and he said he didn’t want a relationship at the moment. I was heartbroken and confused (yeah I know, I’m naive) because I really felt that we were more than friends, he’d told me he found me attractive and cute and we talked more than we didn’t. 

So I decided right, I’m going to accept the situation and get over him. And that’s what I did, I started to and everything was fine, he said of course we could stay as friends and well...that lasted for all of 3 weeks. He kept flirting with me and the chemistry was still there, it was really hard if not impossible for me to think of him as just a friend. He started FaceTiming me every night just to say goodnight to me and we’d talk for hours. And then the sexting started again, and one day in early February I went round his house and things happened. Up until this point we only saw each other maybe once every three months? But he had just passed his driving test. Then we started seeing each other all the time and it wasn’t only for sex, we’d go on little day trips out and dates (though he never called it that, he even took me out for dinner on valentines) and we acted like a couple and more than just FWB, he would hold my hand and we’d spend hours cuddling in his bed and talking about life. He’s so gentle and affectionate with me, we tell each other everything, he makes me feel so alive when I’m with him, I’ve never felt like this about anyone, and I can’t imagine life without him. I have anxiety and he always listens to me no matter how many times I repeat myself and ask for reassurance. And then the last time I saw him he said he had feelings for me and wanted to be with me, but he wasn’t sure because of my brother, and that he’d think about it. A side note, a few weeks ago my brother started to suspect that something was going on because we were seeing each other all the time and got really pissed at us and ignored us both. We denied it, I wasn’t going to tell him until I knew what this was because we were figuring it out ourselves. But things went back to normal with us all and my brothers friend said he’s not worried about it.  

So anyway, every time I asked him if he had decided yet he would say he was still thinking, and then last week he told me he wasn’t sure if he meant what he had said. I was fucking devastated, I couldn’t comprehend it. After we said goodnight on ft I wrote out a message about how he had really hurt me and that I didn’t believe he didn’t have feelings, i just didn’t believe that he could smile at me the way he does and not have feelings for me. In the morning he said he agreed with me and that he was sorry for hurting me, but he said he agreed we do both have feelings for each other so he was going to ‘have a think’ over the next few days. It’s been a week now and he still hasn’t said anything. I don’t want to keep pestering him but it’s just killing me, and I know he’s not being fair to me. Being friends just isn’t an option for me, I’ve already tried that and it didn’t work. I just don’t know what to do, I love him but it’s causing me so much stress and I can’t keep doing this for the sake of my own mental health, but I don’t want to walk away just yet. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you.",06Apr2020,0
637,"For the past week my friend (whom I met online) has started staying up late or pulling entire all-nighters to game with one of their best friends. It's gotten to the point where they are still awake by the time I wake up, and either get a few hours of sleep or don't sleep until the next night. I tried letting it slide for a few days but I'm starting to worry about their mental and physical well being. At times, they've said they need sleep but still force themself to stay awake for their best friend.

I tried confronting them about it but they seemed to take offence by it. I tried telling them they shouldn't put their friends above their basic needs but they insist I shouldn't get on their head about their own life and that I'm mad they're spending more time with their best friend.

If it's someone really close to me, I get it. At one point of time I was convinced that she just wanted to ruin my relationship. Paranoid, I know. She used to tell me stuff like I'm not pretty enough, photogenic enough, and also that she can analyze my handwriting and say that I'm not open minded. Pretty manipulative and childish. 
I've just been ignoring her existence, but sometimes, she just gets in one of those moods where I'm her ""bestfriend"" and starts saying things like we have to visit that place, this place, remember that day?

Here in Canada, my parents are still greatly expecting me to come back home for Easter. We don’t celebrate, but given that they’re from a small farm community with no (known) cases of it, they’re quite insulated and don’t believe that they can get it. I live in one of the “hotspots” in my province, and they still insist on me coming home. I’m apprehensive; I miss them but I don’t want to spread anything and so I’m left with the task of telling them that I won’t be coming down and they will be very angry.

645,"I’ve never been the best sleeper, but lately it seems like there’s 500 things in the way of getting a good nights sleep. For at least a year I’ve been lucky to get five hours of sleep a night (usually less) and it’s taking a huge toll on my mental and physical health, which isn’t great to begin with. Falling asleep is a minor issue, and I’m usually so exhausted it’s within less than 20min, the real issue is staying asleep through everyone’s interruptions. I’d love to know if anyone has any solutions or ideas to tackle any of these issues. 

Issue 1: I live in a house with other people all of whom “try their best” but still insist on stomping around with shoes on at all hours and doing loud activities regardless of others. I’ve tried talking with them, and a few changes have been made admittedly, but none of the major issues have been, or likely will be, addressed. Moving is out of the question for the time being.

Issue 2: The biggest issue. The floor above me creaks INSANELY loud, and it’s used like clockwork by the only nightshift worker everyday, twice a day, both of which are in the middle of my sleep schedule. I’ve tried bringing up the issue and offering to pay to have it fixed, only to be shrugged off dozens of times. I can’t move bedrooms.

Issue 3: My partner snores! He had a sleep test done a few months ago, but we haven’t heard back yet. We’ve tried MANY anti snore devices, nose strips, head bands, mouth guards, nasal dilators, nose sprays, sleeping positions etc. Nothing seems to work for more than a week tops. Thankfully he bites the bullet and sleeps on the couch a few times a week to give me a chance at some sleep, but it’s not ideal with so many others around, and it makes me so sad!

I have a decent sleep routine in place. I can usually keep my bedroom at a comfortable temperature, and light is basically non existent. I don’t drink a lot of caffeine (one warm drink when I wake up). I’ve tried earplugs but my tinnitus really gets in the way of falling asleep, music or television noise also prevent me from falling and staying asleep. I currently use an air purifier for white noise, and have used fans on and off, which help me sleep through the quieter issues. I can’t take melatonin because of medications I’m on (which aren’t the issue, as I only started them a few months ago). Im worried about taking sleep medications because of dependence and suggested short term use, and the possibility of feeling more groggy and exhausted if they don’t help me sleep through the noises. It is something I’m open to, however. I’ve tried different sleep times to try to alleviate some of the interruptions, but the only quiet hours in the house seem to be the few hours I’m getting now and a few hours midday, which I’ve tried adding on as a nap but I just end up in that gross state of disorientation and nausea. I feel as though I’ve exhausted all of my options, pun intended, I’d appreciate absolutely any ideas.

646,"I got hired at my local grocery store exactly one day before the NBA and Disneyland closed their sweet little doors due to the coronavirus. Everyone’s great, love my bosses and coworkers, we get to sanitize, wear masks, all sorts of good stuff. I get paid $14 an hour too, so thats not to shabby compared to my prior minimum wage college desk job! (At community college currently). 

My problem is that I want two things more than anything else. Time with my family, and a career doing what I love. I have a really awkward schedule at work right now and the amount of extra time I have to dedicate to my online classes eats up the majority of my time. I barely have the energy to crawl into bed at night, let alone work on anything creative for my future. 

My question is, should I keep my head down and bite the bullet? Save up a ton so I have a good foundation? Or should I be cutting down my working hours significantly so I can better my craft and enjoy my time with my family while I still live with them?

648,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 9 months. He is enmeshed with his mom and brother. He works out almost every morning. One morning, I was sleeping over at my boyfriend's brothers apartment and getting ready for a brunch. While my boyfriend and his brother were gone, my boyfriend's mom and my boyfriend's brothers two kids (one child is age 2F and the other child was 6-7 month old) were at the apartment. As I was getting ready, I kept noticing that my boyfriend's mom would lay the baby at the edge of the master bed and just leave to another room, leaving the baby unattended. When I noticed this, I would lay next to him until she came back. The 2 year old has a mini potty in the living room and I went to go sit next to her to make sure she used the restroom. As I am sitting next to her, my boyfriend's mom comes in the living and puts the baby on the corner of the couch and leaves to the kitchen. Immediately, my heart drops seeing that she would just leave him on the couch. As I am getting off of the floor to go attend to him, he rolls off of the couch face first on the carpet. 

My boyfriend's mom runs in the living room to take him out of my arms and mentions ""He rolls off of the bed all the time"". I understand that the master bed has piles and piles of clothes around it for him to fall on, which may not be a big deal if he falls from there but still I don't find that safe AT ALL. She made it seem like she was going to tell my my boyfriend's brother that his son fell off the couch and she never mentioned it to him, which I find really shady because if he hurt himself it could possibly be a problem. When my boyfriend got back home, I told him what happened and he did not give me a reaction, he just left the room in silence. He left for two seconds then comes back and tells me ""My mom said its ok for the baby to roll over on his stomach because he can support his head"". I was in SHOCK. 

From my perspective, it seemed like when he went to confront her about what I said, she twisted the story to make it seem like something else happened to the baby. I was annoyed, but I dropped the situation because we were rushing to get to the brunch and I did not want to create a big scene. This situation replays in my head all of the time, I wish I was more firm in the moment in creating a boundary with my boyfriend's mom and showing her that I was not going to put up with that bull\*&amp;#%. On top of that, the kids always have full diapers and when we are out in public, they are never attended to. My boyfriend's mom and my boyfriend's brother just let the kids roam freely in public and terrorize anything they get their hands on. I immediately thought to myself after this happened, if I ever had a child with her son, I would never want to leave my child alone with her. I don't trust her and rethinking this situation over and over everyday, it's starting to make me not like her; especially because he is enmeshed with her and invites her on our dates (which I told him yesterday, this will not happen again or I am leaving him).

**Was my boyfriend's mom gaslighting me in this situation or am I over reacting? Any advice on if I should re-approach my boyfriend about this situation since it happened last November?** I want a future with my boyfriend but I feel like his enmeshed family will be the demise of our relationship because they all enable each others toxic/unhealthy behaviors and have to be around each other 24/7.

Gaslighting: manipulate (someone) by psychological means into questioning their own sanity. the aim is clear: to confuse and disorient the victim so that the perpetrator can gain total control over them or a particular situation. the more seeds of doubt that can be sown in the victim’s mind, the easier it becomes for the perpetrator to dictate every situation to their liking.",06Apr2020,1

Phone: Galaxy S9 no memory card just the 64g that comes with the phone.

Ive never had a virus on my phone before but this sure seems like one.
A little while ago I was getting adds on my phone. On the home page, in my gallery, basically not coming from any game or app I had open they would just appear and if I hit the menus button to bring up open apps it would disappear.
That was annoying for a while, I deleted some sketchy apps that could be causing it and it stopped.

Lately Ive been getting Full Storage alerts
I take a lot of videos and photos so this is kind of a problem, I figured it was just time to clear out some old stuff. Only I did and it hasnt stopped. According to my storage my photos and videos take up only 200MB of storage. The biggest files it can find to suggest deleting are audio recordings of some dnd sessions that are 25mb

All my storage is being used by some mysterious ""other"" my phone wont let me access or cant seem to categorize.
Ive deleted apps, screen shots, even cleared the cache on all my apps. Now Im certain its a virus because I just tried shooting an 18second video. I did a couple takes no problem but it was still not quite perfect so I delete the old take and start recording again. I just made 18 second worth of video and deleted it, but when I hit record I get a Not Enough Storage notification and it refuses to let me record.

650,"I live in a 3 bdrm apartment with 2 other girls. Our lease is up in early June, and only one of the girls Sarah, we'll call her, is renewing her lease and staying in the apartment. Sarah found 2 new girls to move in with her. They'll be moving in the week after we leave. I haven't signed any papers to renew my lease. By the time they move in, I will be legally free of my lease and shouldn't have to do anything more. 

Our leasing office is requiring my other roommate and I to sign a ""Roommate Release Form"" that, in their words ""legally frees you from the lease and allows Sarah's new roommates to move in. It gives us permission to remove you from the lease."" Referencing the RRF that my other roommate filled out,   ""on the date of 6/7/2020 (the literal day that our lease is up) we allow X person and Y person to take over the lease."" On the form, it also requires us to sign that we forfeit out security deposit to Sarah's new roommates. 

I'm so confused. Why do I have to sign a form that gives Sarah's roommates permission to move in when THEY'LL ALREADY BE FREE TO MOVE IN. I will no longer be on the lease, I shouldn't even have a say in whether or not they can move in. My understanding is that a Roommate Release form is for a person to be released from a lease, prior to the ending of the lease."" That is not the intention here. I also don't feel like depending on people I don't even know to send me my security deposit. God forbid there's any issues with it.. they won't be legally required to pay me due to the fact that I'll have forfeited it. I can't imagine that typical ""protocol"" for these situations is to rely on strangers to ""just Venmo you"" and for people that are moving out anyway to sign a document that doesn't make logical sense. 

Let's say I don't sign it....no other roommates will ever be able to move in EVER? I'll be free from the lease and they just won't allow Sarah to ever have any other roommates...even though I'M NOT ASSOCIATED with the lease after June 7th? WHAT?? 

The signed form is due tomorrow, Sarah is being a bitch about me not coming over while the notary was over at our apartment yesterday to sign off on the form (i'm not staying at my apartment right now because my roommates aren't taking COVID seriously &amp; I'm immune suppressed). I chose not to come because I hadn't heard back from the leasing office, me signing this makes no fucking sense and I'm too scared to leave quarantine.

I am not totally sure this is the right subreddit to post this but since this issue is directly related to human relationships i think it makes sense. Thank you for your serious and helpful advices already. Me and my wife are both professional business people and run our own company,which is one of the most-popular architecture companies where we live. So i can say that we are also well-known people. For the last 5-6 years,we have been into BDSM and hotwifing lifestyles,numerous kinks and enjoying this very much so far. We have invited many single men into our bedroom and discretion and privacy has always been on the top in our criteria. We have never faced any problem threatening our social/professional lives and safety so far and made perfectly sure nobody in our lives is aware of this. 

Two days ago though,when i was texting with a guy who could be possibly our next partner on WhatsApp, i texted a message revealing totally our lifestyle and kinks to my employee,thinking i texted the guy. I even wanted to see a NSFW pic. It took me a couple of minutes to realize this and it was too late because my employee was online and saw the message. He just said ""I guess there have been a mistake"" and nothing more. I got really nervous and deleted the message,even though it did not mean anything. I did not text him back. Now,officially my employee is the only one in our lives who knows about this side of us. Me and my wife have huge anxities regarding our privacy. 

&amp;#x200B;

The thing is that he is a guy who is too smart to believe any lie we can produce. So i even do not want to try it. He is a very respectful educated man and i am definitely content with his professionality. I do not think he is going to threaten us with anything or blackmail us,but this is making me nervous.

658,"A month or two ago I was serving at a restaurant. When the corona virus started spreading my hours were cut bad but my friend worked at a loan office and convinced me to apply. After a very short amount of time I was hired on. I have never worked at a loan office before and have been extremely scared I won’t have what it takes. And now everyone is scared about money with the corona so it is difficult to get people in the office to file for a loan or to pay their loan. I do feel I have adjusted a lot more to the different work atmosphere, but my boss was talking with the other manager trainee this morning saying I haven’t gotten a lot resolved. I feel I have done an okay job other than being sent to voicemail 1000 times. But I was wondering if there’s anyone who can tell me how I can get people in to pay and make loans. So many people have told me they don’t wanna get out of their house, but I assure them we’ve been using germ x disinfecting everything.

659,"UGH im so mad at myself, i have a history of repeating self sabotaging practices with my one close guy friend. each time he has forgiven me but not after we have fought a ton over text and call, sometimes leading to silence for a few days and overall feeling tense in the relationship afterwards. he really means everything to me and his forgiveness has made me want to try again and again and i thought i finally had it down... everything was so good, in my personal life /internally and our frienship.

well this weekend on friday he had somewhat suggested we should do edibles but i felt like he was beating around the bush and not really seem to be interested and would respond like 2 hours after every message (probably cause he was gaming). so it didnt happen and i swallowed my frustration (did not start anything) and he said tomorrow then. 

so saturday we chatted a little then i asked when he wanted to hang out, he instead asked me when do i want to? and i said idk maybe soon what are you up to and he said nothing just gaming. for whatever reason it felt like uninterest or rejection (still trying to get this logic) and i changed the topic. later he says well let me know when ur free.

around 5 i asked if he wanted to hang out but he didnt respond to me until 7:30 which in that time i got anyry and decided it wasnt happening as i told him i hate being kept waiting. i told him i dont want to anymore and he told me he cancelled plans so we could hang out and i got really angry and we fought. overall my point was that i felt like he expected me to intiate everything and i just didnt get the feeling was mutual. (???im dumb fuck) during that time he was working on his masters application, i dont think he did anything on purpose and yesterday morning i apologized and then we talked like regular but im still feeling so sad about it and regret it so much fuck why do i keep fucking self sabotaging things when there good like this isnt the first second or third time ive done this shit. fuck. now my mental is scattered and UGH FUCK how do i stop being like this??? i dont want to hurt him anymore i dont want to start shit anymore im super upset",06Apr2020,1

663," 

My cousin (Ill use the name Joe in place of his real name) is having a baby within the next couple days with his girlfriend. I hate Joe because of thing's he's done to me in the past that I simply can't let go of. He probably doesn't even know that I'm mad over these things which is why I'm having so much trouble letting go. Nobody in my family knows that I have a chip on my shoulder besides my mom. My mom and I just got into a huge argument because I refuse to contact him and say congratulations on being a father. She hates that I hate Joe and it really upsets her that I won't let go of the past.

I used to idolize my cousin when I was a kid. I'm not sure why I just looked up to him because I always thought he was really cool. I even picked up the trombone when I picked an instrument in school because he played the trombone.

Over the years he became an asshole. Got into bad shit. Even got kicked out of his house for a bit. I forgot what the conversation was about, but at some point we got into an argument on facebook messenger years ago. I was really young like 14 or 15. In this argument he told me I'd never get laid and that I would be like the 40 year old virgin and that if he wanted to he could rip me in half because of how strong he was. He was a real piece of shit. The 40 year old virgin thing really messed with my head. When I started seeing girls I was so focused on proving him wrong that I ruined relationships because I only cared about the sex part and not about the actual relationship because of what he said to me. When I lost my virginity I just thought ""fuck you Joe"". I proved him wrong.

Fast forward a few years and he joined the USMC. He changed a little bit, but deep down he was still a dick I could tell. A few years ago he visited our house from Florida. I hadn't seen him in years. I was dating my ex at the time and I felt hesitant about being friendly with him. But my ex persuaded me to put my ego aside and to give him another chance, so I did. We actually had a really fun time while he was there. He was with his current gf.

After he left I was really happy that I finally let go of the past. Like a heavy weight off my shoulders. A week later I'm laying in bed with my ex and she tells me I have to tell you something, but I really don't want you to be upset. I was like okay.. She told me that while Joe was there he privately asked my ex if she could get him any weed and asked her not to tell me. I wouldn't have even given a shit about the weed. But the fact that he asked my girlfriend to lie and keep secrets from me? That just showed me that he didn't change and that I was right about him all along.

To this day I still feel a lot of anger and hate towards him and I refuse to text him to congratulate him about his baby. My mom is really upset that I can't let this go and she's getting mad at me for it. I'm not sure how to move forward. I don't think I can let it go without him knowing about what he did to me. Right now would be terrible timing to talk to him about it because he's having a baby and that's just bad timing. Telling him how I feel also runs the risk of ruining my relationship with my Aunt and Uncle (who im very close with) because he may tell them. So, I guess I'm asking for advice on how to move forward.

TLDR: My cousin was an ass when I was younger. Really messed with my head. I forgave him, but he was a dick again. My mom wants me to forgive him, but I dont want to.",06Apr2020,1
664,"on mobile, obligated to apologize. this is also probably the stupidest question i’ve asked in my entire life. 

i’ve never had an issue with food, i’ve always ate normally, and i’ve always had a good relationship with it. recently i’ve been going through some rough times and i’ve found myself feeling a little nauseous. 

the past week or so i’ve found myself craving food and then feeling repulsed when it’s sitting in front of me. there are days where i barely eat at all because my body just doesn’t feel like it. i get hungry, make myself food, and then take a few bites and i don’t feel full, i just simply don’t want to eat after. even my favorite dishes now just taste wrong and i get a pit in my stomach while eating. i’ve been trying to force myself to eat for sustenance.

If being shut-in for two weeks has taught me anything it's that I can't continue living with my parents (and there six cats) any longer. So alas, the time has come for mommy's boi to leave the nest! So with my income of 34,000$ a year I set out. I have my apartment search narrowed down to two and can't decide, hopefully you guys can weigh in and make me feel better about making a decision. 

A)

Apartment A is 750$ a month, tenet is responsible for electric only with electric stove and baseboard heater.  Looks nicer, would give me an extra bedroom, is five minutes closer to all my hot-spots IE work, GF's apartment, gym, supermarket. It's also the 2nd/Middle floor.

B)

Apartment B is 500$ a month, tenet is responsible for electric only and is gas stove with central air. It doesn't look as nice as A and is a little farther away from things. It's a 2nd/Top floor.

So basically I'm trying to decide if the nicer looking apartment and slightly better located apartment A is worth paying the extra 250$ a month for. Let me know what you guys think. Thanks!",06Apr2020,1

I really appreciate having friends willing to help, but there's logistical challenges, and my injury/pain on its own is stressful.  I still have a room elsewhere, but bc of the crutches/pain would need to hole up in there with a bunch of protein bars which isn't the most comforting idea. Everyone in this house has had some sort of mental health challenge, but I wasn't aware my friend has bipolar 3 and narcissism. Last night we got into a ""fight"" because I was applying for a job and he said I've only ever been laid off for 3 weeks in my life and I responded, ""that's lucky"". It wasn't really meant to mean much, but he got defensive and said it was hard work. I didn't have an opportunity to respond during the conversation, but if I could if I would have said, that is a combination of both hard work, anf luck that you happen to like a high demand field (IT/software). Similarly you could say I have worked hard and had some bad luck. Anyways besides the point. Literally all I had the opportunity to say was that's lucky, and then I tried to use non-violent communication to calm him down and explain maybe this argument would be more productive tomorrow bc I assumed the only issue was that he was on mushrooms, taken purposely to clean a lot. It's the next day, and he's still cleaning, btw.  Calming him down didn't work. Later his wife came in and explained he had bipolar 3 and basically don't talk to him much when he's like this. I asked how to predict it and didn't get an answer, and asked if when he starts arguing a bunch if that's it and she said that's a good indicator.

I feel uncomfortable. I don't like not being able to talk in a conversation. I don't understand his intense emotional reactions. Advice? Clarity on bipolar 3 and how to talk to someone manic? I tried setting a boundary last night not to talk to him when he's like this (for me I meant on mushrooms) but now I know that mood is actually part of him I feel less clear about how to tell when he's like that and how to enforce that.",06Apr2020,1

673,"Long story short, we are supposed to give Zoom presentation on our own topics to the class, with 45 minutes allocated per person, out of which 10-15 are for the feedback given by another person (it is clearly stated in the course instructions). Since the number of students is odd, one student got the whole lecture to his presentation. I was convinced the whole thing would take 45 minutes, like for others, but he kept talking and talking, and our female professor simply kept commenting on the presentation with no attempt to move on to the feedback. Then, the feedback student talked almost until the whole 1,5 hour lecture time was over. Still, the professor simply threw in her five cents every once in a while and let them have their discussion with all the other students awkwardly staring at their screens and watching these men getting off from the sound of their voices.

After the lecture, I wrote an email to the professor, asking why these people got twice as much time as everyone else. She replied that it indeed went ""a little"" overtime and explained why along the lines of ""You know, J. is talkative, and N. is always detailed in his feedback"".

I am posting here, because I wonder if this is a gender issue (males taking up the space). Those men really looked like they are getting off from the whole class watching them speak and seemed to enjoy hearing themselves speak. However, maybe the fault is in the teacher, who simply didn't stop enthusiastic students in time? I need some perspective here.

I would never feel comfortable to go overtime and have other students listen to my project. But again, is it because I have been socialized not to take up space or because I am a decent human being and respect others?",06Apr2020,1

675,"This is really hard to say and a long read so I'm sorry but  don't know who to ask for help and I have a fear, from what I've seen, that my older  brother who is 25 might be molesting my 4 yr old baby brother. 

There's a lot to unpack. First my brother has schizophrenia and has been and out of hospitals since he was 17. He has no friends, stays home and really does nothing. He thinks the Illuminati is controlling his brain and the world and that he was chosen to be a great rapper/singer one day. He has never had a girlfriend that I know or a relationship with a girl really. He's always been shy and quiet and it makes me sad that he has no friends and just has our family. 

When I was around 4, an older boy took me and the same brother out to ""play"" at night with my mom's permission and he was well known. The boy took down my pants and molested me, I blacked out after that but my brother was there and I don't know if he remembers or if the boy did anything to him but that severely fucked me up and might have fucked him up too. Especially bc I told my mom and she didn't report it and when I was being hospitalized for depression 4 yrs ago for being sexually abused she got defensive and said that if he didn't put ""it""-his penis- inside of me it shouldn't have affected me. So I don't think know how to speak with her about it. 

My baby brother is 4, isn't potty trained yet and has had trouble using the bathroom. He would cry out that it hurt to poop and pee and would complain constantly. My mom told me that he pooped on the floor recently. 

My baby brother and older brother have a weird relationship, they're super close and it's like my baby brother depends on him. By older brother buys him a lot of stuff and doesn't discipline him like he's trying to buy him. My baby brother would talk about a secret that he couldn't tell me and my older brother would laugh and say and whisper to him ""yah the secret"" and I would pry about it and they both would say they didn't know. 

Yesterday I brought my baby brother a toy from McDonald's and apparently you can clip it to your pants. My older brother asked him if he wanted to put it on him. I saw him struggle for while and pull his pants towards him revealing his underwear or possibly pulling his underwear and revealing his gentials...he said ""oops sorry"" and my baby brother laughed saying, ""you're funny {his name}"" which really freaked me out bc I kind of thought he thought it was a game? After he struggled more he said "" I want daddy to do it and took it to my dad who got it on faster"". 

Ive tried forgetting about it but I can't and it's bringing me a lot of stress and honestly making me so depressed and suicidal bc how awful is it to have this thoughts about your own sibling? He already has no friends and has had no sexual experiences and if I'm wrong I'm a piece of shit but if I'm right then I'm scared to find out the truth. 

I don't live with my family, I live with my partner so these are things I've noticed since I've moved out 6 months ago. I was thinking of moving back in just to keep and eye and take care of my baby brother since I know my mom won't ever realize anything and I also don't want to involve my other siblings. 

Any advice is really appreciated. I'm going to start seeing a therapist bc maybe I'm paranoid and crazy but from what I've read and seen it seems like it's could be a possibility and since moving out I'm seeing things that I was too close to see before?",06Apr2020,1
676,"Life started to finally go my way recently and lately all I can think about is it going away due to something bad happening to me. I told my concerns to some professionals (legal professionals, medical professionals, etc) and they all said I had nothing to worry about. Still I worry about the worst happening. I think it's important to prepare for the worst rather than hoping for the best. I'm so afraid of my life changing again for the worst. I'm afraid of losing everything.

To sum everything up:

I had spent some time only in public with a woman who may or may not have lied about her age. She told me she was 18. We never did anything sexual. I saved my entire text conversation with her which never had anything sexual either. I later found out that she may have lied about her age but at that point we stopped talking to each other. Legal experts told me that since nothing sexual happened nothing bad will happen. She was really fun to talk to which is what drew me to her in the first place.

I fooled around with a woman I used to spend time with. She was naked and dry humped me until I came while I had my underwear on. I'm afraid she could be pregnant yet the medical advice I received says it's near impossible to get pregnant this way.

I'm afraid of someone making false accusations about me, taking me to court, and potentially losing everything. I know that I have done nothing wrong and have proof but I still worry.

So I don't have as much sexual experience as I should have (should have is used loosely here). I've had/have 2 sexual partners total (one night stand and a very loving girlfriend).

I had a follow up with her the next week scheduled in advance but I had no intention of going. I thought to myself if she can miss appointments last minute, why cant I? She works 12 hours a week.

The day before my appointment comes and I cancel last minute. I didnt even bother rescheduling for the following week. I was angry at what had happened the previous week when she had one of her receptionists had called be because she would be ""out of office."" I had a follow up with her scheduled in advance in three weeks. I didnt really care at the time what happened with this relationship.

She calls me the the week that I didnt reschedule and asks me how Im doing. I say that Im good and have just been busy. I was nervous and forgot to mention that I had a follow up with her scheduled in advanced three weeks ahead. She says that she noticed that I had canceled our last appointment and asked if ""it"" had anything to do with my copayment. I said that it was a big issue and that I had lost my job and day x was my last day and that I was waiting on a relief plan with them which I had gotten literally fifteen minutes ago. She said that she would get back to me and see If I could get my copay waived.

She called me when she said she would and I purposely didnt answer the call. I knew that she would have really important information and I wanted it to go to voicemail so that I can play it back and make sure that I get every detail because I zone out a lot because of my anxiety. She was going to waive the copayment.

My recent session with her included me talking about how broke I was over the phone. Tricking her into thinking that I dont have money. She isnt stupid though and she knows that I have money because I talk about how many baseball cards xboxs and other crap that I always buy that I dont need. I actually didnt think that they were going to waive to copayment. How could they?

Now the office is saying that I have to pay despite what my therapist had told everyone including me about waiving the copayment.

Before jumping to conclusions safety wise, I always remove all metadata, never share personally identifying info, never speak, and never show my face.  

So, ever since I was a little kid, I've always been a bit masochistic. My parents never used corporal punishment and I've never been abused or neglected. I have a very loving family that is very supportive of me. I remember my dad reading me the Draco the Dragons book and feeling butterflies on the part where it talks about him getting a spanking. When I was around 10, I started spanking myself. The only porn I've ever been able to get off to is shit you find on Heavy R. 

Anyways, here is the part where shit gets real, so trigger warning maybe. During this whole coronavirus thing, I've been bored and have had nothing to do really. I started reading  bit more ""kinky literature"" and did other more mundane things. Ended up finding my way to the dark web and all was normal for a week. Made sure to stay off any no-no sites. Just browsed things that seemed interesting (e.g hidden answers, people confessing to being hitmen, etc). One thing lead to another, down one rabbit hole, out the next, and I was in contact with a guy who claimed to be a ""dom"". This felt sorta like my thing. That's kind of where I am now, I guess.

They have done the bare minimum it seems just to keep their image in the public's eye positive.While the bonuses given to employees is hardly reasonable , I do not qualify for any bonuses or raises or additional compensation for working directly with the public due to my hire date being a week and a half from the cutoff. I expressed my concerns with my manager, who supposedly brought it to the district manager ,but I don't expect to hear anything back. 

Essentially my problem is that I do not know what to do. Is having a job, but not being compensated for the risks I take better than walking out on a situation that isn't right and losing my only source of income ?

I am 19 years old if that makes any difference.",06Apr2020,1
682,"Hi. This guy has been looking into my eyes and staring at my face when we see each other in the hall for a year now. Giving me some flirty stares, turning back to look at me, sometimes smiling from far away. 

I didn't give him signals other than staring back and being around more.

We don't talk at all. 

Recently my friend found out he had a girlfriend. He was single until recently.

And that'd be perfectly fine but he still literally looks at my face whenever I'm around, like I enter a room and he's the first to look at me. 

He also looks like he knows something is up and I *could* like him...

Backstory: Education facilities have been suspended for almost 1 month due to Coronavirus in my country, so it almost has been one month of quarantine. I am living in a rural area, I don't go anywhere beside a small store nearby and occasionally walk in yard.

I am little bit paranoid and sorry if I make a fuss. Since morning, I've started to feel sore in my throat. Now my mom says she will call doctors to test me for Coronavirus. I don't have any breathing problems or temperature. Should I object to this?",06Apr2020,1

Problem that I haven't brought up to him yet, because it feels  like a weird thought:
I have a 9 year old cat who I have a strong bond with, and I'm afraid a puppy will change that.
The cat grew up with a dog in his life so he's okay with dogs, but it took a while for him to get around to being the cuddly lovable cat I know today.

689,"First of all Any comment would be appreciated. If you read all of this I really appreciate it. Just to let you know some traits about me is that I’m clingy and I have separation issues and I’m kind of a sucker for attention but I don’t show it. Anyways, Me (18) and my gf (18) (3 months in) have been having some bumps in our path lately. The last time I saw her was about a month ago. When we’re physically together there’s absolutely nothing but love. However ever since I’ve seen her we’ve had problems. 

The first problem we had was about a family friend that she had done stuff with a while back. He likes her and still probably does and talks bad on me even though I’ve never met him lol. He called me a tool to her and insulted me. However I can’t say anything to him or have a problem with him because me and my gfs future would be at risk if that happened. She luckily is very trustable and shows me everything they talk about, if they do talk (they don’t talk really they had to hangout a couple of times with fam before quarantine). I would always feel off if he encountered her or anything like that but I’m not going to let him come in the way anymore and I told her that and I’ve fixed myself ever since but the other night he called her at 3am and I was right there because we were on FaceTime and he apparently disrespected her and was being rude to her. So ofc I got mad at him. Any boyfriend would. I’m protective that’s just how I am. 

Another problem was me opening up to her. I haven’t really opened up to anyone about anything too much. But she didn’t like it when I didn’t open up to her and I didn’t not like opening up to her. Opening up to her helped me a lot because she gave me comfort and my feelings wouldn’t have to be bottled up. So lately I’ve been opening up more. 

the next problem that happened was regarding her responding late. Responding late really isn’t a problem to me as long as she tells me what she’ll be busy with before if she can. If not I understand too but it would be helpful. She understood that but she mostly had a problem of why I was letting it get to me when I knew her strict family habits and school work. So we don’t have that problem anymore I understand and give her her space now when it comes to school and family but she doesn’t always text me before she does anything which bothers me but maybe it’s just something I have to get over? 

Recently shes been having a problem showing her love and stuff to me because apparently it’s always been a problem for her and a lot of people have left her because of it. But I’m in love with her and she’s in love with me. You would think that maybe shes losing feelings but we’ve basically declared that we both want to be together for a long time. Remember how I talked about me opening up? Well yesterday her parents were mad at her for something and she didn’t come to me but instead she was just off and unusual the whole day. It’s like she won’t show me love if she has something going on and will shut down. She said the reason she didn’t tell me is because she didn’t want to burden me and complain. I told her yesterday that you need to open up to me I’ve never made it seem like you can’t I will always take care of you and your feelings and never get tired of your problems or whatever it is you need to talk to me about. 

We both cried together on FaceTime. She cried because she doesn’t think she deserves me and I assured her that she does and that I chose her for a reason. She’s shown me more love than anyone has and she makes me so happy. I mostly cried because I feel like these problems wouldn’t have really happened if this quarantine wasn’t a thing. I feel like we’d be stronger obviously and I hate the fact that some quarantine is distancing us. Btw the distance is 3 hours so it’s a short drive. But she said she just needs to work on being able to open up and express her feelings and I told her I would be there every step of the way to support and help her. Are other long distance couples  having rough patches rn? Any advice to give? Any comment would be appreciated!

TL;DR: me and my girlfriend are having issues that we haven’t really had since the last time we’ve seen eachother which was ab a month ago. How can we deal with this during this difficult time?",06Apr2020,1

I am slightly worried; the email isn't connected to anything too important, but I don't like the idea of someone gaining access to my account.

691,"So I'm a male in highschool and I work at a snocone stand. It's a very simple job and pays minimum wage with a $0.25 increase per ""season"" each season is roughly march to November weather is what changes this. Currently there are 9 employees my boss and my manager, aside from my bosss who deosnt work at the stand I'm the only guy. I get paid $7.50 and hour over been there for 2 ""seasons"" when I started I worked my hardest because I needed to prove myself I was the only guy hired in a while from what I understand. Apparently the last guy to work there groped one of the girls that worked there and she punched him, that is just what I heard I dont know the full story. Now I had worked at a snocone stand before when i was 12 or 13 so I already knew what I was doing so I kept my head down and did my work. 

   After a few months people start quitting and it got to the point where there was only 2 of us worked there,  then the ""season"" ends. So this ""season"" begins and he hires a lot of people the girl who worked there with me last year gets $7.75 I'm getting $7.50 she only worked there a few months before me not a whole season we should both be getting $7.50. She said that she was looking for a new job and our boss wanted her to just work at the snocone stand so he offered $7.75 and now she gets payed that much. 
   
   Now here is where I need advice, part of my job that no one else does is to make ice we have a machin that is made up of 4 rows of 7 cubicles. So what I do is fill up bags with 10 pounds of water reach to the pack place them in and go down the rows, wait 36 hours and take them out as 10 pound blocks of ice which really isnt that heavy, but I have to do this while serving snocones so I'm constantly going back and forth. And doing this over and over again my back hurts like I have a hard time standing it hurts. I do this depending on the week up to 3 times. We have to make sugar water 50 pound bags again it's not that heavy but if I'm working I'm expected to lift the bags. Anytime my manager brings stock like the sugar I have to go get it. So me and my mom.just talked about it. I feel like I'm being walked all over at work and I want to ask for a raise. She says I should leave it alone and I haven't gotten a chance to talk to my dad about it. So should I even ask for a raise and if I do how should I go about it.

694,"Basically my neighbour has gone nuts. They have played loud music before, but it was no where near this frequent or loud.

Now, the issue isn't just the volume, it's the bass as well, I can feel the music through the floor.

I've tried recording with then Samsung voice recorder on my phone, but it can't capture the bass. You can see the lines in the recording being high, but you can't hear it if you play it. 

Essentially, I wanted to know if there is any good way to record it so I can show the landlord.

696,"Been with my GF for 2 years. Tensions have been running high due to the pandemic, and yesterday she was really annoyed and frustrated at life and decided to take it out on me. She started a fight that I didn't want to have, so she kept prodding and provoking until I simply didn't want to be around her at all. I told her that I was leaving the apartment and didn't want to be around her until I've calmed down.

She followed me to the door and was making me out to be overreacting. When I opened the door to leave, she grabbed my arm and tried to get me to stay. I REALLY didn't handle that well, so I rushed out the door and yelled at her ""Don't fucking touch me!""

I went to the elevators of the apartment and waited for it to come. Meanwhile she followed me there and was demanding I talk to her and explain why I'm leaving. Once the elevator came I got in and then she put her hand between the door to prevent it from closing! I was freaking out at the time because she wouldn't let me leave and I wasn't going to push her away. Finally the elevator started beeping and the door closed despite her hand being there so she finally let it close.

I left for a bit and ended up coming back later and we talked it out. She still thinks it's partially my fault that I didn't give her the peace of mind when I left.

I'm not really sure what to think of this whole incident yet... it definitely made me uncomfortable though. What do you guys think?",06Apr2020,1
697,"So context on the story. I met this girl at a party let's call her Alisa and the second girl will be Britany.  And let's call Alisa's room mate Katie.

So Alisa and I have been friends for a while well, a couple of weeks ago Katie invited me over. We were going to watch movies and hang out.

Well Katie fell asleep, and alisa decided to make a move on me and we ended up having sex. After that I had talked to her and asked if we were going to have sex, I'd like for it to just be between us and if she had sex with anyone else then for her to tell me.

I liked alisa and she said she liked me too, but she wasn't ready for a relationship which was fine with me, I had accidentally used the word exclusive and it really freaked her out thinking I was going for something she wasnt looking for.

She wanted some space for a couple of weeks and we didnt talk, I asked her a little after what we were (friends, friends with benefits, not friends) just wanting to know what was happening. I didn't want to lose her as a friend because shes really sincere.

She said we were just friends and to drop it, so I did. I started talking to britany and we really hit it off, shes really funny and I have a great time with her. We havent met yet due to the pandemic but it seems like shes into me, and she wants to take me out after all this is over.

Well Katie told alisa that I was talking to britany, they dont know eachother or anything. Alisa started sending me good morning messages on snap chat and started messaging me everyday. I would kinda look at them but not really respond because she only started doing that when she found out I was talking to britany.

So katie invited me over again, and I was like why not we could actually watch movies and eat pizza and hangout this time.

Well Alisa was very adamant about getting alcohol, Katie already said she didnt want to drink and I said I didnt want to either. But she wanted me to drink with her, so she got alcohol.

We were drinking and Katie is out of the room and alisa looked at me and said, yeah we can be friends with benefits. She said she wanted to have sex. I was about 10 shots in, about 30 minutes into drinking (she wanted to go hard I think because she wanted to have sex...) I told her I had to use the restroom, she pushed me against the wall asking if she could kiss me. I was kinda looking away from here and telling her no. She pushed me on her bed and kept asking why I wouldn't have sex with her or I wouldnt kiss her.

I went to the restroom, came back and she tried kissing me again. At that point I told her honestly, i didnt want to have sex with her and i didnt want to kiss her. I told her she said she wanted to be friends and that's what I was trying to be. She broke down crying telling me about her past relationships, how she hasn't had sex with anyone but me. How she could have had sex with other guys but she didnt, she said it was my fault that she wanted me so bad. About how nice I am and how I would be good in her life but shes afraid of me because of all the bad that's happened in her life.

I told her I'm very sorry for everything that happened in her life, but I just wasnt interested anymore. I told her how I was talking to britany and I didnt want to do anything with her because even though we're not dating or anything like that, I only like to talk to one person at a time.

Alisa looked at me and said well you're not dating, you didnt promise her anything so why wont you do anything with me tonight. You havent even gone on a date with her, so what's the issue. She pushed me back down and tried kissing me again, I was pretty tired and drunk so I couldn't think straight anymore. I guess I just kinda let it happen because she just kissed me at that point. When I sobered up I felt horrible, like i cheated even though I'm not even in a relationship.

I dont want to do that stuff anymore with alisa but I dont want to hurt her feelings, i feel like she really needs a friend there with her. But I dont know if I should continue trying to be there for her. I really want to see where things can go with britany and I, but i don't even know if i should since i had sex with alisa...I dont know what to do or how to feel about this whole situation..

701,"My girlfriend and I have lived with another couple for a little over a year now. We started last April in an apartment and have now began a new year long lease in a house starting in March. In the apartment, the roommate situation was a little shaky, but it ended up okay. Immediately after moving into the house, everything turned terrible and we've since resorted to locking ourselves in our room when not working in every attempt to avoid them and their toxic attitude. Details of the last year:

The male from the couple has been close acquaintances for probably 8 years now. We moved into an apartment with him and his partner because we knew both of them somewhat well and thought all would be fine. It was fine for a few months. They got a cat which we welcomed with open arms, etc. Then about 4 months into the lease, we asked about getting a dog. In person they were very open, but the partner of my friend went on a rant on her private twitter about how she would fight us if we got a dog, ""f\*\*k my roommates,"" ""i'm moving out if they get it,"" etc. We were told by a mutual friend of the partner about these posts, and quietly decided not to get a dog at that time to avoid drama. We didn't bring up the posts but it was very obvious that both couples were upset at eachother - passing each other silently in the apartment, etc. Not many words were said to eachother that weren't completely necessary for about 3 months. My partner and I were always trying to start conversation but they would respond in one or two words and mainly confine themselves to the corners of the apartment or ignore our messages about groceries or social things. They also brought home their own dog permanently, which we also welcomed with open arms although we were both a bit upset about it. Towards the end of the lease, things got much better, and all 4 of us were hanging out and playing board games, etc. Because of this, we signed another lease with them on a house.

All in all, a lot of things have happened. Many ""we're always in the right, you are always wrong and terrible"" situations by the roommates. Now we have finally got our own dog after many conversations with the roommates, and they have stopped talking to us completely and talking about us negatively on the phone in complete earshot or talking to us angrily.

Ultimately we just want to get out of this lease. We're tired of the anxiety that we get when doing anything, thinking it will upset them and they'll continue posting about us on whatever social media platforms. I know it's dependent on the details within the lease, but we want to know if there's anything we can do without legal action. I'd also not like to cause a ton of issues, as we already feel a bit unsafe around them and don't want them coming after us. We feel unsafe as it is, both for our physical health and the health of our pup but also for our possessions.

Is there anything we can do here? We're all mid twenties (except for the partner who's been causing the issues, she's younger) and I didn't think I'd be having to deal with this at my age.

709,"Hi! Sorry for the long paragraph but here we go: So I play cello at my church on the weekends at the masses. I’m fairly close with my music director there and we’ve been in contact during this quarantine. When all the masses originally got cancelled a few weeks ago, I heard my church was doing live stream masses. I texted my director asking if he was going to be doing music for the live streams or not, and he said that no one had asked him to, and that he was just gonna wait and see. Fast forward to yesterday and I saw the Palm Sunday live stream mass, and there were two other instrumentalists there along with him, playing for the live stream mass. I don’t think he intentionally didn’t invite me, but probably forgot. 
I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I should text him and say something about the music yesterday (like hey glad to see there was music yesterday) or if I should ask if I can come play for the upcoming Easter masses this week. I don’t want him thinking that I’m upset with him for not inviting me, because I’m not. I’m a little bummed is all. And I also don’t want to come off as annoying.

710,"I'm a minor with a part-time job. I was recently confronted by my parents after work when they found weed in my computer desk. Being the second time they caught me, they had their decision all planned out, just waiting for me to get home. They made me sit in my bed while they talked me down, saying things like ""I  have never done drugs in my life, not even a cigarette"", ""Why are you smoking if we have never hurt or treated you unfairly"". I have loving parents (though my  childhood wasn't the brightest as my dad's first born), and I was able to understand some of their points, but there are just some things they don't understand.

Anyways, there was a pause of silence, waiting for me to tell them why I keep coming back to smoking. I just told that I felt sad and alone. Which is true, really. My initial use was due to wanting to run away from my problems for a while (and I know that never turns out good from experience). With the quarantine going on, they have asked me to stay at home and leave my job for a while. Well I guess this incident of getting caught is why they said that they are no longer going to let me work. They are going to take away my job, and they even mentioned stripping my custodial bank account of all of its balance. They claimed that me having a job wasn't going to work out. because I would just buy my own weed and things that I like. I have invested a lot of money into my computer setup. Computers are the best and I love working with them. I have even started studying a new hobby of cyber security, just to pass the time. Well they also took away my computer (though I paid for half of the parts) and made me unhinge my bedroom door. I don't have a door anymore, so the only place of privacy I have now is the bathroom. How convenient of them to do this when school literally just got cancelled for the rest of the year, amirite? Now I need to do all of my online classwork on a flismy laptop. I guess this is my punishment, thought i'm not quite sure what their goal is here, or what message they are trying to send me.

My mother is a catholic, and she is always trying to get our family to pray with her. She thinks it will help make things better with the pandemic going on. I've been over religion for years now. They put me into a catholic school and forced me into confirmation classes throughout my childhood, so you can assume that I'm fed up with it all. Ever since I got my job, I have felt proud and more independent. It feels good buying your own things. And now my parents want to take that away from me, over a legal plant. They are stuck in their own generation, really. Apparently, people that smoke weed have no aspirations for their future, and have no chance of success to study in college. They think I am going to end up on the street like a junky. IT'S MARIJUANA. I understand that I have disrespected my parents by bringing drugs into their house, but their reactions seem a little dramatic to me. I told them that I wanted to study after high school, and my mom says that it will not be possible with weed.

My dad kept bringing up my little sister and how I am a shitty example and influence as the older brother.  It's funny that he doesn't see alcohol as a drug. He got shitfaced on new year's eve and I had to do the 2 hour drive back home because my mom had been drinking that night too and he was in the back seat wanting to throw up. She was right next to my little sister, I wonder what she thought of our dad at that point. I feel bad, maybe she was a bit frightened. We had to deal with his drunk habits in our childhood. I believe alcohol is much more destructive than weed, and my mom mentioned that she looked at some studies linking weed use to depression??? I don't know what she took from what I said about feeling sad and alone, she thinks it's because of the pandemic and having to self isolate. But really, I am more than capable of handling it with my computer, but that's not going to happen anymore, I guess.

One thing I wanted to mention was what my parents said about my 18th birthday. Though it wasn't really clear to me about what they were trying to say, I think it's safe to presume that they would kick me out of the house if I continued with my habits.

Sorry if the post got really long, I'm just trying to speak my mind while I can. This laptop is about to die and they took my phone too, so I have no other way of communication. I just hope I can get some thoughts of others. Call me a coward if you so please. I just need some input right now.

My head is just scrambled with thoughts right now, and my dad is being more strict with me. Said I lost his confidence that I regained after being caught the first time. I might not get it back in a while, but hopefully it's not too long because I am going to lose my mind in this house with nothing to do, and this laptop is driving me crazy.

I guess I deserve this.",06Apr2020,1

So I guess first things first the sleeping schedule I have is quite bad, to be honest, I kind of struggle with being hyper at night where there's a range of stuff that constantly goes through my brain even though I am tired I can't just fall asleep not sure if it's my ADD or what plus I'm always anxious for no apparent reason in my mind. This weird sleep schedule kind of developed now with the lockdown and having to attend classes at various times which are now a pain due to me feeling quite ill and not being able to concentrate well at all.  


Secondly again due to overall laziness, being extremely tired all the time as well as my ADD I struggle to keep up with tasks that I would like to complete I either get distracted or tell myself tomorrow or later I'll do it because I'm currently too tired to manage the task but I really want to get it done for instance my guitar practice while I barely manage to accomplish.

If anyone has any advice I'd greatly appreciate it, I've tried a lot of those ""hacks"" on the internet to no avail and my days feel extremely short and unaccomplished. Thanks again",06Apr2020,1

716,"Mother- M
Father- F
LL- Landlord
Minnesota

My mother is 60+ and has COPD. My siblings that live with her are mostly vulnerable adults, with varying degrees of autism. She'll be taking care of them until she dies. There's so many issues, but I'll try to get to the gist of it..

My Mother, five siblings and 1 cat moved in with my Father's 1 bed room place that he rents, using HUD, in Nov. 2019. They are not on the lease, I believe. It's a shitty situation, but M did not want to go into a homeless shelter. Can't bring her cat.

Landlord said he filed an eviction before the Covid issues, with no proof. Now he is offering money to F to move out. (Otherwise if he is evicted he could lose his HUD for a year. My mother also lost her HUD if relevant.) My father did accepted the money, does that meaning they all have to leave? Can the rest of my family be evicted if he leaves? 

They have no where to go. The shelters are full or closed. LL has offered a tent. 

My question is can the eviction be enforced now, even if my vulnerable father took the bribe?",06Apr2020,2
717,"I won’t make this long I promise.

Some background: I was born with pectus excavadum (basically a concaved chest) and had surgery about a year ago. To fix it, I had a bar put under my sternum to push my chest back up. I have pain constantly and was told by my surgeon and nurse that this was 100% normal and won’t go away until the bar comes out. Most of the time it’s not extremely bad, but it’s there and I usually ignore it. However, it hurts worse when I exercise and I get out of gym sometimes because of it.

Recently because of the pandemic and the fact that my family is quarantined, my parents have decided to take daily walks 2x a day. A shorter one in the afternoon (when I usually wake up lol) and a longer one after dinner. I went maybe 2-3 times and have found that my chest gets very tight and it is painful to do this and I am extremely against taking walks. I’ve tried negotiating and asking if I can do something else instead of walking up and down the hilly roads near our house, but they won’t budge. I want to exercise a little to look good for my boyfriend but at the same time I am ok with my body shape and feel I don’t need it. I don’t know what to do at this point.

So on March 15 I lost my job indefinitely due to the corona virus. I’m a restaurant worker. Since then I have done my part of applying for unemployment and was instructed that I have to finish the second half of my application over the phone. Fast forward to me spending these last couple of weeks making constant phone calls and never being able to get through. I made over 1500 phone calls, only connected to the automated service 3 times, just to be hung up on after dialing in all my information because they have too many callers. I know they’re busy since this virus has hurt so many US citizens which breaks my heart. 

However, I’m starting to become desperate. I don’t have any savings and I had to defer all my bills for now. My landlord is doing her best to work with me but I’m becoming extremely desperate. I don’t have much money for food and I’m doing my best to ration everything I have which isn’t going to last me much longer. I applied for food stamps and I was supposed to receive a call on April 3rd which hasn’t come in yet which I assume is because they are backed up. I also reached out to my assemblyman for help reaching unemployment and they basically told me to “keep calling.”

Every career sucks, every job sucks. 

Every hobby seems boring and underwhelming. 

I dislike women despite being attracted to them. They all seem untrustworthy, manipulative, slutty, hypergamous.

I'm so cynical of love. It's such a phony thing, and what's the point? It doesn't even last. So many people cheat or just get tired of their partner. Even in the relationship, people are checking their shoulder to see other possible partners. Love is so phony to me. Most young women want to hookup with some Chad on tinder so you're essentially useless if you're not the tall buff guy they want to fuck.

I don't like people in general. I hate cliques and social circles. I can't find any that I'd like to be a part of. I hate how people talk about such mundane and meaningless things. 

I hate music and dancing. I only like sad songs because at least they relate to me.

I politely turned him down, initially stating I wanted to take things slow because I had a bad dating experience in the past that pretty much scarred me. I do not have commitment issues, I just don’t want to repeat history. He agreed.

While I had brewing feelings then, I find myself genuinely liking him now, and today I asked him (we agreed in the beginning we will keep things honest/updates) do he see us going anywhere and how is he feeling about us. He said (not verbatim) that he likes me but didn’t want to rush things. Dodging the question in whole, and told me to just ride it out. I didn’t ask him to commit to me, didn’t hint at it. I was essentially asking are we wasting each other’s time. This would (if we commit) be his “first” relationship. This would be my second, so I know this rodeo all too well.

I was confused but i didn’t approach the topic where he asked me to commit to him in the beginning, so I dropped it totally because it was as if I was making the conversation awkward. I feel bad because I felt I was coming onto him too hard. 

We talk everyday, but the past couple days i’ve been initiating contact. I was just *asking for reassurance*, especially because my emotions are now getting involved again.

735,"Hello! 

So my boyfriend has always been naturally skinny. He’s 6’2” and weighs 152 pounds but he eats at least 3000-4000 calories a day. He has been “bulking” ever since we met almost two years ago but hasn’t ever gained weight (he started a year before that). He eats like 6 meals a day and each one is 500+ calories. He works out everyday and appears healthy &amp; toned. 

The problem is that he weighed himself today and decided he wanted to start bulk eating even more than he has been. What worries me is that he already eats way too much fat and carbs than any person should. Since we’ve been together I’ve helped introduce more vegetables into his diet but I still have to prompt him about it. He also taught himself how to cook and mostly eats at home. I know he’s made a lot of progress because he told me used to eat two steaks for dinner, fast food &amp; pizza daily so cooking for himself is a lot better. But he doesn’t cook healthy at all! 

He’s OBSESSED with protein and cooks four jumbo eggs with a cup of meat for breakfast with cheese everyday. And he eats two breakfasts, two lunches &amp; two dinners! Every time he cooks he adds two tbsp of butter and/or olive oil, even when cooking beef! Sometimes he even takes olive oil shots bc someone told him that good for you? He eats probably more than a pound of meat and eggs a day, with bread, potatoes, rice and tops it all off with huge protein shakes with goat milk &amp; whey powder and half a cup of peanut butter. 

I tried to talk to him about cholesterol and I plugged in his breakfast this morning to show him it was over 750 calories and already waaaay over a person his size &amp; weights fat &amp; cholesterol goals for a day. 

His response was: “I’m gonna be fine don't worry. Thanks for your concern though it shows you care”. 

I didn’t want to give up just yet so I sent him some info on high rates of cholesterol even in “skinny” people and this was his response: 

“Elevated cholesterol serum levels are a symptom, not a cause. Body sends signal to produce more LDL/HDL to move cholesterol through blood, and if the inflammation doesnt let up, it builds up inside.This inflammation is built up by seed oils, refined carbs n sugar. The free radicals that those bring can get rent by antioxidants and vitamins found in veggies and fruits, so through your help I’ve been conscious on getting more of those in my diet! You have me drinking green juice lol” 

I don’t even know what to say to him anymore. He barely eats veggies, and has only had two cups of my green juice before lol, so it’s not like that is a regular thing for him. He eats a lot of carbs and fats so he not offsetting nearly enough for his intake! 

I need advice on how to have this discussion without it becoming a fight or making him feel like I am attacking his personal choices. Like he said, I care about him greatly and want to marry him one day. And I don’t want to see this diet effect his health in older age! Especially if I see a future with him.

737,"I have been looking for a new job since before all this COVID-19 stuff started in the states. I am incredibly fortunate that I work in an industry where working from home is entirely possible (I'm an IT Project Manager), and is often done even when there's not a pandemic. The reason I was searching for a new job is because my boss is an absolutely abhorrent human being. She loves to publicly call me out and yell at me for things I have little to no control over. She also likes to call me when I'm off the clock to yell at me. One of her favorites is to put me in charge of something new, give me no information about the new task/project, and then scream when I inevitably mess it up or don't do it exactly the way she envisioned. This shit happens almost daily and it is making me miserable.

I have been interviewing for a while, and have several prospective employers express that they are preparing offers for me, but that has all been delayed indefinitely thanks to COVID-19. 

I know the smart thing to do is to stay at my stable job until I have something else lined up, but working under this boss is wreaking havoc on my mental health.

I know how INCREDIBLY privileged I am to still have a job during this crisis when so many are either losing their source of income, or forced to work in situations that put them at high risk for infection.

I cant tell you that yet because what I’m eventually going to tell you, you won’t be ready for until later on.”Which sound extremely shady when I heard and sounds like a test but my curiosity leads me to play along not wanting to probe any further as he talks awhile about being open to change and instructed us to read this book called “who moved my cheese” by next week. After we join a 3 way group chat I dm my old coworker some questions and he tells me it’s best to talk in the group chat. these all set off some red flags for me.

I approached the counter to obviously pay, and although there was nobody at the counter as I went up to pay, there were still probably about five or six other people in the actual store looking for things and could easily see me.

This same girl behind the counter looks and me and says “can I see your gun?”

And I froze for a second. I was thinking... like... you want me to give it to you...? Or do you want me to show you my gun...?

So I took a step back and turned to the left wall where she could see it on my right side, but she leaned over and reached her arm out, as if she wanted me to hand it to her.

She said “please, sir.” 

And I said. “There’s no sign by the door that says I can’t have my gun in here, ma’am. And if there were, you’re supposed to ask me to put it back in my car.” 

This woman looks like she’s in her early twenties, I’d say. So it is possible that she’s just ignorant and has no idea what she’s talking about, although my three-year-old son probably has more common sense than this girl. And I was nice to her, too! I could’ve called her stupid or started arguing with her or debated her about guns, but I didn’t. I told this woman I would go put my gun in my car and then come back in to purchase my things, but I was NOT going to HAND her MY gun. That’s such an unprofessional thing to ask.

And the part that baffles me is this NEXT part:

She says something along the lines of “Sir, those things are very dangerous and I feel threatened as a person. You either hand me the gun or get out of here; one of the two.”

And I said the one thing that I do, in some way, regret. I said “if you’re so afraid of the gun, why do you want to grab ahold of it and take it yourself?”

She then rolled her eyes and walked over to her phone and called somebody, I’m guessing. She was whispering and I couldn’t hear her. During the window that she was on the phone, I was able to have a mini-text conversation with my baby mama about what she wanted for dinner, so she was on the phone for about five minutes.

She comes back and says, very pissed off, the total price of all of my things. I paid for my things and my gas, and then got out.

I didn’t go to work the next day because it rained that night and I work construction.

Now, let’s finally get started about yesterday. It had been a whole day since I’d gone to this gas station, and I was coming home from work, I pull into this gas station and get out of my car. I think “maybe I should try a different one today?” But then I also thought. “Nah, just suck it up. Maybe a different person is working.”

So I walk into the store, this time *leaving my gun in the car*, I walk into the store only thinking about buying a drink and some gas. 

But there I see the same woman behind the counter, and she recognizes me, and she seems disgusted. Not scared... but disgusted.

I go and grab my energy drink and walk up toward the counter to pay for my gas, but I see the woman on the phone, and this time she is speaking... louder, let’s say. 

She was on phone with f****** 911.

And not only was she speaking with the police at that moment, but she had them on speaker so I would hear it.

She said something along the lines of “Yes I would like to report a disturbance. There is a Caucasian male looks to be around 30 or 40...” (I’m 29, so, close I guess) “... in MY store with an ASSAULT WEAPON and I’m beginning to feel unsafe. Oh, yes, I asked him to leave multiple times and he won’t. I think he’ll fire if you don’t get here quick. Thank you. Yes, I’ll stay on the line.” 

I... I was baffled. And I still am, very much, baffled. 

A 9mm Glock does not equal an “ASSAULT WEAPON” and she had not even asked me to leave the store at all that day, just the day before. 

So I leave my drink on the counter without even putting it back, I look at this woman and I say “You are stunningly full of shit, woman.” And then I left .

I didn’t go to work today because our boss’s contractor hasn’t found us a job quite yet, and yes I do work on weekends to support my family.

So what do I do? I had 911 called on me for having an assault weapon (as far as they are told) I’m pretty sure the police would have called her bluff because of how ignorant and stupid this woman is, but what are the chances they believe her? I don’t know, but I’m super worried. Nothing like this has ever happened to me before.

754,"This is a question for all the extroverts that are doing self-isolation at the moment. I'd really appreciate your advice! 

TL;DR: What can I do for my extroverted friends to make their quarantined life better. Is there something you wish someone is doing for you, but you don't want to ask for it? 

So, my country has been in quarantine for a month now and everyone got hit pretty hard.

I'm an introvert by nature and thankfully I've been doing pretty good (even better than normal) under these new conditions. 
But, all of my friends are huge extroverts and they are all pretty much destroyed. They don't know how to deal with this and they are all having one or more of the following behaviours:

- nonexistwnt sleeping schedule (they don't sleep in patterns I can follow, so I can be awake at the same time as them)
- they became distant and with minimum contact (we talk 2-3 times a week via social media, and even then they are lifeless and depressed) 
- they are literally waiting for the time to pass, and live in an illusion that it will all end soon. We've been home for a month, and our country's covid-19 situation is becoming worse every day
- no one is eating healthy or taking care for their body
- all they do is lie in bed and watch tv shows
- and they are being irritable every time I suggest them some activity they can do to kill the boredom 

I understand that it is very hard for them, and I'm not getting offended or my feelings hurt because of their behaviour. I'm not making this about me. I just miss them terribly and I painfully want to help them. 

I ask them how are they doing, and I regularly check up on them, I offer them to watch movies (on Netflix Party), play online games, or just to chat but they are all just miserable.

I am kinda pissed that they are being big babies (we're all 20 years old) and we had plenty of time to adapt to this situation, but they still continue to do nothing to help themselves.

So my question is, is there something, a small thing, or a gesture, that I can do, to make them feel better? Or on the contrary, should I stop doing something that's pissing them off? Is there anything that I didn't think of, that will actually make a difference to them? 

Btw when I talk to them, I am being emotionally supportive and I try to relate to their struggles, meaning I don't attack them or negatively comment on their decisions, just because I don't want to upset them even more.

760,"Background: I am (20F) currently a college student and living with my parents. I have grown up in a family that is strictly Christian (my parents are both pastors) and have always taught me family is #1 and that you need to always forgive your family no matter what and take whatever they throw at you basically. 

So my issue is, I've strayed from religion (specifically christianity) for about 3-4 years now. I want nothing to do with it because of my family. My parents and all 4 of my siblings are very intense Christians (I have nothing wrong with what anyone wants to believe, but I'm sure anyone can agree if someone constantly forces an unwanted idea on you, youd soon come to dislike it) but they have started to put a bad taste in my mouth for religion and Christianity specifically.

 I've tried stating my opinion that I dont want to associate with religion and they force me to go to church every Sunday and constantly try to force the idea of their religion down my throat, despite what I've told them. They keep telling me God is the only way and won't let me escape the idea of their religion. I get texts from my dad every day about some shit related to it. I can barely talk to them about anything because it always turns into I need to ""trust God."" Here and there my dad will pull me aside and uncomfortably question me about my ""walk with God"" and also make me sit down and watch some God-related video or something. It's like he can't accept the fact I don't believe the same way he does and wont let it rest. I'm just sick of it.

The one thing that pushed me off the edge (and caused me to be staying with my bf atm) is that my brother went off on me the other day about how the end times are here and I need to be right with God right now and have no time to choose. He was saying so much shit for almost an hour and my mom was backing him up. It got to a point where I had a panic attack in front of them, ran to my room, and told them to leave me alone. They thought my panic attack was me being ""filled with joy"".. and my dad later TEXTED ME saying ""thanks to (my brother) I will yield to jesus!""

 Since then I have been mad. Years of them not respecting my views, my decisions, and they keep pushing and pushing this religion. It seems also that they are going out of their way to ignore what I feel or say and instead proclaim I am some way they want me to be, to feel better or something. 

I'm essentially at a breaking point and want to cut them out of my life (even more than I have been wanting to the past few years) because no matter what I tell them, they won't respect me, even though we have different views and I always try to respect theirs.. I let them pray for me, I dont complain about having to go through church, I never tell them they're wrong or they need to change their view. It feels very disrespectful to me and my feelings and makes me feel really shitty.

 My brother keeps calling me and trying to talk to me and honestly I dont want to talk to him. My parents randomly showed up at my bf's apartment 2 days ago (mind you we have stay-at-home orders and my bf is an hour away from my parents) and they were sitting there for almost an hour telling me and him we need to be right with God and how we are in end times, which he followed up by saying ""you know, I'm not trying to force the idea of God on you. I think I do pretty good at not doing so."" Yet they came (unwelcomed and uninvited) to my bf's apartment and had this talk. They said it was because I didnt video chat them the other day and they thought something was wrong. I was really depressed and they make my depression worse so I avoided them, but my bf is here so it isnt like I was alone. I couldnt say that to them though because that's a whole situation I couldnt mentally handle that day, so I just said I was depressed.

My parents and family do love me, I know this. But there is this disturbing side to them that is forceful, persistent, and seems like they honestly disregard what anyone else has to say except themselves. I'm not trying to slam Christianity. I'm sure most of the people out there who are Christian's are genuine, nice people, but my family is just a bad case. Since I've been raised on the whole ""I should be close to my family"" it's conflicting wanting to move out of state and stop contacting them, though I think it would be better for me. Being with my bf atm, I feel at ease and peaceful. When my family or parents tries to contact me, I get instant anxiety and dread. It makes me feel very trapped. I know I'm not a perfect person in all this, but I do try my very best to still respect my family and be nice to them though I basically just take all their crap and swallow it with a smile.

Do you think cutting my family off is a good idea? Am I awful for wanting to cut them off..?",06Apr2020,1

AND we are the only ones who take the proper precautions of cleaning the apartment, washing hands, etc.. idk what else to say about this situation, but I just don’t want people coming over like nothing is wrong and using up all our supplies.

762,"So my friend that I rent to wants me to continue to rent to him (the same place he lives). 2 months ago I ended the contract because of things that I didn't like about the place (messy roommates, electricity often shuts down, he has several projects going on in the apartment, etc.).

Since he still wants me to live with him, and now that the other messy roommates are out, he offers to cut the rent in half the next two months, and after that, 15% less than what I have previously paid.

Sure, that sounds like a good deal, but the thing is, my friend has some serious neurotic tendencies (highly anxious, power-hungry, depressed, restless, disorderly). The other day he flipped for something he misinterpreted and told me to leave the apartment after this period is over in a very demeaning and rude way. And said sorry after that..

On the other hand, a part of me wants the peace of being alone. I am secretly a sort of hermit that naturally likes isolation. And even craves it.

**So here are my options:**

1. Live with another friend, and pay rent to a landlord that is not anyone I know
2. Pay rent by myself somewhere else (that will be expensive), but I'll get the isolation
3. Go live with my parents again. 1 hour away from friends. Save up for a house or camping-car (I believe I can make my job work living that far away, but corona has made things a little unsure)

763,"Tldr at the bottom 

I'm trying to give him benefit of the doubt. We're obviously all affected, scared and anxious, but his comments are triggering solid panic attacks for me during work hours.

I can't stop talking to him, we need to discuss work related things almost all the time. While talking about project he slips in some over dramatized and sometimes FALSE informations about this pandemic, situation in our country and what was said by our government. I immediately go into research only to see half of his statements aren't true.

I can feel for this guy, if this is what he constantly thinks about to the point of bringing it up while talking to me, he has to be very concerned. I also appreciate he tries to make sure I'm well informed about this topic.

BUT. This scarcity has become very toxic for me. It was really hard at the beginning to cope, I fell into dark place and started abusing substances. Right now I'm avoiding news for the most part and I'm only getting updates from my family (members of which are well informed health workers). I started to gain control little by little.

Then this person storms in with all his biased feelings and half-truths only to tear me apart during the time I'm supposed to be productive and focused.

What I've tried so far: At first I jokingly said he doesn't have to scare me like this as a respond to one of his messages. Later I talked to him in a more serious way, something along the lines of ""I don't feel comfortable talking about this during work hours"". Once I sent him proof of his informations not being correct. Lately I've been ignoring it and changing the subject. Although I pretend I'm ignoring it, it's still affecting me in a very negative way.

I'm italian so quarantine for me started at the beginning of march and since then I've been staying home alone. My rommate was supposed to stay with me, but she decided to go back to her hometown in the end. After she left I thought about going home also, but I had some work materials that I couldn't transport by train, so I decided to stay. The problem is that I've been telling my mom that my roommate was home with me for the past month, because I knew she would have wanted me to stay at her house (my brother lives with her so I knew she wasn't alone) . I know it was wrong of me to lie, I was trying to take the easy way out of an uncomfortable situation.

Free hours you don't have to work. No decrease in normal pay.

Initially it struck me as unfair. Please help me. I'm very confused about percentages of how much I'm working compared to everyone, or how much less I'm getting for free percentagewise.

This seems petty or icky to bring this up. I don't know what to say to my manager. But I should definitely point it out.

Btw, it's often forgotten that I'm modified full-time. I do not believe it was on purpose.",06Apr2020,1
773,"My roommate and I have been living together for nearly 6 years. We have had ups and downs (mainly ups) and we genuinely love each other and are best friends. 

I generally do not invite people over to our apartment. Ever since I was young I didn't like friends coming over to my house due to my living situation and that carried over to my adult life. I also am not close to my family, so of the 7 years I have lived on my own they have visited me only a handful of times. My roommate however, loves inviting people over and sees her family every day. Because of this I have also grown close to her family and they consider me an extension of their close knit group, which I really appreciate. But lately it has been increasingly difficult for me to have people in and out of our apartment (this started even before COVID). Her family here almost every other day, many times when she is not here, they do their laundry here sometimes (which is a lot because there is 3 of them), and just hang out all the time. I don't like to tell my roommate who she can and cant have over, especially family, but it's all becoming a bit much for me considering I really don't like others in my space very often. 

The other issue is her boyfriend. I dont really date and my roommate has had a few boyfriends since we have lived together, her current one being the most serious, and also the guy I like the least. Me and him can get along just fine and are cordial with one other, but overall he is just not my cup of tea. I find he can be crass and argumentative. He's also somewhat conservative so we have fundamental differences that I just can't get past. He is here about 5x a week and I dont like to be around him so I stay in my room and let them take the living room. If I do stay in the living room, say watching tv, they both drop hints the whole time that they want to watch something else making me feel super awkward. Doing this is making me feel like I am losing my apartment. Like the apartment is not mine anymore and I'm confined to my room. 

Idk what to do! I'm extremely accommodating and non-confrontational by nature. My roommate can be quick to anger and judgement and in the past if I bring things up she thinks that I am being difficult and am against her. All of my uncomfortability has accelerated during COVID because she is still allowing her family and boyfriend to come over when I am seriously trying to quarantine. I feel like she is not taking me into consideration and it is extremely frustrating. Any advice is great appreciated. Thanks for reading my long ass post.",06Apr2020,2
775,"My best friend lives across the world from me with a 12 hour time difference. He has been suicidal for a long time, he is gay in a country where it's illegal and his family is abusive towards him. About a month ago he began talking about killing himself that day. He said he was just going to do it. I tried to make him stop and talk him out of it but he wouldn't listen. He told me he was thankful for everything I was saying but that he was going to make the decision for himself. He told me that at 3:30 he was going to have the opportunity and he was going to make his decision. 3:30 PM for him is 3:30 AM for me. I was very tired but I told him I wouldn't go to sleep and I would wait for him and I would be there to talk to him at 3:30. I sat by my computer with my phone for hours.

Last I remember it was 2:50 and I sent him another message telling him please to not do it. And then I woke up at 7. I missed 3:30. I slept through it. I wasn't trying to fall asleep but I fell asleep anyway. As soon as I woke up and realized what I'd done, I started crying because I thought I had killed him. I thought to myself that I had missed my best friend's death. All he needed was someone to talk to and I promised him I'd be there and I wasn't, and now he was dead.

It turns out he wasn't dead and he hadn't killed himself. He had made the decision not to do it and to change the way he was living his life and eventually leave the country he lives in. We talked for a long time and he told me not to feel guilty about falling asleep. He's doing fine now. But I haven't been able to sleep through the night since. I keep waking up and crying. And every time I wake up now I have this feeling of a ton of bricks being dropped on top of me. Every time I open my eyes the first thing I think is ""He's dead he's dead and I killed him."" No matter how tired I am I can't sleep. Spontaneously throughout the day I'll get hit by that feeling again and it's so overpowering it makes me want to vomit. I can't live with myself anymore knowing how I failed. I could've killed my friend. I can't take it anymore knowing that I did. I can't forget it. Even though he's alive, and he's okay, it feels like I killed my friend. I could be a murderer for what I did. I can't live anymore with this weight on my shoulders.",06Apr2020,1
776,"It’s been about a month and a half now since me and my ex broke up with me and I still don’t know what I done wrong. We met online and clicked right away. after talking for awhile we realised we only lived close so we started meeting up and things progressed. I still remember the excitement that ran through me every time I saw her beautiful smile or heard her sweet voice. After awhile of meeting up and spending the days together doing nothing but; laughing, listing and showing each other new music, watching films, going on trips to the local shops I decided I was gonna ask her to be my girlfriend and I did. She said yes. And the amount of joy I felt that day was immense. I was convinced she was perfect and I fell in love with every inch of her being and I believed she’d fallen in love with me however neither of us had said it yet. However red flags started to appear she had this friend (we’ll call him Steve) he was a male friend which didn’t bother me, and I hate them controlling relationships so I wasn’t going to tell her who she can and cannot be friends with. One night while I was at hers I asked if she wanted to come to mine, when I was going to tell her I loved her, in a few days time as it was the next time we were both free but she said she already had plans with her friends which was fine so we agreed to meet a few days after that instead and I was going to announce my love then. On the day she “had plans with her friends” she was being really blunt with her replys and ghosted my messages so I assumed she was just busy with her friends. a few hours later I was scrolling through Instagram when I see she’s posted a story of her and Steve baking cupcakes at his house. my heart sank. I waited until she replied to me then I asked her why she wasn’t honest with me and didn’t tell me, I wouldn’t of be mad if she was just honest about it and told me before hand but her hiding it from me made me nothing but suspicious, she apologised for not telling me and said it wouldn’t happen again then we ended it at that. A week or two later she is at a friends house for a gathering and texts me saying “we need to talk” so I call her and she enters a room on her own. She started by telling me “things don’t feel the same” and we ended the call by agreeing to meet up and discuss it in person. Two days later I go round her house and we talk about everything including Steve and she says she feels like she has to chose between being in a relationship with me or being friends with Steve, she also said that her friends persuaded her to text me and go on a break and that she would never of done it if they didn’t persuade her. After we finished our talk we hugged and she said she’ll think about the whole thing and text me once she’s decided. Looking back I should of not gave her the option and left then because clearly her love for me was not strong or there at all if she’d rather be “friends” with Steve then be with me. A few days later she texts me saying she wants things to stay as they are which was not together I felt defeated but I respected her decision as clearly Steve has something I don’t. Fast forward to now one and a half months later and Im copping. We spoken twice and that’s when she’s messaged me. Last week she messaged me saying “sorry”, “it should of never happened” and that “it was her lose” I don’t know what to reply but I told her how I’m coping well and that we both need to move on. But inside all I want is to be back with her and it kills me inside I have to distract myself because as soon as my mind wonders it goes straight to her. Last night I was on the verge of messaging her but I thought what’s it going to accomplish so I put my headphones in and went to sleep. I woke up with a missed call from her and a text saying “hello I know your probably awake and I want to talk” I replied with “I was asleep so didn’t reply but what do you want to talk about?” That was this morning and she still hasn’t opened it even though she’s been active. 

I’m don’t know what to do when she replies. Should I give her one more chance if she wants it, or is she just messaging me because she feels lonely in lockdown. Maybe she still loves me. Maybe she misses me just as much as I miss her. I don’t know what to do any advice would be appreciated

781,"My fiancé (26 y.o. Male) lives in Texas and I (27 y.o female) live in Delaware. It’s sort of a long story (to say the least) in regards to how we ended up in this situation- but with the global pandemic we are currently facing, it has become increasingly difficult to make the long distance relationship feasible.

 Before the spread of the covid-19 virus, we had created a plan to make frequent long term visits where we would travel back and fourth and spend as much time together as possible. Now with the spread of the virus, it is extremely dangerous to travel, and people are being told to stay home at all costs. With the social distancing practices being put in place, our long distance plan has become difficult to execute with confidence. We are both anxious and afraid that we may not be able to see each other for an indefinite amount of time considering the current circumstances.

About a week and a half ago, I got let go from my job. I applied for unemployment and food stamps, and I feel confident that the UI benefits will provide me with enough financial stability and security to get through the pandemic and get back up on my feet when all of this is over. I am fortunate enough that my  monthly expenses are currently very low (I’m renting a home from his mother and she has provided a lot of financial support and security through these difficult and uncertain times). 

My fiancé feels differently- he has expressed fear that with millions of people filing for UI benefits, that the well is likely to run dry. He feels that the best option would be for me to go and live with him until all of this is over and I can go back to work. He insists that I am being selfish by staying here. He has suggested that if I do not go out there to be with him, that I must not care about him. He is willing to do everything In his power to make it so that we can be together during these difficult and scary times, and the way I continue to refuse his help is hurtful to him. On one occasion he threatened to take the ring back- although I believe that that was likely out of frustration, that sort of felt like an ultimatum. he says that he is only being pushy and forceful because he is trying to protect me and support me. I don’t feel supported by this approach, as it is causing additional confusion and anxiety. 

 while I would absolutely love to be with there him, I’m not convinced that it is safe for me to travel there.  I am afraid of risking the exposure to this potentially life threatening virus. he is a type 1 diabetic, meaning he is part of the high risk population and is much more likely to contract this virus than much of the rest of our population. I am so nervous that my traveling there will put him at an even greater risk... if you ask me, it feels like the safest and smartest option for both him and I is to stay put and be patient until all of this chaos settles down. Once it is safe to travel again, I will hope on the first plane to Texas to be with him for as long as possible, but for right now, it feels best to stay home. 

Half of the loved ones that I have asked have told me to stay put, insisting that travel is too dangerous. the other half of the people that I have asked have insisted that they would risk anything to be with the ones that they love in such an uncertain and dangerous time, and that if it were them in my situation, they would go.

I am extremely conflicted, and I am in desperate need of some honest and unbiased advice.

782,"Trigger warning: brief mention of suicide



I genuinely don't know what to do. My sister's bf said that he's suicidal and if he dies, it'll be her fault. Despite her typical strong demeanor, she's understandably shaken by what he said and had broken down in my arms just a few minutes ago. I know that that is textbook manipulation to get her to stay with him, but she said she would be undoubtedly traumatised if he actually kept up with his 'promise' when I told her that. 

Before, I felt that he was not good for her. Now I'm 100% sure that the relationship will break her down if this continues. I'm not willing to let my sister be forced to forgive and forget this entire thing happened.

783,"tldr at the end, Didn't expect this to get that long.

I left work for a new job, we almost got together after 3 months of talking, hooked up then I came back to work with her which is when she said she wasn't ready but left it very open saying how she does like me, etc and to give it some time to let her guard down.

2 months of her flirting she backs off a bit and becomes a bit distant so I ask her to be honest how she feels because I like her. told me she's not 100% sure she feels the same. Sent a couple of paragraphs saying how sorry she was and sorry she lead me on and took me for granted.

Anyways couple days later told me she got pregnant a month ago (unplanned) with a guy she met two months ago. again said she's so sorry for telling me. I just told her I needed some space but I hope things go well for her.

Our manager later talked to me because of shes close to the girl. told me she thinks highly of me etc and gives that ""smile"" when she talks about me to her. Told me I should remain friends for a couple of months and see how things progress as this guy isn't anything special and things aren't working out.

I told her I wanted space. A week later she starts msging me like normal, I thought I'd try to be friends after a couple of weeks she has become friendlier (it's a good sign) But its actually hurting me more than I first thought to message her and remain friends (For the moment) while I still have feelings. Especially since she has started getting a little bit friendlier.

I don't know If I should just stop responding or just tell her I can't do it, not really sure how to handle this situation. What advice can anyone give me? I'm hesitant as I know us not talking will hurt her. (her close friend told me that) I'm trying to remain as mature as possible.

785,"So I've made a few posts on another subreddit about my situation, so you can check those if you want more context. It ain't necessary though.

Basically I've liked this girl for awhile and I thought she might be interested in me. She was always stealing looks at me and whenever we made eye contact she would quickly look away. I've always wanted to talk to her but I just never could.

But after our school year got canceled and everything moved online I realized I had to make a move now or it'd be months before I'd see her again.So I followed her on instagram and planned to message her. I got really nervous on what exactly to say so I just sent her a simple ""hey"" on Instagram. Maybe that was lame but at the time it's the safest thing I could think of.

It's been 4 days now and she hasn't replied. She hasn't actually opened it cause there's no seen, but shes active on Instagram so I'm almost certain shes actually seen it.

I'm just frustrated cause I never got to tell her how I feel. For all she knows I could've been hitting her up for anything. I keep thinking maybe if I had been more direct or out there it would've been different. Cause I swear the way we looked at each other I really felt that something was there.

Which leads me to my question. Could I just text her one more time to get everything off my chest? I wouldn't beg her or anything and I wouldn't act salty about the ghosting. Just a straight to the point confession. I understand this might not change anything. But I'm willing to do it just to get closure knowing I put everything on the table. And who knows. I'm trying to be positive. Maybe she'll reply and everything will be good. Ya never know.

So what do you guys think? The reason I'm asking is because I'm wondering if yall would consider this desperate or pathetic, or just sad, and I dont really wanna come off like that. So yeah, that's it. I'd appreciate your thoughts. :)

786,"My class ended up being switched over to online because of what’s going on in the word rn. It’s been 3 weeks of online class so far and I’m having trouble. 

Every weekday, we go onto zoom (video chat app) and have class. We listen to the teacher go over something, do discussions, go over the homework, and sometimes do presentations. We also have quizzes and tests as well. These video calls are 1.5 - 2 hours long. 

After the video call ends, we do whatever homework is assigned because it’s due the next day. 

I find that I’m having trouble learning through online classes. When we’re doing video chat, sometimes the audio sounds terrible or cuts off randomly. It doesn’t help that I also have some problems with my ears as well, which makes listening even more difficult. I also end up zoning out because I get bored. Which is my fault. It’s something that I need to work on.

With the class that I’m taking, most of it is hands on work. We only do a bit of textbook work. But now that class has switched over to online, we’re doing a lot of textbook work. I don’t feel like I’m really learning anything since hands on work is how we learn most of the material.

Hi everyone,

Desperate so I thought I'd talk to someone to get my mind straight. I've been dating someone for 3+ years now. The relationship is great but I've just always thought we didn't really get along and I simply don't like how I talk to him somehow. Frankly, I'm not happy with how I feel around him sometimes. I do tend to be an idealist and exaggerate things. Just as a disclaimer.

Before dating my current bf there's was this guy I talked to for a long while and we met once but he ended up choosing someone else. I guess I was more like a friend. 2 years later he broke up with her and a couple of months in I actually received a FB friend request from him again but just declined it since I was happy in my current relationship and obviously hurt he had gone for someone else. Thing is, I can't help but wonder it that would have been a better choice and I wish I could at least talk to him to sort things out. How do you advise me to go on?

Any thoughts appreciated. Stay safe!",06Apr2020,1
803,"I have a nice little group of friends, there are four of us. I'll call my 3 bros Jane, Carl and Dwight (based on favourite shows/games lol). 

Jane is acting really obsessed with Carl. She texts him 24/7. Everytime I'm around Carl his phone is dinging insanely. He has to mute Jane quite a bit. On top of the crazy texting, whenever the bros stay over, Jane is always clinging to Carl. At night she always tries to get super close to him, making him really uncomfortable. I feel so bad for him. Carl is interested in dudes, and he's made that clear, but she is still hung up on him. 

Awhile back ago Carl, Dwight and I all had a bonfire together. At that bonfire, while Carl was gone, Dwight admitted to me that he kind of likes Carl. He said he felt bad though because he thought it was like stepping on Jane's territory (even though carl isn't into her). Dwight said he didn't know if he liked Carl romantically or just really cares about him like a friend, though. 

Jane's obsession with Carl has gotten very irritating, and at our last hangout she was acting quite bitchy. We all agree as a group that we care about her, but this needs to end. And if Jane were to find out about Dwight's interest in Carl, what would that do to our group? I haven't really heard Dwight mention his interest in Carl since the bonfire. I've really thought about cutting Jane off from my house.

Basically, the story is that my girlfriend lives in a shared uni house (In the UK.) Because of the quarantine, her housemates have both moved back home, but that wasn't an option for her because airports shut down in her country.

Since then, she has moved into her best friends accommodation during quarantine, as she can't live alone for health reasons. Currently no one is living in the shared house. Her former housemates have said that they don't plan on moving back, and as a result want her to pay all the bills in the house, because she will be the only one who has access to the house. I don't know a lot about the contract they've signed, but surely this is illegal? Furthermore, to ensure this, her housemates have said that all of the bills will be in her name from now on. I have tried to say that they can't do that without her permission, but at the same time, I'm still not really clear on that.

806,"TW FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT



Throwaway because my bf is on reddit as well. Last May, an extremely close friend of mine sexually assaulted me while I was asleep next to him on the couch. There was no P-in-V, but still violating as I was asleep. After having a year apart from him, I’ve started actually missing his company because he was a good friend of mine and my bf’s. He completely regrets his actions and is genuinely sorry that he hurt me (he was under the impression that I was consenting, as I opened my eyes in my sleep when he nudged me). My bf doesn’t know that I’ve been in contact with him (just in the last two days or so, with limited conversation), and definitely still hates/mistrusts him, and my other friends feel the same way. 

I’m more than willing to put it behind me and continue being friends, but i dont know what I’d say to my friends and boyfriend. Does anyone have any advice?",06Apr2020,0
807,"So some background. Im(f)a quarter black not very dark and don’t have any black features besides having pretty tan skin, most people don’t even know I have black in me. My dad(who is half black) has never been in a my life and my was white(she passes away when I was younger) so I was raised by my half brother who is white so I was never around black people. My brother is also kinda racist so I grew up hearing the n word.  I’ve never considered myself a “black girl” but growing up in a small town I got some racist comments growing up or guys wouldn’t date me cuz I was “too dark”. 

Anyways our friend Jim comes over every Saturday for a cookout. Well one time jim said the N word talking to his brother(Sam) who was also over that weekend and my fiancé told him not to use that word and they kinda just paused and it was awkward. Well i pulled my fiancé to the side and told him that what he did was embarrassing and I don’t want them to think it offends me that it’s fine as long as it isn’t said to me (which was stupid I know). 

Well this last Saturday Jim was over and him and my fiancé went outside for a cig. Well I came outside and was like “where’s (fiancé name) and he goes “oh he went to go fuck that bitch” mind you there wasn’t anyone else there besides us three(fiancé was in the kitchen getting a drink)  and Jim was pretty drunk. I didn’t find this joke funny so I said “he’s not like Sam”(Sam, Jim’s older brother, brags about cheating all the time and I honestly look down at him for having so much pride in cheating) and Jim goes “you nigger” and I was like “uh what” and he was like “always talking shit” and I was like “uh no I don’t”. I don’t know why it was ok to joke about my fiancé cheating but me making that statement was talking shit when even Jim has made comments about his brothers cheating. When my fiancé came out I just kinda went back inside and avoided him for the rest of the night. 

I’ve known jim since we were kids but fiancé was best friends with same growing up. When I was younger I had a huge crush on jim he knew and never would give me time in day. Well now I know why. I don’t have feelings for him at all whatsoever anymore I looked at him as a friend before he called me the n word. 

After Jim left we went to bed. And I started crying cuz it really hurt and honestly felt violated in my own home. My fiancé asks me what’s wrong and I hesitated to tell him cu I know he  doesn’t like that word and Jim was just drunk and prolly didn’t  mean it. Eventually I told him and he was kinda mad and said “see this is why that word doesn’t need to be said in me house jim gets too drunk and starts talking out his ass” and reassured me my skin color was beautiful and said he’ll talk to him. 

It’s been a couple day’s and I still feel horrible. And don’t think my fiancé understands how hurtful this was. That word is really offensive. Idk if I want to do these Saturday dinners anymore but I don’t want to be over reacting cuz he was drunk. Advice please?

815,"This is a little long, thank you in advance!

**A little context:** I work at a small mom and pop sandwich shop. When this whole Coronavirus thing started, my bosses decided that we’re going to stay open as long as we can, until we are forced to close our doors. They told us that we didn’t have to work if we were uncomfortable or felt unsafe at work.

We have 2 shops, 4 people work at each. In February, there were 10 of us, total - including the two owners, so that gave us enough staff to work 6 days every week and everyone had a day off. We’ve since ‘lost’ a few people for various reasons.

Someone quit before this all started (he worked at the same one I do) because one of the owners is a little high strung and had a breakdown one day on us, he quit on the spot, they’ve since replaced him, so we’re still at 10 employees.

One person (also at my location) called out because he was actually sick. He was out for a week with some sinus infection or something. I’m not sure what happened behind the scenes, but one day he came and turned in his keys. They fired him apparently, not sure the actual reason. Down to 9.

One guy (also at my location) went on a trip for his birthday two weeks ago, they sent him termination papers and said he’d be back but they didn’t want to take the risk as he’d been on an airplane. Down to 8.

One girl (from the other location) had a coronavirus scare and said she had a fever so they let her go, too. Down to 7.

I don’t know if they’re bringing anyone back at this point as there has been no sign of that. They’ve been taken out of our systems. I’ve been given keys and “promoted” to full time to take the place of the guys that all left my location. We started closing an extra day every week because there’s just not enough people for anyone to have a day off.

Personal context: I was thankful to still be able to make money, as I don’t have any savings. I got a roommate in January to start helping me on the financial side of things, cut down my rent and try to stop living paycheck to paycheck. I’ve been steadily getting there, until this all hit. We stopped making much as far as tips go, and that’s where like half of my paycheck comes from. I'm making less full time than I did part time because of this.

So, lately I’ve had the option of going to work in my back pocket, it felt nice. I’ve been in the mindset of being as careful as possible but there is still risk. I don’t do anything besides go to work or go home. I haven’t gotten food outside of home for 3 weeks, been to the grocery store, gotten gas, literally anything. We are still in close quarters with each other and while we’re doing our best, we are still serving a lot of people and nearly selling out every day, so the risk is still there. I feel like I’m just waiting for it to come. Once it hits one of us, we are all going to be hit, too.

Everything feels harder at work because it’s so different. Everyone I’m familiar working with is gone. It’s been a big adjustment and I’m working with the owners every day and it’s a struggle, as they are generally high strung.

We’ve also had our share of Coronavirus scares. One customer came in and said his employee possibly had it and that he was waiting to get tested. We were like then WHY THE HECK ARE YOU HERE? My boss took it very seriously and we re-thought our set up.

The girl at the other location had a fever, I have not heard anything about her but they took that seriously too, and let her go. This past Saturday, the guy that replaced the first guy that quit went home not feeling well, too. And several customers bring up how they know someone that has it, has passed from it, etc.

This weekend my mom wasn’t well - it wasn’t Coronavirus related, but it still scared me because I cannot be there in the event that something happened as I’m still at a higher level of risk.

&amp;#x200B;

**All that being said -- to get to the point** I’m considering utilizing the offer of taking some time off. On one hand, I can’t really afford to and I feel like I should work as I have the opportunity to work in a time where a large majority of people would love to have the ability to work and helping people feel normal during a time of scare. On the other hand: I feel scared to take an unnecessary risk while I don’t have health insurance, want to be with my family if something went wrong, am currently having a really hard time coping with the loss of all the people I’m so used to working with (I’m not excited to go to work anymore because it’s so much more high stress outside of Coronavirus) and have mixed feelings on us being open and possibly spreading it around.

Another hard point to this is if I do take time off, what does that time even look like? This likely won’t be solved soon, but does taking a week or a couple of weeks off even put me in a better position or is it just delaying the inevitable?

During 'normal' times, I'm a freelance creative. Things have been slow on the freelance work, but as far as financials go, they're less of my concern. I plan on using the time off to look for some side work and update my online presence, work on some personal projects I've been putting off, etc.

It feels like a very selfish decision to not work and I think I’m also not trying to let anyone down. It feels like a hard decision to make as it speaks to my character, as well. I guess a big question I’m asking myself is “Will taking some time off speak negatively to my character that I don’t handle hard times well and that I played it too safe?” I know ultimately it’s up to me, but I’d love some insight on your thoughts to help give me clarity on what I decide on doing.",06Apr2020,1

I am a college sophomore at a pretty good school (top 25) and I am studying in the field of GIS, Urban Design/Planning, and Architecture. Last summer, I had an internship that allowed me to use GIS for research. I was hoping to spend the summer of 2021 with an architecture firm. That leaves summer 2020. I planned to apply for internships within local governments around me, because I wanted an idea of what it is like to use GIS and Urban Design strategies from a government point of view, as this is a realistic career path for me. However, due to COVID-19, a lot of the internships I applied to are now emailing me saying that they have to cancel the internships. This is completely understandable, and although not all of them have said this yet, I anticipate they will eventually.

In addition to gaining valuable experience, these internships were all paid which would help me afford living costs for college next year. My knowledge includes ArcMap, ArcGIS Pro, Revit, AutoCAD, Target by Seequent for ArcMap and ArcGIS Pro, and the Adobe Suite.

I was on a walk with my dad the other day and he threw out the idea that perhaps I try to start a firm/company. I could then contact the same cities and ask them if they had any work they would like to delegate to me. I could potentially be paid for the hours I actually work, rather than going into the office and being paid for the time I am there, regardless of if I am working or not. This also allows me to work from home and avoid going out, which is very important in these times.

While it sounded like a great idea (I would get experience and hopefully get paid), I have no idea where to start. Would I have to register an actual company somewhere? Could I just email the cities and ask for work? I am pretty lost as to where to start. I was also thinking I could get other friends from my program who are now losing internships involved and work with their cities as well.

Ive recently been under a lot of stress due to some other issues that I dont need advice on. Its something I have to work out on my own. But, the anger, hurt, and tiredness has been driving me to smoke cigarettes. I also want to do nothing but drink and smoke weed. I smoke weed often, but not regularly, and I drink occasionally, but all I want to do is numb myself out now. Ive been smoking cigs because I cant drink or smoke weed right now, and I have zero desire to do any other drugs. 

I dont know how to get rid of this feeling. I dont know what to do. Im currently on anti-depressants and anxiety medication that is working, but I also suffer from chronic insomnia that is taking its toll on me.",06Apr2020,1
835,"So I had been best friends with this guy for nearly 7ish years, but about a month ago I stopped talking to him because one day he came over to visit my girlfriend and I. The whole time he was over he kept changing the subject to sexual things involving my girlfriend and I. He would ask very specific sexual questions about my sex life with my girlfriend and no matter how many times we tried to change the topic, he wouldn’t get off of it. So I told him this made both my gf and I uncomfortable and I was upset by this. He kept saying he was sorry and wouldn’t do it again but he also kept making excuses, saying that he “thought it was funny and didn’t think he was making us uncomfortable”. Then out of nowhere he just stopped apologizing and never said another word. I took this as he didn’t care and I haven’t made any efforts to speak with him, but lately I’ve been wondering if I should talk to him again and forgive him since he did apologize. Is this bad of me to do? Should I reach out to him again or be friends with him again?",06Apr2020,1

we broke up 4 months ago and i think about him a lot. i am pretty sure that i’m over him and only think about him so much because he was kinda my first real relationship. since our breakup, we’ve unfollowed each other on all social media but we talked on the phone a few times after we broke up, but we haven’t talked in about 3 months.

i got really close to his family when we were together and his mom works in a hospital so if i texted him i would ask how his family is and thank his mom for the work she’s doing.

also, about a month ago, i maybe might have driven past his house blasting music and holding up my middle finger and then posted about it where i didn’t think he’d see it and then my friend replied to my post saying “[my ex] says hi 🤭” so i’m pretty sure he showed him.

i should also maybe include that the reason we broke up is because we just didn’t have enough time to see each other in person, nothing to do with our dynamic. i say that i’m over him but if presented with the opportunity to get back together, there’s definitely a chance i’d say yes.

She holds herself to an exagerrate standard and she always thinks that if she can't do it 100% perfect, it's as good as 0. I, on the other hand have never been ambitious. I hate ambition in general. I know it's a good thing in moderation but my friend takes it to the extreme. She's always stressing out and complaining. She knows what she is doing is bad but she can't stop it. These days she is writing something for fun, and she always tells us how she keeps erasing what she is writing because she feels it's not good enough.

 
Both me and another friend tried helping, we've told her countless times to stop this, stop this behaviour, just let it as it is, even if she feels it is not right because her standards are exagerrated. She doesn't want to. She says it's impossible for her to do that because it will mean changing her personality. My other friend compared her to a smoker that complains about lung issues but doesn't want to stop smoking, and she felt hurt by her statement. We tried helping her but she seems to reject our ideas completly. I told her she should try to supress this voice telling her to do everything perfect and she told me ""Why? Why should I settle for less?"". I don't know what to do or say anymore. 


She keeps bringing this up but it's always the same story. She then calls herself awful and I have no idea how to help. All 3 of us are 16.

I've seen people being destroyed by perfectionism and ambition (that's why I hate it so much) and I don't want this to happen to her.

I bought a used 2018 Audi a4 in June of 2018. Here we are, Not even 2 years later...BUT I've about had it with Audi's service and I'm getting about ready to sell my car, but I'm not sure if I should. I've had NOTHING but issues with this car and service is just downright rude. The list of reason's why I'm upset:

* I bought a 5 year warranty, and they never applied it. It took 8 months for them to realize this and I had to fight to prove that I had a warranty.
* They charged me $600 for a freaking wire that a squirrel chewed through. The wire would have costed me \~$10 somewhere else.
* My backup camera has had horizontal lines going through it and I can't get them to fix it since they can't replicate it. (been complaining about this for about 6 months.)
* The left rear view mirrors motor went...haven't even owned the car for 2 years!!!
* More Rodent problems..had a nest in my car &amp; $1,300 worth of damage. Should I mention that their wire sheathing is edible? YAY SOY BASED.
* Asked the manager to open a case with Audi's corporate office since I don't feel like I should have to jump through hoops to get this issue raised. He said he would, never did. Then denied saying he would. I opened the case...oh and guess what? NO ONE WILL GET BACK TO ME :)
* Did I mention Rodent problems? not even 2 weeks after the $1,300 worth of damage, I found another nest..and this time...with BABIES!! :) When my car gave birth to the squirrels, I called audi cause I wasn't sure what I should do. (Yes I probably should have googled..but I was just in shock and that was the first thing I thought of to do) and the women chewed me out on the phone. I called my vet next and she even gave me a list of places to call.
* Just brought the car in for service, brought up the issue with the backup camera, and they said they wont fix it cause again..they can't replicate it!!! AWESOME!! :)

I've about had it with being treated like garbage. But I'm not sure if it's even worth selling since idk if I would have this problem elsewhere. I don't know what to do. They said they would call me tomorrow to discuss..I don't even know where to start with them.

I'm so angry at what I've been going through with Audi and mad at myself that I even bought it. Am I overreacting? Should I just sell the car? I think I can get roughly 25k - 27k for it..It only has 26k miles on it.. I don't even know what car I should even look at..

My friend on the other hand. He's.. going down the wrong path. We used to be attached at the hip. We used to plan our future together that we were gonna go to college and rent a house out, etc. But then my parents moved me to a new state. Ever since then he fell in with the wrong crowd. And he's partying/drinking/doing drugs. On a weekly basis. He dropped out of college and moved back home. Won't hold a job cause he's ""eventually going back to school"". 

And I'm worried about him. I feel like if I never moved away his life would be completely different now. We were best friends. And I really feel like if he doesn't make a drastic change to his lifestyle. He's gonna crash and burn. He's being heavily influenced by his ""friends"" to do these reckless things. And behind his back they laugh about him on social media and pick at him. 

I kinda feel like I gotta try and help him get on the right path. He doesn't even have his driver's license yet. And has never held a job for longer than a week.

862,"Hi all, I'm a 24 y/o (M) and I need some advice on whether I should go sober or not. For context, I've never struggled with addiction with either alcohol or drugs, I'm just learning towards sobriety to improve my physical and mental wellbeing. However, I'm worried about the consequences this may have on my social life.

I used to drink a lot to cope with mental health issues. Since then, I've cut back significantly and started new habits to improve my mental wellbeing (exercising regularly, being open with others etc) and it's working. I feel better than I ever have before and it feels like the next best thing for me will be to try and stay sober for good. I still occasionally indulge in drinking, but it typically leads to depressive episodes which is why I'm considering quitting for good.

My dilemma is that I'm not a particularly social person and the way I normally socialise is through drinking (this applies to both friends and strangers). Because of this, I fear that if I choose to become sober it might damage the relationships I currently have and make it difficult for me to make new friendships in the future. 

I feel like I should do what's best for me and let life work out the rest, even if theres a lot of uncertainty ahead. But I just wanted to hear from your experiences if its relatable at all.

So to start off my husband has a couple of issues he's dealing with as far as work and unemployment goes.

The first one being that the new restaurant he started working for hasn't paid him for the time he worked. Everyone else has been paid. We're in Washington state and the restaurant hadn't opened yet when our stay at home order went into effect so the owner decided to delay opening. Everyone was laid off, including the manager my husband was dealing with. Now we have no contact info for the owner and he still hasn't been paid for the days he worked preparing for the opening.  Do we just have to wait this one out?

Second issue is unemployment. The manager initially gave the wrong company name so unemployment was denied. Now we're pretty sure we have the right name and info but I'm concerned that the manager never put my husband on as an employee and unemployment will get denied again. I think we just have to wait and see on this one as well but without his income we're starting to drown in debt.

We both live in the same complex and we had met on the balcony a few weeks ago and realized we were next door neighbors.  We started drinking some tequila and had a few too many and we went back to his apartment where I went down on him.  I didn't know at the time but he recorded it.

The next night he knocked on my door and we started talking again and after a little bit he just grabbed my head and tried to push it down to his crotch.  It made me very uncomfortable and I told him to leave.  He said fine, he would just post the video from the night before and masturbate to the comments.  I called bullshit but he showed me the video.  I begged him to delete it but he wouldn't.  He said I could ""convince"" him to not post it, and it was very obvious what he meant.  I was terrified of that video getting out, so I gave in.  And that time I actually noticed him take his phone out and record again but there was nothing I could really do about it.   

As he was leaving he said he was going to post both videos to the internet in the morning unless I stopped by to convinced him not to.  I thought about going to the police but I was too scared and embarrassed.  And I was worried he would post the videos as punishment.  I didn't know what else to do so I knocked on his door the next morning to demand that he delete the videos or I would go to the police.  Well that tactic didn't go as I expected and I ended up having to convince him again.

It started off as once a day but with the quarantine it's turned into several times a day.  He records each one.  He's becoming rougher too.  And it's getting weird, today he put a dog collar on me when I walked in. 

This is really starting to affect every part of my life.  I can barely focus on work and my boss just grilled me for missing a deadline.  I've been avoiding my boyfriend, and telling him it's just because of the quarantine.  I need to get myself out of this situation.  He probably has at least 20 videos at this point. He said if I go to the police then he would put them on every major porn website and send out links.  He knows where I work.  I'm scared to death.  I'm a 29 year old female in finance and I've worked really hard to get where I'm at and I don't want to see it all go away.  But I also can't keep doing this.

I have tried to reconnect with my mother but I’m not sure how to talk to her. The last time we talked it ended badly. I guess I should say why our relationship is so rocky it’s because whenever I was younger she would go out to clubs and bring random men home somehow they always ended up in my bed or stopping by my room at night. I was molested from 6-16 years old. She knew what was going on there was even an instance when she beat me with a belt because her boyfriend at the time was trying to put his junk in my anus. It was the middle of the night. I was maybe 7. She says I asked for it. I asked for all those men to touch me, she said I liked it.

869,"So without going into too much detail, I'm considered an essential worker and have been working as a two person team with another co-worker since social distancing started. Normally, we would rotate and switch up the teams but since the coronavirus outbreak reached North America, our company decided to keep the teams the same, that way, if someone gets sick, only that person's partner should theoretically get sick, rather than the entire staff.

Basically, I [F20s] am stuck working with this one coworker [M20s] until the outbreak is over. Now, I don't know what it is, maybe we just both aren't the best at starting conversations or maybe there just isn't enough going on right now other than the virus, but I'm really having a hard time getting a good conversation going.

We work in a lab, so there's a lot of time to talk while we run our test samples and whatnot, but I swear this is the only coworker I have a hard time talking to. I start conversations about 75% of the time and he does seem to enjoy talking when we do talk (like he'll be smiling and not indicate any annoyance or anything), but I feel as though he's just very closed off.

For example, I'll talk about my family or something, just explaining what my sisters are like and how everyone in my family has been affected by the current situation and then the conversation will die off. For starters, I know he has a family and that he visits them every once in a while, but that's it. I know not everyone is super close to their families and I don't want to seem nosy or like I'm prying, so I don't really know if I should ask him if his family's been affected or not.

But that same thing happens anytime I share something about my life and don't finish with a question he can respond to. Should I be asking more questions? I'm so used to having people continue the conversation on their own and I don't know, maybe I'm just not the most comfortable with asking people questions all the time, because it makes me feel as though I'm reading them wrong and that they don't actually want to talk. But at the same time, hours of silence is getting pretty old with just the radio playing in the background.

Anyone have any advice?

TL;DR: I'm working closely as a team of two with another co-worker in a lab setting, but I have a hard time getting a conversation going with him. Basically, he doesn't really continue the conversation unless I ask him a question, which makes me a bit uncomfortable, because I don't want to just be asking him a million questions all day. I'm used to having people share their experiences in response to me sharing my experience with something, rather than having to ask all these questions. Anyone have any advice for this?",06Apr2020,1

871,"He told me he legitimately thought I had died because my lips turned blue and I was completely out. I've never seen so much fear in his eyes as I remember seeing last night. 

He had to go to work this morning and has said he's not sure how he's going to deal with this. Last night was one of maybe 3 times I've seen him cry in the 4 years we've known each other, and he said he's cried at work today. He's not great but working on communicating his emotions rather than bottling them. I can't imagine the terror he felt. I saw him pass out one time and then be totally fine, which was scary enough, but I can't imagine how terrible it would be for someone to pass out while you're screaming in their face to stay awake. I just want to help him deal with this. Any advice is appreciated.",06Apr2020,2
872,"They broke up 6 months ago, both in their 20’s. He cheated and she left him. The relationship was complicated, she had also cheated once in the past, but he continued to cheat over and over again and she didn’t want to deal with it anymore. What’s concerning is that he’s still depressed about it and can’t move on even 6 months later.

His ex has completely gone NC with him. On her social media profiles there isn’t a trace of any of his photos. She’s completely removed him from her life and has moved on. She’s with a new guy now and is extremely happy.

For him it’s a completely different picture. He cries every time a song comes on that reminds him of her. He talks about how he misses his ex constantly. He still tries to contact her even though she blocked him, instead trying to make contact through a mutual friend that is still in touch with her. His social media still has photos of them together. He still has photos of her, he even made a slideshow of all their memories together (vids, pics, with music playing in the background).

I don’t know how to help him. It’s gotten to the point where it’s pathetic. There’s no chance of them getting back together, but he still focuses on the past and refuses to move on. He clings to the hope that one day he can get back what he lost but it’s just not possible. He cries about a relationship that’s long gone. The girl he misses isn’t even the same person anymore, she has completely moved on.


TLDR; best friend’s gf left him 6 months ago. She’s moved on but he hasn’t. He’s still depressed/despondent and it doesn’t seem to be getting better. How can I help him?",06Apr2020,1
873,"     Since I was six, and before I even knew what it was, I have considered suicide heavily. I have severe depression and have always felt like an outcast or scapegoat. From second to seventh grade I was openly mocked for who I was, which has lead to so many issues now that im older. Over the past few mounths I have been dragged into a verbaly and sexualy abusive relationship and attempted suicide twice. My mother keeps pressuring me to open up about how i feel, but anytine I did she would get mad at me and start raising her voice which would give me extrenely severe anxiety attacks. Just wrighting this is making it very hard to brethe. I tried to tell her that her actions have hurt me, and tried to be good enough for her, but no matter what I do I never suceed. About a mounth ago she told me outright that she has given up on me, and that im on my own. She just cancelled all my therapist appointments without telling me, and hasnt taken an ounce of responsibility for all the painful and emotionaly dammaging things she said to me when she gets mad. Now im more suicidal than ever, and thats saying a lot. I attempted to slit my wrist yesterday and I just really wish I wouldve killed myself when I had the chance all those years ago. I cant even bring myself to attempt again because I just get so overwelmed by everything that has happened. Im flying through this story so this doesnt turn into a twenty page essay, but just please know I have severe (undiagnosed) PTSD episodes whetere a loud bang or slamming door will give me flashbacks to my dad shaking me awake and screaming at me after police came to our house because I told the school I wanted to kill myself. I didnt even think that was entierly accurate as its shown in the media, but i swear its just like you see in the movies. Because of this i feel like no one will believe me, and i just really wish I could die anywhere else. I really dont know what to do, and with how everyone has treated me all my life im genuinely angry at myself for not ending it already. I feel so unwelcome and scared in my own home, and clearly arent welcome or valued by anyone at all so i feel like this is all my fault and im just so dumb to keep putting myself through this by staying alive. I dont know what to do, and I have litteraly no one. I came out as pansexual (not by my own choice) and was thrown into this world of pain and screaming because of it. Ive been a closeted atheist on the fence about religion and considered being teansgender since 1st grade, but I can never tell my family that because they painfully pry that kind of stuff from my soul and beat down on me for it. I really dont see a way out, and I want to just shoot myself every second of every day. Im stuck in this constant cycle of pain and suffering my whole life and I dont know what to do. This most likely will accualy end up being my third suicide note anyway, so please share any kind of help you know of. I really just want this to end. I know even by killing myself my family will be mad at me for being in the way, so i feel like there isnt even a point anymore. Please help. Please",06Apr2020,1

875,"This is my first ever post on reddit so sorry if something I say comes out stupid or doesn’t make sense. Also, this is a long story. 

About a year ago I was fired from a PetSmart in Dallas. It was my first job that I had ever gotten moved up into a middle management position so I had an attachment to it of course as well as a sense of reverence and closeness to my Store Leader at the time that promoted me. It was pretty decent pay and I was very upset when I lost my job. 
I was promoted at about 11 months of seniority as a pet care leader. My manager has a lot of faith in me and often bragged about me to my other coworkers and seemed to enjoy my company over others sometimes. 
Generally speaking, I don’t really have anything going on outside of work. My social life is at work. I met my current girlfriend in the workplace, working under me. Before her, I had been talking to a woman that was working in the grooming salon. Word spreads like wildfire in any salon so, soon everyone knew the girl had a thing for me. However this didn’t get around to my manager, as far as I know. I liked the attention I received from her, but soon I learned that she was not looking for an actual relationship with me but instead looking for a third person to be a part of her threesomes. I didn’t like that all that much so a couple of months later I started talking to another groomer romantically. She ended up moving to Ohio, so that didn’t work out. Again, word of this didn’t go to my manager. 
Then, a girl, we’ll call her Kate, that I had been talking to in a friendly way started making advances towards me outside of work and we became “something”. I told her that we needed to keep everything on the down-low because I was worried that something would happen. After a few months of nothing happening, I moved into an apartment and she agreed to be my roommate, soon after we became serious and she was my girlfriend. This is where it went downhill. 
I understand that what I did was wrong, reckless, and unprofessional 100% but it’s what happened when they fired me that got to me. 
A couple of days before, I had to go through some long uncomfortable talks with HR. At this time my manager knew about everything that was going on due to an informant in the salon and a picture Kate had uploaded on Snapchat about my Valentine’s Day gift to her. After the last talk with HR, my manager said I should just go home for the day. She messaged me shortly after leaving, asking me if I would just accept a transfer to another store and everything would be okay. I could tell she didn’t want me fired since I was a good employee. I said of course because I didn’t want this on my track record. 
The next day I’m getting ready for work and my manager texts me to tell me that another manager from a different store wants to talk to me about transfer. I walk in, go straight to the office where I find my manager and her. They close the door and my manager, to my surprise, tells me that the district manager and them have decided to let me go, without the possibility of transferring. I was floored to say the least. 
I hope you all can understand how betrayed I felt I’m this moment about this and see past the things I did. After a year I still feel like this was so wrong and something I definitely didn’t deserve. I felt like I worked hard to become the valuable employee I became working there just to be thrown away for becoming romantically involved with someone who didn’t even work in the same department as me. 

What is your advice on getting past this?

Will this affect me getting other management jobs in the future? 

Do you think that I was in the wrong for this?",06Apr2020,1
876,"Apologies for formatting; I'm on mobile.

My brother and I have been off from school for a few weeks now, which means that we're spending much more time than we used to with our father, who has a history of being emotionally abusive. This includes constantly yelling and insulting us, saying that we're stupid and won't get anywhere in life and that he wishes we weren't his kids, berating us for every moment we're not studying (because if we still have time to eat and sleep, we're doing it wrong), threatening physical violence, and breaking things around the house when he's mad, etc etc. Unfortunately, this kind of stuff is far too normalized in asian families such as ours, and being at home is only exacerbating the issue.

There's a fairly significant age gap between me and my brother- I'm in high school while he's in first grade- so I have had far more time to process the trauma caused by growing up in this sort of environment and also spent less time in it due to my parents' longer working hours when I was younger.
 
Because of this and the fact that my brother is such a young child, I'm wondering how I can help him deal with our shitty situation in any way that might make it easier for him. I don't want him internalizing our father's behavior.

Thanks in advance for any advice and wisdom you guys impart :)",06Apr2020,1
877,"Unfortunately, I heard one of my neighbors crying this morning. It lasted about 10 minutes, and I couldn't say anything during that time since I was giving an exam. This is not sitting very well with me, and I've written a note for consolation but I'm really debating whether or not I should leave it outside their door. This was obviously a very private moment for her and I do not want to anger or embarrass her into thinking that I was eavesdropping, or that I'm sticking my nose somewhere it doesn't belong. Also, I'm assuming it was the person right across my hall, since that is the closest apartment to mine and the cry sounded quite close to me, but there is a chance that it could be someone else. 

I honestly feel very bad for her, since the cry I heard was quite painful. I have only once ever said hello to said person, and we haven't really come into contact after that. So, would it be a good idea to leave a note?",06Apr2020,2

879,"For backstory, my ex-best friend and I met through an online game back in 2013 and we developed a deep bond. She was home schooled and I had no friends during this time. We kept in contact outside of the virtual world and practically grew up together. I was even lucky enough to meet her in person 3 times throughout our friendship. Everything was great up until our “break ups”.

Our first of many break ups happened when she believed a lie about me that one of her IRL friends told her and she ended up ghosting me. Not only was I crushed, this lowkey traumatized me. I remember crying and at the same time being filled with rage. This was a bad time. We managed to rekindle our friendship a few months later but things weren’t exactly the same. The second time we broke up we got into an ugly fight. I called her sensitive and she called me toxic. We cut off ties right after. This was when I began to lurk on her social media and it’s been a habit since. We hadn’t talked for about 2 years after this fight. I reached out to her because a horrific hurricane was heading her way and I wanted to make sure she was safe. She appreciated my concern and once again, we rekindled our friendship. About 3 months later, I met her in person for her birthday and let’s just say things were... odd. I noticed we were *very* different people and we hardly had anything in common at this point. Literally right after visiting her, she barely communicated to me for months and I had to cut her off. This ensued a bunch of shady and nasty posts on her social media towards me. I’m not going to victimize myself because I acted shady as well. This was immature on my part and I regret it.

Recently as of last year, she reached out to me. I was taken aback because I was always the one who reached out to her. To summarize, she said that she reflected over our friendship and missed me. My intuition knew better but I respectfully texted her back and carelessly obliged to be her friend... again. We texted back and forth and FaceTimed each other the way we did when we were kids and opened up about our problems. Over time, I became somewhat disinterested in our conversations. I'm not trying to justify what I did was right, but I was focusing on important matters in my life and became distant towards her. This resulted in her sending me a paragraph basically saying, “We were great friends at one point, but we need to stop chasing each other for the bond we once had because it’s become tarnished.” I was confused. I let her know I’ve been busy with things in my life and that doesn’t necessarily mean we have to lose our friendship? Either way, we cut each other off at the end of 2019.

Since then, I’ve been lurking on her social media checking up on how she’s been. I’ll admit it’s been a problem for years and I’ve tried multiple times to stop this terrible habit but I've never overcome it. I guess I became attached to her and continue to be hurt that she's exited my life after I opened up to her over and over again. I’ll even go as far as saying that I never really let go. I’m not exactly sure why I can’t let go, I mean she's lied to me, been fake to me while we were friends, wasted my time, plus the constant on and off friendship took a toll on me. I always believed she was the only best friend I could have when I had other friends with better intentions. Sometimes I feel as if I never really knew her. I don’t know what to do to let her go. I’ve tried many things such as writing a personal letter and burning it, blocking her, and deleting my social media but it never works out. What can I do to let go and move on with my life peacefully?",06Apr2020,1
880,"Yeah it’s pretty weird.. I’m 22, my mother recently passed away and there was no way I could keep our family home. Me and my gf are saving up to get a place of our own and living at her dads place in the meantime with him and her little sister (15). 

She never acted like this before but since I moved in with them she’s started being really weird around me, like she’ll walk around the house with barely any clothes on and is constantly trying to get my attention and it makes me really really uncomfortable. I told my gf and she didn’t take me seriously and basically turned it into a joke... 

if that wasn’t weird enough she’s now started walking in on me when I’m in the shower or getting out (there’s no lock on the door) I’ve told her that it’s wrong and why she shouldn’t be doing it but she just laughs at me and does it again a few days later.

I have a budget. There are lots of girls that will video call for 10-15mins an get you off for $40. $120 for 2 session a week is affordable, but usually for my kink you submit to a woman, and some exploit you  and drain more.

One friend in particular that I used to be very close with, let's call her ""Winter,"" has reestablished contact with me. Winter and I always clicked pretty well, and at one point we were very close. We fell out at some point for some reason I can't explain, and come quarantine, I decided I'd text her for old times sake.

Her boyfriend, let's call him Alex, is the quiet type. However, i am (or at least was) one of his two closest friends. We formed a bit of a trio and frequently hung out. Suddenly, he's been treating me like shit. He wont talk to me much, and he passive aggressively puts me down or insults me every chance he gets. He also compared me to a guy I hate. The guy he compared me too consistently hits on his gf and hit on my ex A LOT. He didn't compare that trait in particular, but I thought it was peculiar

It all seemed to go downhill after a picture of me wound up on Winter's Instagram. She and I also started to call and talk and snap back and forth and things like like that. His sudden change in mood towards me correlated with that.

890,"My (25F) boyfriend (24M) of four and a half years has had a group of guys he’s been friends with since elementary school. Most of them are great and we get along well, except for one, who also happens to be his roommate. I usually just quietly tolerate him, but recent events have gotten me reflecting on whether this guy is worth being friends with at all (and whether it’s even my place to tell my bf this).

The friend I think might mean well sometimes, but he’s really selfish and kind of a douche in a lot of ways. This has stemmed back for years. Just to name a few incidents: When they were in high school, my bf had just broken up with a girl he spent like 1 or 2 years in a relationship with, and days later, his friend messaged that girl and asked to have sex with her. The first time I met the friend when my bf and I were in college, he made an uncalled for joke out of nowhere that I’m fat (and I am a normal weight, plus I was actually in an eating disorder treatment center at the time, so it was especially poor timing). Recently, he asked my bf when he was going to get a new woman in front of me and all of our friends, and then when everyone including my bf reacted strongly to what he said, he claimed he had meant to say something else (whatever that means).

Probably the biggest point of contention though is his friend’s toxic relationship. The friend has has inflicted his awful girlfriend and their fights on everyone else in the friend group, and nobody likes her. She is physically and emotionally abusive to him, a liar, can never keep a job, can’t drive, randomly came home with chlamydia once 3 years into their relationship and claimed it was dormant - it’s honestly a wonder he’s even with her because I can’t think of a single redeeming quality about her. They have very public fights in front of everyone that involve yelling and sometimes hitting and slamming doors, often ruining hangouts for the group. She has been staying (mooching) in my bf’s and his roommate’s the apartment for quarantine without clearing it with my bf first, and the roommate and gf always leave things a mess. Not to mention, the gf isn’t listed as a tenant and hasn’t even contributed to rent. My bf spent the week taking photo evidence of messes they leave around the apartment and finally had a talk with them, which turned into a blowup fight about how the toxic gf isn’t leaving, and random accusations from the roommate towards my bf that didn’t make sense and fell apart almost instantly once my bf responded with facts. Then, an hour after that bizarre fight, his friend asks if we want to go in on an apartment with him and his toxic gf (probably so the rent is lower for him bc his girlfriend is constantly unemployed and I guess he wants to drag us into financially supporting her too).

So, now that the long-winded explanation is over, this has got me thinking about whether the roommate is even worth being friends with at this point. My bf is a really nice guy and doesn’t really cut people off, and plus the friend group thing would kind of make seeing the roommate unavoidable. I ultimately can’t tell my bf who he can and can’t be friends with, but I feel like I should say something to him about whether his roommate is worth having more than limited contact with, because in my opinion, he’s proven himself over the years to be a shit friend.",06Apr2020,1
891,"Ok so long story, about 2 weeks ago i started getting a sore throat, me being super anxiety ridden went to tell my manager (in the hopes that I could stay home and quarantine and then come back after a few weeks after all the corona stuff calmed down) but everything has not calmed down and seeing the news, this thing is not going away any time soon.

Problem is, now i need a doctors note (to clear me) and i dont have insurance, not only that but i do not want to come anywhere close to potentially sick people.

892,"I need to start this out by saying that I understand what I did was wrong and it wasn't my business to go into another person's personal space while they weren't home, but, at first, it was an accident, then it was more just shock. Also I feel like this could be taken as a humblebrag, but that's not the intention, at all. I merely talk about my weight/fitness/eating habits to outline the things that I do that seem to set her off.  


I had a rather traumatic event in 2016, which led me to being told that I wasn't mentally stable enough to work and I had to move in with my aunt in order for her to support me financially on the condition that I help around the house with things that are too hard for her to do anymore. She's 66, so even though she still works full time at a pretty physically demanding job, it can still be hard for her to do certain things around the house or in the yard. She also has some medical issues that seem to be reoccurring, though the doctors can't quite figure out why they keep coming back or why she keeps having such intense problems with her muscles.  


My main responsibility, though is taking care of my dog. He's pretty low maintenance and as long as he gets exercise and food, he's usually pretty chill. There are times though that he'll freak out if he thinks someone is too close to our house and he'll run to every window in the house in order to bark at them until they are far enough away from the house that he feels okay again.   


Yesterday was one of those days. He was looking out the window in my bedroom when he saw someone who was jogging go in front of the house. I had the guest room door closed, so he couldn't see out that window, but my aunt must of not pulled her bedroom door shut enough that it actually would hold. He ran into it and it flung open. He proceeded to run over to the window and shove his head past the curtain to look outside, which knocked over a package. I, of course, ran in after him to get him away from the window and shoo him out of the room. I went over to pick up the package to put back on her stand and I noticed that it had fallen off a table which also had what looked like a dresser drawer that was overflowing with candy and snack cakes.   


I put the package of peeps back where I thought it had been before Ash went in there and I turned to leave, sort of scanning the room now and I noticed another shelf in her wardrobe that had a bunch of cans of ravioli and soups stacked up in there. Now, I'm pretty confused and I see, next to the dresser, three reusable bags that appear to be bulging from being filled with something heavy. I knew I shouldn't have, but I couldn't help but to look over into the bags and all of them were also filled with cans of food. I didn't stay past that. I went out of the room, shut the door and went back to my room to pretend I didn't see anything.   


Some background to make more sense as to why I feel so guilty.   
I'm in my early 20's and have arthritis in my back, so it's extremely important that I do yoga everyday, to stretch out my back muscles or they get tight and become really painful. Also, I just enjoy it and I really like using it as a pre and post work out cooling off thing. I also try to take my dog out on a short run or a long walk at least three days a week. I definitely could be in better shape, but I'm pretty health conscious, overall.   


When I first moved here, my aunt was constantly mentioning how we should work out together, which I agreed would be fun, but she never seemed to actually want to. She was really open about doing things with me, she even would ask me to go into her room to get her something or do something for her. She taught me some cooking tips that would help me out and helped me get used to cooking on a gas stove.  


 It wasn't too long after I got used to being here that she started saying how fat she was all the time and how none of her clothes fit her anymore. Keep in mind she's probably 190 pounds max. I hate going to the gym, but I started going there instead, so she wouldn't feel so bad about not working out when I do. This didn't seem to do much to control her temper though. She started being miserable all the time and she started getting really mean to me to the point that even my friends and visiting family members would get angry at her. She stopped wanting to go out and do anything other than work. She even stopped picking up the phone or calling back her friends when they tried to reach out to her.  


 It was around this time that she started throwing up at night. I have a salt lamp in my room, next to my bed, so I tend to use that at night, instead of using my overhead while working on my art projects. I also don't really make any noise when I'm asleep, so it can be really hard to tell when I'm actually asleep without looking inside my room. It started becoming really common that around two or three in the morning she would come out of her room in a hurry and rush to the bathroom, throw up her guts for what felt like forever and sounded extremely painful, be silent for up to a minute and then casually go back to bed, as if nothing happened.   


She does have a history of depression, but claims that after a few months on anti depressants, the doctors told her that she didn't need to take the pills anymore, that she was doing well with coping without them. I also want to add that She's lost pretty much all of her teeth, though that could of been from the long history of chain smoking more than throwing up and she also is dealing with the after effects of having multiple ulcers that she left untreated for long amounts of time when she was younger. She also has this thing I can't remember the name of where the sacs in between her bones that are supposed to keep those spots lubricated so it's not painful when the bones move together isn't producing enough lubricant, which is causing a lot of pain and it's been recommended over and over she start physical therapy, but she won't.  


Intellectually, I know I have nothing to do with this. If this is how she has taught herself to cope and doesn't want help, then there's nothing that can be done. Emotionally, though. I've gotten to the point that I don't even feel comfortable wearing tight or revealing clothing around her, even in summer. I've started going so far as I'll get changed for the day and then wear an oversized baggy sweater until I get in the car and drive a ways down the road. After I'm ready to come home, I stop off the side of the road, before turning onto our street and put the sweater back on, then change into pajamas, pretty much, as soon as I get home.   


I feel bad whenever I do anything physical in front of her, even if it's just stretching my back, and I will choose not to snack, even if I'm hungry, because I know that she'll get mad that she's eaten half a box of nutty buddies for a snack when she got home from work and I'll get an orange or something. She already gets mad at me, all the time, and constantly is trying to contradict me, even if she has no idea what I'm talking about. I just feel like my entire life is turning into walking on eggshells around someone who gets mad about my habits and destroys herself in retaliation.   


I can't afford to live on my own and I have no one else I can move in with. My disability appointments have been cancelled until after this whole virus thing is over and even if I do get approved, I'll still have to wait up to five months before I start getting a monthly check. Her and I have to share a car right now, so that's not too helpful either. I constantly feel guilty and stay silent because I worry that anything I do or say will set her off, but I'm worried that my mental health is going to start deteriorating, eventually. I just feel so trapped and like I can't even talk to her or anyone about what I'm feeling because she'll end up exploding on me.   


It's a complicated situation, I know. I just don't know what else to do, at this point. I feel like a failure for putting her insecurity over my health and happiness, but I also feel like a horrible person for considering doing what's best for me, leaving her to deal with her emotions however she knows how.",06Apr2020,1

895,"Sorry if anything ends up being incoherent....

So I've always gotten good grades and kept up, or even ahead, in math/science classes, and been fairly consistent in other classes. I had no serious problems with the school system until high school (currently a senior), where everything got worse. Rather than getting teachers who were just kind of boring or inspiring, I was now getting teachers assigning  massive amounts of busy work, wasting the majority of class talking and assigning homework because of that, a shit-ton of bad technology/frustrating online work, ect. Not a huge deal but annoying. But what burnt out my ability to deal with it was health class and the end of Junior year. Each year I had been trying to take the required health class over the summer because otherwise it would conflict with my schedule, but each year they only let us sign up a month in advance with the actual date being announced the second last or actual last week of school, which always conflicted(4 weeks you can only miss 2 days). 

The end of Junior year arrived and all teachers are throwing multiple assignments at students every day, too much to actually complete in a day and get more than 4 hours of sleep in my case. I spoke with my counselor about the still required health class,  who told me they sometimes run health on days opposite of gym, which doesn't conflict with my schedule, and I asked what my options are if that is not an option. I was told not to worry about it... over the summer after the hell of constant homework I called and left multiple messages to the vp asking for an independent study in case, was told to wait for confirmation... 

Day before school I get called by my counselor and I have to drop a class to take health, she didn't know about the independent study, and was originally going to drop AP Chemistry, does this person know me?, I ended up dropping college level Spanish. Later I learn that there is a health class running on days opposite of my gym class, when I have study hall WTF!, And there are ways to take the class online or at a nearby college, and there were literal independent study forms in the office. 

This year we got chrome books, literal trash, while my ap chem class is working on ipads, and the tech issues have only gotten worse. Now that we are only working from home I don't havw to deal with some of them, but every teacher seems to be using a different platform, it's a mess. So e teachers have just dumped a ton of stuff on google classroom, like my English teacher's classroom, which gives me a headache every time I have to scroll for 30-40 seconds just to find the current assignment.

TLDR^ I can't do school work without a ton of frustration resurfacing, I don't have much respect/trust in the school system

Music helps by drowning out said frustration, but many assignments are video based.

Motivation has gone out the window, Only something right in my face feels real, or gets done, 
Many times, especially for writing, it takes ages to do anything:most of which is me sitting in front of the assignment thinking but not reaching a statement that seems appropriate/sufficient for the question

I have been quite alone and antisocial except for a small group of friends, but now with the current stress and time I am leaning too far in the other direction, I just feel like spending the whole day on discord voice chats...almost like all the loneliness from the past years finally caught up

How do I get back into a mental state to function?

I've spent the last 2 weeks Ill myself and looking after him, today being the first day back to work... I was in work at 7.30am and by 12.45pm I was  home due to my husband having worrying symptoms and needed me home. 

The doctors have given him Amitriptyline for what seems to be a  nerve issue...but my husband doesn't want me to go to work for the fear of today happening again or something bad happening and no one being around to help.

My life is getting hard to handle with my husbands health issues and work. The work itself isnt stressful but when each day has been going wrong or my husband getting worrying symptoms,  it's hard to know where I should be (in work / at home) and terrified about losing my job but then terrified to leave my husband to go to work. 

I dont have the option to work from home and his parents live far away from us so it's not like we can arrange for them to keep an eye on him... especially now with the covid19.

897,"TLDR: Friend put on public Instagram he wanted to kill himself, I wasn’t in a good state and was barely using my phone so I didn’t send him a message (wish I had), he then put message on his story about how someone (in particular) doesn’t care about him bc they didn’t talk when he said he was going to kill himself


I personally suffer from my own mental health issues, just for later in asking for advice. We’re both minors and I’m not sure what to do. 

I’ve known this guy on Instagram for about six months now. We talked on and off, and right from the beginning he seemed to have a rough home life. 

Fast forward to the last few weeks, he seemed really down about his life so I sent him a dm saying if he needs to talk, I’m here for him and he seemed okay. I myself struggle with dealing with mental health issues, and shit weighs on me like crazy, but I like to try and be as helpful as possible if someone is in the same boat or worse. Just to hopefully make them feel less alone. I personally don’t vent online or to just one person, but I know for some people this works better for them.

Today was a rough day for me, I had had a pretty major breakdown about something and took a break for a bit. But before putting my phone away, I noticed this guy had put on his public Instagram story ‘... got all the stuff I need to kill myself’ or something along those lines. I felt like shit because I wasn’t in a good state to message  him about it then, and I didn’t know what I could do; he had blocked me out yesterday and I didn’t know whether I should approach him or if he needed someone closer, as he does talk to people he knows irl. 

About an hour ago, he put on his story ‘to someone in particular, the less you talk to me the more Ik you don’t care’. I’m pretty concerned he’s referring to me here, and I sent him a dm immediately about if he wants to talk now, but he left me on read. I really don’t know how to deal with this, but I’d like to know what I should do next as it’s going to play on my mind for a while.",06Apr2020,1

899,"aight so i'm just gonna admit right from the start that this is probably just stupid high school drama, but i kinda wanna get something good out of school so i decided today that i wanna get revenge on this one particular fuckin asshat.

So in Danish schools you don't do that thing where you walk from classroom to classroom and have different classmates in different classes. You stay with the same people everyday, all day, all year, basically your whole school time. Now there is usually two or three ""classes"" depending on your school (three is most usual in my case). By classes i don't mean subject, but for example there's 6.a, 6.b and 6.c. It has nothing to do with grades or anything, it's completely random. Ever since i started school i've been in the a class. But when we started 7th grade we got told that if we were 56 or less students when our 6th grade year was over, we'd be made into two classes. 

We ended up being exactly 56 students left and we were divided into just two classes. I started with all my best friends and of course the one girl we're going to talk about.

cast: me (me), spoiled annoying girl (sag), my long-term best friend (lbf), my current best friend (bf) and my other friend (of).

So i don't really have a lot of friends but i don't really mind, as long as i have a few. When i started 7th grade with this whole new class i had a bunch of friends tho. But that was when sag came and just kinda ruined it. She was in the c class before and that meant she was one of the popular rich kids.

Sag has loads of expensive clothes and jewelry and that boosts her confidence ALOT. Of course i'm not saying she shouldn't be confident, but she's just a bit over the top. She's also EXTREMELY loud and attention seeking. At least 2 times during class she walks veeeery slowly over to the bin to throw out something. Oh yeah, and she never takes the discreet way over there, no, she has to take the one where everyone can see her. Not to mention that whenever she has made her way to the bin she does this weird little belly dance showing of her body. Oh and also, she has been wearing a fuckin THONG since she was like TWELVE (no, i'm not some creepy stalker, but she wears see-through pants like everyday). That wasn't what she has done to me, just some background on what kind of person she is.

Let me just tell you about the two single conversations we've had, in the many years we've known each other. Here's the first we ever had (it was over snapchat and took place not to long ago).

Sag: \*Sends me photos of herself with text saying something like ""ugh i'm so bored, please swipe up and send anonymous questions! I know you're a lazy teenager but it only takes 30 seconds!""\* 

Me: Could you stop sending me those? please?

Sag: \*Sends one more\*

Me: Hey, didn't you see my last message?

Sag: Yeah, but i don't care:)

Me: Welp

Sag: Wtf?

Me: Nvm

Sag: ?

Me: Google it

Sag: I know what it means just don't message me?

Me: Okay, any specific reason?

Sag: You're annoying

Me: Lol okay

At this point i knew she was a bitch, but i was kinda surprised, why was some girl i've NEVER EVER talked to suddenly being so fuckin rude to me? Oh well here's our latest convo:

\*some papers of mine are lying in the windowsill next to her jacket\*

Sag: What's this? \*picking up my papers\*

Me not wanting her to look at my things: \*grabs papers from her hand\* Those are mine.

Sag: Oh \*moves jacket far away from my papers with disgusted face\*

I haven't had any interactions with her since. I don't mind her disliking me much but what gets me pissed of is the fact that she's taking my friends away from me, one by one. She started with my best friend from since i was FIVE (lbf). One day lbf just stopped hanging out with me and bf, i was a bit confused at first but then she talked to me and said that she wanted to hang out with sag because ""she doesn't think me and her share the same interests anymore"" which is totally okay. Of course i got sad and cried in a toilet stall and all that shit, but i just felt that if she was happy i was happy. One day i hung out with lbf alone and she told me that sag was taking advantage of everyone in their group and that sag was currently mad at her because she couldn't cancel her plans with me to be with her instead. I think that's disgusting. Sag was literally forcing my long-term best friend to say yes to everything, because if she didn't, sag wouldn't want her in the 'popular' group anymore.  I tried to talk lbf out of being sag's friends but they stayed friends. 

Sag has done this exact thing with loads of my friends and i only have like 2 left. Of and bf. Of hung out with the popular group the years before 7th so she's still close with them and then there's bf. I've realized that sag has been overly nice to bf this year while still completely ignoring my existence. I haven't talked shit since 5th grade but i honestly can't help doing it whenever sag is annoying me. The thing is just that i can't even do THAT anymore because now bf and of likes her. A lot. 

So i've just been dealing with this girl taking my friends for years and i'm a bit sick of it by now. I mean she could at least leave one for me. Well, that's why i decided to get some revenge. If you made it this far, you might have some cool revenge ideas? I dunno if it's much to ask for, but i thought i'd give it a try.",06Apr2020,1

On **Feb/18** I saw the email of it being canceled so I emailed them when will I receive a refund.

On **Feb/20** I called both Beyerdynamic and BoA to asked about my refund, and I got the refund after the call in my BoA account.

On **Feb/21** I got an email from Beyerdynamic asking if I received the refund, and I said yes.

Between **Feb/21** and **Mar/03** the refund transaction history in my BoA account disappeared.

My dad never showed kindness or love to me or respected me or anything that a dad is supposed to do. Instead he berated at every chance he got. Judged for wearing whatever I wanted, never let me have any friends. Never once in my life I've sleptover at a friend's, because he couldn't trust me, he just assumed I'd do something wrong even before I actually started doing the wrong things. He never even let me visit them.

Mom on the other hand is very loving caring and let's me do things, in limit. Still doesn't let me stay at a friend's or anything cause she can't trust me either. They both think I'd just go and sleep with every guy I see. The reason they think this is cause I had a boyfriend at 16 and they didn't approve of it. In our culture it's a very very bad and wrong thing to do. So ever since they've always kept an eye on what I do or where I go and stuff. There was a time my mom didn't talk to me for months. I don't remember the reason but at the time all I thought was how is it that my mom, who's supposed to be the most loving person can do this to me. Her love should be unconditional or whatever, right? But it wasn't. She was only nice to me when I did everything like they wanted me to.

Fast forward to now. Even though she is very nice and caring or whatever I feel like it's not real. I cannot look her in the eye when we talk. I hate myself for that. I hate myself for not being nice to her like a good daughter should be. But I can't I just can't look at her. I don't hate her, I just don't know what this is. Dad, I don't know if I hate him but I'm pretty sure it's very close to that whatever this is. I just don't care about him. I don't want to see him, hear from him or anything to do with him which is difficult since we live in a same house.

I just need to know if there's anything I can do to be nicer to my mom. I don't want to be a shitty daughter and person. Yes I have lots of mommy/daddy issues because of them, I can't trust anyone to be caring or genuine, I need someone's approval all the time and a lot more pathetic issues that were caused by them.

The year passed, and we never talked until last week, when she reached out over LinkedIn message. 

We are both female, by the way. Also, she was a master's student when we met, so she's 26 now. I'm in my early thirties - so there's not a huge age gap between us.

908,"this irritates me, not every night but some. of course most nights i’m happy to abide by the rules since it only begins arguments which need to include everyone in the household. me and my younger sister share a room in a council-provided house and the council have refused for the past 3 years to provide a larger one. and since we first moved in we have had to share the exact same routine. due to COVID-19 neither of us are studying anymore or working and therefore there isn’t any need to get up early.

on a usual school night for my sister i will go to bed in respect that she needs to get up early and this usually doesn’t bother me - eventhough as an 18 year old being told to go to bed at 7PM is annoying as i’m usually not at all tired by then - or in the middle of doing something. however if i need to work (my place requires me to start at 5:30AM sometimes) she doesn’t go to bed early because she doesn’t need to. i don’t really understand how i must be making all the sacrifices. COVID-19 disrupting the routine has made little change at night, as i’m still being told to go to bed at the same time as her and turn all electronics off and hang up the phone on my boyfriend (we are in an LDR and his time zone is different so we are usually playing something). Despite nobody in my home waking up until about 10am most days, i am still told to go to bed when my sister is told - about 9pm at latest. 

this feels ridiculous, i’ve asked to sit downstairs where my sister is not disrupted or go somewhere else but my parents continue to hammer it into me that i must sleep too. of course i’ll be off to university soon and finally have my own space. but this still makes my days feel short. especially since i can not do anything too early in case i wake her up too. 

i just need advice in how to cope with this, how to feel like my days aren’t cut into the hours of an 11 year old when i am 18 myself. i don’t have any option to move out yet and am waiting to go to uni, any ideas or thoughts on the subject would really help me feel at ease - as i do feel guilty knowing that it is my parent’s house, and their rules. but i can’t help feeling i’m the one losing all the time.

I've sadly have contemplated suicide and nearly attempted from being in my household. 

My friends are the only ones that actually reached to me and never judged me for who I was. 

So, on the prejudice thing, my family hates gay people and are against mixed marriages with anyone that's not white or Hispanic (they're mixed themselves with Spanish and Irish). My father has drilled in my head to not date anyone that's not my skin color, and while my mom didn't support what he said, she is against me dating a woman. And it turns out, I'm actually a lesbian. No one in my family knows, except my half sisters since they're not as bigoted as them. 

I've heard all of my dad's rants against gays and the sorts, and I'm tired of it. I'm tired of being blamed for everything and being called awful things. All it does is make me go through depressive episodes and stresses me out. 

I just want to move out now, but up to the same city I want to go to university in. The places there are surprisingly cheap in the area, and there's more opportunities there than my city. There's more social events, a nice change of scenery, and somewhere to refresh. 

My mom hates my friend because she thinks I'm only leaving for her, which is not the case at all. I told her why, and she just ignored me. She brought up another excuse that its ""too expensive"", even though it's a nicely priced college that offers low tuition rates. And my career prep teacher said that it's cheaper to live in a non-housing apartment, and to do all my basics through a community college (which is what I'll do). Plus the apartments my friend wants to live in, don't charge for utilities. Over the summer before I leave, I'll be looking for jobs in that area with the help of a friend. And since I'm doing online classes, I can be mobile. 

My question is, can I just move out and move in with my friend without them approving anything document wise? I didn't know what my friend meant by that, but I don't want to held back because my parents refuse to sign something. I'm saving up, and not spending my money on anything miscellaneous, and I'm getting walkthroughs from already college kids I'm friends with on adult stuff. Since my own parents never did that, and just claimed they didn't know anything. 

Of course, this won't happen until this whole virus thing blows over. And I'm prepared to face what's for me if I do go. 

For more reference, I live in Texas. If that makes a difference at all. 

I just want out. And eventually I know my parents will charge me up the rear after I graduate, for rent. And they get nastier as time goes on, and they're close to trying to figure out my sexuality. I hate to say it, but I know I might get kicked out since my dad really hates gays. And finding out his only daughter is, will drive him insane and he'll lash out on me. God knows what could happen..

910,"So my gf got in a accident and they gave her a rental car until her car is done being repaired and so she called up our apartment management to let them know she got a rental and they won’t allow her to park it in her spot that comes with our apartment without the sticker.

Which she can’t get because she doesn’t get off work until later and once she gets off the repair place will be closed.

Our apartment management told my gf not to call the towing place  and I guess she was yelling

she still  called up the towing place because she has no other options and they said they won’t tow her but first they need confirmation from our apartment management and so she called back our apartment management and asked if they can give the tow place confirmation and the lady said no, that my girlfriend needs to get the sticker and she started yelling at my girlfriend for calling the towing place and so my girlfriend hung up .

It all seems a bit too much . Kinda like she’s having a power trip .

911,"So i recently got sick and im hoping to ask for some answers. 

(before i got sick i bathed my cat in the tub and it took me a good while to do so. i was on my knees for too long and i think that made me sore. i heard body aches were a symptom but all this happened and im not sure at this point if it was just me being sore from bathing my cat or a symptom of the virus. the areas of me that were sore were my legs and my bottom)

On thursday evening i had a massive fever with chills to the point that i was shivering uncontrollably and an infected throat. i believe its infected because the day before i slept with my mouth opened. no runny nose or coughing. took some pills for the flu and it helped a lot. enough for me to sleep for the night. 

On friday my fever came and went away from taking pills but i slept with the fever at night. i still had chills throughout the day. still no coughing or trouble breathing or runny nose. 

Saturday was the same as Friday. just chills and fevers and feeling dizzy. but i also cried because im afraid of what could happen so that gave me a headache. i also felt nauseas. wanted to eat but the smell of food made me gag. i barely had anything to eat this day. 

Sunday i started to cough. didnt let out any nasty coughs. had some chills as well. and still was nauseas. still no trouble breathing but i did feel some weird pains over my left side of my chest. it was a small tight feeling. i felt this before and was told it was nothing by doctors when i got it checked before this virus. so im thinking its just that same feeling. i did not eat much this day. 

Monday (today) had some food and i rejected it for tasting bad this morning. atm im able to eat some chicken soup. i had woken up feeling good but a bit dizzy. i took a nap after crying again and woke up with a huge headache. i dont have any body aches at this point. barely coughing. its only when i breath and the air brushes against my throat. 

i would appreciate it if anyone can help me if these are any symptoms of covid or just the flu. 

or let me know how bad the coughs have to be or how bad they should feel",06Apr2020,0
912,"Warning: Relationship- Long Post

So first I fucked up....
Cause I fell in love with this girl. We were in a 4 year relationship. During which she got pregnant, upon her getting pregnant she tells me that over the course of our relationship she’s cheated on me 3 times (and of course got super pissed off when I dared to ask “are you sure it’s mine- it is). She accuses me of cheating because I start talking to this other girl I knew from my old high school, (not sexually, not wanting to date, but she also recently had a child and was hoping we were doing okay and how I was blah blah) my ex took this as I was “emotionally cheating” which is no different if not worse than her actually cheating multiple times. So I cut off contact with my old friend. 
I forgave her for cheating on me, I still loved her, I wanted to marry her. Apparently she did not feel the same, she decided to move and take the baby at (4months old) to see her family up north. Which I was okay with being her family never saw the baby since it was born. She was supposed to stay for 2 weeks. About a week and a half into her trip she tells me she’s breaking up with me and not coming back, she lied to her family saying I was basically the devil and completely 180’d there opinions of me. The next 1-3 months after we kept in contact. After she had been gone for 3.5-4 weeks (including the 2 that was supposed to be a trip to see her daily) she tells me she slept with someone else and how it was a huge mistake and she just felt lonely and I sympathized with her. I go through a deep deep heartbreak and am still recovering from a depression I was in for 7-8 months since she left. After about 3.5 months of her being gone I cut off all contact with her till I could get myself together and figure out how to get my child back. During the 3.5 months we were still somewhat in contact she tells me she’s slept with 5-6 other guys, while saying men are trash blah blah blah, and how awful our entire relationship was to her and how horrible of a person I was. Despite not showing any of this while we were actually together. 
I cut off contact after she started dating someone else and her new boyfriend said he doesn’t think she should be talking to me or my family.
So here’s where I need advice...
A part of me as seriously hurt as I am, still actually loves her and has feelings for her. Kind of wants to be back with her to also help my child grow up. Another part of me thinks it’s a bad idea, considering our relationship really wasn’t great but we both went through tremendous life hurdles together and the 4 year relationship wasn’t nothing. I thought we really had a connection. She had said maybe it wasn’t the right time and later on we could try again cause she still has love for me, but she was saying not for another 5 years.
I kind of agree but think 5 years is way too long and I don’t want to get back with her if it’s going to be that far out.
I want to have sex with other people like she has(I’ve only been in 3 relationships cause they’ve all lasted years), but I’ve never done that and don’t really know how. At the same time a relationship doesn’t feel right to me. Granted now I’m at a point where I’ve learned to love myself and feel mostly stable alone. A week-ish ago she sent my mom a text saying if I wanted to come visit my kid I can and I can stay at her apartment if I wanted and be there for a few days. I’m not in any position to do that right now, but it makes me think maybe her feelings have changed. Also I haven’t seen my kind in 8 months, i missed his first birthday.

I know this is all long and jumbled but I really need an outside look and maybe just general advice. I’m confused and lost, and still kinda scarred.",06Apr2020,1

Some simply ignore, some actually respond politelty and some others respond harsher.

914,"


 I know this is cringey but I just feel very overwhelmed with emotions at the moment. I have really struggled over the past several months, to the point where I am constantly thinking about suicide. 

I feel so worthless, i have nobody in my life that values me. I have no examples that I can provide myself to create any argument that I have worth, even among people I consider my closest friends I’m laughably disposable. It’s so easy to ghost me or blow me off or ditch me because nobody cares about me or how I feel.

Women don’t want me either and I really don’t blame them anymore. It seems so apparent that despite any efforts I make I will never have anything to offer another person that will coerce them in to thinking I’m worth their time. I’ve tried everything I feel like is possible for me; I’ve bought a car, I go to college, I have a job, I’ve lost 85 pounds, I bought new clothes, nothing adds to my value. There was a time where I went a full 6 months without a single match on tinder or bumble while I swiped every day until i couldn’t anymore, I’m a disgrace.

I feel like I have nothing to look forward to anymore. Holidays alone, an empty home, nobody to turn to when I need help, I can’t live my life like that. What’s the point in making an effort when I know that it’s for nothing? I have proven to myself that it doesn’t matter how much effort I put in to fixing myself I will never be enough. I can’t handle this anymore, I drink and smoke weed every day just to make life bearable. I go to therapy but I can’t force myself to open up to anyone about this stuff so It’s just become another addition to a long list of disappointing failures. 

It feels like this is it, I am at the end of my tolerance. All I want now is to not have to feel like this anymore, I just want to be gone. I think about dying every day, it has become my only long term plan. That may sound dramatic and feel free to downvote but it’s true. I can’t delude myself in to thinking that I’m going to have a happy family and a good life like I did when I was in highschool, it feels disingenuous to act like there’s a future where I don’t end it.

My questions is, over the years, especially the last ones, she has loaned a lot and I don’t really have overview of how much she owes me. It’s definitely a really big number that she couldn’t pay me back in one go at this point of time. It’s really starting to irritate me that I don’t know how much she owes me. I’m not even certain she know how much she owes me. Any advice of how to broach the subject to her? I really don’t want to come of as an ass and hurt her.

I don't think I was misdiagnosed; I seriously don't believe that bipolar disorder exists. I think that if people were more honest with themselves about addressing the problems in their life and addressing their social skill deficits and if they learned to regulate their emotions better and think positively about themselves, they wouldn't be bipolar. I think all psychiatric drugs are poison, and I think psychiatry should be done away with as a medical specialty.

Basically I think I could've chosen to behave normally under the circumstances, but I chose not to, and now I will be punished for the way I behaved my junior year of high school for the rest of my adult life. 

I don't believe in bipolar disorder, ADHD, schizophrenia, etc. You can say that I'm ignorant, but I seriously don't believe in any of these conditions and I really do think that psychotropic drugs are poison.

919,"Warning: very small mention of suicidal thoughts. 

Background: my brother is unemployed, lazy, lives with my parents, and barley leaves his room.  He expects to be put first, mostly because my parents have enabled him to be that way.  

So this all started with my brother watching my daughter one day a week for a certain sum. It started off ok, but things started to get tense with him. 

  I would show up and he would still be asleep. He would get pissy if I woke him up.  He was usually up all night and morning playing his Xbox. 
 
He would get mad he would have to feed her even if I had just gotten off work, and picked her up from daycare. (Where she just had her scheduled  nap)  the money should covered this. He knew it was expected. Not to mention he uses his food stamps as rent to my parents. 

He started to demand more money to watch her. Which I did give him multiple times. 

I ask that he doesn't smoke with her in the room to do it on the porch. Which there was grumbling about that.  (How can he afford smokes? My parents)
 
There is more these are the main few 

So main thing. I was going through a rough patch at work and decided to prepay him for the next two weeks. When I gave him the money, he decided that the money wasn't prepaid, it was back pay. He demanded more.  That he needs it for yada yada yada. 

There is so much more, but I was just so done. I'm tired of getting walked on by my family.

I blocked him on Facebook.  For this and another reason. (As some one who used to be depressed, dealt with suicidal thoughts, I get very upset when my brother keep posting I'm gonna kill myself online for attention.  It was bad for my mental health. )

Other than that, I have not spoken to him in over a month.  I have not gone over to my parents house because I found some else to babysit. 

So my mom is upset she is not seeing her Grandbaby.  Which she is capable to come over, but she is TOO BUSY to do. (Her words, not mine) No I need to go over there, and put them first.

923,"Edit: Male in early 20s

Hey everyone, for some context, I'm a computer science student graduating after two more classes this fall, and have been working at one of the US's largest grocery chains for four years come the 23rd. I live with both of my parents and my sibling. I wanted to know what you guys think.

To be blunt, I want to quit for more than a few reasons, but this pandemic has largely become the main reason.  

Firstly, I hate my department. I liked and worked in another but talked a bit and got moved Jan. 2019. I legitimately hate my department. I'm calm but very open about it to people in store and my own department as well. After four years of retail the job as a whole kinda sucks. It's a first job so it's expected, but I've just had enough of costumers and the mind numbing tasks we do each day.

With everything going on, going to work makes me kinda nervous now. I work with the vitamins, hand sanitizer, soap, etc., so I'm interacting with people constantly telling them we're out of item X. Additionally, the prospect of getting the virus itself really scares me, coupled with the fact that both of my parents are in their early  60s and stay at home now most of the time, in the event I get it I don't want to risk infecting them. Two workers have left (temporarily) since each have a loved one that they don't want to get sick, so now I've picked up more hours despite wanting to work as little as possible during this pandemic.

Probably the most selfish reason, but since my classes have moved online, I wanted a month or so of just relaxing as my last serious semester comes to a close. I know it makes me sound lazy, but my friends all have been able to stay at home during all of this, and those lucky enough to be in an internship have been able to work at home as well. I feel a little annoyed in a sense, I'm jealous I guess. 

I know if the economy takes a dip a low paying job is still a *job*, but maybe I've just grown contemptuous towards it.  I have a vacation happening in three weeks, and I've considered putting my two weeks in and taking my remaining PTO days before I leave. 

I'm really torn though. I'm young and a job is a job, but I feel like quitting is the wrong choice since it's such a huge commitment and change of a lifestyle. With everything going on though and more news each day of people getting sick and dying it makes me feel unsafe and vulnerable going out to work. What do you guys think?",06Apr2020,1

For context: My mother is crucial to the survival of my family. She takes care of literally everything, from basic house chores, grocery shopping, cooking both supper and dinner on a set schedule (12pm sharp &amp; 6pm sharp.) She picks up after everyone in the house (I have never seen my father put away his plate after a meal). She does LITERALLY everything for my two older brothers and my dad, who all live together working on the family farm. On top of which, she takes care of all the financials, insurance, etc. 

My dad, without discussing this with my mother, wants me to move home for the summer and take ALL OF THAT ON on top of caring for my mother while taking my classes online. 
I know for a fact that I cannot do it to the standard that is expected. I’m genuinely freaking out and I am racked with guilt. I want to help my mom but shit. I’ve been clinically diagnosed with C-PTSD and depression and my mental health could not take an entire summer of that. 

Please know that my brothers are both callous and useless, meaning they’re unlikely caregivers. My dad is the same. 

What do I do? I’m fine with making the three hour drive as I can and staying for a little under a week at a time but that will leave my mother and the rest of my family without care. There’s the option of other family helping out here and there, but my mother is too prideful for that to last. 

I don’t know how to tell all this to my dad. He’s incredibly emotionally absent and has some cognitive processing issues due to some head trauma, so he literally cannot understand.

931,"Me and my roommate get along very well and are great friends. 

Some brief background, my mom is in the age range of people most likely to get super sick/die from the virus. At the moment she is sick (not coronavirus, but a fever and stuff) and her doctor told her not to leave her apartment and I have been helping bring her things from her office and groceries. I work at a fast food restaurant (different than my roommates chain) and as a result I am exposed to a lot of people and am wary that I may spread the virus to my mom without even realizing it.

This is why my roommate is frustrating me. She is a manager at a national fast food chain, and as a result of the virus she has had to cut everyone's hours at her store. One of the managers at a store in a city an hour away from us (with higher coronavirus cases then we have) got sick with flu like symptoms and was told not to work for two weeks, and my roommate decided to volunteer to take his place at his store, because she is bored and wants to work more (she is good financially and does not need money). I told her that was stupid and created unnecessary risk for me and my family, and she said something like ""You can't live life without taking any risks and I'm not going to get it. We are all going to get it one day and its not going to kill me"". She then did the math and calculated the percentage of the population of the city with the virus (which is very small) and said that it is very unlikely that one of them would walk into her store.

That was a week ago, since then she has gone to the other city and another city even further away with more cases than us a few times. I am thinking of telling her to just stay at her boyfriends place if she is going to keep doing this. If she gets the virus from these trips and give it to me and I give it to my parents (who are older and one is sick atm) and they get super sick/die I will literally never forgive her.

I hinted that I was open to taking it further by getting serious, he wasn't ready for it to go further but said he definitely didn't want it to end. Fair enough, I still had my doubts too. Now I'm definitely ready to get serious, and he says he would like that too in the future but isn't quite at that point yet. Thing is, he's the nicest person I've probably ever met, but even he admits he likes attention from people. He's the centre of the party, everyone loves him (for good reason) and he loves that too. Now I'm wondering if maybe he likes me out of everyone else is because I give him a lot of attention (I have a bit of anxiety but he's always saying how much he likes spending time with me, he initiates phone calls, texting too).

TLDR:
Dating an amazing person who likes getting  attention a lot. They still have reservations about getting serious but that's fair enough because our initial agreement in September was to be casual.
How do you know a person likes you not just because you're the only person around giving them attention? Do you just have to have blind faith?",06Apr2020,1
936,"Hi all,

First off, sorry for the wall of text, I’m on mobile. 

Okay for background, I work at a dealership in California as a service advisor and I’ve been here for nearly 2 years. When the shelter in place order went into effect, our business died. We have barely anyone coming in, and what little work we have is generally just oil changes or other scheduled maintenance. 



If you don’t know how service advisors are paid, here’s a quick rundown. We make our regular hourly pay with overtime, plus commission. Normally I make about 110 hours per pay period. The way our pay plan is set up, we make commission on a percentage of our gross sales over a certain amount, which is set to 20,300. For example, say I sold 25,300 for the pay period, I make a percentage of 5000. 



The reason that’s important is because like I said, business has died. So we’re not making anything anywhere near 20k in sales. The owner also cut our hours, so we’re open for 8 hours instead of 10.5, with a mandatory unpaid one hour lunch, and we are only working 3 days per week. So, now I’m doing about 50 hours. An average check for me used to be anywhere from 1600-2200 and now I am only making about 500. 



To help employees, the owner drafted a new pay plan. In this new plan, as long as you met these certain performance metrics (showing up to work, writing up a fair percentage of cars, paperwork done on time etc) you were guaranteed $1300 plus a potential for bonuses based on your average amount of hours per repair order. 


Fucking awesome right? Well as it turns out, this was lined out in a mandatory meeting that I was not informed of, because I was told to stay home that week and no one thought to inform me. Because I didn’t go to the meeting, I am excluded from the new pay plan. So I still get to make my measly $500 a pay period instead of actually making a livable wage like everyone else. 



My direct supervisor offered to lay me off so that I can collect unemployment and I’m really tempted to take the offer, but the catch is that I won’t have a job when this is over. 



What do I do, Reddit? Do I take a massive pay cut but keep my job or do I lose my job but get more money?",06Apr2020,1
937,"So basically last year i started dating this girl, she was really nice and we've been dating for 6 months, we've broken up once i'd class it as a break to have some time to ourselves, but i don't know if she's good for me, she did cause my mental health to drop, it's never been good, but she's helped me through severe crippling anxiety, Currently i'm 3.5 weeks clean from self harm which is a big accomplishment, i started to self harm a 5 weeks after i met her, basically she told me what had happened to her it had to do with sexual abuse n other things and i was at a low point and it made everything worse tbh i should have told her but longs story short i overdosed and took 57 herbal pills and a few paracetamol had to get rushed to the hospital, so a few days later things started getting better. But there is also problems within my family such as people in my family relying on me with tech which is very pressuring imo.

So 3 months into dating i had found out she had lied our entire relationship, this is where my cutting really took off well not really so my dad found out about my cutting and started getting angry at me as a i guess a defence mechanism and took away my razor blade which caused me to smash my only phone and use the glass to cut myself with i eventually got that undercontrol until i found a blade.. i started using that but then my SO got me to stop, i'm also suicide free for 4 months which is good, i have severe trust issues because i was abused sexually and physically by a family member and i have extreme paranoia so anytime she talks to guys i get really anxious, but i try not to let that interfere. I need a therapist but honestly, im on a wait for 8+ months mainly because if the coronavirus outbreak, and i can't get online therapy for free, cause my parents wont pay. Honestly i have all the love for this girl but idk i think i may have rushed into things without thinking about consequences, so if i break up with her ill break her heart again and i'm starting to rethink my choices, but at the same time i don't want to leave her cause i love her and she makes me happy, i've been keeping diary logs for the past week i guess it's just my emotions but i have severe mood swings.",06Apr2020,1

Immediately afterward, my boyfriend started getting mad at me about how I handled the conversation. He seemed extremely offended, saying that I was too awkward and ruined it, that I shouldn’t have said anything etc. It hurt my feelings and I tried to tell him that it was harsh, but he always accuses me of making things into problems and getting mad too quickly.

Then her mom called back and her dad tried talking to her and she did the same thing.

It seemed rude to me and when I mentioned it she said it wasn’t a big deal and she’ll just apologize next time they talk and it’ll be back to normal.

I understand she’s frustrated and has a few things to figure out about her future with this pandemic going on. I just thought she could’ve handled it way better and should call to apologize ASAP.

I also don’t want to blow anything out of proportion and get involved with all that if it isn’t something I should.

946,"So recently my friend hasn't been all that responsive. She's 18 and I'm 18 as well. We've been friends for over a year and dated briefly around a year ago. She was cool with being friends after we broke up. She didn't really talk to me at all after that for a few months. She did break up because of some mental health issues so I wasn't too surprised about her not answering for those 3 months. 

Anyways, I recently visited her for her birthday. I came over to her place, gave her a gift, talked for a little while with her, and drove her to work. I messaged her almost 2 weeks later trying to start up a conversation with no luck. We talk on both messenger and through texting. She hasn't looked at any of my messenger messages I sent her months ago (and she's active on facebook for at least 2 hours a day) and I suspect she ignored them (a feature on messenger). I know she has time to talk with the whole quarantine thing going on. 

I've always been the one who starts the conversation. Once we get to talking we used to talk for hours but nowadays she hardly talks for half an hour. I've asked her if she doesn't want to be friends anymore but she keeps giving me the excuse that she has no time. I don't know, it feels like she only talks to me out of pity or something. 

Should I try to talk to her more (maybe send one message?), tell her how I'm feeling about her blatantly ignoring me, give up entirely, or something else?

951,"I go to a small school of 1800 kids in Florida called Eckerd Colleges it’s pretty random and not a name brand school. It’s great and I have formed a lot of close relationships with my profs ect. but I only have a 3.0-3.2 gpa (we will see where if is after coronacation). Being at home reminds me of how comfortable I am in NJ. Socially at school I have not done that well. Idk if this is normal but I only have one good relationship with a friend there and sometime they even act sketchy. The school is p dramatic socially and I’ve been in 2 friends groups due to rejection. The social scene of Florida is very looks based as well and I a “thicc” girl get left out often too bc of my body. Which is obviously fucked up. Although I have a v pretty face (idk why I’m telling you this). I obviously have emotional/social problems that caused them to reject me. Ik I need to solve this problem for myself. I feel very alone all the time though.

If I transferred to the local college Montclair State next semester (if we are even going back) and tried to finish my history degree ( I am an idiot with little direction) and tried to add a management degree would that be a wise choice. I feel so depressed all the time. Or should I just tough it out at Eckerd one more year and feel miserable (develope an eating disorder ect.) If I do this I can’t add a management degree. 

Would grad schools judge me?

954,"Hi there. A huge dilemma on my hands.

This is a really long story so I'll just to abbreviate it as best as possible, and only include the most pertinent details.

So, I acted really badly for a year and a half. In the process, I hurt two people in very similar and very deep ways. I lied and manipulated repeatedly and in general was very, very destructive.

My lies were discovered and both parties were devastated. I have had to work hard every day to try and save one relationship (with my girlfriend) and start the very long, gradual process of rebuilding trust and healing the damage done. However, one stipulation of this rebuilding effort is that I refrain from contacting the other person who I hurt. At first, I was OK with that because I assumed the other person wouldn't want me to contact her.

However, she has been reaching out to me periodically, and I know she is looking for an apology and explanation for my behavior, as well as some closure. I've had no contact since she discovered my behavior and I left her completely in the dark (in order to save relationship with girlfriend). I feel guilty and it's weighing on my soul. I need to apologize. I need to explain. I need to offer closure. But doing so would mean betraying my girlfriend. It would also introduce the possibility of chaos back into my life, as the other person can be quite vindictive and is (justly) probably still pretty angry with me. Now, especially with my life in the precarious position it is because of COVID-19 (job loss, loss of home), I don't need any more chaos. 

I feel stuck, because i want to move on and become a better person and treat others around me with respect and kindness, but this dilemma feels like a huge obstacle. I feel like treating the other person with respect means offering an apology, but that would hurt my girlfriend. But continuing to ignore the other person means that I'm hurting her. I can't see a way forward in which i don't continue hurting somebody..

Can anybody offer their thoughts? I'm paralyzed by the dilemma.",06Apr2020,1

Idk if she is just getting super horny or what but she is constantly telling me how thicc she is, how big her ass is getting (and she keeps on saying that over and over), how big her boobs are getting and saying ""it's a pain having to carry 6lbs of boobs on your chest"", and a whole assortment of other sexual things.

All I can think to say is ""lol yeah"" or something like that. I'm really kinda speechless because I don't want to say anything to extra because she has a bf already. She's usually never been like this and only started it up after him and her began having sex several months ago. To make matters worse it's starting to make me get feelings for her to when she talks to me like this. Like I'm a virgin so when a girl is telling me how big her ass and boobs are it does turn me on a little and I can't help it. I wish she wouldn't talk this way to me until I atleast can find me a gf and won't be tempted into getting anymore feelings for my friend.

961,"I’m a stay at home mum so the quarantine, doesn’t really affect my routine very much. Since a few weeks ago I have been struggling with panic attacks that lasts days and anxiety. I realised the root of that is the continual coverage of the COVID16 pandemic and the way people talk about it. I’m from Christchurch, NZ and in the last 10 years we have had earthquakes and terrorist attacks, and I think that the root of my anxiety this time around is both the continual coverage and just the constant disaster talk. It feels as though it’s been going on for 10 years and this is just another disaster on top of those that already occurred. 

I can deal with the coverage, I choose not to watch the news or any social media updates and just every so often check the latest update from the prime minister. That has been okay.

The problem I am really struggling with is I don’t want increased contact with people (by phone/online), I’m finding it very triggering. I am quite introverted in general, so my weeks consist of a few interactions usually a visit with my parents and catch-up with a few friends. However I am quite socially competent so have a wide range of friends. This has meant now they all want to have zoom catchups and are constantly messaging now they are all at home. In addition my mum’s way of coping through these types of things is talking about it. My parents are wanting to skype most days and my mum even pops around to drop off things from her garden off without coming in contact with us. She wants to see the baby and chat through the window. I’ve been quite cold in my interactions with her/them and she knows something is up, but that heightens her desire to talk. I feel really guilty about that.

I would love advice from anyone as to how to go about addressing this, I feel like if I told anyone that I’m not coping they would just want to talk about it and reach out, which is not what I want. I’m am perfectly happy in my bubble with my husband, not talking about disasters and cherishing every milestone with our baby. 

Also How do I set up boundaries with my parents now? In the past disasters my mum has really struggled, so I have allowed her to come around and constantly talk about it. This time is different for me emotionally and I don’t know what to do about it.

I’ve never been one to want to do anything. I’ve always  wanted to be an interesting person, with interesting interests, and an overall a passion. But I don’t. I am stuck in a loop of reddit, youtube, sleeping, and eating. I don’t consider myself an idiot. Just a person with potential who wastes it. Reading has always been easy for me, so school has always been a breeze. I’ve never really worked for things in my life and it shows on me. As soon as something is difficult, I quit. As soon as something requires me to think, just even a little, I find it annoying. I don’t want to think back on my life and realize I did nothing but scroll, mope around about my appearance, and depend on others.
I see people like Joji and other passionate artists and I want to do that. I want to be passionate, I want to work, make memories, but I still can’t bring myself to do it. One of my teachers told me “You have so much potential, and I don’t want to see that you’ve wasted it. All you do is play video games, when you could really be changing our world.” I want to be able to do this. I want to have passion. Her words have stuck with me ever since.

973,"I am a student who was living with my two very old relatives in another country. They gave me a room, I was paying for it and all. We were never that close and they offered me to live with them even tho the price wasn't that low. I accepted and they would occasionally offer lunch, coffee and all of that, emphasizing how they always give away things and help people (first red flag). They told me how during my long 2 month holidays when I will be home, I won't have to pay as it is oftentimes the practice there with students. Would be okay with me either way, but fine, great. I had a semester before coronavirus and went home, they still demanded the rent which I found weird because of our initial plan but I payed, however now I'm unable to go back against my will and won't be for another 2 months. NONE of my student friends are paying for their residents, even in other countries. They called me mad about not paying (also I'm unable to), and I asked what about our deal with no rent during holidays, especially since you always go into my room and it's not like you were usually renting, you were calling it a favor. She attacked me for making things up and how she said that we will see when the time comes, which is NOT TRUE.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel manipulated and played a fool, especially since she was saying how they would offer me food and how this is unacceptable. She also started the whole call with how she now needs to pay her duties like everyone else which is what I should have to do too.

975,"Hi all, throwaway here, I am 25F and live with my long term partner, 27M. He has diabetes and is therefore at high risk for complications from COVID-19. We live in CA and have been staying at home since March 14th, save for pharmacy runs and outdoor walks. 

Today, I went to a medical appointment that was screening for a serious condition and couldn't be postponed. I don't have a car, so I took the bus - most of the buses are empty these days, and it's easier to distance yourself from people than it is in a Lyft. 

However, after getting on the bus, a family with five children got on, and the kids immediately swarmed around me. No one had masks. I was trapped due to where I was in the bus and couldn't get a safe distance away. Finally, I managed to move away, but then another gentleman (possible homeless? no judgment there, just for context) coughed directly onto me and dropped part of his sleeping bag onto me. I had a cloth mask and sunglasses on but no other protection. 

Now I am home, and after showering and washing everything I was wearing, I am coming to terms with the fact that I was likely exposed today and probably should behave as if I have the virus. I am trying to figure out the best next steps to avoid giving it to my partner. Our apartment is too small for us to effectively distance, even if I slept on the dining room floor and stayed out of the bedroom. 

One of my neighbors has an air bnb rental with its own entrance that's completely separated from their house, and they are willing to let me rent it for the next couple weeks. It's expensive, but we are in the lucky position that we can sort of afford it right now. The neighbors are in their 70s, but in all likelihood I would never even see them (I can let myself in with a keypad) so I could avoid transmitting it to them. 

Another option is to stay with a friend of mine. She has no preexisting conditions, but lives in a small one-bedroom, so it would be difficult for us to isolate from each other there as well. She also lives quite a ways away, and it would be hard for me to get back to my place if I need to without having her drive me. However, this option is free. 

What would you do in this situation? Part of me feels like I'm overreacting, but I realize that overreacting is kind of what we all need to do right now. If I stay home and try to half-ass the distancing, and my partner gets sick, I will never forgive myself. Let me know your thoughts.",06Apr2020,1
976,"I just turned 18 in the last 2 weeks. 

Backstory- For a year I had been getting intense pains in my lower right stomach. The first time it happened I thought it was appendicitis, so I went to the ER. They said it was constipation and let me leave. I kept getting reoccurring pains pretty regularly, for 2-3 days at a time before they went away, and would come back in 2-4 weeks. However, I assumed it was just constipation so I added more fiber, started exercising, staying hydrated,etc. Nothing helped. But everyone kept telling me it was constipation and I just needed to exercise more/eat better. 

I finally got scheduled for an ultrasound after going to a different doctor. I went to the appointment this morning, and the technician informed me she was also going to do a transvaginal ultrasound after completing the normal scheduled one. I was a little confused/shocked. Then my family doctor called me this afternoon to say a large mass was found in my pelvis area. I now have a CT scan scheduled this week for further examination, and will likely have surgery in 3-6 months to remove it. 

I don't know what it is, if it is benign or malignant, causes, anything, just that it is a ""mass"". How do I handle this without extreme anxiety or stress?

977,"I’m a 20 yo woman. I live near my dad who is my best friend. He’s never steered me wrong, has put me through school, has supported me in every way possible, and who loves me unconditionally... the only one who’s ever showed me true love. In this world is just us. Me him and my aunt and my grandma. A family of immigrants who put one foot in front of another bite the nail and prevail. 

My dad has dated a woman for some 15 or so years. She has 3 children and while I grew up in another state with my mom they all lived as a separated family until about 3 years ago they moved in together but never married because he says he built and empire for us and for me to carry on just as his mom did her kids. On the totem pole I’m just below him and he’s stayed true to it my whole life. 

The other day my “step mom” who I’ve dearly come to accept as my “parent” outted me. She said “it’s always something specially for her isn’t it?” In a snarky attitude. My dad cocked his head and started with the “don’t you ever cross me and my daughter, I’ve given your kids quite a fucking life. Cars, educations, I’ve housed their SOs and given more than I should have if you feel I’ve treated everyone like second class citizens.” 

This hurt because I grew up in a family where I was still the step child of the house and always felt it. But here I was beginning to feel accepted I started introducing them together as “these are my parents”. I didn’t know she thought of me in that way. I thought she thought of me as equal or as possibly. This is the second time she’s ever done it but the first time I was young and not present. I believed before she treated me different but I felt the effort was always there. I respect that my dad had my back and he always has and I don’t believe I’ll ever see a day that he doesn’t. I mean even when I’m wrong he’s the most understanding guy and really tries to get me to see things his way and pretty much every time he gets his way because I respect him so much and value his opinion deeply. He tells me not to worry about it and she does love me but why the snarky ness? I’m not mean I’m not ugly to her if anything I really appreciate her. Now I feel like I don’t. I feel like I hate her. I feel like if she thought this way about me was she upset when I moved here? Was she upset that this wasn’t just her family anymore?

Long story short, I work for a small company that's in the process of trying to get the small business loan from the government, but there's no telling when that's gonna happen. 

My boss isn't laying anyone off, but he made it clear that he's unable to pay anyone unless he's able to get the loan. He says it may take around 3-4 weeks, but that seems like wishful thinking. 

Even before this, the company I've worked for has been in dire straights for a while (not gonna go into specifics or say which company it is), so to be frank I don't think this company is even gonna make it.

My family is encouraging me to just go ahead and file for unemployment, and if by some miracle the company is able to scrape by, that I can just contact UI and cancel the claim. 

Right now, I'm still technically employed since I'm working from home, but I'm not getting paid a cent by the company, and I'm not sure if they're gonna be able to get the loan or not.

Asking this question because being quarantined during this pandemic has been hard. 

I currently live with my husband of 3 years in a small apartment. Things have been pretty rocky between us for the past year or so and this quarantine isn’t helping. 

In the past year i have suffered from emotional, and physical abuse from this person. He’s not loving, he’s not helpful around the house, I’m the sole earner in the house (he’s in grad school - will be for 3 more years fml) and he doesn’t compromise, he’s hard to work with and slowly i am not even sure if I’m attracted to him anymore. I don’t feel close with him, or even like we’re friends anymore. 
I’m so scared because i have no where to go, i can’t see my family (i live far from them) because of the pandemic and i keep forging his terrible actions. 

He’s made a couple of moves that were wrong in front if others that i disagreed with and warned him not to do but he did anyway and got him into a lot trouble. He argues over the tiniest things and doesn’t work with me at all. I just don’t know what to do. I try to be kind, understanding of study schedule and everything that j can be. I cook, clean, earn, have hobbies and goals of my own that are left behind because of his grad school. He yells, gets angry and does his own thing the entire day and doesn’t help at all with anything. He doesn’t touch me or come close to me except when he wants to have sex, which i force a lot of times to make him happy. I’ve given up so much for him but i don’t know how to get away from something that’s causing me so much unhappiness. Is there love where the spouse loves you more daily? And is excited to see you all the time and wants to be around you and care for you? Or is that just me? And am i just breaking my own heart? 

I don’t know what to do and I’m so scared because i am embarrassed and too scared to get a divorce. Maybe that’s the right thing to do, but i just don’t know how i could ever do it. My parents and his would be so upset. How would i show my face to my siblings and explain why it happened? I try so hard with his family, make a lot of effort for his sake but don’t get much back.

We are from the same town, but I came back to work my job near my university because our volunteer EMS agency needed help (most of their roster is students - who aren't at the university now).

It is a rural area, and we haven't been hit hard yet. SO is worried, and I'm doing my best to reassure her that I'm following our protocols, keeping up to date with the CDC recommendations, and I'm not getting complacent. She asked me if I would move back to our home state If I found a different job, to which I answered 'yes,' thinking she meant as a part of my ongoing search for a post-graduation job in a non-medical field.

Now her mom is trying to get me a job working security at some company. I'm faced with some moral and ethical dilemmas. 

1. My EMS agency has not struggled with our patient load yet (We are in a pretty rural area). However we don't have many people to spread our shifts out among. I can't estimate how me leaving would affect them / my community.
2. I feel like I have a duty to my community. I've been here to help for the past few years, but it feels wrong to bail now.
3. This potential other job (really any other job) pays more. All I get in EMS is a stipend. Just recently my EMS agency got emergency funding to pay hourly for our shifts (about $10/hr to attract back our staff that left the area when school shut down). I'm broke, and I do like money.

Any advice on what I can do to reassure her that it is best if I stay in healthcare for now? (I feel ethically committed to this job until my lease is up in a month / until this virus dies down)

Then Friday I believe, he called me. We talked for short while. No big deal, I was happy to hear from him....

Then Saturday night he called and we video chatted and he played his guitar for me and did the voices he knows I love.

Last night he called to video chat again, I answered. We chatted and he was drunk and being adorable and funny. He started playing his guitar and said he wrong a song for me and played it on his guitar. When he wasny playing, he held his phone up so I could see all of him.

Is there any way I can get my money back or something? Is it too late now that its been 5 or 6 months?",06Apr2020,1

1004,"I (27M) live with my mother (56F) in Canada. When I say I live with her, I mean we still live in the same rental that I grew up in, she is still the primary tenant, but I pay rent and most of the bills. This situations has been like this for 5 years now.

For those 5 years she has been unemployed. She used to be a crossing guard, which paid user 1k a month. So growing up, most of our bills were paid by social assistance programs. Once I started working, those programs cut her off, so she has been my dependent.

---**Context about my mother and her situation**---

I said my mother was unemployed, but really, she's unemployable. Crossing was the only job she ever had. Go to the school, twice a day, two hours a day, five days a week, 8 months out of the year. That's all she did. Didn't graduate highschool, didn't learn any transferable skills. Now that it's over, there really is no valid employment for her. She is still in good health, but even if someone would hire her, she does not have the will to work full time. That's what I have seen, and believe. She has no will to try something new, or hard. I don't even blame her for that. Those government programs enabled her to coast through life for over 30 years, and now expects her to be able to support her self. If it came down to working a retail job, or living on the street, she would rather end up on the street.

I feel like my mother is a walking time bomb. That she will eventually break and self destruct. I know she is bored with life, and miserable. I hear her crying when she thinks I can't. She has no friends, no hobbies, and no personal interests. All she has really been able to put any effort into all of these years is taking care of me. I know that sounds a big egotistical, but I know she would agree with me.

We don't have a healthy personal relation. Never have. She puts her relationship with god before us. I have a lot of resentment from my younger years over that. We've talked about it before, but every discussion ends in an argument, and every argument end in her making it about her. How she did her best raising me, and how she everything she does now is in my best interest, and therefore anything she does is infallible (only slightly paraphrasing, actually). She is quick to anger, very confrontational, and the most stubborn person I have ever met.

\-\-\-\-

I am so tired of living in this house with her. I'm afraid, and anxious, that I'm loosing these early years of my life, stuck with her. I feel completely trapped. I have not had a romantic relationship in these years, and I feel like I cannot even consider it, because I refuse to expose someone to such a nasty person. 

I actually did this once when I first got stable employment. She was still pulling the ""My house my rules"" shit even though I was already paying the rent at that point. We had an argument which ended in her telling me to get my own place if I don't like it. So I did. I picked out an apartment and made the down payment without telling her until I had a date to move in. When I told her she broke down crying. She begged me not to go. She begged me to ""at least take care of me until I'm dead"". I broke down too.

I'm not heartless to the situation. I only have bad things to say about her, but I still love her as a mom. I've been crying the whole time writing this because I'm scared of what will happen to her if I leave, and I'm scared of what will happen to me if I stay. How many years will I be in this situation. She says she's on a waiting list for social assisted housing (which are places we have lived in the past). But we've been on that list for 10 years now. I don't even have proof it exists, but that's been exit plan for both of us all this time. 

---
So that's my situation. I can hear her crying about the argument we just had, in an hour or two she'll come up, tell me how she's doing her best and that I'm the problem, I'll counter by saying were both at fault, and she'll walk away thinking she's has done no wrong, and pray that I will come closer to god. I don't know what kind of answers I'm expecting. Everyone has different ideas on the value of family. I guess I'm just looking for someone to tell me I'm not a monster for wanting to abandon her, or some eccentric billionaire to offer to take care of her.",06Apr2020,1
1005,"Sorry this is so long, TL:DR @ the bottom sorry for format 

So on Christmas of 2017, we were all but disowned by my moms side of the family. We (Mom, Dad, brother [14, 12 @time], and I [16, 13 at the time [my brother and I are a year apart, I born in February, he was born in July, which is why the ages are werid before someone asks] had an arguement, I'm not sure about what honestly, but my grandparents and aunt were drunk, yelling and screaming, I remember my aunt had tried to pin my mom to the floor to punch her? and my grandmother tried getting at my mom while she was on the floor, and I just remember sobbing while pulling in the back of my grandmother's sweater. 

its was kinda traumatic, and I'm still angry about it. they All acted like children in my opinion, and honestly, I kinda hate them. For the past two years, my grandparents have been dead to me. I practically tortured myself trying to have a relationship with my aunt, but after a few months, I realized that if I'm feeling absolutely dread everytime shes texts, that not healthy, and I should really just cut her out. So I blocked her. That was in 2018.

Flashforward to a few days ago. The deadman came a callin' and my grandfather called. I thought I had come to terms with everything, but all ot took was three blasted words of ""I love you"" rip off the scabs and the floodgates come open. But, he did call on his own accord, and didnt even tell his wife so he couldnt be talked out of it. 

But anyways, my aunt. That call got me thinking, my mom asked if he knew what happened, and he said he didnt. I believe him. But of I had to pin point the whole situation, it's my aunt and my grandmother who seem to be at the center. I've havent spoken to my grandmother since then. Frankly, I didnt really speak with her before then either, she was kinda crazy, and never made an effort to try to get to know me as a person, even if academics weren't her thing, we still had stuff in common, and while I know I could've made the effort to talk to her, but I was that the oldest 14 when we still talked, so I didnt exactly have emotional intelligence yet. 

My aunt, I did have a decent relationship with, and she did care, but after this, I really have trouble separating those good memories I have of her, from the bad ones. and even when we still texted, she was usually drunk when she texted (shes also an alcoholic). I dont think I want a relationship with her again, but I do want to ask her what the hell happened that day. I just want answers. 

TL:DR I have shit relations with my maternal aunt and grandparents, they all kicked us out and stopped speaking for two years. I tried to have a relationship with my aunt but that wasnt healthy so I cut her off, I want to text her to get answers about the family situation, and then just block her again after I get them.",06Apr2020,1
1006,"For instance, I am getting a big (for me) chunk of money. I told my SO about it and he started talking about all the hobby stuff he needs (subtle I know). This is typical, and usually I'm just whatever and let him get whatever tf he wants.

But it's at a point where he spends all extra money on hobby stuff so his shoes are old, his clothes are old. You get the picture. So... I said actually, I was thinking of buying you some shoes.

He got real quiet and hasn't really talked much since. Is this childish or weird? I mean I get like ""not wanting a gift you didn't ask for"" but in this case he NEEDS shoes and I know 1000% for a fact he will be happy when he is wearing them.

I realize in a reverse scenario I would have to also be okay with it, but I think I would be. If my bf got money, his own money, and said I could have some for clothes, I would be grateful, not disappointed.",06Apr2020,1
1007,I’m 23/f and I’m currently 270lbs. I’m trying to get down to 190lbs. I come from an obese family. We’re all fat. Lately I’ve had tons of motivation to get into a healthy lifestyle. My family doesn’t support me though. I’ve been doing good by myself without their support and I’ve lost 20lbs on my own since I started my journey in February. It’s just hard when they bring fast food home and snacks/treats and tease me with them. They also tell me you won’t be able to do this for too long. You’re gonna gain it back in no time.

1008,"I (22f) went out with 24m for about 3 months at the end of 2019 that I met on tinder. I ended things with him in Jan, but attempted to reach out in the beginning of March. It didn’t really go anywhere and we ended up deleting each other from social media. (I deleted his number in Jan so there is no way for me to contact him). 

I am now suddenly getting random waves of missing him. More than did when I initially ended it, to the point that it’s making me cry.  I did see him on tinder and bumble again, but I was already getting the feeling of missing him before covid. 

I talked to some friends about it but I’m still not sure. I don’t want to talk about it so much which is why I’m here. 

I guess what I’m asking what I can do to get rid of these feelings or why you think I’m having them. It’s so confusing and frustrating for me, especially considering we weren’t even together for that long.

1009,"I moved into my apartment a little over 2 months ago. In the past two days, a lightbulb has gone out and my water filter says it’s due for replacement. As a tenant, I have to pay for these items, which I knew signing the lease. My problem is that these things have happened so soon into my lease. The filter is supposed to last around 6 months and the lightbulb probably more than two... 

Anyways, my lease says that the apartment is furnished with “a full complement” of these items. Do I bother pushing the issue about trying to have them replace it instead of me paying for it? Or does the wording in the lease mean that these items don’t have to be new, as long as they are installed?

1010,"I am a 18M I made big mistakes. I still live with my strict, religious, (my dad is a pastor) parents and seeing as the virus is a problem I am still with them and will be here for a few months no matter what most likely. I also have a girlfriend 17F and seeing as she expressively stated that she gave consent and everything is legal and we could in late December, whenever my parents would leave she would come over and we would fool around but we never had sex. 

We did this for about 2 months until my girlfriend and I had our valentines date. We went to her favorite restaurant and then went and watched a movie at my church because there’s a big comfy couch and are usual spot of parking lots was getting old. I threw up during our date and it was so embarrassing and I ended up staying an hour later than me and my parents talked about but I figured given that I’m 18 and can make my own choices and I threw up and I texted them as soon as it happened that it would ok. It wasn’t ok. I dropped my girlfriend off at her house and went home feeling great because our date ended good and we made the best of a bad situation. My parents were very mad and yelled at me for an hour after taking my phone and finding out what my girlfriend and I had been doing behind their backs. 

While they were angry they gave me the punishment of (but they call them “protections”) not being allowed to see her anywhere and in any capacity besides school. We are allowed to text but it must all be through the same app and I have to turn my phone in every night so they can check it. I’m not allowed to close my door unless I’m changing. I’m not allowed to be home alone, and on the other end of the spectrum I’m not allowed to leave unless they know exactly what I’m doing and they can track my location. I was also not allowed to call her in any way until about a few weeks ago when they permitted me to because of the virus, but last night they told me I have to turn my phone in at 12:00 which they know is the only time when I call my girlfriend because of how her internet works. 

I soon adjusted to all my restrictions (also known as protections) and I got comfortable in my new non privacy life. My relationship with my parents healed but they have not expressed to be anywhere near trusting me for around another year.

This has been the worst on my girlfriend however. She often cries and breaks out into borderline panic attacks because of my parents and for 2 months she’s lived this paranoid my parents have attacked her in many ways all through me by telling me that she and I should break up because our relationship is unhealthy and that she’s making me sin and turning me away from the church and she’s going to ruin my life and my dad said once that she’s incapable of love because of pedophiles that she had dealt with for 5 years who blackmailed her online. My girlfriend is constantly afraid of my parents and has nightmares and when my parents said they would take my phone at 12 each night she cried so much she threw up because she thought it was something she did and I believe the reason was so I would stop staying up so late talking to her. 

Now finally comes the advice part if you made it this far lol. My current plan is to talk to my parents and tell them everything that my girlfriend has gone through (she called and told me so they wouldn’t know) but I’m wondering if I should go through with it or if I should do something else. I’m 18 and deserve more freedom than my 13 year old sister (who currently is their new “favorite” and who is allowed all the freedoms I lost) they have expressed that the only way they would stop is if I moved out but I have no one who would take me in and I would most likely be homeless if they kicked me out. But please help any answer is accepted I’m willing to live with these “protections” for longer but I can’t let my girlfriend deal with this anymore it’s ruining her life and she needs to be happy and she said once that it takes all her energy just to text me because it stresses her out so much.

1012,"I’m a 14 year old male who lives in the States, and I have a friend who’s female, 17, and lives in Taiwan. So obviously it’s long distance, and we only communicated through iMessage and Instagram, and we never FaceTimed or anything but we did purely voice chat a few times.  We have been communicating for exactly 9 months. 


Anyway, I always assumed that we were really close. We liked the same things, and often said that we were the same people born in different countries and different bodies. We were both kind of loners so we naturally became each other’s best friends. She tried to commit suicide 3 times, and she always came to me and I saved her twice. Anyway, she’s alive and doing fine now, but I thought we were really close then. We also dated for a month or two, and she broke up with me a few days before Christmas and just ghosted me for no good reason. 


I panicked because I thought I was her best friend, and she was definitely mine. She didn’t talk to me until like February, when she just randomly started sending me memes about once a week, I would start sending them back (extending an olive branch) and during March we had our first long talk (it was like an hour, and she said she was sorry for ghosting me and we talked about our lives and depression and family situation etc etc etc). She was drunk and lonely then so, so I think that might be the only reason why she talked to me. She contacted me once for a few weeks ago to talk again, and during so she claimed that “You’re the only one who I’m happy to receive messages from” and I thought that was really sweet and I said the same in response, and since then I assumed she liked talking to me, but after that she barely said anything.


For example, I’ll say Hi, she’ll say Hi back, I’ll say how are you, and she won’t respond for days. I would start conversations but she would finish them or leave them dead super quickly, so I’m wondering what to do next. She’s still probably my best friend and I love talking with her, but at this point I doubt she feels the same way. 


I was wondering what I should do about it. I considered just talking to her maybe once a day and seeing what she does until eventually she either leaves me on seen forever or starts actually talking, or I considered just flat out telling her what I felt. I’m really conflicted here because I feel like when she sees my messages she feels I’m just wasting her time.

1017,"TLDR: New boo agrees with me about basic stuff (e. g. capitalism has been harmful, homophobia is bad, helping people is good) but he's never done much critical thinking when it comes to bigger sociopolitical conversations.  What's a good movie to fuel this discussion?

So I just started seeing this guy. We have great sexual chemistry and good conversation. We don't have much history behind us yet but this is one of my more intentional relationships-- actual dates, good morning texts, and the lot. The problem is despite him having most of his life together in terms of being financially stable, taking care of his family, etc. we don't seem to share the same values. 

Though nothing about his character is oppositional to mine, my casual conversations with my friends might include giving fake Trump speeches about pulling yourself up by your very big bootstraps or discussing how Love is Blind only honors conventional standards of beauty for women and doesn't have any queer relationships. On the other hand, normal conversation for him and his friends is talking about anime and TV.

Think of him as Raj from The Big Bang Theory except much more confident. He hides his nerdy interior pretty well but he's in his late 20s and doesn't drink and do drugs. Not that I want him to but it just points to his overall naivety. I don't expect this relationship to last long, to be very frank, but I genuinely want to expose him to as much as possible while I'm around and give him the chance to think about some deeper values. It seems like he's just never had the opportunity to think critically. His life has just been studying hard, securing a good job, fending for his family, and being entertained by media. 

Generally he doesn't like any of my Netflix reccomendations. For example, one of my favorite shows is Bojack Horseman. He said he can't even get past one episode. I'm guessing it's because it's too depressing for him but dark comedy in general is pretty central to my character. He's never even heard of Blue Is The Warmest Color. (I'm queer and my sense of stylistic expression is obtuse to the point that most people simply assume I'm a lesbian. It took him a while to figure this out, after asking me to wear a dress and having a conversation about whether someone should come out to their partner. Finally, he just asked. But it's almost weird that he didn't know til this point because I've made a few blunt jokes about it.)

Because of these differences, we always fight over what to watch, playfully, and though I've told him I don't like action comedy he's adamant on convincing me I do. After many a failed selections he's said that I can have the final decision on what we watch next. I'm thinking something either anti-capitalist or queer. He's already watched Parasite or Sorry To Bother You and he thought both films were weird and confusing, but good. Does anyone have any reccomendations for our next film? Obviously he likes comedy but we just watched Ozark so he can get darker. I'm thinking Rent or Tangerine but I really need a good pick.",06Apr2020,1
