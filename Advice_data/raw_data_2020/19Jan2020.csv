0,"I (17f) have become incredibly insecure and will have breakdowns like once a week now (separate post). I get incredibly defensive/emotional when I think people are about to yell at me, even if it’s just someone saying something in an angry tone.

Unfortunately, it is emotionally draining on my mother and has deteriorated our relationship, starting last year. She now believes that I’m emotionally abusing her by continuing to be such a wreck despite her attempts to help (she gave me a book on self compassion).

It came to a head when she called me yesterday to get information to an awards ceremony I was asking her to drive me to. I heard her angry sounding tone of voice and started overreacting, thinking she was going to start yelling at me and told her so. I said I was going to send her the details, and I hung up, but she said she didn’t want to drive me anymore after I hung up on her and to ask my father.

I texted my dad the info, and when I got home she was pissed that I had hung up and didn’t send her the info. She said that I was being abusive, and she will no longer take abuse from me. 

I don’t do much cooking or cleaning around the house, and I essentially have a lot of club activities that I ask her to pick me up from everyday, sometimes without enough notice bc I don’t receive early enough notice or forget. 

Now when I talk to her, she basically just repeats that I’m abusive and that she’ll only do the bare minimum that’s asked of a mother. What do I do?",19Jan2020,1
1,"Sorry if there’s a better sub for this. 

I’m 20, I just got my first credit card not long ago. It’s a secured one with $500. I know I need to start building credit, but the idea of using it makes me nervous. I don’t want something to come up and then all of a sudden not be able to pay it back. The idea of being in debt makes me super anxious. 

I’ve heard just using it for food at work or something each day would be good? I don’t even really want to use it for that but I know I have to somewhere. I guess I’m just wondering how much do I actually have to use it to start building credit effectively? Because I doubt buying one small thing each month would be enough. Unless it is? I’m stupid I don’t know how this stuff works.",19Jan2020,1
2,"I know the question sounds really weird but hear me out.

I love living. I love it so much that I sometimes really fear to die unexpectedly, like in a car crash or something, because that would mean that some things I would like people to know will never be known.

For a few weeks now I have been thinking about writing stuff down for every person I've interacted with in any significant way or for people who mean something to me. That way I would know that they hear how I feel about them in an unfiltered way. The reason why I want to do this is because I have some insecurities about the honesty of some of my friendships. I sometimes feel like specific people only tolerate me and simply pretend to like me. A classmate of mine is really nice, she's smart, good looking, happy and generally a good person. I would simply like to let her know that I consider her somewhat of a friend. I know I could just tell her that, but that would be weird. The same with a girl I like. I'm really afraid of the consequences it might have if I tell her. But the real reason is to leave messages I can't deliver myself.

I fucked up a lot in the last few months. I invaded someone else's privacy, ignored boundaries and simply did really stupid stuff to someone I care about. I can't really get close to that person in any way because doing so would make it worse, but I still want her to know that I'm sorry. Deeply honestly sorry. But I simply cannot tell her that right now. 

I am afraid I might never be able to say these things because I could be ripped out of this world to early. That's why I want to write stuff down. As insurance.",19Jan2020,1
3,"I have been asking myself this question for the past couple of days. It started when a teacher of mine said other teachers have called me ""Very smart. Brilliant. Talented."" But is that something they say to everyone who has nothing going for them?

You look at a jock, a theater kid, an A+ student and you would refer to them as athletic, talented, and intelligent. But when you start calling a hoodie wearing, C+ average loner ""smart,"" is it appropriate to take that as a compliment or be insulted?

And I don't refer to myself as smart. Sure I can perform okay on tests and I happen to know a lot of semi interesting facts, but I have no ""feats of strength."" If teach me how to perform a math equation, the next day I will know nothing. If you have me play a board game with a group of people that requires strategy I will lose every time.

What should I do the next time someone comes up to me and says ""You're very bright,"" do I just look at them and say ""Well actually...""?",19Jan2020,1
4,"Over the last 6 months, I (18F) went through a lot that broke me down.  I learned about my fathers HIV status, my father went to jail, I was jumped, and I was sexually assaulted by a boy I trusted. I'm a senior in high school, and I'm already stressed enough with wrapping up my high school days on a good note.

Unfortunately, I used marijuana to cope with my stress.  I've been smoking just about every day since August. Whats preventing me from stopping is I built a dependency on it. Now that I'm sober (only because I don't have money), I'm being forced to deal with my repetitive thoughts. 

I'm trying to distract myself, but it isn't working. I go days without speaking to anyone, and my ""friends"" always flake on me. I don't know how to break the cycle and feel happy with my life like I used to.

TLDR: I feel alone and I'm trying to not go back to weed being my crutch for happiness.",19Jan2020,1
5,I have always been the second choice when I’m with my friends. All of them would rather talk not hang out with someone else and it’s frustrating.

6,"So its halfway through the year and I'm getting worried that I'm not doing enough. I do study this year after school for 2 hours but as soon as I come home I cant pull myself to work more. It really depends on the subject. I'm naturally gifted with maths and so I really don't mind spending extra time on it, but I know I don't even need to work on it. I may have ADHD, my guidance counsellor agreed when I pointed it out but I don't want to take adderall or any ADHD medication this year. My main worry is that I won't get the college course I want. So my question really is, how can I get myself to study? I always find myself finding a reason to use my phone. Usually the reason is legitimate, but then I end up browsing reddit, tiktok or Snapchat. Any help would be really appreciated.",19Jan2020,1

13,"Hi! I need some advice on a gift from an ex-boyfriend. For context, he gave it to me last year when we last saw each other after we'd spent three days together. It was early in the morning and he gave me one of his chain necklaces (he has two in total) which he has been wearing since he was 18. He told me it was given to him by a friend who passed away, that it's a very special necklace to him and that he wanted me to have it as a reminder of him. It's such a personal and sentimental gift and I've cherished it since he gave it to me. Whenever I wear it, I think of him and it makes me feel a little closer to him in a weird way. Since then we've broken up and I asked if he wanted it back and he said no, that he wants me to keep it because it will protect me. I love the necklace and stopped wearing it for a bit because it reminded me of him too much. Recently, I've started wearing it again because I just need the love/protection/strength from it. I know it's just a necklace but it just makes me feel better. He's my best friend and we keep in touch till today. I just wanted to know whether him giving this to me means something more than he said?",19Jan2020,1

15,"To start, I’m only 18. I’ve been struggling for the last 4 months after my now ex boyfriend left in October from his trip to me. It was everything I could ask for, and I ruined it. Let me explain, but I’ll explain from the beginning of 2019 to now.

We have been dating for 2 years and 4 months.

At the start of 2019, I was 17 and dealing with family related problems. Arguments ensuing with my mother and grandmother, and sometimes involving everyone else. I can’t handle confrontation or being brought into it so I tend to just lose my mind and scream and cry and beg them to stop. I’ve been traumatized by the arguing occurring and my mum leaving many times due to them since I was twelve. She left around the beginning to middle of this year. Well, my then boyfriend bought me a ticket to Minnesota and I spent the summer there. I had never felt so complete, and like life was easier but too quiet. He came back with me to Florida, and we spent time together for a few days into September. He left then came back in October for two weeks, I missed him a lot and never spent halloween with him. He left after and I’ve been struggling with feeling alone, and I became so lazy that I only ever played games with friends and I didn’t text as often, nor called as often anymore. We argued a lot and were quite shit to each other, and it was for no reason. We had 0 reasons to argue but became quick to argue, and it started becoming to the point we’d cold shoulder it. Well, just yesterday, we broke up. Here’s where I separate the paragraph to keep this clean.

We texted about it, we exchanged I love you’s, and he even said he wasn’t planning on moving on and just wanted time apart because we had never been intense like we were. He exclaimed how he truly loved me and would continue to do so. He had abusive relationships in the past which makes me believe him quite a bit. He said that maybe we could try again soon, and I’m kind of hopeful but maybe I’m not entirely hopeful due to the fact I’ve dealt with abusive relationships in the past. The main reason I’m a little hopeful is because we were almost inseparable, we did everything together, he never left my side, and he was my best friend while my boyfriend. He was there when I couldn’t speak my mind, he was there when I would have panic attacks, he was there when I was dealing with frantic paranoia, he was there when my mum left, and he was there when I was suicidal. 

I just generally need advice on how to deal with this without moving on too quickly in case there is a next time? I don’t plan on waiting forever, my maximum is two months. I am aware that people can move on, which is why I said two months max, because I guess I’m still kind of his friend, and I can find out if he has, or is in the process of moving on. I told him not to hesitate to come back, I’d give my all to make sure this time around we both can help each other meanwhile seeking help of our own to maintain a healthier relationship, I understand this can be wishful thinking, like i said, I just need advice about dealing with this without moving on too quickly.",19Jan2020,1
16,"This is just  what I can remember off the top of my head. I have my brother, who can also confirm this happened so I'm not having a vivid dream or something.


I was about 7, and it was during the summer, I remember my parents telling me that'd we'd be going away for the summer and we were going in the UK, The first thing that happened was when we got there was that we were separated from out parents. Probably about 20-25 of us all my age.

We were divided by gender into camps, open rooms and with a bathroom outside. There was this one woman who we had to ask to do anything and I mean anything. She confiscated all of our electronics and stuff we had on them and we had to put them in a box.

By anything I mean you had to ask her if you wanted to go pee. You had to ask her to literally do anything. 

We would then have classes with the woman away from our parents with this woman, I remember them being pretty fun and interactive.

We would see our parents only during activities. What we're times when we had to do net building and things like that.

I remember on the first night, someone didn't had over like an MP3 player they had and this woman got irrationally mad. She screamed at this kid and took it off him.

Someone the next day tried to escape because they were scared and hated having to ask this woman to do things and he wasn't with us in our classes anymore. 

It continued in this way for about a week and a half, I remember the site being so clean, like OCD clean. 

After it was over we went home on a coach too. 

I've tried talking to my parents about this, but it's like I'm saying that the sky is green to them, they probably know something I don't, but I was wondering if anyone had any ideas on what the place might have been? Or if they've experienced something similar?",19Jan2020,1

20,"I’m iffy to Reddit and may need to delete this, I dunno.

I’ve been divorced from my ex for some odd years now. I’ve moved away from the state he and I used to reside in together and have since been remarried to a wonderful man for a couple years.

While with my ex I had learned about his ex, the love of his life. She was his teacher in high school and then fired when they became public about their relationship, he was 18 at the time. She has since been a counselor since then. This fact made me hesitate before entering a relationship with him, but ignoring my gut feeling we ended up getting engaged and then married. Not long after he confided that he wasn’t 18 when they started their sexual relationship, but in fact had been dating secretly for a lot longer than many knew. When he was 17 she got pregnant and had an abortion to avoid going to jail and she didn’t want to lose her sons to their dads.
Many issues later my ex and I split and I took this secret with me. I recently found out that this woman got in trouble again as a counselor because she entered a sexual relationship with a married client.
What do I do? I now wonder if she has done this with under-aged clients or friends of her sons? My ex would completely deny all that he confessed to me (he had always been obsessed with her). And the only evidence is in some other state’s abortion clinic, but obviously no one could get a hold of that. I also don’t want to be involved or see my ex again.

We chatted the night we met and that next Monday I asked her out over Instagram and got an answer along the lines of I have something else to do but maybe another day, I wonder if this was just her finding a nice way to say no. We text occasionally, friendly conversations and go to school together, I’m in the year above her and I’m about to graduate, I just feel like it’ll bother me if I don’t tell her my feelings for her face to face, at the very least it’ll get a weight off my shoulders, is the a bad idea?

I just got my dream career as a car salesman (I know, not exactly glamorous but it's something I am passionate about.) and I can't seem to have fun as easily as I used to. 
I used to spend hours playing games on my PS4 or PC or phone but I can't relax at home anymore. It just doesn't work for me like it used to. I really enjoy spending money (I am responsible, unlike younger me who spent hundreds on GTA V back in 2014-2017, Thanks to my girlfriend helping me manage my money properly.) And find I have the most fun shopping. I absolutely love cars and I got to test drive my dream car yesterday... That was the epitome of fun for me and I can't wait to buy the car in the next few months when I think I can afford it. Whenever I'm home I just can't enjoy myself though. I go straight to lay in bed after work and I either do more work research or watch YouTube for a couple hours. 
My thinking is that it's because I don't have a stick shift car anymore, or at least a car I find fun to drive. I used to go out for hours at a time driving having an absolute blast cruising with my friends and racing but I can't do that anymore. I think I just answered myself.

30,"Hi. to answer the obvious question that will come up promptly, ""how did you get banned from discord?""

Look into r/discord and the posts about being banned/having their accounts being disabled for no reasons, and the Support team refused to help them out in any way they can. That's the same thing that happened to me. Says i violated ToS and that's it.

&amp;#x200B;

When that happened, Discord was literally the only connection i literally had with them, (beside kik) and there's a literal huge issue.  
1) I do not know their username nor know their # too, because they're a roleplayer (don't ask, i didn't question about this.) If they didn't change their usernames very frequently, i wouldn't even make this post in first place and i would found them so sooner, and reunited with them.

  
2) we literally do not share any mutual friends nor mutual servers between us.

  
3) If anyone ever use kik (yes, i know the reputation that precedes the app, but here's a shocker- the app is still alive and kicking.) 

you'll know when the app is not on their cell phones and any message you send to them, it'll pop up saying ""whoops it looks like they don't have the app on their app or/and has disconnected for too long"" etc etc, but that's the only contact/social media i had with them. (The username is NecroticFleshWound if anyone ever know them, please reach out to them and let them know that i'm looking for them. :( my username is VERY recognizable.)

4) No other ways of social medias to reach out them. This situation is literally considered almost ""impossible mission"" kind.

32,"My 38 year old sibling was diagnosed with LD, ADD, speech problems and allergies as a kid. My parents didn't like what Ritalin did to him, so they stopped giving it to him after 1 week. So growing up he did not take any medication. He has struggled in school, at home and work and with his weight. I believe he has an undiagnosed condition, but I don't know what type of doctor to go to for a diagnosis. 
He is morbidly obese.  He is under 5’8” and well over 320 pounds.  He is a compulsive eater, and will eat combinations of food other people simply wouldn’t think of, such as spaghetti with mayonnaise (an entire large jar of mayonnaise at that) or just plain hot dog buns.  All of this has led to a number of serious health problems, including sudden onset diabetes, which he was diagnosed with in December 2018, and severe sleep apnea.  These very serious health issues, which are dangerous and scary by themselves, are made much worse by his behavioral issues.  In fact, his diabetes diagnosis was only arrived at because there was a perfect storm of his poor health and behavioral problems.
He refuses to wear pants and prefers the cold, so during the winter he will go and sit on the porch in shorts and a tee shirt and watch videos on his phone regardless of the temperature.  He simply does not seem to feel the cold, and if he does he simply does not care.  This leads to dry skin (in addition to a chronic cough). When he gets dry skin, he picks at it compulsively which means his legs are always scabbed or bruised.  It seems like he can't tell when he has pain.  Last December, he picked at his leg and ultimately wound up with an infection.  He didn’t tell anyone about the infection until the skin was literally bubbling and oozing.  By the time he brought it to my attention (he hid it from our mom) he had a bubble the size of a golf ball by his ankle and was oozing puss to the point where there was a trail where he walked.  My sister and I insisted he go to the hospital, and when we got there he was immediately admitted (he stayed in a hospital bed for 10 days). 
While at the hospital they asked him his pain level on a scale of 1-10.  He calmly said it was a 2.  The Doctors did not believe that (so much so that they gave him Fentanyl).  After they administered the antibiotics via IV they ran blood work and diagnosed him with diabetes and informed him he was lucky to have his leg. 
Shortly after getting out of the hospital, he got an infection in his eye (cellulitis) and, after seeing an opthamologist  we were told to go straight to the ER.  He was then transferred to two different hospitals (via ambulance) because each hospital was so worried there would need to be an emergency surgery that could perhaps involve removing his eye. Once again when he was asked about his pain level he said it was a 2, and once again the doctor said he should've been in a lot more pain and administered Fetanyl. Ultimately he recovered, though the extent of the damage to his eye is still unknown.
Both times he told people that his leg or eye had looked the way it did for only a couple of days, which was impossible. His leg had been untreated for a month before anyone in the family was aware of it and rushed him to the hospital and his eye had been untreated for a week before we noticed it and rushed him to the hospital. After both of the incidents we decided to start going to his doctor appointments with him. At his appointments he said he was fine, nothing bothered him and answered questions with one word answers (the same way he responds to us). 
His health problems continue, and we once again had to take him to the hospital because of an open wound on his leg (roughly one year after he was first rushed to the ER with bubbling/oozing wounds).  They are simply made worse by his attitude/behavioral issues.  He lies to doctors, his family, and himself about his health. He is very stubborn and will do things out of spite. You can show him proof that he is wrong and he will simply deny it without offering any counterpoint. He will be sick and refuse to go to the doctor; if you ask him to do a chore he will leave and come back late at night so he doesn't have to do it; if you give him a date by which he needs to have a chore completed he will wait until an 11 PM of that date to start doing it (if he even does it all). If you talk to him about something he doesn't like (chores, doctors, weight, health, his eating, etc.) he will just ignore you and doesn't respond to you. When he is not working (he works as a cashier and is on his feet most of the day - despite doctor's orders that he limit the time spent on his feet until he loses weight) he just sits and watches tv (which, admittedly, he has done his whole life).
He also struggles socially.  While he is a very sweet and generous person he has struggled to find his place, and simply retreats into himself.  He goes to the movies by himself a few days a week. At any given time he has seen almost every movie in the theater (some of them twice). He has never had a girlfriend and has never had many friends. 
Additionally, he has “quirks” that may be indicative of something more serious. He has motor and vocal tics - blinks his eyes multiple times, twitches/shakes his head/neck, jerks his mouth/lips, and makes a spitting/hissing noise with his tongue against his teeth.  In addition to his compulsive eating, he seems to have other compulsions such as picking his skin until he bleeds, washing his hands with scalding hot water, checking and rechecking things (like closing doors), touching things.  If his clothes are in the dryer and you move them, he will wash them again. He also hoards and keeps things that most people would get rid of immediately.  He doesn't clean his room or car and refuses to allow anyone to. 
He also falls asleep when he is driving (he has been in many car accidents because of this). When he is not driving, he falls asleep every car ride within minutes. When he was left in charge of taking care of my parents cars that are in the garage, he would have to start them every few days so that the battery wouldn't die. He would start the cars in the closed garage and leave them running for a couple of hours nearly killing himself and me. When he was told he could not do that he got upset and just ignored me. The next time he did it he cracked the garage door, but did not realize it wasn’t opened above the exhaust pipe, and once again filled the garage and house with exhaust. I told him he could not do that, he had to open the garage fully and/ or take them out of the garage. He still refuses and I have to go out there and open the garage door. He has left the air compressor running all day nearly blowing up the house.  He refuses to help out around the house or follow any of the rules set for him (clean his room/bathroom). 
He has run up $20,000 credit card debt, 95% of it on food. He has no savings or any money. He lives pay-check to pay-check and everything else my mom takes care of. He lives with my mom. I do not believe he will ever be able to live on his own. We have tried antidepressants and nothing changed. Not too long ago I asked him about his future and he said he was going to get married and have kids one day. He is 38 and has never had a girlfriend or done anything that would lead to him one day getting married or having kids.  
Obviously, there are a lot of issues/problems.  I love my brother and want him to live the best life he possibly can, but when I look at everything that is going on and everything that has happened, I know that he will not be able to until he receives the proper care, which begins with a proper diagnosis. He does not think he has a problem, and would be heartbroken if he knew how apparent it is to those around him that he needs help.  Because he is 38 years old I am not able to direct his medical care.  I want to help my brother before it is too late, and know that he needs medical assistance but am unable to direct his medical care.  I am wondering what the proper approach is/where I can go from here.",19Jan2020,1

anyways, i had lied to one of these friends in middle school about where i was from. we stayed friends all the way until highschool, but i had kept the lie up because i was too scared to tell him the truth after so long. one day, he brought up the lie to my other friends in the group. they all confronted me (because they knew the truth), so i panicked, made a new discord account, ghosted them basically.

37,"Hello, I'm a 24m who's been in a somewhat on and off again relationship now for about 2 years with a now 24f. Basically I've known this girl going on 12+ years now, so since middle school I've known her and have had a friendship with her and about during high school we started dating our sophomore year. I've had the biggest crush on her since middle school at this point in time and never got the chance to ask her out because she was in a relationship with someone else since I've known of her in middle school and they both broke it off freshman year or so. We dated for about 2 years in high school, I lost my virginity to her, first girl I admitted my love too, and then we broke it off, not on a good note i should add. She went on to date and have a kid with someone else and I did the same as well. Our lives moved on and we grew up more etc etc, though overtime I never forgot about her and always thought about what could be with her so one day about 3 years ago or so I found her youtube channel and left a comment on one of her videos saying ""hi whats up i miss you"" basically and we began talking after that again. Fast forward to now and we've been dating for about 2 years now, and I'm totally in love with her again I feel as if my love for her has rekindled. Recently we got into a pretty nasty fight, the worst we've ever had and it was over me finding out she was doing some stripping on the side, I admittedly overreacted at first but was genuinely upset that she had kept that from me and she did so because she knows my opinion towards strip clubs, but still it was the point of having that be kept from me, because well now I've come to learn and understand the job it is and am willing to support her with what she does, and I try to be like that with everything for her. The fight didn't end well and we ended up breaking up and not speaking for almost over a week and at that point in time I was wanting to move on from the situation and try to find a possible chance with real love elsewhere. During that point in time I did find someone wanting the same thing I did and we began talking for a little and during that point in time, the girl whom I've been talking about messages me a positive pregnancy test. An so me and her began talking again and I had to break it to other girl that it wasn't going to work out anymore and that im sorry. While talking to that other girl though I never did stop thinking about *her* and trying to work it out again.  So when she sent me that pregnancy test, we began talking again and working on our relationship and communication. An so as of this morning she broke up with me, I was wanting to talk about the baby situation and our lives and start formulating a plan together and she wanted to know if I wanted to have the baby with her and I had said yes, but we just need to start stepping up to the plate more. After I said that, she said she wanted to be done and that she didn't think this relationship was going anywhere. I'm at a loss here with what to do, a lot of me wants to move on and move away but still keep in contact for the sake of the child but she doesn't want to contact me about anything and the past few days it's been hard to get her to even talk about the baby situation, she just shuts it down right away. An I don't know what she wants to do about it and I can't leave her alone without knowing whats going on with that and I'm just having very conflicting emotions on what to do and if I should stay with her and try to work it out or move on but keep cordially and even if she decides the *other option* than that would be great to know but I can't even get that.

2- What else would you suggest to add to my skills to be more marketable ( Web design,.....).

3-What other softwares would you recommend to learn to increase freelance market-ability.

46,"Hello, 

I am in a huge dilemma. I'm a 21 year old male that lives with my grandmother. My grandmother is 68 years old. She has been very disabled for the past 5 years to the point that she can't do much for herself anymore and quite frankly, has not been able to since her 40s. She has been in and out of hospitals and rehabs since 2013. My grandmother has suffered from diabetes, pneumonia, bronchitis, arthritis, sepsis, kidney failure, and a plethora of other bodily problems that I'm forgetting to mention. Because of her disabilities, she has become almost entirely reliant on me and my mother. My grandmother cannot take a bath or shower without assistance, get out of bed or a chair without assistance, can't carry objects over about 5 - 7 pounds, can't cook from not wanting to stand up for any longer than 5 minutes, and she cannot drive. She hasn't drove since her 30s from a back injury at work. She has not worked since because she was comfortable with receiving a check from the government and even after she was healed, she never attempted to work or drive again. My grandmother and grandfather moved in with my mom in 1999 after that injury some years before. I believe she took advantage of my mother's niceness because she wasn't required to pay any bills and my mom would take her anywhere she wanted. My grandfather used to basically be her caregiver until he passed away in 2015. My mom's two older brothers do as much as they can now, but not nearly as much as my mother and I. 

My mother moved out 2 years ago with her new husband. She was basically tired of dedicating her life to my grandmother, but she still helps her on a daily basis. Despite her moving out, I have unwillingly taken my mom's place as my grandmother's primary caregiver. I have a huge problem with this because these current problems stem from their past decisions that I had no control over as I was too young to think about these kind of issues that would arise in the future. At first, I didn't mind doing for my grandmother every now and then, but it has gotten to the point where I am spending half of my day conforming to her needs. I have to run all of her errands, do certain time consuming activities around the house, and deal with her calling my name every 10 minutes to do something for her that a capable person should be able to do in no time at all. For instance, she has 4 cats that I used to like, but now absolutely despise because I have to feed them every meal every day and empty the cat shit that I hate doing. Anytime she wants something, she wants it immediately and if you don't get it immediately she'll throw a fit or talk bad about you behind your back. My grandmother is a very needy, selfish, and negative person if you haven't noticed by now. If I at least got paid for doing things for her, I wouldn't mind helping. Everything I do for my grandmother at this point is to help my mom out mostly because I know her work schedule takes up a lot of her time. We have tried to convince her to live in an assisted living facility, but she refuses to do so because she has a negative outlook on them and that would mean giving up her government check. 

I want to move out as soon as possible, but my current job isn't making me enough money to get a place of my own. I am currently in pursuit of obtaining my real estate license to become an affiliate broker, but I won't have the program complete until most likely the middle of this year which means I probably won't be making any serious money until about 2 - 3 months after I've acquired a job as an affiliate broker for a firm. Then it would take me even more months to save up to get my own place. I plan on moving out sometime in 2021. Another reason why I haven't moved out the years before was because I was enrolled in college and was still figuring out what I wanted to do with my life. I can't move in with my mom and her husband because of personal reasons. I can't move in with my dad and his wife because of a lack of space. I am also a single child, so I can't get a place with any siblings. 

So my questions are:

1. How can I convince my grandmother to go to a nursing home?
2. What are some ways I can move out sooner without getting a roomate?",19Jan2020,1

52,"I’m a 30(m) I separated about 12months ago from a really mismatched relationship that I stayed in for about 5 years too long due to depression. We have a beautiful 2yo daughter who is my everything.

About 4 months ago, I was touring in a different country and met an incredible woman. She literally, at the moment feels like the perfect person. We’ve met on 4 separate occasions since meeting, for between 3 and 4 nights at a time, me flying to her and vice versa. It’s got to the point where we talk a lot, and everything seems so easy. I realised recently that I am deeply in love with her, and we have told each other this too. 

The girl in question has a very solid plan of what she wants and feels pressure to start getting to a place where she can settle down. She wants to travel for 6months as a couple before settling down and doesn’t think she could face leaving her family to move to my country to be together. Due to my circumstances (having a child) I don’t think I could face leaving the country to pursue this relationship further, or be able to travel for 6months and be away from my daughter for so long. I’m starting to feel terrible, I love my daughter and am starting to resent myself for wanting to leave. 

Me and said woman are still talking and after a long and soul crushing talk have decided to continue seeing each other in a very non committed way so she can meet someone who can give her the future she wants, being close to her family in her home country. I know this makes it sound like she is difficult but it has been very hard for both of us and recently our talks have become very sad from both of us, and I really don’t want to lose her but sense it is coming. 

I guess the advice I’m after is, do I just need to break contact for my own mental health reasons. Im constantly down about it all and it’s affecting my day to day life. Or is there a way to continue and it feel better. 

I want so much to just move away and start a life with her, I’ve never met someone so perfect for me and never felt so strongly (romanticly) so soon with anybody

Am I the worst person for actually considering leaving my life and daughter to settle down else where? I would never lose contact with my daughter and would try to long distance dad, but ultimately think it would be just as much of a betrayal of my responsibility’s as a father. 

I feel like I finally left my depression behind when I left my previous partner and have been a better dad for it. I now feel like the mist is forming again and am struggling massively. I feel very immature for even considering any of this and not just cutting ties sooner. 

What would other do in my situation? Do I just need to man up and except the choices I’ve made or has anyone got a similar experience that worked out in the end?

59,"At my 16th birthday I noticed I was losing my memories and that their were problems with my cognitive ability, this is a condition known as subjective cognitive impairment. Individuals with neurodegenerative disease often complain about losing memory before the diagnosis of dementia.

My biggest mistake was to reach out for help and go see a doctor I was immediately accused of schizophrenic delusions and I was involuntarily detained on and off for several months. Nurses often pulled my pants down to forcefully inject anti psychotic drugs, later on it is now somewhat established that I have no delusional disorders I have no psychosis I have no schizophrenia, no bipolar, no depression, nothing.

2 years ago I began to get extremely painful physical symptoms I got temperature intolerance, chest pain, shortness of breath.

It is sometimes the most unbearable pain imaginable and because of that I often face accusations of delusions disorders, sometimes when the pain gets bad I become anxious and my parents will call the police to have me involuntarily held for weeks in mental hospitals.

Last time I was involuntarily held for my chronic pain I was unable to get any sleep for the entire duration in the next 3 months I couldn’t sleep until I was prescribed sleeping pills.

I don’t understand what to do to stop this, I wish I was allowed to speak about chronic pain or terminal illness without being accused of schizophrenia.

My mental health is declining and if I speak with someone close or in my family, it will cause issues between others and for myself.

Hey, I feel like I'm overthinking this, but I feel really guilty at the moment. I asked a work friend if he wanted to grab dinner and he agreed. We were talking and having a good time, the conversation was flowing for a while with only a few awkward pauses. However, we were grabbing dinner for about an hour and we were running out of things to really talk about. I thought my friend seemed a bit anxious, so I asked if he wanted to head out and that was that. He went to go his girl and I went to do my thing.

I feel terrible because I don't know how to end things like this gracefully. I had a great time with him, but I thought we were heading towards the natural end of the conversation. So, when we reached another pause I asked if he wanted to head out. He seemed a little disappointed and his body language seemed upset and I think he might have thought I wanted to leave. I feel awful because I really enjoyed his company. I just felt the conversation was reaching an end and I thought he was feeling anxious because he wanted to leave.

Am I overthinking this? This is really eating me up because I actually really enjoy this guys company and I want to continue being friends with him.",19Jan2020,1
67,"Me and this guy have been on and off for a couple of months. We started off casually having sex until he told me he developed feelings and I told him I was working on things with my ex. 

We still hung out during that time and we became closer. I eventually started to have feelings after I gave up on things with my ex. By that time he had stopped pursuing anything further with me.

We weren’t moving any further with our relationship so I told him I wanted to give him all of his things back and cut ties which caused animosity between us whenever we would see each other out (this was a couple months ago.) 

A couple weeks went by and we saw each other at a party and we talked. He picked me up from my friends house that night and we had sex. We didn’t talk for a couple weeks after that and my period was late so I took a pregnancy test and sure enough it was positive. I waited a week to tell him.

Whenever we had to talk about the baby, it was me who had to reach out because he was avoiding the situation. We argued about money when I decided I wanted an abortion because I’m not in a great position for a baby. 

It’s been a couple months since then. I saw him at our mutual friends house when there was a get together about 2 weeks ago, his best friend convinced us to talk so it would be less uncomfortable for us and everyone else.

We finally had a decent conversation about everything where he admitted he was too scared to face me because he wasn’t ready for a baby. We started hanging out again, started having sex again, in my vulnerability I started to regain feelings.

He’s been acting weird and I realized he blocked me on some social media. I put two and two together and saw he’s been spending lots of time with a girl back where he grew up and has blocked my friends as well to hide the fact he’s been posting with her. 

I confronted him today and he lied saying he’s just visiting friends from back home. 

Do I tell his ‘girlfriend?’ I’m very hurt, I don’t want to cause anymore drama, there’s been enough these past couple months but I’m so aggravated. I’m hurt and feel like an idiot for being so naive and letting myself get used. I know I should tell her but I don’t want to look crazy.",19Jan2020,1

71,"Hello! I'm a 13 y/o girl and i will turn 14 in a few months, I grew up in a pretty conservative Christian family, with a mother who really despise girl-to-girl relationships, she's always told me about how ""disgusting"" it is for two girls to love/like each other romantically, My father is the same, he once told me that he wouldn't allow me to have a boyfriend until i'm 18, and if i did, he would shoot him with his gun (of course he was joking lol) so i jokingly replied with ""But what if it's a girlfriend"" his smile slowly disappeared, stared at me for a few seconds, then looked away to proceed with what he was doing. I'm not a lesbian, i like boys, but i like girls just as much.. Ever since i was younger, i've always thought of girls as attractive and sees boys as obnoxious beings. I don't see myself as a guy, and i've never thought of becoming or wanting to be one. People around me have always told me about how ladylike i was, or how feminine i was with my sense of style or with the way i walk, smile, or talk (i'm a soft-spoken person), but what they don't know is that that ""feminine girl"" also likes girls. As i've told you, I grew up in a Christian family and they've always told me that same sex relationships shouldn't exist, I'm pretty sure that i'm gonna marry a man in the future because of my family, i don't want to disappoint them. But, as of now, i'm just really confused with my sexuality because i'm attracted to everyone, be it a boy, a girl, a gay person, or a lesbian. I'm saying it here because i don't know what to do with myself, i don't want to tell it to my parents as i'm really confused with it myself, i'm pretty sure they're gonna judge me for it, for something that i have no control over.

Sorry for the grammar and the disorganization of this, i'm really nervous about writing this as it's my first time talking about my sexuality, i wrote a lot but also edited and erased a lot so some of this might not even make sense. thanks for reading this, any advice would be helpful \^\^",19Jan2020,1
73,"For my situation, my mom told me to remind my brother to take his band uniform home when I pick him up from school so she can take it to dry clean it and return it the following week. I did not remember too and when she came home and asked about it, she got mad because I didn't remember. 

Now since that has happened she's given me the silent treatment and I think expecting me to say something but I already explained I didn't remember and I need to write it down so I don't forget next time. I think this is a little ridiculous how mad she is getting mad at me for something that is my brother's responsibility but not mine. My dad even pointed this out in a conversation when I tried suggesting to email one of the parents who are in band for a solution.

75,"Hey all! This may be a long one so strap in :)

So my story begins a little under 4 years ago. I see this girl(let’s call her Jane) get off the bus(we were and still are in high school), and instantly I’m in love. Of course I’ve never met her and she’s a grade above me as I’d cone to find out.

Cut to a year later, I join my school’s drama club. Guess who else joins that same year. Jane. What are the chances right? Naturally we grow closer as our interests align and we end up doing similar jobs backstage and whatnot. 

Some time passes, we are now at 2 years ago. We are on a bus and Jane sits next to me. She asks “OP, do you believe in true love?” Of course my dumb ass says “I dunno” and we haven’t talked about that since.

Anywho, I’m patching myself up to ask her out within the week when she says “(my best friend) and I are dating btw”. Crushing blow. Fucking sucked but she was happy so I accepted it and waited.

That summer I had kind of realized time was up and started to move on. I developed another crush which ended when I found out she had a boyfriend. Then came the second non-Jane crush. This started at the end of this last summer.

Jane and I had become very close, very trusting of each other. She helped me through some major at the time bullshit and I helped her with some of hers. Then I decided to tell Jane about my crush on this girl, let’s call her Leah.

Some time passes, Jane and I now work together as well so we have a lot of time together, not to mention we hang out outside of our normal stuff and whatnot. Anyway she helps me out with working up the courage to ask out Leah. This whole time after all the time we spent together I realized I still liked Jane.

Then the unthinkable happened. After spending all this time with Jane, after getting this close with her, she breaks up with her boyfriend. I help her a ton through it all and now we hug every time we go our separate ways. She confide Ltd in me with some deep deep secrets.

Eventually I ask out Leah. She says no unfortunately but that’s fine, we are friends now and I realized I liked Jane anyway. Now we are here, in the present. Still very close, still hugs and stuff. We even got out to eat and do random “date” stuff and not just hang out really often but we aren’t dating.

Jane confides in me she has a crush of sorts on someone but isn’t looking for a relationship if you catch my drift.

We sometimes say love you and stuff like that in kind of a friendly way of that makes sense? But sometimes there’s just this look in her eye and the moment feels right but nothing comes of it ever.

I can clarify stuff in the comments if needed but I need some advice please. I’ve never felt this strongly for someone before and I have no clue what to do.",19Jan2020,1

77,"Hey everyone I’m going to try to keep this short and simple. I bought a pair of AirPods on amazon that were advertised as the latest version (it wasn’t a private seller the seller was Apple). So I thought these were wireless charging. They turned out not to be so I returned them. I’ve returned countless things to amazon without any issue. 

It arrives back on January 3 and was told to wait till January 11 for the refund. January 15 rolls around and I decide to chat with someone. They say they received an empty box and can’t issue a refund. I started panicking since I knew this wasn’t possible. I call the support number and they say the same thing and that they’re sorry. They said I could talk to a supervisor or wait to see what happens. 

I thought this was crazy that this was real. I paid $154 for something that I 100% returned and now still have that money missing from my account. Basically paid for something I don’t have. I’ve never seen anything like this and I feel helpless as this money was needed for an emergency. And now it’s vanished in thin air. 

I still have the receipt from UPS when I returned it and the slip said the package weighed 2.5lbs. I don’t get how they got an empty box. I was very sincere with the lady on the phone with how this situation obviously looks, but I know I shipped them back. I searched everywhere to see if I somehow forgot to put the AirPods in but I definitely didn’t forget, I mean come on how could you.

98,"posting here cuz it got removed from r/relationships :/

TLDR at bottom,

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a junior at a very large American university. It's both a party school and academically prestigious. I was raised in an immigrant family and my parents' traumatic experiences led them to raise me in a very sheltered life. They are also extremely close to their home values. What I mean by this is that I was barely allowed to hang out with friends, and I was told from a very young age that I would never be allowed to date and would have an arranged marriage when I'm older. I probably learned this in 3rd grade. Looking back, being told this so early really messed my confidence with girls, even still today. Simply because I always felt like it just wasn't possible to have a relationship, because I come from this type of background and they wouldn't understand or fit into it. I also was not allowed to go to prom or hang out with friends outside of school much, and I accepted these rules back then because I was so under control and didn't realize I could just be a rebellious teen like others.

I only realized in college that high school is apparently the time where everybody learns more about their sexuality and relationships in general. In high school, I knew people were getting laid but honestly had no clue that it was normal, I thought of them as the troublemakers. This is probably as a result of the brainwashing from my parents.

Anyways, I'm a junior in college. I have honestly had many opportunities in college at building a relationship or even having a one-time hookup, but I've missed all these opportunities because of not being experienced enough reading the signals.

Now that I'm a junior in college, I feel heavy regret on how I've lived my life thus far, and I blame my past for being so unable to enjoy college like others around me are. I have a huge fear of time running out since graduation is around the corner. I've tried going out with friends often and meeting people, but it never turns into anything. I guess I've been searching for an interaction with a girl that would lead to a friendly relationship, then into possibly dating or casual hookups. This is also my first time putting myself out there, even freshman and sophomore year I didn't go out much and never went out with the intention of meeting people. It's been unsuccessful though, by meeting people I'm not interested in, and not being confident enough to approach people I am interested in.

On top of this, I feel shame for being so inexperienced. Everybody around me in college seems so... experienced, and I guess that intimidates me, especially when I meet girls. Specifically, because I'm always scared that it'll be a huge red flag to them once they find out I'm inexperienced.

I also don't think I'm capable of doing hook-ups. A lot of these girls that I find attractive, I feel like I could never hook-up with as my first time. I almost want a girl who would be understanding of my inexperience but know that most girls around me probably wouldn't be. I guess this idea hurts my confidence probably a lot.

I guess I'm posting this just to hear what people have to think, since I haven't opened up about this before except for a few friends, but not to this detail. I really want to get over this regret.

TL;DR

I'm a college student who has never been in a serious relationship and is very inexperienced, probably due to conservative childhood teachings which I have always disagreed with but never rebelled. As a junior in college, this is now hitting me hard as I realized how much I have missed out on throughout high school and college so far (by not rebelling), both in good experiences/memories and in knowing that there are things to be learned from experience. I want to know how I can get over this regret and fear and be confident in putting myself out there for dating and maybe even hookups.",19Jan2020,1

101,"To give context, it’s been a couple weeks since I’ve gotten out of a 1 year relationship with my pretty toxic (now) ex, and I think it’s safe to say that it’s affected me a lot mentally. 
But, a couple days ago a really good friend of mine decided it was a good idea to tell me he had feelings for me. As I’m not in a good place at the moment, i had to explain how I needed time to recover from the previous relationship and how I didn’t think it would be a good idea to get into a relationship as I definitely wasn’t ready for one. To say he didn’t take it well is an understatement. 
He’s now told me he doesn’t want to associate with me/speak to me/ or even be in the same room as me anymore, and is no longer hanging out in our friendgroup, instead is hanging out with my toxic ex and their friends. 
I feel pretty hurt and confused by it all as he was a really good friend, yet has suddenly started shaming me for my decision through constant angry messages and pretty much guilt tripping me at this point. 

I was just wondering if I could get a second opinion/outside view on the situation as I can’t tell if I’m just being selfish and inconsiderate for turning him down as I didn’t feel ready for another relationship, and also because I feel like I’m ruining his friendships with the people in our friendgroup bc he’s avoiding us all now (because of me.) honestly if I’m in the wrong here I’d love to apologise to him and really want to try to salvage the friendship.

103,"This is kind of a confusing situation. There’s this girl (19F) I’ve (18M) known a long time. For some context, she did nicely turn me down several months ago when I told her how I felt (this isn’t about that at all). So I’ve refrained from messaging her. About a month ago, she posted some concerning things on her TikTok. The first vid showed a bunch of vapes and had a hashtag nicotine addiction. Other vids from her and her friends also show her partying and drinking. But one vid is what really triggered my concern for her. It was called “things I lost in 2019:” and then went to “my will to live”, “my lungs and liver”, “good grades”, and “my virginity”. She deleted the vid later in the day. I don’t necessarily know how serious everything is, but I still feel concerned. 

It’s like she had a character change or has been influenced. She had like a 4.3 high school gpa, as far as I know she wasn’t involved in anything risky, and she’s Christian. She did breakup with her ex about over a year ago, and she’s still with no one. She’s also lived with a mom that’s divorced multiple times. Maybe that’s had some effect on her and she’s been doing unhealthy methods of coping. But is it right of me to be concerned about what I’ve seen?

My main question is, should I say anything to her and maybe ask if she needs someone? We both go to different colleges until next fall (she doesn’t know that part). So that kinda limits what I can do. But I really want to let her know my concern and ask if I can help. I’m not trying to judge her for her choices. She just doesn’t seem okay at all.

So we were watching tik toks and there was a video about girls with a certain name and the stereotype behind it. My friend makes a joke about girls named “Bethany” ( that is not the name) are bitches because her old roommate was named Bethany and her roommate was incredibly cruel to her, verbally assaulted her multiple times even at a party publicly , and spread lies about her. Anyways I made a cruel insensitive joke saying “ actually girls named Bethany are nice” then I followed up by saying obviously not your old roommate though and I was laughing. She looked very mad and she take it back and I didn’t really know what to say so I just said I was joking and the whole situation brushed off but now I realized how rude of me it was to say that. Should I bring it up again and say sorry or by brining it up will be unnecessary as of right now and just bring up tension again?!",19Jan2020,1
105,"I asked my doctor for a referral to a psychiatrist for the first time. In the meantime, I'm just trying to keep going. It's very hard because I can't go an hour without thinking and stressing about my appearance. It's been like this since I can remember. I believe my mom has an eating disorder and instilled a harmful mindset in me. There wasn't a day that went by where she hadn't talked about dieting or hating her weight. She has been off and on diets and taking diet pills since I can remember. She has also had liposuction. She used to criticize my weight often. I have always been on the chubbier side, and people used to ask me out on a date as a joke. I'm taller and wear size 9 shoes, which is considered big for a woman. I often felt ashamed over the fact that I didn't have the willpower to be anorexic or bulimic. How bad is it that you WISH you had anorexia or bulimia because then you'd actually lose weight? But I don't know what I could possibly have. I don't binge eat, either. I just always have this hatred of my appearance, but I don't necessarily do anything that fits into eating disorder territory.

The only time I was ever happy about my appearance was in college because I was exercising about 3 hours a day (sometimes more). On top of that, I didn't drive and walked a lot. I lost about 20 lbs and felt good about myself. But I can't maintain that lifestyle anymore. I am working full-time, so I don't have the ability to exercise 3 hours a day. I eat healthy, but I've gained weight since I started working more, and my mental health has gone drastically downhill. I used to be happy, now I feel I can't be happy anymore. It's on my mind CONSTANTLY. Getting dressed in the morning sends me into a state of panic. Just the other day, I spent an hour and a half straight trying on clothes and changing out of them into a different outfit. Literally just trying on clothes for an hour and a half and hating everything. It got to the point that I broke down and started sobbing in the closet because I couldn't find anything I liked on my body. This happens about twice a week. It's weird, but it's at the point that I feel like I might as well be a man, because there's nothing feminine about my appearance. I am not transgender, but there have been times when I just felt like I should just be a man because that's all that I look like, even though I don't want to be. I feel like a woman, and I want to be petite and small, but I'm just not. I think about my weight every second of every day. I dream about it. I just don't know what to do.

106,"So I'm only young [20M] and I still got all my life ahead of me. So this isn't as urgent bit ant advice would be appreciated. Would it be a wise decision to move and live in Perth later in life?

Hi, 

I am unable to move around the building freely when she is around. I could be awkwardly starving than get up and cook something for myself while she is around. I have low self esteem with my cooking skills that she might ask me to let her “taste” or try my bad food and she would judge me. I am trying to act as I dont care but its obvious and I sometimes cannot hide it well. Its really hard to control my feelings. Sometimes I feel overwhelming and clingy to her. I am so desperate now. And what makes it worse is that she doesnt even speak the same language as I. I am trying to learn Spanish but I am far from having a decent conversation. 

Well, it all started that we had a mutual friend [M30] who used to cook for all of us. He was closer to me than anyone since we were from the same country. He used to cook and invite her, then she would cook and invite us. Well, at the time I could care less about her existance. Hell, I even was watching a movie with her at her bed and I didnt care about her at all. I had no feelings at all. I was  just totally careless. 

Since he (our mutual friend) left, I dont invite anyone nor cook for anyone and vice versa no one invites me. Its fair because I suck at cooking that I cannot really show off my skills yet. 

Well, but I started to develop feelings for her and things got worse. I started to hang out around her more. She seemed ok with me kissing her on the neck and hugging her. Even telling her that I was missing her. But then, I think she is getting a bit uncomfortable. Or perhaps I overwhelmed her. The problem is that we cannot communicate. My Spanish language skills are not good enough to date her. She is also leaving after few months and I am not ready for a serious relationship now. I dont have the love feelings for her. I have some feeling of lust and other interest in her, perhaps FWB. I dont know how to describe it. She is fun and before I had those feelings, we used to joke and laugh alot. Now she seems a bit distant. 

What do I do? 

Thank you",19Jan2020,1

I started smoking when I was around 20, and I'm soon turning 24, which makes it around 4 years. In those 4 years, I have been high everyday, except one time I tried to quit and lasted for 4 days. 

The time it all really went shit, was when I broke up with my ex around when I was 21, because she didn't know that i smoked and she really hated people that did smoke. After the break up, the amount of weed smoking has just been increasing, and as of today, I have smoked 49 bong hits.

I'm currently in university, and I can really feel the weed affect my motivation and thrive do stuff. I love school and I really enjoy sensation from learning, but for the last year, I haven't done homework, stopped caring, and missed a lot of school days, all I get done is smoking weed and play video games.

I really can't take it anymore. I want to quit, and want to get my life together, but it just don't know how. Today I used my last cigarette for a mix, and told myself, that after this, I'll be smoke free. No more weed, time to pull my own weight, and actually do something meaningful with my life, instead of just wasting it on weed and playing video games.

I guess what I'm really asking for, is some help and motivation to make this the one that counts

He is going through a seriously bad time because his parents are getting divorced. He lives with his parents due to his situation so he has to hear all their arguing and get dragged into it. They put immense pressure on him, asking him which parent he agrees with and his dad vents to him about the divorce. His dad is moving out in less than a week which will leave him to live with his mom until he can move in a year or two. That stresses him out even more. He tells me how he can't take it anymore and he feels immense pressure from them. His parents argue and his mom has no empathy for his dad which makes my boyfriend feel terrible. I feel so bad for him and wish he didn't have to deal with this. His parents are dragging him into their divorce. As a result, I ask him multiple times a day how he is feeling and he is opening up to me about how he feels. I try my best to be there for him and help him feel better. But, I worry about him a lot. He has blacked out twice in the past two days, presumably because of anxiety and stress. We were just talking and he ended it to go lay down because he felt like he was going to lose consciousness. This was right after his dad talked to him more about the divorce. He says he has had trouble breathing after talking to his parents. He has a history of bad anxiety and depression and I am really worried about his mental health.

128,"My sister has a problem she doesn't seem to acknowledge or understand. She is only attracted to tall, white, and handsome men. The reason this is a problem is statistically speaking, that is only about 3-5% of the male population and all the women are chasing those guys. She has been willing to date guys who are severely pathological just because they meet those physical requirements. Any other guy she dates, she says she ""doesn't feel a spark with"" and that's all there is.

She is rapidly reaching an age where she will not be able to have kids if she doesn't do something different. This scares her. I have told her quite bluntly that the most important thing is not if a guy is white, or 6' tall, or looks super hot, but whether he treats you well and can provide a future you like. I try to tell her to just date some boring normal guy who can give her a normal life.

But she won't listen to me. A few times she has admitted the only reason she dated a guy for so long was he was ""tall and hot"" but the rest of the time she pretends it's just coincidence that the only people she can enjoy dating are this way. 

She can get hundreds or thousands of guys to date. But yet she says none of them are good enough. 

Is there anything I can do to help her understand why she's having this problem or to help her correct it? Or am I doomed to watch her keep chasing guys who fit a certain height/face/race requirement while being otherwise awful until she hits menopause and becomes a lonely cat lady?",19Jan2020,1

Sorry if this isn't the kind of thing to ask for. I just want some advice and/or tips from people with experience. Note: I live in Baltimore County, Maryland.

I want to say that I absolutely love history. Yes, that makes me sound like a nerd and that is also the reason why I don't tell most people. I love local history, and I research a lot; almost every day. I research about my town, finding old archives and maps and such. I love archaeology so much; I have a metal detector that I often use in the woods behind my house; looking for old coins or artifacts, often going out of my way to research the history/origin of even minor things I find. My dream job is to become an archaeologist.

However, the salary of an archaeologist just isn't enough to have a family. Also, in my culture, you're often expected to have high-paying jobs in fields like medicine or IT. So, I'm thinking about programming and becoming a software developer.

However, I want to know if there's a way I can be both a software developer and an archaeologist, or if I can somehow be an archaeologist as a side job. Being both a software developer and an archaeologist might be too hard, so I'm thinking of switching ""archaeologist"" with ""historian"".

After getting them together, I found my boundaries so it's not like I'm doing everything for them in there relationship - that happens on some occasions. Anyways, T recently (just a week ago) kicked her dad out of the house. Well, her mom and her did. He's honestly a piece of shit, was always making false promises and an addict to drugs and alcohol. And every time he hurt her, I was left to pick up the pieces. I'm not saying this was an ""inconvenience"" for me, it just hurt seeing her get hurt by him so much when I could be there physically for her and pound her dad's face in. And it helped but took a toll on her when she and her mom got fed up and kicked his ass to the curb. We all celebrated though. Anyways, she thinks now that she may have bipolar depression for she has lots of the symptoms - and I believe her because my ex has it, and we were still friends for a long time after we broke up but we just kinda drifted apart from friendship too. I still my ex around though, and sometimes its when shes in her depressed mood. Anyways, I'm getting off-topic. I'm just extremely stressed and I have a lot going on in my life right now, but I spend a good quarter of my life online with T and M. And there's always drama, conflict with M's abusive father (we all have daddy issues tbh) and I'm ALWAYS the one that has to comfort, give advice and such. But after I'm done helping, I barely get a ""thanks"". I'm not saying I expect this for being a good friend, but they never really.. idk, let me know that I'm a good friend? For example. I just had a convo with T and she was saying that she is going to take a break from being online for a while to figure herself out. She was worried about what M would think and that he would hurt himself. I reassured her everything would be okay, and after that, I sent her basically an essay telling her what an amazing person she was and how lucky we were to have her and all that. I meant it, of course, I love her and M with all my heart. And I was expecting one of our sweet moments where we cry together and say goodbye on a sweet note. But she responded (after reading the essay) with:

""I'm just scared M will hurt himself though.""

And when she said that, it felt like something inside me broke. I know their lives are a challenge too, we're all troubled and I'm probably a dick for even complaining but like I just- I don't know. It hurt. And I can't say anything because that's narcissistic, and I don't even understand how I feel right now or why. All I want is for them to be happy and for me to put in as much as I can for them because that's what they deserve. And I guess I'll keep telling myself that's all I want, that's all I need from them. Them to be happy. And there's no way for me to prove to myself that's wrong because I don't know why I feel like it is.",19Jan2020,1

To some degree, the measure of peace of mind is determined by how much we are able to live in the present moment.

Without question, many of us have mastered the neurotic art of spending much of our lives worrying about variety of things all at once. We allow our past problems and future concerns to dominate our present moments, so much so that we end up frustrated depressed and hopeless. on the flip side we also postpone our gratification and our happiness, often conceiving ourselves that ""someday"" will be better than today. Unfortunately the same mental dynamics that tell us to look toward the future will only repeat itself so that ""someday"" never actually arrives.

Many people live life as if it were a dressing rehearsal for some later date. it isn't. In fact no one has a guarantee that he or she will be here tomorrow. Now is the only time we have  and the only time we have control over. When all of you attention is in the present moment, you stop obsessing about past events that might have been awkward or depressing and you also push the fear out of your mind. Fear is the concern over events that might happen in the future.

Don't let your past depress you and don't let your future scare you. The best strategy is to learn to bring your attention back to the present every time your mind wonders.

141,"Hello fellow redditors!

First of all, excuse me for my bad english!  
I have gotte in a problem for a longer time now (even before i tried any psychadelic drugs, my drug use is mentioned below), and which is really hard to describe, but i really dont know where else i could seek advice as its really hard to talk about, so i picked this anonymous website.  


I've always had problems in findindig out who i really am. Every time i chill out with a group of friends, i always question where i belong to. Am i the cool guy from class? Am i that nerd that barely talks to people? I feel that everybody has some special personality, that everyone has something that makes them special. I feel like a robot that has to do certain things to fit into society.

I feel lost. I've had multiple periods of depression about a year ago, thinking that im worthless etc., but luckily i have more or less defeated that by working out in the gym regulary, cut drinking and started socializing more. 

I've compiled a couple of topics below, which describes my problem in more detail:  


1) No Gf

I know that im not bad looking, and i have a good amout of friend groups where i kinda fit into them., and i have always been part in conversations, sometimes making the group laugh, sometimes cracking jokes that where kinda cringy, but i guess that happens to everyone once in a while. Yet there has been absolutely 0 girls that have shown any romantic interest in me. Many of my friends, the weird ones, the cool ones, the ""normal"" ones, have or have had a gf. I really dont know what im doing wrong? I dont blame women in general like incels (""ugh al women are sluts reee""), i know the problem is me. But what am i doing wrong? I feel im ""that weird guy"", but many signs have shown me that my friends see me as a completely normal person. Im completely lost in that regard but i hope that things may change or that i'll eventually find one. Im not really desperate, there is still a lot of time as im quite young, so this subject is not really a big concern. Imma just keep trying, if it works out its nice, if not well then it doesnt work out and i'll just live on somehow.

2) Drugs

Even at my young age i've tried a lot of drugs for recreational use, just to find out more about myself. MDMA, LSD, Weed, Alcohol and, most importantly, xanax, on which im on right so that i have the courage to create this post. Im not addicted to any of these substances, i just try them once in a while so that i can have more insight about myself. All in all, these drugs have given me quite an insight on who i am, but have also shown me that there much more on what i could improve on myself.

3) Friend groups

I have a couple of friend groups, and i feel like im always the kind of outsider, but for a fact i know that im not. People invite me often to parties etc, are happy when im around an i often enjoy the time beeing around them, its  always a nice experience. I have a friend group that is more chill, where you can talk about personal problems etc, where we chill at home somewhere and enjoy music and talk a lot. A have a friend group which is full of more of those party type persons, where we go out into clubs or homeparties and socialize there. And i have a group of friends which is a mix of both. I still dont know where i belong to? I feel fully involed in those kinds of friend groups, but as i mentioned above, im kind of not.

Im really not sure who i am. Sometimes i behave like this and sometimes like that. But im still living a normal live, sometimes im happy, sometimes im not. I know im eventually going to have a wife, a stable job, a house, kids and i'll finish off my life as an wise old man looking back into his life remembering all the beautiful things i have experienced. I mean if i had a gf my life would be in perfect balance atm, but well imma find some eventually, maybe not, lets see what the future brings.

Im pobably gonne be ashamed about a wrote about my biggest insecurities and insight into my life after i wake up after my sleep, but this a throwaway anyways, so lol.

The question now is: how can i find out who i really am? 

  
Thank you for reading this long post, i hope you have had a nice day, im really curious about your respones :)

PS: i didnt make this up. Im 100% serious about this.   
PPS: i wanted to post this into more sociolgy related subs, but my karma is to low for that, i hope you can forgive me for posting here :3",19Jan2020,1
143,"Lemme cement myself first, I am autistic, bipolar and a megalomaniac. I am covering nights because I’m the only drive thru person at my job who has flexible hours (One will not work into the AM and the other is a Minor) and have been jumping from mornings to mid shifts and closing shifts at a fast food restaurant.
This Night Manager used to be very friendly towards me and we’d joke around a lot but lately she’s just been so cold and rude to me, ESPECIALLY on days where I’ll come in to cover a call in. She’ll tell me if I’m talking to the other person “Go clean something”, without asking me what I am currently doing ( I’m a talker, yes, but I can multitask and, ya know, talk to someone as I’m passing someone). I’ve worked at this restaurant longer than her but she makes a list of things for only me, and not herself and the other closer (All managers who close are supposed to make a list for everyone, including themselves on the jobs for the night)
She’ll tell me to stop sweeping and go do something else because she wants to do floors.
But most of all, she just ignores me presence and is very passive aggressive towards me every time I do try to talk to her. I’ve told my general manager I will only work nights for a bit longer but this is a serious problem and I’m at my limit.
She’s also VERY aggressive with customers’ food, including slamming a clutter on the food instead of rolling it like it’s designed or even crushing customers food intentionally, even if the customer was pleasant.
I don’t like confrontation and leaving my job isn’t really an option because I need the health and dental insurance. Even now she looked at me in restrained disgust as I write this.

I’m not sure if I’ve done anything wrong as she’s usually vocal about problems.",19Jan2020,1
144,"I’ve never been so confused in my life. This girl out of no where texted me a year after we broke up (EXACTLY 1 year after, she said she counted it) and we started talking a bit. The first time I told her to fuck off and I blocked her. I unblocked her to take her off my blocked accounts and she texted me again as soon as I did. After that it was on and off texting sometimes we’d talk for 5 days straight and then just stop for a whole month or we would talk every few days. The thing is I’m not sure what to think because she’ll tell me a bunch of personal stuff, send a multiple texts at once and be intrigued in conversations and then other days she’ll be cold and send one word replies. I’m not necessarily interested but more curious as to why she texted me in the first place so I’ve been trying to get her to answer and she keeps avoiding it. She’ll beg me to call her but when I do she’s awkward and when I try to make conversation it’s one word replies again. I’m not really sure what she wants and if she won’t answer maybe someone else will cuz I might be missing something here.",19Jan2020,1

Next year I will be starting college. I planned on potentially studying Chinese and Economics. However, I am really passionate about sociology. I love how it encourages critical thinking. I like the research element. I like how it is subjective, how not everything is black and white. There is always more to understand, more to explore. There is always ways to improve ourselves and build a better future.

I also have some concerns. My dad has always told me how sociology is the “science” of excuses. And to a certain extent, I believe it. I also fear that if I become a sociologist, I will be bound by whoever is funding my research to sell their narrative. What if my research doesn’t support my funder’s goals. Will I have to cover it up? Ignore it? Hide it behind more convenient results(not exactly lying but still morally wrong)

Another thing to consider, will I be able to get a job as a sociologist? I’ll go to UVA at the latest after receiving my associates. If I can’t be a sociologist, I’d probably be content as a teacher or social worker or something within that general field of social sciences or service. 

If my sociology degree can not get me a career in that field, would I be able to get a decent career with my Mandarin skills/degree? Maybe work as an interpreter or as a translator. 

It is important for me to have a stable job doing something that somewhat interests me. I don’t really need a lucrative career, but I would like to be able to have some extra money to save. 12-15 years after doing that job I would hope to have saved enough to open my own bakery/ cafe, and work there instead. 

Thank you for your advice.",19Jan2020,1
147,"First off I (M27) want to say that I have a very small family so ever since I was young I have felt that friends are basically family too. I also apologize as I am not the best at articulating my thoughts and emotions especially in the form of text.

Over the last 2-6 years many of my old and closest friends have grown more and more distant and it has become extremely hard for me to just let go. When I try or something happens that pushes friends further apart I cannot just turn off my brain and constantly think and criticize myself over my decisions. Or when I don't get invited to something with a bunch of mutual friends it makes me extremely depressed even when it is something super miniscule. I have tried many things to try not to feel this way or just let go and not let it bother me but nothing seems to work. Curious if anyone has some suggestions for this. 



This all being said it is not like I haven't made new friends or anything but I struggle to deeply connect so they are friendships but nothing like the ones you make growing up with the people around you. And recently two friends that I felt very close to basically told me to never talk to them again. One thought she heard me and another friend say awful awful things about her that we would never say. My friend was extremely drunk and is loud and says stupid shit when drunk and may have crossed the line a little bit but nothing of the gravity she claims. However she has forgiven my friend and blames me for everything when I am positive that it was not me. Second a few friends went to the bars. We all got a little too wasted and the bouncer and I got into a little scuffle as he tried tackling me outside of the establishment after I had already left. I walked around the block to cool off and come back to see cops were called and it turned into a big deal. I confronted said cops saying my friends had nothing to do with the altercation and it was me they needed to talk to. It got solved we ubered home and then the next day he says to both my friend and I that he never wants to talk to us again. I have known him for 22 years. 

Those two incident were in the same year but like 9 months or so apart and I still can't just forget them and move on. It has really been eating away at me while making me extremely depressed. It feels like losing touch with a brother or sister to me. Thanks kind people of reddit for allowing me to ramble on and vent.",19Jan2020,1

149,"Okay, so here's the skinny: we are a group of fun-loving goofballs who work at a little survey joint at the mall in our hometown. I'll assign us all letters to make it easier: E, C, D, S, and our boss K. E and D are siblings and are very close. E and his wife just had a baby, a boy. And when we work, it never really feels like work. We all get along with the regulars, have fun, are smiling, happy. 

Until today.

When we found out E's baby son died.

No one knows how. S and his girlfriend, who hang out with E, hung out with him yesterday and that was the last day any one of us saw that poor baby alive. And now he's gone. They think it was SIDS. And E is utterly broken.

K actually called me in early today and that's how I found out. I am covering E's shifts next week, something I'm more than happy to do to help him out in such a trying time.

My problem is thus: I am genuinely afraid that E and/or his wife might kill themselves over this, which absolutely cannot be allowed to happen for obvious reasons. So I need a plan of action to help my friend and keep that from happening.

150,"Some background info, the man I have been talking to is in his early 40’s and I grew up listening to the band he’s in. I was always a fan and didn’t realize until a couple months ago, that he was following my account. His Instagram is fairly small and doesn’t really post much personal information. We have gotten to talking fairly often. I’m a really lonely person and don’t have any friends, so it was nice to see him be interested in chatting, and I have to admit I was pretty flattered. He told me how is ex died in an accident, he values stable relationships, etc. but as he felt more “comfortable” with me he started saying really contradictory things like how he sleeps with women, relationships disgust him, etc. He was only interested in talking about painful things from my past, and I wanted attention so I forced myself to do so. The even bigger issue is, he has a girlfriend. The woman I saw on his older posts I figured was just a friend, I didn’t know they were actually together. I guess they really didn’t seem like typical photos of couples that I’d think of. I feel really hurt because lately he hasn’t messaged me much probably because I annoy him. Normally I’ve sent nudes when I wanted to get his attention but now I feel really bad. I don’t know if I should tell her, but he would hate me and I don’t want that. I want us to continue talking so I was wondering if I should just ignore what I sound found out? Do I tell her? What do I do? I have liked this guy for so long, but he’s even said weird bizarre things like telling me easy ways to kill myself and that he’s busy and just to talk to him once a week. I sound over dramatic but I really don’t have anybody in my life and this is just really devastating to me. I feel like he took advantage of my vulnerability, and I don’t even think he cares.

151,"Throwaway because my boss has Reddit. 
First time posting anything to Reddit. 
Posting from mobile, sorry if there any formatting issues. 

Some backstory: me (19F) and my significant other (20M) work at a small family owned business. Both of us have worked here for a couple years. It's a pretty friendly environment, with coworkers often joking and teasing each other as we work. The bosses, a married couple who own the business, also joke around with everyone. 

I have some back pain problems, and it flares up more when I'm on my feet more than normal. The past month or has been particularly busy, so my back pain has definitely flared up.

I texted one of my bosses, Boss 2, letting them know that my back pain was particularly bad today and that I couldn't work, and figured that'd be that. My SO was also not working today, so neither of could know if anything was being said about us being gone.

I'm pretty good friends with one of my coworkers, and they came by later today. I asked how work was, if the bosses were mad at me calling out with such short notice. They told me yeah they were mad, but Boss 1 thought I was faking my pain for a day off. Boss 1 made a very inappropriate joke to most of my coworkers workers. It's not a direct quote, of course, but it was along the lines of ""(throwaway-workadvice) would only have back pain that bad if SO f*cked her that hard, but I doubt SO would actually do it.""

Now, Boss 1 has made some.. inappropriate jokes before that have made SO and me uncomfortable, but this was way over the line. From the sounds of it, he made the joke to all my coworkers that were working, and in a way that it wasn't exactly a ""joke."" SO and I don't know what to do, there's no HR for us to report to, it's a small business where the only higher ups are Boss 1 and Boss 2. We've dealt with different types of harassment from them before, but this was way over the line and all the other issues are piling up.

This town is very small, in the middle of nowhere, so it's not like we can just.. contact somewhere else for help. SO has left for personal reasons, but I can't leave for at least another couple of months. We need advice for how to handle this, especially since I have to stay working at this job for a little bit longer.

I'm sorry for the long read and the long background info, but any help would be appreciated. Thank you",19Jan2020,1
152,"I met up with one of my friends last month. I really enjoyed it and am just reflecting on it all. One thing I am naturally terrible at - and what I am dwelling on is how we said ‘goodbye’ at the end.

The last time I met this friend (about a year ago) she said ‘see you later’ to me on parting. Last month, when we parted, we were on the tube and talking right to the very end before she had to get off at her stop. As the train pulled in to her stop, I initiated a cuddle with her (she initiated one with me when we met). She said something along the lines of it was good to have met and good luck with my masters and dissertation (which I am currently working on) and wished me a good **Christmas**.

The words that ring in my ears though were her final words to me ‘see you, bye’. She then left the tube very quickly and didn’t stay on the platform to wave as the train left with me on it.

Is ‘see you, bye’ a suggestion that she doesn’t want to see me again? Last year when we parted she said ‘see you later’ to me. This meant that I had the confidence to reach out and message her and arrange today because she said that. Ending the day on ‘See you, bye’ means that I will be much less likely to be as confident in the future to reach out to her again. 

We spent six hours together when we met and I really enjoyed it. 

Do you think that ending it in this way has shut the door on me contacting her again (maybe in a year or so) to arrange another catch up?",19Jan2020,1

154,"Hi! I was just posting this to hopefully get some knowledge as to how weird or unlikely this is, or if I should even be worrying about this at all.

I and my 2 friends were walking through a relatively small wood in our neighborhood park. Soon enough, around 200-250ft we found a severed pony/horse head. This park is around a city area and deep within a neighborhood. The only thing that could've killed it would have been a coyote since those are around the area. However, coyotes in my area only really kill chickens and cats and stuff. Never a pony/horse. 

Things I noticed: 

1: It was skinned, with no fur. Either it has rotted and all the fur is gone or it was skinned.

2: I couldn't see any ears on it. (I flipped it both ways with a stick)

3: It wasn't a clean decapitation. The neck is brutally mutilated and torn apart.

Theory 1: It was killed and then torn apart by coyotes, with one dropping the head off here. But, the head hasn't been eaten at all, and the area of the woods (the place we were in was kind of an inconvenient outstretch of the woods, detached from the bigger section) was odd.

158,"Im F(20) and my boyfriend is M(21). I've been with my boyfriend for almost 5 years and we have a 3 month old together. Hes cheated and both emotionally and physically abused me ever since we've been together and I've always made excuses for him and forgiven him. Hes also narcissistic and a pathological liar. He will lie about everything from making a mess to feeding the animals, paying the Bill's, and planning to marry another woman. He has severe anger issues as well; hes given me a black eye, a broken arm, he even injured me while I was pregnant. We've lived together for 4 1/2 years and we own a ranch.
           
        While I was pregnant ( both myself and the baby were highrisk) he was cheating on me with a girl that he works with. He met her kids, they told each other how much they loved each other, they were planning on getting married.  I was alone and depressed my entire pregnancy. He made me go by myself to the high risk ob which was over 2 hours away and I had to go every week.  Instead he would go to her house. Our baby had to be in the nicu for a week and I had (still have) super bad postpartum depression. When we got back from the hospital he moved in with his girlfriend and left me by myself to take care of our newborn. I just sat and cried on the couch everyday.  He kept telling me over and over how he didn't love me, didn't want me, how we weren't good together and gave me court papers for partial custody of our daughter ( which I didn't sign)

        After 2 weeks he moved back in and started sleeping on the couch. Telling me how he made a mistake and how he loves me. He says that he never had any feelings for her and that he only did it because he wanted to hurt me (which I obviously dont believe) . After he moved back in I found out that he was still talking to her about how much he loves her and missed her and stuff like that. It hasn't even been a month since the last time that I know of that they talked to each other and he keeps telling me how I'm the only one for him and how he wants to marry me. ( we were engaged before I got pregnant and I was already planning our wedding). But I honestly dont think I can believe or trust him and idk things just dont feel the same between us anymore. All I can constantly think about is how her kids had started calling him dad and they were planning on getting married. But everytime I try to talk to him about it he just blows me off and says that he loves me and that we're going to get married. I've been thinking about leaving but I dont have a job rn and I do love him but hes still still lying about everything and I dont think he loves me . I think he just likes the fact that I love him and take care of him . I dont know what to do. Any advice?

162,"Most relationships I’ve had come with constant fear of being tied down to that person, I start off strong sometimes but then slowly become despondent. I immensely enjoy taking people out for dates and going on little trips with them especially if they were having a bad day, though I often do that with many girls leading to unwanted expectations. Ive been talking to one girl for a while and enjoy the time I spend with her, I treat this connection like a relationship even though I tell her it’s not an official one. I think its stressful for the person in the long run because I think I’m leading her on, but I don’t know how to break it off because I want that friendship. I’ve tried not dating and just being single but I always stray toward the relationship dynamic. Does anyone else have these habits and/or have advice for fixing them? I know it sounds horrible and it’s a bad way to be towards people, so I’m trying my hardest to change this.",19Jan2020,1

165,"I am 25 and I am working a low paying ($10/ hour) job that I enjoy as a preschool teacher. Last summer I graduated with a bachelors degree in speech pathology but rather than obtain the necessary masters I am really wanting to go back to school for a degree in nursing. 
I am currently working during the day and taking the first of 3 sequential pre-requisites for nursing school at night. 
In June I age out of being on my parents health insurance but my current job has a plan I can get covered by.
I have a few paths I can choose from:

1. Quit work at the preschool in June and take the final 2 prerequisites in the summer so I can begin nursing in Spring 2021 (Id miss the fall 2020 application deadline). In this option I won’t have the cheaper health insurance through work anymore and would need to buy marketplace coverage for fall 2020 through Spring 2023 when I’d graduate. I’d work full time somewhere for Fall 2020 and part time once I enter the nursing program.

2. Keep working at the preschool and take the final 2 prerequisites in fall and spring terms at night. In this option I would maintain the cheaper health insurance until I enter the nursing program in Fall 2021. Then I’d need the more expensive market place insurance for Fall 2021-Fall 2023 when I’d graduate. I’d work part time throughout the nursing program.

3. Quit now and find a job with more flexible hours that allows me to work while completing the prerequisites and the nursing program. The risk is that the pay might not be any better and the job might not offer health insurance and require me to buy a more expensive marketplace plan.

Any advise as to which is the more financially responsible path in the long run would be greatly appreciated. I’m feeling so stuck.",19Jan2020,1
166,"Do you ever just look at yourself and your actions to others and think you need to change but every attempt to change just causes either you or anyone you try to get to know pain?

Some background: the few friends I have use me for gifts or help when they need it which I have perpetuated with my actions. But never bother and don't actually care about me unless it makes life harder for them. Relationships I never connect with anyone I date. love is a heady feeling I may feel in the first month but is gone and I spend the rest of the time trying to get it back.

I have tried getting out and meeting new people, talking, therapy, having a pet but each attempt tbh just leads to me having a pity party or new friends who due to my people pleasing personality tire of me.

I know it shouldn't just be me but to be honest anyone or everyone I've reached out to says it's all in my head/don’t bother people are stupid/etc

To make it worse, she caught her two friends having sex in her bed and she’s not on good terms with them anymore, or at least I don’t think so.

To top it off, she got into a pretty big fight with my dad.

Please, someone give me advice on this.",19Jan2020,1
169,"Specifically in this situation I'm talking about my mom. We Don't have a good relationship simply put.  But what is frustrating is that only I seem to realize it.     Little background I am 1st generation and she is fresh off the boat periods that being said my mom is very westernized and Actually in upper management for a large company in hospitality.  I only mention this  Information  To eliminate any  Preconceived cultural notions heard my mom is a business woman and is able to communicate with others extreamly well.

 That has spuratically started her own businesses, is extremely proficient within our local chamber, and has a great reputation for being a great woman and mother.   Part of which was established through the tremendous amount of time shes dedicated to those organizations...  Combine that with  The fact that people automatically assume she's super mom because she's a single woman.... And you have a perfect recipe to  F**** up your kid.

Going to lay it all on the line  Storing now. My sister and I have a 5 year difference in age.   So she was always somewhat sheltered from the decisions my mom made in regards to our future. She was at an age where going to 8 schools in 6 years  Was an irrelevant factor  In her personal and emotional development... Whereas that combined with the fact that I've moved at least 10 times before I was 17  Really f**** up my ability to properly have relationships with people.  More importantly it's caused this alarming Debate internally as to who I am,  And more recently whether or not my mom had any of my best interests in mind at all Throughout the years where she was supposedly  Trying to be supermom. Half the times we move houses,  Was simply so my mom could appease this need she had to be seen  As successful.  So we go from renting a 3 bedroom in a crapy town to a one and a 1/2 or 2 bedroom in a nicer part of town. It had gotten to the point where I wouldnt even unpack.   

 But honestly despite all that  I'm pissed off because I bought into the me and my mom against the world bullshit she fed me  And got let down so hard.  
Every time I walk into a restaurant as a child my eyes got went to the cheapest part of the menu.
 The few sports that I did get to play a whole season through,  Mom never had to be there because I knew she was busy and award nights...fuck em, its cool if bailed last minute every time.
How about Being aware enough to understand (at 16) how emotionally fucked up your becoming ...so much so  That you had to beg your mom to stay in one place for your sister's mental health.... my longest stay at a school was sophmore through senior year at my second highschool...my sister, however was able to go from 6th till her senior in high school  With the same friends, in the same house, And now has a relationship with my mom That I believed I had to suffer to earn.  Maybe it's my fault for not bitching,  Or maybe it's my fault for  Not seeing my mom as a dumb bitch from day one...

 But I'm currently on the verge of losing my entire family because they don't understand where some anger I have stems from. I Joined the army to put myself through college come on because I was told there was no other way. 1st week I left for basic training they moved into a smaller house where conveniently I didn't have a bedroom.   So here I am constantly thinking of ways to eliminate the burden from my mothers shoulders, And here she is constantly f******* me. And I believe the worst part of it all is that she's so unaware of her actions that she genuinely believes  the bullshit she was feeding me... I mean this done beach got cheated on by my stepdad 8 years into the relationship, and still had another kid with him at 40 Before I graduated high school And without ever understanding what the word stability meant. This cunt had the balls to ask me whether they should consider having another kid as were living  Paycheck to paycheck  And as my stepdad just lost his job for fucking another coworker that he also impregnated..

 My mom has 3 jokes that  she tells her friends about me,  She  Thanks they are cute. But as you'll see they epitomize who she was as a mother entirely.

 1st joke is after 12 years of me playing football the camera she had no idea what position I played. After moving to the 2nd high school in 2 years. The athletic director after what position I play and she couldn't answer. She thought that was cute because she's a woman and its football. He I could tell saw for what it was. Not to mention that to this day when she tells that story to somebody she looks like a fuckin moron;  Also doesn't help that she follows that joke  up with  typically a reference to  Again how naive in cute she is to my entire, very accomplished, 10 year military career.  Bitch had the nerve to ask me why I joined; meanwhile never forgotting to ask you for my discount when it applied...


 Tonight was a final straw.  I'm a position where I currently don't have a vehicle for the next week because I'm transitioning businesses. She has a $10000 all wheel drive vehicle that I asked to utilize in the 4-5""  of snow we had been getting...  I already knew the answer prior to asking because as always it's a firm and quick no despite any reasoning....  So instead of being helpful she came up  With an idea I'd never have thought of which was to use an Uber in 6"" of snow and my driver was about 60 years old...
 I'm in the auto  industry and drive $100000 cars on a regular basis...being as that  I Am a buyer for a handful of exotic dealerships...

However despite that my mom would rather  i spend $90  To have a 60 plus year old woman drive me around in 5 to 6"" of snow... Again the frustrating part being her developed ability  To spew absolute horse shit, incorrect bable, just nonsense... And believe it...

So what do I do Lose my family the only 2 people in my life.... Or do I ignore the issues come up or 10 likes good common and go on the rest of my life Lost as f****... I mean at this point I don't even know if the things  She was telling me about my father were true.  I come to find out later on in life seems like she wanted to keep me from my father out of spite. And also due to the fact that  She got remarried twice after my dad   Only the have it all in the same way proves to be pretty disturbing and a huge credibility issue... Sheep for cans like she's doing things for me, so that she can appear that way to everybody else. But then denies that there is any issue and leaves me going crazy with nobody to talk to or any way to navigate this..help",19Jan2020,1

A while ago, i asked her if she has instagram she nodded no and said ""i don't like social media""  she asked me about one of our coworker's number but never asked for mine, even though i hinted more than once that i want us to be friends outside of work. one day i saw her using instagram, eventho she said that she doesn't have one. i also noticed that she talks to someone alot on phone on so she might be seeing someone, could that be why she's pushing me away? i never showed any interests in anything more than a friendship. i didn't ask for her socials again because i didn't wanna be clingy. we both go to college so i only work with her on Saturday.  today, she told me that she will work Thursdays instead of Saturdays because her mom is here and she wanna spend the weekends with her. we walked together to the bus stop and she left. i was hoping she could give me any sort of communication to keep in touch, she knew i was waiting for it. im sick of having school ""friends"" and work ""friends"" but no real friends that u could spend the night with. she probably doesn't have this issue, she's likable and everyone loves her. i still have the option to get her number from my coworker and hit her up. idk what to do.",19Jan2020,1
173,"Background: I year back I dated this girl. We had lots of fun and enjoyed the relationship. One day I wasn’t feeling too good physically or mentally and decided to  end things, not for any reason at all, other than how I was in the moment. 

Now: I have figured out my physical problems and now take medicine for my mental issues as well. I am dating a new girl, however we fight due to conflicting schedules, underlying issues, and differences in background. Me being from this city, and her moving here for a job. We both understand that she has to leave this coming summer to a new office, and due to Financial commitments I cannot move with her. 

The issue:  I am not the most happy in my relationship with this girl. When she is here it’s amazing and I couldn’t be more happy, but when she is gone for work........ it’s terrible, she will often miss read a text and ignore me for the day, or tell me to piss off entirely. It’s starting to become a real issue. 
 
         The first girl and I aren’t friends anymore, but occasionally talk and have conversations, but always excuse ourselves to not get attached again. Lately she has been flirting with me, and talking to me more often. But then I noticed something, she seems to be in a very bad mental state, with her abusive family, and with her only mother, her only “rock” who is now dying of cancer. I want to be there for her, but am scared of losing what I have with my girlfriend. 

Solution? 

A) break up and get back with this girl, you had a blast with her, and only broke up due to misplaced statehood. 

B) ignore her as it isn’t your “problem” anymore

C) lend as much help as possible without over extending and hurting your current relationship more. But keeping in mind that you aren’t happy",19Jan2020,1

She set me up with this guy, and she would be overly invested in the relationship. V would force me to FaceTime him and if I didn’t, she would put my face in the camera (jokingly maybe?). She also sent the guy pictures from the photoshoot without my permission which I found kind of weird, especially since she did this behind my back. She would always make comments like “his eyes are gray when he talks to you”, “he never looks at me like that”, “he never said that to me”, and “you’re so pretty, no wonder why he likes you so much”. Then, I found out that they used to date, but he dumped her after 7 hours. I thought that maybe she was jealous of me for maintaining a relationship with him, or maybe because of my looks (as cocky as that sounds)? When I dumped the guy, she seemed pretty relieved and she started talking about other places to do the shoot. Today, on her Snapchat story, she posted some depressing quote and her wall in the background. Her wall had a bunch of pictures of her boyfriend (which she dated for 2 years), 2 pictures of her family, and a bunch of pictures of me. I was kind of weirded out that she took the time to print them and put them on her wall. My friends started to notice that she acts pretty weird around me. What do you think about this situation?

My car battery broke had to dip in to fix that. That’s fine I save but then get smacked with the bathtub. Plumbing issue happened and during that repair the bathtub cracked (it’s one of those tub shower combos very thing material easy for a steel toed shoe to go in when you slip!) So now the whole tub needs to be ripped out. Naturally I thought of covering it with a bath fitter type deal but they wanted to charge my ass 9k! 

I found a contractor who will do it for 3k and repair the plumbing job that’s left. The plumbing issue leaked into the walls and naturally needs repair in the other rooms. I’ve already started repairing the washroom ripped up all the subfloor that rotted fixed the structure and slapped down some nice wood floors. But that was the last of my “extra rainy day” funds.

Now I’m not so crazy to souly base my financial life on the internet but my wife and I are at a crossroad. We can’t decide what to do first. Fix the rest immediately or stick to the plan of paying off almost all the debt ?

199,"So I’ve been talking to this girl for two weeks pretty heavily back and forth on this app and we talked about some pretty personal stuff so there’s already a bond between us. I wasn’t 100% certain I was attracted but I got carried away in our conversation and said stuff that I shouldn’t have and now she thinks I like her as well. Anyways we added each other on Instagram and when I checked out her profile that kinda sealed the deal, I didn’t really find this person attractive or feel the same way I did before. Going any further would be a lie for me and her.  Now we haven’t thankfully which should ease her pain but now this girl is pretty heavily invested in me, how do I break this up before it gets worse for her? 

Also to add on above, this is on a dating app and she’s far away, like a 6 hour flight far, we both talked about the distance but didn’t go into depth. I’ve told her I have a date with another girl I met and I was wondering if I could use that as an excuse to end things. The key thing is I don’t want this girl to feel pain but I think it’s past that point, I already feel like garbage for leading this girl on this far.",19Jan2020,1
200,"So for context, the last few years haven't been the best for me and my wife, culminating in me being fired from my job earlier this week. After some lengthy conversation and a lot of soul searching, we decided that we needed a drastic change if we were ever going to break out of the cycle we've been stuck in. 

After bouncing a few ideas back and forth, I randomly decided to mention military service. After another smaller discussion about what branch personally felt best, we decided on the National Guard. We browsed the site, read most of the material pertaining to our personal reasons for joining, and we decided (After a coin flip that was decidedly against the choice lol) that I should go for it. 

I have the recruiters email open and I'm ready to start the process...and I want to get honest opinions about the decision from people who have either joined the National Guard specifically, or just the idea of military service in general. I want a very unbiased, clear picture of what I'm getting into, not just what is portrayed in videos and media. 

I appreciate any and all advice given, thank you.",19Jan2020,1

202,"I’m a full-time freshman in college, and atm I’m in the midst of my second semester. I work at Wendy’s about 3-4 days a week, ranging from 4-10 hours shifts. I usually work in the evenings on weekdays and mid-days on weekends. 

I’d say my expertise lies in customer service instead of making the food. I’m usually on front register or drive-thru, working through the lunch and dinner rushes. I’m moving out in June so I’ve been betting on waiting it out.

A mutual friend of mine offered up a job at a pizzeria which I’m really thinking about taking. It’ll be a waiting/counter job, with tips and flexible hours which I need. Thing is, as much as I hate the establishment I work for I kind of like the people there for the most part. We’re all apathetic about working so it’s usually pretty fun. But then again it’s minimum wage whereas I’d be getting $9 plus tips at the pizza place.

204,"So a few months ago, my best friend was shot and killed by a complete stranger. She lived here in town on her own, and all of her family lives on the other end of the state, so I've never met any of them. On the website for the newspaper in the town she was from, they had an obituary,  and it listed her brother's email address at the bottom,  for if anyone had any questions or wanted to talk about anything.  I have no idea what happened after she died, so I don't know where or if she was buried,  because I'd like to go see her.

But I have no idea how to write this email; how do I ask what I want while still being aware that I'm talking about the death of someone he knew his entire life?  And her ex boyfriend blames me for the circumstances leading to her death, what if he's voiced his opinions about me to her family? 

Do I explain who I am, and that we were really close? And how do I refer to her? For the most part she went by Sam, but her family and a small handful of friends called her sammy, and she insisted that I should call her sammy if I wanted.  So if I called her that in my email,  would her brother get mad at me for calling her that name? And this obit was published in August,  and I haven't been able to get myself to just write this email,  so is he going to wonder why I've been silent for the past 6 months?

I love him and he’s told me he’s loved me. We have our ups and downs just like every couple and truthfully we’ve had more downs than ups. I’m unemployed and living with his family without having to pay bills and ofc I’m grateful but I’m so scared he’s cheating on me. He’s a very social person and he’s the sweetest guy ever. Both of us have restricted each other of talking to the opposite gender due to jealousy and other personal reasons. We have no trust in each other and truthfully I’ve been annoying him more and more accusing him about cheating but he does the same. I don’t know what to do at this point because we’ve both kept secret social media accounts from each other. I’ve asked him to clean up his accounts but his excuses are that their his friends or coworkers. He’s told me to clean up mine and I did I deleted my accounts and every friend request has to go through him and he always blocks any guys on my accounts.

216,"I have known this girl for years and we have been best friends for almost as long. I would say I have had feelings on/off for her since I was around 12/13. In between then and now I have had a couple of girlfriends, but no matter what my feelings for her keep coming back. We live together in University and already have a place for the rest of the University (with another friend from High School) set up.

Recently, talking to my best friend and catching up on life, I have noticed that my feelings for her were coming back again. The last time I had them was when I confronted her about them. It was a dark time for me and in the aftermath, I concluded that I just thought too much of our friendship and confused feelings. Now that these feelings are coming back again, I do not know what to do. Her relationship is also not doing well and it seems like it is coming to an end. I do not want to seem predatory or like I am preying, but perhaps this just fueled the fire and it seems like an opportunity? I would never do anything to purposefully harm her relationship, because at the end of the day she is still my best friend and if she is happy that is all that matters.

I guess my question is, how do I cope with my feelings for her? Both if she becomes single or stays in the relationship. If they have been around for so long they clearly are more than nothing. There is something about her that I do not want to let go. She brings a sense of comfort, and the thought of coming home to her after a long day of work/school brings joy. There is a connection that I do not know how to describe effectively, I just know that this person is more than a friend in my eyes.

I have tried to suppress and have tried to overcome these feelings but I cannot, so what am I to do? Do I continue my life with these emotions, holding them back to at least ensure that we will have our friendship? If she stays in her relationship then I will simply put my feelings aside and be happy for her. But what if it ends? She has also had feelings for me before, but from what I know they were before I confessed my feelings.

Thank you in advance, any help is appreciated.",19Jan2020,1
217,"I'm 24M. I'm in college and today I spent the day studying a male friend and two girls friends of mine. All of them are roommates. One of the girls is girlfriends with the guy, the other one has been on an on-and-off relationship with another guy. I've known all of them for 3 years. The thing is, this on-and-off relationship one of the girls is on is... difficult I guess. They fight a lot and stuff. She was talking with the other girl along the afternoon, who is of the opinion they should break up, then they both went to her room to discuss it in private while me and the other guy talked about cars.

20 minutes later they came back and things went on as planned. However, by dinner time, the girl in the couple asked if I didn't mind bringing another guy to have dinner with us because he was dining alone, which has been the plan since the start of the day and this guy was never mentioned, and he's not someone either of us gets along with regularly.

At this moment alarm bells start going off. I'm thinking that the girl invited this guy to be her roommate's date, and I'm just the assigned driver for the night. This was kind of proven by how the evening progressed. They were pretty close for two people who had never met before. Even assuming she was instantly attracted to him and vice-versa, usually people tend to play it cool. Or maybe I'm just clueless idk. But she was leaning her head on his shoulders as he was showing her something on his phone, leaning over his legs to check his phone, going over to him a few times to start a short conversation and vice-versa, etc. As we got back in the car, guy was kissing her jacket/arm. She wasn't reacting though.

I didn't really feel they were attracted to each other (he didn't talk a lot, there wasn't really a lot of touching/laughing/talking/chemistry, or anything really apart from the few things I said), but at this point I was feeling kind of bad. I felt I was being used, and they were just testing the waters with each other. This is just my read of the whole situation, and I think it explains everything. By the end I wasn't comfortable looking at the rear view mirror of MY own car to avoid watching the guy awkwardly kissing her on her jacket.

I did end up asking her ""So what was going on back there"" after dropping him off. And I made a few jokes on it. She denied he was kissing her jacket. 

Then I started thinking I might have come across as more jealous than angry. I sent her roommate a text asking if she was mad, explaining I was feeling uncomfortable for not being able to look in the mirror. and saying I felt like I had crossed the line and was willing to apologize to her in person if needed. I am not attracted to this girl, but I'm getting to know her best friend and we're getting along. I wouldn't want her to tell her friend that I'm an extremely jealous guy regarding this girl I've been friends with for 3 years without ever making any sort of move on her.

I'm probably going to be with them again, and I'm thinking of just coming clean, explain why I was mad, and that I'm not jealous. I just put the puzzle pieces together and felt quite used and it came out the wrong way. What do you guys think of the whole situation?",19Jan2020,1

However, I lived at home with my parents, and basically didn’t have “real world” responsibilities. Due to the harsh realities of life, my family is gone, and I’m on my own as a fully financially independent man. With that said, I’m barely getting by in life. The money I have goes to bills and basic necessities. I’m trying to pursue a long-term difficult career venture in film &amp; tv production. 

Women always position themselves around me whenever I’m in public and I can’t help but think “You may be attracted to me physically but you won’t stick around if you knew my situation.” And because of that, for the most part, I don’t approach women who give all the cues. 

My problem: I’m so bothered by the fact that I feel this “invisible peer pressure” to talk to girls when I don’t feel comfortable with my life situation to wanna pursue them.

recently, i told his room mate about my feelings and she told me that they were mutual at one point and he was really into me over the summer. however, according to his room mate, he felt as though it wasn’t reciprocated, so he came up with some excuses as to why he backed out of talking to me/having feelings for me. His reasons were: he felt like i wasn’t into him because he always texted first and didn’t catch onto his signals, he said i wasn’t confident enough, and he said that we were too similar. His room mate, however, thinks the biggest thing is that he didn’t want to get hurt so he backed out. 

we started talking again recently and things have been going pretty decently i think. i’ve been taking more initiative and texting him first and just working on my overall confidence. that being said, go you guys think there’s any hope at all that we could get back to where we were and potentially start a relationship or do you think it was just the worst timing and biggest missed opportunity? do you think i should just give up and accept that we fucked up or should i try again?",19Jan2020,1

226,"Okay so I (an American) use a language app where I basically talk to people from foreign countries in order to learn more about their language, culture, country, etc. 

So earlier this week, I was on the app just scrolling around when I stumbled upon this girl (let’s call her P) who I thought was kinda cute. Anyway, I followed her and left it at that but then later during the day she was the first to initiate the chat  by texting “heyy”. I responded and we got to talking and it was actually a really good conversation. She asks for my Instagram account and I gave it to her and so we transitioned our texting over to Instagram. On the language learning app, I posted a drawing and she said in our PM on the app that I was good at drawing, she liked the picture that I drew, and she even called it beautiful. 

Our conversation over at Instagram was also really good but then she just suddenly left me on seen. Obviously she very likely has stuff going on in her life and I respect that since I’m also a busy guy and don’t always get back to people’s texts so I can understand that. But when she posted something onto her Instagram story and I replied to the picture since I thought it was cool, she just gave me a name of what the picture was and when I asked her to elaborate, she just said “wait” and has never gotten back to me ever since. 

Again, I can respect and do understand if she’s got stuff going on in her life and I shouldn’t be her main priority. If she’s busy with school or family stuff then she should focus on that instead of texting some guy 8,000 miles away in an entirely different country across the largest ocean in the world who she texted earlier this week and barely know. But I do still want to talk to her since she seems like an incredibly interesting girl and I want to learn her language and understand her culture. I’m not expecting for anything to come out of our little texts and while that’d be cool and nice, I like to consider myself a realistic person and see that we’re not gonna suddenly start dating out of the blue like that. 

But if I screwed up somewhere, I’d like to know so that I can fix it and learn from it. So far my plan is to basically just wait and see where all of this goes. And I mean, it is what it is, I can accept that. I’m thinking that she’ll probably never text back and you know what, that’s cool, it’s whatever. I’m not those crazy desperate guys who will never accept the fact that a girl just doesn’t like him. Plus, I’m not losing anything since I’m probably never gonna ever see her in my life so I’m not hung over the fact that a girl didn’t text me back.

I have this friend, well I had. We’ve known each other for almost three years and she’s been for me through thick and thin; she told me everything about her family problems (Her parents were separated since she was born and they recently divorced) and about her on again off again boyfriend problems. She even talked me out of suicide when I was going through an extremely rough time. She was the closest thing to a best friend I’ve ever had but she lied, she lied about stuff about her boyfriend and my other friends.
 
She was mildly delusional too, a small gesture her ex/current/ex boyfriend would make meant that he wanted to get back together even after he had even called her a wh*re once. 

So, a few weeks ago I was in a pretty bad mess. I and another girl from my class was accused of being illicit substances to school, we even almost got kicked out. During that time this girl/ my friend told a few people that I had given the other girl involved money to bring the substance to school, and I hadn’t.
This happened before my name was cleared, so I was super pissed at her that she did this even after I had saved her arse a few too many times. I told her that I was breaking all my contacts from her (which I did) and that she was a lying dumb madwoman (my exact words). 
I haven’t talked to her since but a lot of mutual friend have told me that she’s pretty sad about the incident and that she has no real friends left. 


I feel pretty shitty about the whole situation and can’t help but wonder would it be right for me to talk to her again. I just feel sad about not having such a good friend next to anymore... I just don’t know what to do anymore. My friend tell me to stay away from her but I can’t help but search for her during lunch or think about her whenever i enter the school.

Obviously, a buttload of things have occurred ever since that time period, but I'll try to be as precise yet detailed as possible. I failed two academic terms at the college I'm attending, and despite all the things I tried (e.g. going to office hours, looking up study tips, attending study workshops, or just really trying hard), things were way too difficult than expected. When I had failed one academic term, I just said I failed an important class, which my mom treated it as nothing (she was trying to be optimistic, but clearly offered no solution). After going through this bullshit, I decided to check out healthcare professionals to determine if they would know what was going on (in a nutshell, my parents don't like the idea of mental healthcare). Thus, after a lot of questions were asked, I finally got an answer: ADHD and a separate learning disability. At this point, I was glad I at least got an answer, even if that answer wasn't as helpful or good as I thought it would be. I recently started meds for my ADHD, but I think it's going to take a couple more weeks of experimenting bc I still don't feel an improvement in my symptoms.

Anyways, I plan to tell my parents after I find the right ADHD med plan that helps my symptoms, but I'm afraid my parents will literally get a heart attack and die or become super depressed (my parents are really old and they sometimes get really stressed or frustrated by their own problems).

236,"What happened:

I was assigned to do a project of a photo essay (I need to take the photos) this past Wednesday for a winter class. I wanted to do it of my roommates cat that is generally here during the year. My roommate goes home last Friday with the cat, and I asked him on Saturday if I could do it on the cat. He says he will be back Tuesday, so I figure that I do the project on the cat. 

I draft the project and send it to my Prof without pictures. He tells me on Monday that he won't be back till Wednesday. On Wednesday he tells me he won't be back till Thursday for sure. I ask the Prof. for an extension and I ask him again if he will bring his pet, he says yes. Thursday afternoon comes and he doesn't bring the pet because he says ""it was hiding from me"". He gives me a very small apology something like ""yeah sry bout that"" then just tells me to do another topic . He also is not working or taking classes which pissed me off the most because he did not have to be anywhere.

The reason I'm pissed off is just his lack of any empathy and because his apology was so shitty.",19Jan2020,1

238,"Throwaway account.

First off, I'm sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to post this in. I don't really spend much time on reddit, so I'm not too sure what subreddit is the right one to be posting this in. 

For some context, I'm currently 16 years old, but I turn 17 in less than a month. I go to a vocational school for engineering, and am OSHA certified. I started on manual mills and lathes when I was 15. I've had experience with CNC machining using MasterCAM on both a HAAS and ProLight machine. I've been taught to use CAD since 8th grade. 

I know there are regulations against people under the age of 18 working with that type of machinery. I'm just wondering if I'm able to work part-time in a machine shop given the experience I have. I'm comfortable around the machinery and know how to work it.  
Should I try to find a part-time job in the realm of CAD instead? I'm just not too sure there would be as much a desire for a 16 year old applicant. 

Should I try to shoot for an apprenticeship instead? I'd rather be working part-time, as I'm not really interested into becoming an engineer (don't ask why I go to a vocational school, I don't know why either.)",19Jan2020,1
239,"Ok so we'll just call my friend Veronica.

Veronica and I have been friends for months and we grew very close really quickly.

She invites me over to her house almost every weekend (It's literally a 3 minute walk), and we both really get along and have a lot of fun hanging out.
We have the same opinions on a lot of things but also have our differences and in general, Veronica is an amazing person and knowing her has significantly improved my life and mood every day.

But yesterday we went and met at this little dock between our houses and I ended up going over to her house, that's normal. Nothing unusual there.

When we got there she asked me if I wanted to stay the night and I said yes because it happens all the time.
She had asked her mum if I can stay and she ended up saying yes. Her mum likes me a lot so that's also normal.

Then Veronica gets a text from her older brother (he was downstairs) and told me he wanted to go on a run and that I might have to go back home for a bit.
Ok, that ticks me off a little since I just got there like 15 minutes before but I understand.

Veronica walks me out and tells me to come back in an hour. Alright.

Then she texts me like 20 minutes after I got home saying that ""My mom just yelled at me cause she saw my grades and said you can't come back :((""
Like ok then..?
I'm really pissed off after this but of course I'm not going to tell Veronica that-

Then guess what happened?
Today I saw one of her Instagram posts showing a video of her and another one of her friends hanging out!
And from how they were dressed and stuff it's super obvious they had a sleepover?
Wtf?

How should I even feel about this??
I'm really angry and hurt and I guess just confused???

I know she has the right to hang out with whoever she wants but what???
Should I feel like this?

I just don't know anymore, Veronica and I have never had an argument and she's never done anything like this to me..
We get along so well but I just don't know why she would lie to make me go home and not come back so she could invite a different friend over :((",19Jan2020,1
240,"I'm a 16 year old male who lives with two parents, both emotionally abusive. Growing up there was less so emotional abuse and a lot more physical abuse but that has gone done, now it's just mostly emotional. I've tried my best to keep myself away from them but somehow they always find a way. I am not a rowdy student. I take AP classes and have good grades. To adults who know me, I'm respectful and so on. However my parents seem to think I am trouble because I don't 'listen to them'. I am not sure how I'm supposed to listen to them if their favorite words to call me are 'animal', 'bitch', 'motherfucker', and so on. I try my best but I always get blamed for things that are not necessarily my fault. I am currently seeing a nutritionist with low-weight gain problems. I've been asked why don't I eat a lot but I can't say ""I don't feel comfortable eating food from someone who constantly insults me and never has acted motherly (apart from doing the bare legal requirements) towards me"" when my parents are in the room. When I was young (6-7?) I remember trusting my cousin's word and in the end my father hung me upside down with my legs tied with a pickup truck tie down rope. In another case, a few years later, my father was whipping my brother and he accidentally clipped my ear with his belt (slight 'mark' on my ear because of it). My mother takes prescription drugs which were prescribed for her 'migraines' but Amitriptyline is also an anti-depressant. In her perspective, it's our fault she has those migraines and nerve damage. I have plenty of stories about how I grew up which are all equally as bad. I've spoken to my counselor and she doesn't know what to do either. She mentioned that ""in the state of Georgia, parents have the right to discipline their child."" Growing up and even until now, I am not allowed to hang with people outside of school. I am not allowed to have 'friends' I can call and talk to. I still try to circumvent that with online friends but that's still an issue. My family is a low-income, minority family who immigrated from a third-world country in the late 90s. My narcissistic mother dropped out of high school and my father never finished a certification program at a community college. They do not care about my homework and rather put themselves first. My word doesn't matter because I am 'never telling the truth'. I am no longer sure what to do in my situation. The most common advice I've gotten is ""keep fighting, you'll get through."" That's a hard advice to follow when you're constantly being degraded by your own parents and the thought of suicide and running away slips your mind. I don't think I am depressed but who knows? I have issues in my household that interfere with my mental health, maybe even physical health, social life, and often times my education. My parents wont let me have a job and I have no money (apart from $145 locked away in PayPal because I am under 18) which makes emancipation even more difficult. I don't have family I can trust because my parents have kept us pretty isolated from everyone else. I also have 3 other siblings and one of which is a 13 month old child. I've considered running away, emancipation, and reporting to DFACS. I am not sure if there are other things I can do but what would be the best thing to do?

There's a bit of details left out in this to keep it short and I'm happy to answer any questions one may have about my situation. I am in Georgia, US.",19Jan2020,1
241,Any advice for getting a girl without it being cringe?,19Jan2020,1
242,"Less than a year ago I moved into my new house with my longtime SO, and it happened to be next door to old friends of ours. We all had a huge falling out years ago and that was pretty much the last we’d had of each other until we moved here. 

The one girl who lives there, who specifically is the person we fought with years ago, is around our age and very, very clingy. When we moved in, I knew it would be a huge issue navigating having her next door because she is just a difficult person to be around in general. She is super sensitive and takes offense to even the most innocuous things, and has a HUGE temper so when she gets mad, she loses it. Screams, sends dozens of nasty texts, deletes and blocks you on social media, the whole 9. And then when she gets over it, she just acts like it never happened. 

She’s just so exhausting and I have no interest in being around her. I’m too old to deal with that dramatic BS anymore. My SO, however, has rekindled the friendship and in the friend’s mind, being friends with my SO = being friends with me. It’s gotten to the point where I can’t even go outside when they are home because she will force her company on me or just stand on her porch and beg me repeatedly to come over and hang out with her. When she sees my car and knows I’m home, she’ll just text me repeatedly asking to hang out.

What the hell can I do about this? I don’t want to have to worry about my house or car being vandalized because I hurt this girl’s feelings. How can I delicately extricate myself from her grasp without causing a huge blow up? Is this something I’m just going to have to put up with until one of us moves?",19Jan2020,1
243,"I've prided myself in having a growth mindset, trying to improve myself, blah blah blah bullshit.

I do want to improve myself, and when it's easy I'll easily do things that will (doing things that scare my on a whim, a recent example is going repelling even though I'm scared of heights). But when it comes to my personal time and personal planning, it's nearly impossible.

When I try to clean up around the house, it's mostly fine until my mind is flooded with thoughts of inadequacy, thoughts about my ex, etc. until I just give up and watch YouTube. 

When I try to settle down and do some paperwork/homework/the like, I'll be flooded by the same thoughts and want to shut my brain off and play YouTube/play video games/do some sort of drug. I've recently given up marijuana, usually kratom/alcohol is my go to, I don't drink more than twice a week, I've been successful in keeping this rule.

246,"I don't even know where to start. I guess quick backstory. 

This is about my best friend...we'll call him Larry. We went to High School together, he's two years my senior, but we've been BFF's since. I was the first person he came out to (but we all already ""knew""), and we grew up with similar tremulous home lives. He is my ride or die, my midnight call, and my murder accomplice. If we ever need each other we know we have each other. 

About 6-7 years ago he moved out of the small town we went to High School in, and that's where he found himself and the comfort to ""come out"" so to speak, but in a big city he quickly fell in with the wrong crowd, got started on drugs. Fast forward a bit and he ended up loosing his job and getting evicted. 

His family had moved to another city, so he followed and moved in with his parents, he was doing better until his mother got diagnosed with cancer, then down the rabbit hole he fell. As I mentioned above not the best family life. His brothers are 1, and 2 years younger respectively, his father adopted him at birth but have always had a rocky relationship. He has a horrible sense of entitlement and that his family support him which just caused even more issues. Once his mother died nearly 2 years ago, they all sorta fell apart. 

He moved in with some extremely bad people, living in a home without water or electricity most of the time. I'm 90% certain still on drugs. We last hung out about a year and a half ago when I picked him up for my birthday weekend, it was like we had drifted so far that we rarely talked. He is still a brother to me though and I wish daily I could help. 

Today I got a call from jail, apparently he's been/being charged with a crime and I am the only one who's phone number he knows that will answer. He asked me to call his brother/dad. I did, and found out he was arrested in December for stealing $1000+ of groceries, but charges were dropped because the officer broke his arm in two places. Now there is talk about being caught driving a stolen car! 

I have done everything I can, including adding money I didn't really to my phone so he can keep calling me. However I definitely can't post his bail, and I've called family and his brother is going to call in the morning, but I know Larry, he is going to be pissed it isn't tonight. I don't know how to tow the line and be his ride or die, but also let him hit ""rock bottom"" so he can potentially turn his life around. 

TLDR; My best friend has ended up in prison after bad life decisions resulting from drug use, now I'm the only one taking his calls. I dont know how to be a good friend, but also allow him to face the repercussions of his actions.",19Jan2020,1
247,"Basically I (F) have this internet friend (M) who I occasionally message with (maybe once a month). The reason we are connected in the first place is because of our mutual hobby (art) and we met each other online through an art community a few years ago. I wouldn't say that we are close by any means. But sometimes he will message me asking how life is and I respond, sharing some stuff going on in my life. He told me about a month ago that him and his girlfriend broke up and I was the only person he felt he could talk to. I was a little taken aback by his forwardness in saying this and I wanted to make sure I didn't come off as giving him the wrong idea. Tonight he messaged me and asked how I'm doing, to which I responded, sharing how my evenings going. I reciprocated the question and asked him how he is doing, to which he replied that he is not doing well at all, actually quite bad. Immediately I kind of felt angry, pissed off, annoyed. I felt the annoyance arise in me that I feel when people frequently message me to vent what's going on with then. I replied kindly and told him I'm sorry he's not feeling well and that I completely understand. But I didn't offer to talk about it, because I don't feel that I have the capacity currently to take on anyone else's problems. I have been spending more time alone, writing, reading, seeing a counselor and really meditating on the ideas we discuss in therapy sessions, and overall I have been mentally feeling so much better than I had felt in a long time. I feel like every time I open myself up to listen to someone vent, I feel drained afterwards, and I have made a promise of sorts to myself to stop doing this. So, do you think I'm in the wrong?

250,"This is going to be quite long.

I’ve been friends with this girl (let’s call her Tina) for about three years, but our friendship is far from healthy. She’s just weirdly invasive about my personal life, always wanting to know if I have sex or masturbate, what my sexuality is( she always teased that I was gay).  She sends weird text to our other friend saying “I’ve seen your breasts more than your man has.” What I don’t understand she was only like that to the girls in our group never the guys.

Since the 9th grade she has threatened suicide in our former friend group as a way of making all of us stay friends (I think). She always bullied all of us but masked it as joking. One of the girls (call her Sara) finally left the friend group because of how toxic it was ( I remember one time me and Sara were enjoying lunch together while Tina was talking about how she almost succeeded in hanging herself to which we blew up her phone). Sara was always the butt of the joke but I never got behind joking about her because she was a sweetheart. Once Sara leaves it starts to click to my other friends that Tina isn’t all that normal. They start to drift apart to the point we made our own group chat apart from the main one we spoke in. In it we complained about Tina. I know it’s an asshole move but every time we tried to tell her how bad she was acting she’d bring the suicide card. 

Fast forward to the last few months, I had my own issues to work through and wasn’t really active online. Me, Tina and another friend that was drifting away got into an argument. I called Tina a dumbass, told her to get used to people not agreeing with you and to get over it. She leaves the group chat, messages me a farewell text and we go back and forth about her not trying to jump over the bridge or OD on her medication for about two hours. 

Fast forward to a few weeks ago. At this point everyone has drifted away and I’m the only person left she talks to daily. I was visiting my sister. Tina messages the group chat about doing a secret Santa and says that we should hang out when I return. I said I can’t do that because as soon as I get back I have a month to move out and I’ll be busy working and applying to college. I won’t have time for it. 
She sends a sad face, a picture of her crying along with a paragraph about how shitty her life is that “everyone is leaving her” and how “2020 was going to be her year”. She leaves the group chat then messages me that I “wasn’t being a friend” nor “making her feel better”, and that she was literally about to kill herself when she sent that text. 
We argue and my sister suggests to ignore her for a while to cool down. 

Ignoring turns into ghosting; I checked out of that friendship. Tina makes a Snapchat group chat with two other girls I dislike, and blows up my phone with notifications. She texts my father (who she knows I hate and have a terrible relationship with) asking where I am. When I fly back home I didn’t feel like I lost anything and I felt better with out her.

Then, last Saturday I wake up to her in the doorframe of my room; I was sleeping and half naked.  She starts crying and says “we have to talk now this can’t wait.” 
She pushes me to talk for about ten minutes until I say to stop threatening suicide every time we argue and she says she’ll stop. I texted the second group that everyone else is in that drifted away and both of them compared her to a stalker ex. After this debacle she proceeds to offer me 50$ a month to help with expenses. She texts me saying “I don’t know what I would do with out you.”

TLDR; friend that bullies and threatens suicide for three years that I tried to ghost for two weeks shows up in my house, uninvited and pressures me to be friends again. I felt better without her and feel anxious being her friend again. How the hell can I get away from her?

P.S.: I’ve tried to explain to her that I don’t want to be friends but she threatens suicide every time, and she can very easily OD since her medications are on her nightstand.

254,"I see myself as someone with incredible discipline-when I believe in the cause. I’ve done prolonged fasts up to 7 days (while prepping food for others), cold showers daily, 530 am wake ups for months consistently, meditation for hours on end etc. 
I can also be one of the “laziest” and most reckless people I know. I spent a few years of my life pretty much high all the time and drinking everyday, playing video games until 5 am. I was going through a really rough time at a young age and was just coping. 
These habits of self-medication and self abandonment got really deeply engrained, and 5 years later I still find myself consistently going through weeks or even months of eating bullshit food, smoking weed, and video game binging. 
Except...my life philosophy has changed dramatically so it doesn’t really bother me anymore. Early on in life I was driven by fear and desire. Fear of failure, desire for riches, status. Next I was driven by ambition. Hustle-porn. Grinding was sexy, and served as a good escape from my emotions, and “self-discipline” honestly just became another form of self-abandonment. 
Now I’m in a phase of just going with the flow of life. Trying to be compassionate with myself, knowing the stream is going to end up in the same place whether I struggle against it or not. This is liberating and peaceful, but I worry it’s dangerously easy to confuse with my old tendency toward apathy. I often find myself saying “it doesn’t matter” and “I don’t care” which I know is putting me on a negative trajectory, but I just feel that having seen through much of the game of life, I can’t be bothered to buy into it and play it anymore. 
I’m also in undergrad which is challenging enough at times to drain me of a lot of energy, but I still have tons of free time that I know I could be utilizing better...it’s just a weird in between phase...
Essentially I’ve adopted a eastern/yogic philosophy on effort and meaning, but I often use it as an excuse to be lazy and rather than meditating I’m playing video games. What I need are goals but A. My (engineering) degree takes just enough out of me to make accomplishing anything else meaningful unlikely and B. The degree is really really not in line with who I am which I think triggers apathy. I have tried time and time again to figure out what I’m good at and what I want to do, self authoring etc but it’s like I could be or do anything and still know it’s just a game and I’d rather just smoke and play my video games tbh.

- I like making people panic (with harmless pranks. Nothing extreme. It’s little things like doing something high energy and then just collapsing in a way that made it seem like I had passed out, but I was fine and just wanted to lay down.)

263,"My situation has become so stressful I don’t even know where to begin. I’m 20 years old and when I was 18 I got my girlfriend pregnant and we’ve stayed together since then and raised our now 19 month old son while living at my parents house. However, around 7 months ago my girlfriend’s adoptive mom got in contact with her birth dad who she had never met before.  We ending up meeting him and his wife and three kids soon after that and they immediately were very invasive. They began sending both my girlfriend and her mom lots of money and then offered to have us move in with them 3 states away and work for their plumping business. This might seem like a good thing but it was alarming to me as they were strangers we just met.  However, my girlfriend was in favor of moving in with them we just couldn’t at the time because she was still 17  and her adoptive mom didn’t want her moving 3 states away. As time went by my girlfriend continued texting her dad and his wife regularly and eventually they offered to pay for our son’s daycare if we moved in with them once my girlfriend turned 18.  This eventually made me change my mind about moving there as I thought daycare would be good for my son’s development and I told myself it would be worth the sacrifice of living with strangers that I’m extremely uncomfortable around. At the time my girlfriend watched our son all day at my parent’s house and finished high school online while I was working 30 hours a week at a gas station making 9.60 an hour.  My girlfriend also still doesn’t have her driver’s license so she couldn’t take our son anywhere and I was sick of him just being stuck at my house all the time. I was always really invested in his development because I know the first years of life are crucial for brain growth. I made sure my girlfriend breastfed him for as long as she could and my entire life has revolved around playing with him, reading to him, taking him places, etc. I literally don’t have any friends anymore because I don’t have the time or energy. I also have pretty severe social anxiety and I’ve struggled with depression and I’ve actually been hospitalized 4 times in the past due to suicide attempts and issues with alcohol and drugs. I actually met my girlfriend at a mental hospital. So long story short now we’ve been moved in to their house for a week and I feel like shit. I thought I could be strong and do this for my son but I don’t know if I can. I’m about to start working for their company tomorrow and I don’t know if I can do it. I’m also struggling with a terrible addiction to a nootropic called phenibut and adderall which I’m prescribed but I abuse it instead of taking it as prescribed to cope with depression and to have the energy to get things done and to take care of my son. Since we’ve been here I’ve just felt horrible and I just want to leave. I cut myself on my thighs the other day which is something I used to do when I was too stressed and I’ve had some suicidal thoughts. I’m only here for my son if it weren’t for him I would have probably broken up with my girlfriend a long time ago. I used to be in love with her and wanted to spend my life with her but as time has gone on I’ve changed and learned more about who I am.  I still care about her but I don’t think I love her anymore. I just don’t know if I can bring myself to leave my son and move back to my parents house but I feel like I’m going to have a mental breakdown. I don’t know what else to say I don’t have the energy to elaborate anymore I just need help and I have no one to go to.",19Jan2020,1
264,"So basically I had recently moved in into a house with one of my friends [M] from the past year. Him and I vibed really well together and have been good friends since the day we met.

Anyway I have another friend [F] who I am also really close with, have known longer, and had sex with one of her friends but it was just a one time thing and never turned into anything.

Admittedly in a way I kinda set these two up, they both thought the other was cute when they first met each other, so I would feel good if I made my friends happy and helping them out in getting the other laid. 

Suddenly, [F] started coming over a lot more often then she did before, and it’s mostly just to fuck my roommate. My roommate also has stopped hanging out with me as much, and both of them have been slightly more rude to me and me very much getting the vibe of “get out of here dude” every time I’m third wheeling with them.

Anyway, I don’t know what to do but to just to continue to feel left out until they start to date and it gets even worse. I love my friends but I do not want to see them get cuddly with each other in front of me. It kinda sucks it feels like two of my close friends have disappeared on me.",19Jan2020,1

She always jumps to conclusions like that and its so frustrating especially when she makes these decisions like that for me as if i already decided. And she always says she feels like i dont like touching her or i dont want to be with her and i dont know why! I do everything for her i try so hard to make her happy i love her so much i just want to be everything for her but i feel like i cant ever be.

266,"
For the vast majority of my 2 year relationship I feel like the luckiest lady alive. But I also have this sad feeling inside me that I cannot seem to shake no matter what I tell myself. 

I always planned to just sleep with one person, it’s just the way I was brought up and I was convinced that this would be the case. I wanted to wait for marriage or at-least engagement. 
At 24 I made a huge ( drunken ) mistake and slept with the wrong person. Before I met my now wonderful partner I had been with a total of 2 people. I know it’s not a lot but I really feel like I let myself ( and my partner down ). I can’t explain the feeling it’s just a super sad feeling in my heart that I wish I waited just a little bit longer to meet him then he’d be my one &amp; only. I actually cry my self to sleep about it Atleast  once a week. 

Should I tell him or deal with it myself? If I tell him how would I word it. He knows I wasn’t a virgin when we met but he doesn’t know how I feel.its like we will have a really nice day together then I’ll go home and this surge of guilt will hit me and this voice in my head will literally say ‘ he’s so good to you &amp; you couldn’t even give him your virginity ‘ 

My friends advised me not to, they said ‘ your boyf isn’t your therapist or confessor. It isn’t his burden to hold ‘ so now I’m unsure.",19Jan2020,1

273,"Hi everyone! I need some advice regarding the job I work at and how to communicate my thoughts/frustrations to management. I am a college student that currently works at the front desk of a major hotel chain and I've been working here for about 8 months. It seems everything was going well up until about a month ago. Because I am taking classes currently, I only work one day a week on the weekend down from 3-4 days a week during the summer. We have about 8 other front desk agents that work here too because not everyone can work full time.

In our hotel at the front desk, we have a ""front desk journal"" that is used to write any issues we may notice around the hotel, as well as general comments to keep each front desk agent up to date about the happenings of the day. Every once in a while a front desk agent or manager will write a criticism or a reminder for all front desk agents to read in the event that we did something wrong or forgot to do something. This doesn't usually bother me because a lot of the times the comments are just friendly reminders to do something or to not to forget to do something else. 

Up until about a month ago, everything seemed to be just fine: my managers and the owner were really nice to me and just generally great bosses to have working here. Even the full-time front desk agent that has been working here for 8 years was really nice to me, but the tone subtly changed. Now, every time I get to the hotel to work my Saturday morning shift, I read through a week's worth of front desk notes to catch up on what I missed over the passed week and it's nothing but criticisms and all-caps writing saying things like ""WHY ARE YOU GUYS NOT DOING YOUR JOBS?"". It's just pages and pages of comments like this from our managers and the full time front desk person that works here. 

I only work one day a week. There are seven other front desk people that work here as well, so maybe these comments are directed towards them? It's hard to say because the comments in our journal are so vague it makes me wonder like ""hmm... Is this comment directed towards me? Did I not do this correctly?"" It just makes me feel bad because I absolutely love this job, it is the perfect job to have in college so naturally I come in to work very happy and energetic, but I'm starting to lose this feeling because every time I come in there's an issue that may or may not be related to me and nobody is telling me. I'm not saying that I am perfect at my job, so I am bound to make some mistakes here and there. I even hear a different tone of voice when the managers speak to me, it's a lot more monotone and exhausted sounding which makes me think I'm doing something wrong when working. I don't know, I guess I don't really feel appreciated here anymore. I read nothing but negative comments directed towards us front desk agents but nobody tells you if you're doing something wrong; lack of communication I guess is the issue. I wish my manager or the owner would privately tell us if we were doing something wrong so we could quickly resolve the issue, but that's not happening here.

Who and how would I communicate my frustrations and my general feelings towards this job? Like I said, I love this job, but recently I've been feeling pretty low energy towards it for the above reasons. Thanks guys, I appreciate it!",19Jan2020,1
275,So my gf of two years broke up with me a couple days ago which leaves me without a date to homecoming. I have this friend and I’ve known she’s had a boyfriend for awhile and they’ve been dating for a long time now.

But I really like her and want to be more than friends with her. I have never met this other guy. I’m trying not to step on her boyfriends toes so I’m setting clear boundaries and making it abundantly clear it’s just as friends. She said that He seems ok with it.

I had a terrible one 2 weeks ago which lasted 45 minutes and my partner called the medical hotline as he was worried and the nurse said that if it’s a sore it will heal within 24-48 hours, after that I can blow my nose fine but when I blow my nose a week after a bleed it just starts bleeding like a tap again.
I saw another doctor just after the bad bleed for some advice and he couldn’t see in there as it was so swollen so he referred me to an Ear nose throat specialist but I don’t have that appointment for another month.

283,"The new semester has started at my university, and I was really excited to be back. I had a good winter break, but missed my friends and activities. I met this one guy last year and instantly hit it off with him. We both had similar interests and vibed well together. A common sight last semester would be one of us dropping an obscure TV or movie reference and the other doing the next line without missing a beat. We had a small group of friends where we’d hang out or go to parties. Now my roommate, him, and a couple other friends will be living in a house together next year.

Well, things haven’t felt quite the same since we’ve returned to school. I still see this friend because of activities and classes, and we still hang out, but it just seems like he isn’t as interested in being friends. Our conversations especially have been pretty dull, and he usually seems bored or uninterested. I’ll make jokes that he would have died laughing at last semester and he’ll maybe give a pity laugh. 

I’ve been in kind of an odd headspace since we’ve gotten back, and it’s only been a week, but this whole situation still feels shitty. I have other friends of course and am involved in a lot of stuff on campus, so it’s not an attachment thing, but this guy was someone I felt the most connected to, and it sucks to not have anything to pin it on if he really isn’t as interested in being friends.

It also just keeps bringing me back to my freshman year, where I had almost *no* friends, and was severely depressed. Thoughts like “everyone hates you, thinks you’re annoying, etc” and “you’re going to be alone” have started creeping back, and this plus other stuff has just made me feel kind of anxious and shitty this week.

287,"This is going to be quite long.

I’ve been friends with this girl (let’s call her Tina) for about three years, but our friendship is far from healthy. She’s just weirdly invasive about my personal life, always wanting to know if I have sex or masturbate, what my sexuality is( she always teased that I was gay).  She sends weird text to our other friend saying “I’ve seen your breasts more than your man has.” What I don’t understand she was only like that to the girls in our group never the guys.

She was also very keen on making my feel bad for slowly cutting ties with my abusive parents. She made comments on how great my father and mother were even though she knows how disgusting they are. 

Since the 9th grade she has threatened suicide in our former friend group as a way of making all of us stay friends (I think). She always bullied all of us but masked it as joking. One of the girls (call her Sara) finally left the friend group because of how toxic it was ( I remember one time me and Sara were enjoying lunch together while Tina was talking about how she almost succeeded in hanging herself to which we blew up her phone). Sara was always the butt of the joke but I never got behind joking about her because she was a sweetheart. Once Sara leaves it starts to click to my other friends that Tina isn’t all that normal. They start to drift apart to the point we made our own group chat apart from the main one we spoke in. In it we complained about Tina. I know it’s an asshole move but every time we tried to tell her how bad she was acting she’d bring the suicide card. 

Fast forward to the last few months, I had my own issues to work through and wasn’t really active online. Me, Tina and another friend that was drifting away got into an argument. I called Tina a dumbass, told her to get used to people not agreeing with you and to get over it. She leaves the group chat, messages me a farewell text and we go back and forth about her not trying to jump over the bridge or OD on her medication for about two hours. 

Fast forward to a few weeks ago. At this point everyone has drifted away and I’m the only person left she talks to daily. I was visiting my sister. Tina messages the group chat about doing a secret Santa and says that we should hang out when I return. I said I can’t do that because as soon as I get back I have a month to move out and I’ll be busy working and applying to college. I won’t have time for it. 
She sends a sad face, a picture of her crying along with a paragraph about how shitty her life is that “everyone is leaving her” and how “2020 was going to be her year”. She leaves the group chat then messages me that I “wasn’t being a friend” nor “making her feel better”, and that she was literally about to kill herself when she sent that text. 
We argue and my sister suggests to ignore her for a while to cool down. 

Ignoring turns into ghosting; I checked out of that friendship. Tina makes a Snapchat group chat with two other girls I dislike, and blows up my phone with notifications. She texts my father (who she knows I hate and have a terrible relationship with) asking where I am. When I fly back home I didn’t feel like I lost anything and I felt better with out her.

Then, last Saturday I wake up to her in the doorframe of my room; I was sleeping and half naked.  She starts crying and says “we have to talk now this can’t wait.” 
She pushes me to talk for about ten minutes until I say to stop threatening suicide every time we argue and she says she’ll stop. I texted the second group that everyone else is in that drifted away and both of them compared her to a stalker ex. After this debacle she proceeds to offer me 50$ a month to help with expenses. She texts me saying “I don’t know what I would do with out you.”

TLDR; friend that bullies and threatens suicide for three years that I tried to ghost for two weeks shows up in my house, uninvited and pressures me to be friends again. I felt better without her and feel anxious being her friend again. How the hell can I get away from her?

P.S.: I’ve tried to explain to her that I don’t want to be friends but she threatens suicide every time, and she can very easily OD since her medications are on her nightstand.",19Jan2020,1

289,"Alright, so; this is one of the relationship questions, so here we go. 

I’m not sure what it feels like to like someone. As in, I have trouble discerning what “liking” someone entails. I’m not able to tell to difference between casually appreciating someone’s presence and becoming attracted to them in a way that is more than that. I’ve been in relationships before, a major one, but it was years ago, and the memory of the feeling has faded. The fact that I’m not able to distinguish feelings for a person has led me to shy away from relationships altogether, as I fear that I will turn out to not like this person as much as I said I would and hurt them.

293,"So there's this woman I've been talking to, we work at the same place but not often since she's part-time...

now her brother (26 year old guy) worked here before she did.
he's someone who immediately began opening up to me and just valued me right away, I'd never seen that before... it was just instantaneous.

We would be in the break room and he'd just open up to me, it was very cool and humbling.

He just instantly valued me and appreciated me.... we didn't work often together, but we remained cool.
A few months later he had told me that his sister will be working here;

they are very close and when she began working here, her and i didn't really talk or anything...
then a couple months ago I realized that he no longer worked here, yet his sister continued to do so...

When I found out this happened, I knew I had to ask his sister about it; soon after we were working nearby away from everyone, which doesn't happen often since we're in different departments...

nonetheless I asked her about school, winter break, and then her brother...

I then asked for his number since he would open up to me a lot, and she seemed gracious to give that to me...

Ever since then we've had a few good conversations over the past few weeks and get along well! She also frequently says hi to me and initiates conversation etc...

she'll just walk up to me while I'm working and greet me, talk to me a bit... she went on a trip recently, and I asked her how it was etc...

she wanted to switch departments, and I offered to email this manager about it, which she agreed.... and then this happened:

The other night, I’m doing some work in my department, and all of a sudden I hear someone say “Hi (my name)!"",

I look up and its her, and I greet her back, and then she tells me how she’s getting more hours at work now that her schedule has freed up a bit..

she works just once/week. then I let her know that I spoke with my manager about her wanting to work in a different dept (she had asked me to do this), and that we'd talk later.

About an hour later she's on break, walks by my dept and says “Hi (my name)!"" again..

She was on her 15 minute break, and she was just standing in front of my dept in one of the aisles, waiting for me to talk to her it appeared..

I had to help a customer, and a few minutes later she walks up to me and asks “are you closing today?"", and I said yes and asked her the same.

I then told her what my manager said, and mentioned that I could take down her number and update her if anything changes... I also let her know that I want to keep in touch...

She agreed, so I took out a pen and post-it note for her to write her number on, and she actually wrote the wrong area code, crossed it out, tried to write it again and wrote it wrong again…

third time she wrote it right and gave it to me… she seemed nervous, yet we then talked for a couple minutes about her getting more hours, and then I told her “well I’ll keep you updated! Have a good break!”

To me it seems apparent that she's interested and enjoys my company... but what do you think?",19Jan2020,1
294,"So...I've been through 2 real relationships in my life. One lasted 2 years, the other lasted 1. After the first one ended I went into a deep, and horrifying depression...at least in my head it was agonizing. I drank every time I turned around so that I wouldnt feel anything, then I felt like I needed to feel something, so I ended up having sex with whoever I could get my hands on....most of them really good friends that I've all but burnt the bridges with because of my actions. It was never an intentional thing, but I ended up hurting many of my lady friends because of it. At least half of them actually wanted a relationship with me, but all my mind could think about was booze, then having sex afterwards. That's all I wanted. After the last one left a year after we started dating, I didnt spiral as bad, but I still felt horrible. I got over my shit in time, but it was hard. Now I'm kinda at this point in my life where, and this is just what I think I believe, I feel that I need someone to be happy. It sounds stupid I know, because you have to ""love"" yourself before anyone can ever truly love you. But that's the thing...I feel like somewhere deep in the back of my head, I know I don't need anybody , but theres still something nagging at me saying who are you gonna go to with your daily problems? Who so you have to give your love to? No one. You have no one. Not like that at least...I dont know just, I guess my question is, how can I make it stop? How can i make it to where I'm not worried a out that stuff. I'm sick of it. Anyway, idk yall might figure this out, but I sure as hell cant.",19Jan2020,1
295,"So quick bit of context. I work as a security guard overnight shifts 12 hours long. It’s a 2 man guard post and my last partner recently moved to a new building.

Enter new guy.

He seemed a little strange right from the start, for example me telling him I’ll be back in 2 minutes (ran to the bathroom) and when I arrive back around 4 minutes later he questions me why I said 2 and I didn’t have to be so specific with him which I was instantly confused by as I’ve used that many times in conversation.

Anyways to the main point I’ve noticed him speaking to himself under his breath a lot and at first I thought maybe he’s singing something or just figuring something out so ignored it. Then yesterday he got into an argument with our supervisor over something very pointless and once the supervisor left he was speaking to himself really aggressively under his breath almost ‘Sméagol/Gollum’ like that’s where I started to feel uncomfortable.

Then just now he’s sat next to me playing games on his laptop (we don’t have too much on weekends to do) and he keeps turning his head to the wall and speaking again. Then he gets up walks into the building slightly away from where I can hear him but I can see him on the cameras and he’s just stood in a hallway I can see his lips moving and he’s laughing to himself then he seems to gather himself and comes back to our office and continues with his games.

Mainly I’m just looking for advice on what to do? Should I confront him and see what’s happening? Should I speak with my supervisor about being uncomfortable? Should i just ignore it?

I do not want a school where there’s lecture , systematic , and controlling , like regular schools. Teacher talks, you write notes, study for test and that is all.

297,"Hello! I’m new to Reddit so if this sounds funny or is formatted wrong I apologize.

I’m 18/M and towards the end of August I’m going to be leaving for college. I’ll be staying in a dorm suite with 3-4 other guys. If all goes as planned I’ll have my own room. 

I’m a bit worried about meeting people while I’m there. I briefly had a girlfriend during my junior year of highschool. I can’t help but feel like she was my only chance. I know I’m 18 but I’m 5’3-5’4. I posted a few pics on rateme and other subreddits like it and people basically told me that it’s not going to be possible for me to date in college. Someone said no woman over 5’5 will even consider taking to me even if I had a great personality. 

This is extremely worrying to me. I know this is Reddit but a lot of people told me that. My college campus has around 3500-4000 students so I’m really hoping that I’ll meet someone. I know I shouldn’t depend on someone to be happy but I just can’t shake the feeling that because of my height and appearance I need to find someone before it’s too late.",19Jan2020,1

I didn’t bring it outside and and used it in the house only.

301,"Background: I have a friend who I’ve loved for years. We’ll call her Amy (not her real name). She’s one of the the only reasons I’m still alive and also getting therapy. But these past few years, she’s become... meaner? She’ll make harsh remarks on my appearance or intelligence, and I’m aware there’s no ill intent, she’s just trying to joke around, but it’s been getting to me.  We hardly ever text or call each other anymore, we only ever hang out in person

Recently, Amy and I got into a small fight because we were supposed to hang out on Friday, but my other friend, Hannah (not her real name) was going through some rough things and I went to comfort her. Basically, Amy felt excluded. And I admit, I should’ve tried to engage with Amy after, and it’s not like I’ve tried to make an effort to text or call her but she called me a bad friend and it really got to me. It’s not like I’ve been the best friend, but it’s not like she has been either. 
Whenever we get into scuffles, I can never get mad at her. She once told a guy I had a crush on about my depression and I cried a lot because of how mortified and embarrassed I was, but no matter how much I wanted to, I couldn’t get mad at her. And she never apologizes either. She always thinks if we get into a fight, it’s because I’ve done something, not her. And I always end up giving in because I know it’s easier to just suck it up and tell her what I really think instead of escalating a fight I know neither of us will win.
 I hate feeling this way towards her because I love her so much and I’m so bad at confronting or talking about this kind of stuff. I don’t know what to do. My other friends have told me her behavior is pretty toxic but I know she loves me too. Please help",19Jan2020,1
302,"Okay, so the obligatory I’m on mobile, this is a rare occasion I post because I’m mostly a lurker, and sorry for any spelling errors or grammatical mistakes I make. 

So, my husband has this buddy that he talks to once or twice a week and when we can find the time between work, school, and being parents, we’ll go and hang out with this friend, we’ll call S. The last time we went to hang out with S was about a month and a half ago(December 8; today is January 18;). During that day he mentioned he had just started talking to this girl he met on the book of faces and he’d either seen her once or twice or was planning on setting up a first time date. 

Fast forward to now, she’s pregnant and he’s moving in with her. We were told she was pregnant maybe a week or a little more ago. Given the time frame, I’ve brought it up to my husband that the baby could potentially not be his friend S’s. 

How would we go about bringing this up to S? I don’t want to make him anymore upset than necessary. I hope I’m wrong in my doubts, and I’m not saying that the baby could not be S’s baby, but I would hate for him to go through raising a child that he thinks is his when it’s not. Or worse, if they break up and she sticks him for support. I’m not sure if he’s given it much thought in that way as he’s the type to just roll with things and he’s seemed a little caught up in having a gf after being single for a while.

Her and I have been looking for everything that would help us make our minds but from what we can tell, it just feels like private school is going to neuter her social life.

I'm sort of a social recluse and just dislike networking/brown-nosing people to like you. I'm planning on redoing the mcat in a few months or so. 

I just don't think I'll finish a masters. Tbh, my parents place heavy emphasis on me doing something with my life. I'm Indian/Pakistani so parents play a huge role in our lives. If I choose to take a year off and study for the mcat, I may look inferior in front of them and tbh, I wouldn't care.

318,It’s hard finding your true self after living in a world of negativity constantly every day. Honestly it’s so important who you surround yourself with each day. I still live with my family. Most of them are either depressed or constantly complaining about something everyday that they could easily fix. I try my best to control my emotions but lately they’ve just been getting the best of me. My patience is thin. Me and my little sister got into an argument and she called me a fat ass. Ever since that I’ve been looking in the mirror picking myself apart and eating a bunch of food. I had been trying to work out every day and I’ve been meal prepping some healthy food. I had a good mindset but the constant negativity and those words coming out of her mouth has torn me down. I also had another person jokingly agree with me that I was fat. He said he was joking and that he’s sorry but people really don’t understand how their words hurt. I’ve been trying my hardest to lose all this weight I gained because of birth control and honestly unhealthy eating habits. Tonight I feel sick and anxious from the way I ate. It wasn’t bad but it definitely wasn’t nothing compared to health kick I been on. I hate being so rough on myself. And just so easily someone can tear me down.

320,"Throwaway account just in case.

Last year I joined a psychology/typology discord server because I was learning about it and getting interested in that stuff. I quickly made friends with several people and started talking to them more and more until recently. And over the past few months I just haven't cared about that stuff at all because I've been trying to focus on myself more and changing things about me, which left me with no shared interests with any of the friends I made. I should note that most of those people I convinced myself not to care about because of things I've learned about them or things they've done that I don't agree with, etc. There are a couple that I still cared about and that's the ones I feel kinda bad for.

I'm also the type of person where I believe friendships go both ways. One person can't put in all of the work - which is what I felt like I was doing. I get that people have lives and such, but that never stopped me from sending someone a message to see how they were and what they were up to or replying when they did seldom message me. Just talking in general. And not very many people ever did that with me which made me not want to care or be friends with them.

So I typed up a goodbye message and posted it in the server and left. And part of me is relieved to be gone and part of me is saying I made a mistake. I know for a fact that a few of those people talked about me in private channels or between each other. I'm not sure why or what about, I never figured that part out. I was nice and got along with everyone that I knew of.

I haven't cut many people out of my life before because once I make friends with someone, I want to hold on to that relationship. I don't take them lightly so this is just bothering me and I know I'm rambling here too.

I don't know what I'm posting this for. I guess I just want to see if anyone else ever felt like they made a wrong choice when they cut people out and if it actually worked our for the best or not. I hope I made the right choice in leaving and cutting out those people in my life and trying to move on. I guess I can always find more discord servers to be apart of and make more friends online.

 The fights have become more frequent because I have recently graduated from college and am home more often. The more we see each other the more I realize our relationship is toxic. My parents do not want me to move out until I am married. They are extremely overprotective. On one hand they do provide for me and they paid for my college tuition (we agreed it would be a loan, not just a favor). Of course part of me likes the luxurious of not having to work and living comfortably at home. But I want to get a job and save up in hopes that I will finally be able to live as an adult. I fear that leaving will mean I will lose my connection to my younger siblings. I also feel sad knowing it could destroy my relationship with my parents. I don't know what to do. I used to smoke a lot of weed in secret to cope with the arguing and strict rules. But now that I'm sober I feel like it is time I face this obstacle head on.

I have a car payment. I low paying job. No family or friends that can help.

329,"When I was a junior in high school, a girl on my cheer team fell asleep at the wheel and killed two girls in the car with her by ramming into a tree. I was incredibly close with one of the girls who died, and both of them were my locker partners on either side of me that year so I essentially saw them every day. 

This really took a toll on me, and kept me from getting my license for a long time. I always have a fear when driving but lately I’ve noticed I panic when other people drive my car, or they’re driving their own; specifically at night.

For instance, my girlfriend and I were driving home from LA last night. We were driving in the dark for a majority of the drive and I started to fall asleep while she was driving. Every 10 minutes or so I kept pulling myself out of sleep to ask her if she was okay, if she was tired, falling asleep, etc. Understandably, she got a bit annoyed by me asking so much. This isn’t the first time this has happened and I do it with other people. It’s almost like I’m so concerned I can’t even let them drive properly. 

What are good ways to overcome this? I have a huge issue with driving in general; since that particular accident I had 3 other kids from my high school die in car related accidents so it weighs heavily on my mind. It has been about 4 years since the first accident happened and I feel like I’m not getting any better.",19Jan2020,1
331,"Long story short, I had a client I was really happy to work with. Someone I looked up to and who has some form of celebrity status.

I did some work for him, but he was not happy with the finished product. I feel extremely bad that the product was not up to his standard, but I did the best that I could and worked on it until it was the best it could possibly be. I had some issues with some of my gear during the time of shooting, that made the editing process hell. None the less, I worked through it and got the job done. I worked way more than what I was paid to do to try to make the client as happy as possible. To no avail.

I have a pretty good track record, and of all of the projects I’ve ever worked on, there has never been one that has gotten this sour.

I’m extremely ashamed that I let down my biggest client, and am in shock that of all of the projects I’ve worked on, this, (what feels like the most important) is the one that got botched.

I’ve basically crawled into a hole over this, and now do not want to post anything on social media because I don’t want to give the chance to remind him that I even exist anymore. I can’t remove him from my friends/followers because that act alone says something. Its a small world within the community I’m associated with. I assume he thinks I am mad at HIM for making the project a pain, when in reality I still think he’s a great person and I’m just more mad at myself for not making the project better from the beginning, and for not showing excellence during a time when I needed to the most.

340,"Some background: My endometriosis &amp; fibromyalgia are most relevant to this. Due to the endo, my periods are horrendous and tend to exacerbate my fibro. The people involved are my parents, younger sister, and partner of 4.5 years (we're poly)

I'm hoping for honest feedback and advice (I'd appreciate empathy, and/or feeling less alone with this too)

I flew out of state and rented a car to visit my sister yesterday. I was crampy and in extra pain, but I thought it was just because of the travel, stress, &amp; change in weather. My period started this afternoon but I put off pain management because I needed to drive to help my sister get some errands I'd promised we'd do done; being unreliable because of my pain has caused issues in our relationship. 

By the time we got to an early dinner the cramping was unbearable. I was definitely paingry but trying my best not to snap at my sister. I was angry at another driver for stopping unnecessarily and costing me a green light so I snapped at them and then things went downhill. I tried to turn the night around but then my parents started blowing up my phone about how disappointed they are in me and that they expected more. By the time we ate I was losing my mind from pain and I snapped at my parents. I told them what was going on and that I needed some sympathy and not a lecture right now so I could get through this and try to turn the rest of the night/trip around after I got my pain meds.  

Then dinner ended and the calls started. Tbh I was unsafe to drive and apparently scared my sister with my driving and ""acting like a crazy person making weird noises"" while I was driving (aka making pained sounds because turning the steering wheel was hell). Long story short I was denied my pain meds for over an hour because my sister didn't want to let me into her dorm and was too upset to feel comfortable going in to get my stuff for me so I could go to a hotel. At that point I was hysterical and just needed some goddamn pain relief; I don't remember too much of the conversation, but I tried to keep things focused on getting our needs met and away from personal attacks. But after a certain point I couldn't stop crying which made the pain worse to the point it hurt to breathe. I was in the fetal position in the driver's seat crying unless I forced myself to move to talk to my partner outside.
     
And I pulled my partner's attention away from his anniversary celebration with his other partner because of the distress I was in; to the extent that he suggested getting the police involved. We agreed it was best I get a hotel for the night. I was supposed to leave Tuesday after seeing my other sister, but that is up in the air now. (I'm not going into how terrible I feel about the situation with his anniversary celebration as I need to not cry right now)

My sister eventually went in without me to get my stuff, got her groceries upstairs, and then left without saying a word. I don't know if we're going to see each other again before I leave and I am devastated. 

I feel like I fucked everything up with my relationship with my sister. She dropped a lot of views she holds about me when we were fighting and I didn't know she thinks so poorly of me; I don't see how we can repair this. She thinks that not only am I an attention-seeker for having conversations with people when we were shopping today, she thinks I was being dramatic about how much pain I was in for pity (extra fucked because she also has endometriosis), and she started going off about how she hates my partner. Especially because we only see each other a few times a year now, I just don't know how to even begin to repair things with her. 

I'm laying in a hotel room right now waiting for my narcotics (thank u leftover surgery meds) to fully kick in. I don't know what to do, as I most likely can't make the multi-hour to the airport like this tomorrow (ignoring f cost of changing my flight, which is another can of worms entirely). 

I'm taking some space tonight from my family to reflect on how I could have handled things differently/better, and because I need some space from them. I just don't know how to begin to address what happened and how to make things better between us. (I'm coming up with plans to do something special for my partner &amp; his other partner, as I feel like I fucked their night up)

341,"Is he in love with me or does he just ""like"" me (lust/infatuation)? Or does he just like me as a friend?

I'm an 18 y o girl, studying my last high school year. I have a bubbly personality but I'm quite reserved/have a few friends. While he is very popular and super social. Let's call him X. He is very good looking while im just average.

We barely talk really except when he's teasing me:

-his friends always steal my phone when Im not looking. X tells me that he'll make them give it back to me if I kiss him on the cheek.

-I sit on my friend's lap and he shouts from the other side of the room in front of everyone ""come sit like that on me"".

-During P. E. class, I was sitting on a chair. He tells me to stand up so he can sit cuz he's tired. I laugh a bit and refuse. He tries to pick me up (im very light) and I tell him to go get another chair, which he does and puts it very close to mine and then he rests his legs on my lap (jokingly) and I push them away (jokingly too). Then we just sat there 10+mins in awkward silence.

-He very often walks in a very manly and macho way towards me as if he's gonna punch/fight me but as a joke obviously. Like he tries to scare me/seem strong.

-I asked him if I could borrow his gym card. He said if I give him a kiss on the cheek. I said ""okay but then I want ur card for a whole week"". He said then Id have to kiss him on the lips. I said no. He said ""alright then u can suck my dick instead"". I was like ""wtf stop it"" then he said ""okay i feel bad now just take my card"". All this happened while laughing so both of us knew it was teasing. And it was in front of his friends so maybe he was tryna seem cool/stupid.

-I told him I wanna try smoking. He said only once cuz he doesn't wanna be a bad influence. He smoked with his cigg then gave me it &amp; i tried to smoke. I couldnt inhale tho. He kept showing me how and i kept trying. At some point he said ""I can hold the cigarette, u try smoking"" so basically he wanted me to smoke the cigarette while he was holding it. Why?

349,"So I’m new on Reddit and am mostly doing this as a spur of the moment type of thing because I don’t know what else to do. I also don’t know if this is the right Topic either so I apologise. To put it bluntly I don’t know what’s up with me mentally. This will involve a bit of a life story so I apologise for that.

I remember feeling like this when I was nine years old. I felt bitter, angry and alone. My parents would argue and fight and I would hardly see my dad and only really have bad memories of him coming home hearing him both physically and mostly verbally abusing her. I don’t know if she would classify this as abuse but to give you all some context he would choke her, hit her, accuse her or cheating (ironic since he would cheat on my mum) and would reek of alcohol. My mum forced herself to stay with him because he was her first boyfriend and she wanted me to at least have a father. My mum was a teen mum. She was never really taught sex education by my nan so she had sex with my dad for the first time and she ended up finding herself pregnant at just 16 years old. She was called a slut, slag and told it would ruin her life, however, I would personally say she is the best mother in the world despite the hardships she was given and has never let it stop her from being a good mother. She is my rock and I love her with all my heart. When my dad finally left the picture that was when 9 year old me felt this anger and bitterness (I’m turning 19 soon btw) and I essentially became a mute at school. I never told anyone how I felt and I was consumed by jealously for my classmates who had regular families who didn’t argue.

One night my father came home, very drunk, and made my older cousin cry during an argument he had with my mum after he pinned me to the wall and lifted me by the scruff of my neck and called me names like “Gay boy” and such. Taunting me and it made me feel powerless and I was paralysed in fear because I understood that I was completely at his mercy and there was nothing I could do. 
After this incident I was fearful of other men and even to this day I still slightly hesitate and lose my wording when it comes to talking to men. It’s silly. I’M A MAN and on top of it I identity as a GAY MAN and I can’t even talk to people of my own gender or people I’m attracted to properly unless I’m tipsy or drunk or they’re close family or friends. I’ve never been in a relationship and I only had my first kiss a few weeks ago (which turned out to be with a guy who kissed me because and I quote: “He’s to ugly to be with me so that’s why I got with him”... ouch. Good one drunk me.) I usually reject all relationship opportunities that come my way. I’ve had many men ask me out or show interest but I turn them down even if I think they’re attractive! The idea of a romantic relationship scares me. I’m scared of being betrayed. Of being used. Scared to have my voice taken away and to be dominated by someone and to give my trust to them. I hate it. And I feel pathetic for feeling that way and it leads me on to a weird... comfort that I’ve taken up since I was 10.
 I remember vividly blaming myself for my parents deteriorating relationship and when I turned 10 I discovered masturbation. When I masturbated it felt nice (I know that’s the point lol) but it was like a warm blanket of security. The blood pumping through my brain and my heart beating fast and yet I felt calm and at peace and strangely content. I’m slightly embarrassed to admit this but I still do it now. When I feel down or stressed or otherwise a slight sexual urge I just masturbate and it makes me feel content once again and clear of mind. This blame and shame I had for feeling like I ruined my parents’ relationship was suffocating and I remained withdrawn from my peers and was known as the quiet and shy kid through the ages of 9-13ish. This also confuses me. I feel sexual attraction and I have men who pay attention to me and yet I reject it and flee to my security blanket. It’s strange. I also have this strange guilt associated with my mum that I’ll elaborate here.

I sometimes think that I have ruined my mother’s life. She was 16 and wasn’t taught correctly about sex and her body and the consequences of these choices. She had so much potential and now she has zero qualifications and spends most of her time at home. It makes me feel like I need to do so well at life to make up for the burden I feel like I am. I get sad and tearful some days and I often wonder whether I’m worthy of the life she gave up for an unplanned motherhood. I’ve shared these thoughts with her before and she’s called me silly. Saying that I was the best thing that ever happened to her and that her life truly began when she gave birth to me and yet I still feel the way I do at times.

When I was 12 I attempted suicide. To this day it was the stupidest thing I have ever done and to this day nobody knows about it, because in my opinion I was spared by a miracle. When I put this makeshift noose around my neck and jumped the beam I tied it to broke even though it was new and it foiled my attempt. In all honesty it freaked me out and I’ve never tried since. But this was yet another moment of weakness from my... I don’t know what to call it really: Self-esteem? Confidence? Guilt? Shame?  
 
Now I’m 18, I turn 19 at the end of March and I feel off. I can’t sleep and because of that I sleep in the day instead of the night and it causes me to miss my lectures and seminars and affects my work performance at University. I feel guilty and tearful at times, lazy, lethargic and sometimes I don’t want to bother anymore and just want to lay in bed and talk to no one. I don’t understand what’s wrong with me. I want to feel normal but I don’t know what the problem is. I just have these recurring thoughts in my mind and it feels like a broken record. 

I know this post is long as all fuck and if you’ve managed to read it all then thank you so much. I don’t care whether you think I’m crazy or overthinking but I feel like I just need to get this off of my chest after 10 years. To have someone tell me what’s wrong with me. I’m scared to tell the people I love because I’m scared they’ll see me as fragile and weak and embarrassed that they’ll laugh at me. I’m scared that they’ll coddle me and overwhelm me and I’ll lash out emotionally and hurt them. Anything is helpful. Thanks again all❤️",19Jan2020,1
350,"Hi I am a female (25/F) and I often get people who I am not close to or do not even know who will tell me every morning they are sad and having a rough day. I try to be positive and help them, but eventually I don't know what to say so I end up just trying to be positive every single time.

351,"aaand i felt nothing. It was just that, but I've been feeling uncomfortable ever since. Context is, we were drunk at a party and I was like hey, why don't we try it. 

Now, I've always felt like I'm not a ""manly"" man, because of the movies I like and the way I sit with one leg over the other. And yeah, I guess I was kind of curious of what the big deal is with kissing a guy, turns out it just feels off. Gay guys hit on me all the time, so i guess I give off that vibe, but I am not homophobic or anything, I actually get along super well with gay people as the ones I meet tend to be funny and witty. So, it was a one second kiss, but I just don't know why my drunkness led me to decide to try it, most of my straight friends have tried it once in a ""yolo"" kind of way and even told me, ""you never know what you are until you try it"". So I asked the guy, we kissed and that was it.

As to my girlfriend, I love her so much, have been together for two years and have actually felt attraction to other girls while being with her, never have cheated or anything though. We are about to hit 2 months without having sex though, we can't at the moment for medical reasons. I can't even spoon her without getting an erection instantly, so i don't know how could my confidence crack so much, so randomly. Like sure, I can tell when a dude is handsome or has a nice body but Its more in a jelous/admiring way (I hope I made sense), but I have never been sexually attracted to a man.

Even in the moment of the kiss I was like, ""hey, look, nothing happens, it's just not my thing"".But then the next day, the guy tried to get in touch with me, we talked and he asked me what I felt. I told him it was not my thing and that I was now feeling uncomfortable, and he then proposed to just keep it forever as a secret and was like ""hey, at least now you know if you ever had any doubt."" Nice guy, we went to school together. But if I remember correctly I actually asked the guy to do it so I could be sure about myself or something along those lines, so now I am debating between thinking ""See? Nothing to worry about"" and thinking ""Why would you even wanted to do that in the first place?"" I even felt like super reassured for a moment, every doubt I ever had about my sexuality actually dissapeared, but now i feel kinda insecure as to why I wanted to prove that to myself in the first place. Is it normal?

Have any other guys tried it just to see?

Should i tell my girlfriend what I did?

Edit: And yeah, I know this probably just sounds like sexuality advice but it really is not, I am worried as to what would my girlfriend think if I just randomly told her ""hey, so I guess I've always felt insecure about myself and kissed a guy just to see what happens and well, nothing did"". I fear she'll change the way she feels about me, as she already knows and admits and sometimes even jokes about how I sometimes have ""girly"" preferences in some things. But if you could also comment on the other thing, it'd be nice because it's kind of haunting me and I squirm in disgust when I think of what I did.",19Jan2020,1

353,"I'm 24. About 7 months ago I was kicked out of my family's house. It's a complicated story, but basically my mother started getting mentally ill and her therapist told her that I had been manipulating her my entire childhood, so she now has a tough-love mindset about me now. 7 months ago I was told to paint their swingset and it started getting dark before I could finish. When I was about to walk out of the house to visit a friend, my Mom calmly asked where I was going, as I didn't finish the swing-set. I told her I would finish in the morning. My friend was in the driveway waiting to pick me up, and she said, ""if you walk out that door now, you're never coming back"". I regretfully said ok and left, not thinking she was serious. 

My parents are fairly well-off, and I was working at the time while living with them. When they kicked me out I moved in with my grandfather, but lost access to their car they let me use, so I lost my job. I lived with my grandfather for about a month, and applied to more jobs than I could count. I had many job interviews, and eventually got one, but that didn't last because I missed a day, and was let go. 

I then found another job, and my grandfather helped me find a cheap room rental, as he was unable to keep me at his house any longer. I held that for about a month before being let go because I had a breakdown at work, and felt so guilty about it that I locked myself in my room for 3 days until they fired me. I have a psychiatrist who put me on anxiety meds, but I never really had this problem before all this. The meds don't really help, but they stop me from having panic attacks. They also make me stop caring about work or myself more. 

This cycle kept going on, and since I've been kicked out from my parents house I've had 4 jobs. I know it's a self-fulfilling prophecy that I'm telling myself I can't hold a job so that's what's happening, but at the same time, I really hated every one of my jobs I've had. I don't know why anyone would live that way. Now that I'm homeless and none of my family wants to help, I'm malnourished, socially-deprived, and really need a haircut and a shower, but I'm not nearly as mentally stressed as when I had those jobs. Physical stress...not so much. It's cold as heck outside and my car is not comfortable at all. I don't want to go to the shelter because my government-support worker told me it is really shady and full of druggies. 

My dad goes along with whatever my mom wants. He is a pretty reasonable person, but he doesn't understand how I may be in an inescapable pit. He could help me get out of it, but he doesn't because he thinks I need to work my way up on my own like a man. He's not the only one to say this. My friends, my grandfather, my government funding case worker, basically everyone who **could actually** help me, so cutting ties with them isn't really an option. 

It's not like I don't want to work. I don't want the type of jobs I've been getting. Being the new guy just gets you made fun of a lot. Nobody smiled to me, or even looked at me when I say hi to them in the morning. I know I just need to stop caring about what others think of me but, I don't know how to. One of those jobs was in a warehouse sorting car parts, away from people, but I was tormented by the fear of getting fired and the mindless labour involved in it was so boring and degrading that I thought about quitting every second.

Not every job I had was bad. I did a co-op placement in college at a water treatment plant and really enjoyed it. Unfortunately I wasn't able to get a full time placement with them, and I'm subscribed to their job board. There hasn't been a posting I'm qualified for come up since then. I applied to many, never got a job. Knowing people in there is the only way to get the jobs, like anywhere. Just like you need money to make money, but if you have no money and nobody that will help you, you're stuck for a good while. 

I want to change, if they are right to think this is a 'mind over matter' situation. I want to be healthy again and find a place to live and get a job. But at the same time, I'd rather live with the lack of living comfort and social interaction than to take any of the jobs I've had recently.

356,"So I met this girl at this party and she’s really nice and funny and we talked like the whole time. Tomorrow she’s literally texting me nonstop, calling me cute etc, whatever. She still constantly texting but we go to separate parties. I met her friend (roommate) at the party I was at and she’s telling me how she’s definitely interested in me but she’s also talking to other guys. I invited her to the party I’m at and my dorm afterwards but she stated that she was too drunk too go. Which is true, she didn’t look in that good of a condition. They invite me to their room today to just chill and she deadass mentions to her friend with me in the room that she hooked up with this other dude the night before. Her friend could definitely tell I was a little put off by that and I think she kinda felt bad. We cuddled and made out and shit when her roommate left the room and she pretty much promised that she wanted to hang after her party. I watched the McGregor fight with the boys and am still waiting on her to even look at my “wyd” so I’m typing this at 2 in the morning. Her roommate also told me straight out that my odds weren’t good and she was planning on hooking up with the same dude the night before. Like I’m just confused really at this point. She’s very smart and calls back to a lot of our previous jokes and I think she does have some feelings for me I’m just kinda put off by this. Low key think I should go for her roommate instead because I feel like we had a connection and she seems more chill ig.

It started two nights ago, I was lying in bed thinking about things: life, existence, death. Nothing out of the ordinary for me. But when I really, *really* started thinking about death and how meaningless our lives are, I had what I believe to be a panic/anxiety attack. My heartbeat became irregular and a pure feeling of terror refused to leave my mind. I had to pace around the house for about 30 minutes to calm down. I don't understand what's going on, these thoughts never impacted me on a this level before. I've been trying to create more memories since then, been doing little things to try and improve the lives of others around me. Is this some kind of ""quarter-ish life crisis""? I feel like these fears have always been there, but I just wish I knew how to supress them again. How do I stop these panic attacks I get from thinking about death? Is there anything I can do?

364,"Hi everyone, I'm 24/F/USA. My advice request has a long story so bare with me please. I still live at home with my mom and my 21 year old brother, who has autism. My hardworking mother works 7 days a week. She is a 2nd shift dispatcher for a construction company, a job that she starts her shift at 12PM and can't leave until every trucks back in the lot and post-trips are complete, sometimes as late as 11:30 PM. Sometimes she's even worked overnights or doubles when the company has special projects like overnight roadwork. She also works at Chick Fil a for about 4 hours, early in the morning. Shes had the dispatch job since I was a baby, shes going on 22 years, and the Chick Fil A job for 13 years now. She is a very hardworking woman, and to do that all 6 days a week and sometimes have to go work on Sunday for an additional shift is brutal to the point where Chick Fil A has told her to take time off so she can get extra sleep. My dad has been out of the picture for about 16 years now. Anyway, my brother needs constant care. He cannot socialize with anyone but my mom, myself and our other brother who's moved out, not even my dad. He can basically work a microwave, switch on and off electronics and use the bathroom, thats it. I have to remind him to shower and brush his teeth every day. My mom can't do it, as she has to work. Here's where the problem comes in. My mother convinced me to skip college and get a full time job as she would let me live at home rent free as long as i kept an eye on my brother. I did skip college and have had tons of jobs like McDonalds, Wendys, a maid job, Panda Express and a Speedway Gas Station AM. All the people from my graduating class are now entering careers, and I want to go to community college and study education, as i'd like to teach disabled students. My mom is horribly opposed to this idea, and the reason is because my brother will be alone 14-17 hours a day and she has to sleep. But I can not be responsible for him any longer. My mom will not apply for SSI for my brother, as she's too ""busy"" to do so and always says she thinks he will get denied. He will not get denied, he is so impaired that he cant talk to people and we've done all we can with therapies, support groups and trying to get him a job even. Everytime I bring up that its time for me to grow up and start my own life, I get told I'm selfish, that my brother will suffer, that my mom will get fired from her job, I wont be able to manage having a job and school, etc. I havent had a boyfriend in 4 years now because my mom is even opposed to that! She's afraid that having a boyfriend will scare my brother too much, but he warmed up to a couple of my longer term ex's. She also tells me not to have my own kids yet asks my brother when he's gonna get his fiance pregnant. So basically, I need to know how to tell my mom that I need to grow up. I've done it all, and she's opposed it all. I even had a guaranteed tuition reimbursement working at McDonalds and she told me to skip it.  I also am told i'll be evicted from her house if i sign up for school, and i have nowhere to go except my car if that happens. PS, please dont tell us to go to therapy, my mom doesnt listen to the therapist.",19Jan2020,1

367,"
She's not necessarily a good friend, and alot of times she doesnt seem like a good person.(towards others). And ive talked to her about it but there no real change. Not that she has to change but i should have to be friend with someone with her kind of takes on things. Furthermore, i dont expect alot from my friends, all my life ive been introverted and ive been able to stay mentally stable on my own. But over time ive realized that she doesnt take the way i feel or think about things as seriously as I do to what she thinks and feels. Dispite me pointing it out she still seems oblivious. Dont get me wrong i dont want anything from her emotionally and probably will never need anything from anyone for the sake of my mental, but i think having that quality makes a good friend. 

Overall, most of the relationship seems like im giving and not getting anything. The delema is that i cant decide whether my morals should be more important than my peace of mind. I dont want to be her friend but i dont want to just drop her. And there is no in between.

Shes said before that without me she might have offed herself and if i recall she might have said without me she might kill herself. In a joking manner and in a kindof serious manner.







Simplified version
-if i leave, cut her off, pay less attention to her she might pay consequences.(suicide, depression, panic attack)
- she does nothing for me to make me feel like she is a good friend.
- if i ever needed advice not only would she probably not give it to me she is most of the time incapable of having deep conversation with any kind of meaningful insight.",19Jan2020,1

369,"Hi! Throw away account for privacy.

I'm posting this on behalf of somebody I know (We'll call her K) who broke up with her ex partner (We'll call him D). The relationship between K and D lasted for about 3 years.

D bought a new puppy for K as a gift. Naturally the dog was around both of them all the time, including both families, they had the dog together for just over a year before they broke up about 8 months ago. K loves the puppy, and it's her best friend.

K caught on that D was messaging another girl, saying things about how unhappy he was, and how seeing K's face made him unhappy. They worked together on late shifts and would go to cafes/diners on occasion after their shift, this went on for months, K asked him to not speak to her which he didn't agree on, and continued to see and message her (A large reason for their break up). He never admited to cheating physically. After they broke up, D and this girl are now together. K is furious.

In the last year of the relationship, K had an immediate family member that fell very sick and passed away. While the family member was wrestling with health, D was doing the above. They broke up about 8 months ago and kept minimal to no communication.

D's mum has fallen sick (K always loved D's mum), and is now feeling conflicted on what she should do regarding the puppy. She wants to be there as she knows what that journey of a sick family member is like, but is conflicted because D abandoned her in her time of need.

D has asked for the dog in some custody to help with the sick mother, as she liked the dog. Thoughts on what K should do with the dog?

TLDR; Got a puppy gifted from a boyfriend, the puppy is her best friend and well taken care of. The relationship is over and has been for almost a year, the the boyfriend is now wanting some shared custody of the dog.",19Jan2020,1

i realized she was going at it quite a while back and it really made me uncomfortable and kinda trapped, since i was at her house and we were just sitting in her room watching tv. i didn't know what to say, though, and just tried to pretend i didn't see anything, despite how much it messed with me. it happened a lot of times after that though, and i'd always just leave the room cause i couldn't bring myself to say anything (i have anxiety and have a hard time standing up for myself). masturbating itself isn't a problem, obviously, but it's not okay at all to just do something like that when someone is fully conscious not even a full two feet away from you, no matter how unaware you think they are. it makes me super uncomfortable and upset. 

anyways, a couple of days ago i realized it was happening AGAIN and still didn't say anything. it apparently was obvious that i'd noticed or something because after she was done she asked ""why did you look at me like that?"" and i just avoided the question. she kept asking. i went to the bathroom and didn't talk to her after that and left the next morning without talking to her either. 

since then i've only talked to her in short sentences over text twice and have been intentionally avoiding answering her, but i'm not sure if she's noticed yet.

Turns out my gf was just going along with me until I prompted a very real discussion regarding the matter. 

I believe the most awful thing I could do as a man is lead someone down the garden path having them think it's something I'd come around to wanting. When I'm sure it's not the case.

At 33 now, I'm financially secure, I'm happy in my work, I travel and run around doing whatever I want within reason. And I just don't see kids in my future.

And I've made my choices clear to my partners.. open and honest. 

Turns out after 4 years, my gf does want children and has been aware that there is a time bomb in our relationship.  Now i don't want to lose her. But I won't bring another unwanted child into the world.  And I won't waste her child bearing years.  Will this leave me alone, probably.

385,"I (23/M) got my first real job at a multinational IT company just over 4 months ago although it doesn't pay a lot, it is still a bit above average for a fresher. I finished college last summer and wound up heavily in debt. Thus, I decided against moving out of my parents house to try and pay off the debt by the end of 2020. So for the same reason I was directly flushing out upwards of 75% of my income against my loan. I was still able to save a little bit owing to some incentives that the company provided for my outstanding work. Also I feel I should mention, I'm not really a software guy. I'm more into hardware and electronics but a software job pays more so I took it get out of debt as a temp job.

At this point I'm not paying for food or rent. My dad however quit his job 3 months ago. He says he is looking for a new job but from what I've seen he isn't even trying to get one. He had absolutely 0 savings at all which means we have been living off of my mum's savings which have been depleted now as well. We own no property so the house rent contributes to the major part of the monthly expense. My mum works at a local clinic and her wages can barely pay off the rent. My dad seems to feel no remorse and has practically unofficially declared retirement with no money hand. Moreover he is often angered by any work that he has to do be it house chores or anything else. I talked to him and even tried to suggest him ways to find a job but to no success.

Also I would like to mention this isn't the first time this has happened. My brother was born premature and needed surgery within 8 days of his birth, my father at the time just gave up and said that he doesn't have any money (My mother had to borrow money from my uncle at the time). He came into a huge debt when his attempted business failed. He has resigned/been fired from at least 15 different jobs. Each of these times my mum's little funds have come to the rescue. I've decided to go the stoic way and just accept it for what it is.

Back to the problem at hand. I have decided to cut down on the debt repayment and pay up all that I have saved towards the debt. I can decrease the monthly installments to 55% of my wage and contribute 35% towards household expenses. If I also turn all my incentives towards the debt, I figured I can still clear my loan by the end of 2020 or by Feb 2021. 

However this will mean living off 10% of my wage, ending up with no savings and also not having enough money to basically socialize. Somehow I believe this is turning me into a major cheapskate and money hoarder. I've had to deny my girlfriend going out to party or going out on fancy dates. That poor soul somehow still manages to love me. But I don't know if I am doing the right thing here. But after a lot of (over)thinking, this is the only option I've found. So I've come here to ask internet strangers for advice. Any and all will be appreciated.",19Jan2020,1

But I just wanted to get some things off my chest. 

I’m 20 years old. My life is just starting, I have an amazing 6 month old. Which I love with ALL my heart. 

My life has been rough traumatic. I’ve been through so much .. I mean who hasn’t. Right ? But I’m stuck in my past. I am the type of person that just .. can’t let go of things.  I’m CONSTANTLY overthinking. I’m mentally weak. I’m a very sensitive person. I hurt easily. 

Every night that I lay to bed I think of how shitty of a person And pathetic of a person I am. I feel like I’m never good enough. Like I’m nothing in this world. It makes me cry. I always try to stay strong for my baby. I try to push myself and be the best mom I can be, but sometimes I wanna give up and I know I can’t. 

I always ask myself “why am I here?” ..

If my baby wasn’t here right now I can honestly say my life would really really suck.

He's the player type of guy.

And don't tell me to move on cuz I can do better etc. I can't control my feelings and unfortunately I fell for the wrong type of guy. Or maybe deep inside he's a good guy. Ugh idk I love him so much.

Im 18 btw. I know him at school. I think he likes me too or like he teases me a lot so idk...

Im quite shy and reserved while he is popular and social.

Anyways yesterday during P.E. class I was sitting on a chair and he came towards me and told me to stand cuz he was so tired and wanted to sit. I laughed and said no and he asked several times and i refused and told him to get another chair from the other side of the room. So he went to get it and placed it literally next to mine 😂 then he rested his legs on my lap but I pushed them away lol. He was clearly teasing me. Anyways, im not someone who talks a lot so after that, we just sat there with an awkward silence for like 10 minutes until he finally said smthg like ""ugh im so tired"" to cut the silence lol and I was just like ""go home to rest"" and then awkward silence again.

As u can tell, im not someone who likes to show how i feel which is rather bad so he probably thinks im not interested at all.

Btw he is very good looking while im just average.

391,"Hi. I really don't know what I'm going to do with my life. I am a freshman in highschool. My middle school grades were bad, but I believe I'm doing better this year, although I do have a D in English...I have asian parents and I have lost all hope for myself. The topic of what I'm going to do with my life after school has come up so many times that i already know what my parents are going to say next. The problem is...I really dont know what I'm going to do. first my parents wanted me to work in the medical field. I said ok. I didnt really care. I want to do whatever makes them happy and working in the medical field doesnt seem that bad at all. But then...a well paying job in the medical field would take at least 8 years to get my degree for. Will I just live off my parents for 8 years? I cant do that to them. So at first , the first time I thought of getting a job I wanted to do something I liked...like maybe get a job that's fun and exciting. Now I really couldnt care less. A stripper? an accountant? a waitress? All I have been thinking about is money and how hard it will be to buy a house when I'm older. Thinking about how I'm going to support my parents and myself. Insurance and cars. I think i feel scared. All I want to do is make money. Money money money. that's all I think about now. How I'm going to save money, how much college will cost. I feel like every free time I get is spent thinking about my life past college. I really cant see myself 5-10 years from now. I dont even see myself living in 5 to 10 years. This sucks. My parents now want me to work as an Emt. my sister got mad at me for not caring about what I want to do with my life or not caring that i have let my parents decide.

393,"I wanna pre face this by saying that I know this isn't a tweet and I'm expecting that this will probably be removed. Mods, if you're going to remove the post and the potential discussion it can provide, please point me to a community I can use. 

To the topic. I'm deep, deep in the sunken place. That, and/or my shadow self is really, really just beneath the surface. Who am I? A 22 year old black man who, for the majority of his adolescence and adulthood to the present, has always felt inadequate in his blackness. Even in elementary school I was drawn to blonde haired white kids as my best friends. I've been told I speak white in middle school. The thing is, I haven't always been this way. I remember writing a powerful essay about Huey Newton in the 8th grade (got a 4, equivalent to an A) and was commended by my teacher for it. And I really meant the shit I put into that essay. I also remember dancing to spanish music with my spanish speaking classmates in my early high school years. Which is so frustrating because I don't know what's caused this slide into, and I'll be blunt, white supremacy, aside from a starvation of a connectedness with a black community. I wasn't raised in a predominantly black neighborhood and I was never really exposed to what it means to be black. You could say I'm sheltered. All I know is I have this major disconnect with people of my own skin. It's like that Jay Z Line - ""OJ like, I'm not black I'm OJ"" Difference being, I know I'm black but I truly don't feel it. I didn't grow up around black people. No one taught me black is beautiful. Where does the deep seeded love for the blonde and the white come from? Subliminal programming from the super saiyans of dragon ball z? The super hero heroics of the blonde haired Naruto? (Two shows I grew up on as a kid)

Carl Jung says the shadow is the worst of us we keep hidden. And I believe my shadow is a white supremacist. I won't repeat word for word the vile bile that part of myself produces, but suffice to say, he believes in a master race. I mentally call almost every black person I see the N - word on impulse. Of course, I don't let this shit fly and condemn myself every single time that prejudice rears it's ugly head. I'm revolted that the sick shit my mind produces, it bothers me that this is who I became. My mind is trash. 

I believe Donald Trump, if the MSM is to be believed, represents the racist response to the first black president. But even greater than that, I believe that, if the MSM is to be believed, he represents the racist face of America we chose to ignore, a face that came out of hiding. I also believe that I'm reflected in that face. I don't believe that it's a coincidence that as I grew more racist, the first black president was replaced with someone who thinks ""there are fine people on both sides"". Not that I'm Truman or a celebrity with 15 minutes to my name, or someone who should put the onus of the direction of the country on his flaws, or on his back. Another disclaimer: I'm fully aware that Trump may be playing 4-D chess, a higher game, than my simple mind may be capable of grasping. If that's the case, please ignore me Donald. You're doing great. Otherwise, the shit I said stands. 

I know I'm not the only one suffering from this deep internalized oppression. I'm not the only one in the sunken place. I may be the only one who doesn't know how he got to point z. I need help. How do I reconnect with my black community? Especially as an introverted, slow loner? How do I tackle the shadow white supremacist lurking right underneath the surface? How do I learn to love being black, and how do I learn to know that black is beautiful?

 So here’s story...my in laws have been staying in our one bedroom apt for last couple months because it’s winter and they usually live in their RV. We didn’t want them to stay out in cold.
 So me and husband woke up freezing in our apartment this morning, with sore throats, and asked his parents who are staying with us if they were cold, they said “no it felt fine.”
 So I happened to notice thermostat turned all the way down tonight, and asked “whoa who turned heat off? No wonder me and Stan woke up freezing this morning with sore throats! “
 And his mom said “oh no! I don’t know who turned it off, maybe Stan? “ (my husband)” 
Then she asked her husband if he did, and her husband said “no, she did, she always does.” (Meaning my mother in law.)
 This made me mad especially knowing my husband doesn’t ever turn heat down, only in summer. AND that his mom blamed on him! 
 Am I over reacting ? 
 I just hate liars or fibbers whatever you want to call em...but to blame on your own son? Knowing he didn’t? Urrrg. I was so mad I didn’t even say goodnight. 
  And be it I’ve been biting my tongue letting them stay with us, and they say “they’re trying to figure it out”. Tired of hearing that one...they’ve been living in RV for about 4 years now,...”trying to figure it out”, but that’s another story.
  I feel like if they are so hot, and turn OUR heat off, why don’t they just go back in their RV?! Just irritates me. I wish I could tell them that.

399,"In brief summary: My mentally-ill sister and I are in a toxic, co-dependent relationship and she views me as a man-sized child of hers, rather than her college graduate brother who doesn't want to spend the rest of his life welded to her hip.  I need to figure out how to move out and be on my own before her mental illness and horrific interpersonal relationships and questionable activities ruin my life by proxy.

&amp;#x200B;

Longer version: I was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, (which has more recently been classified as a form of mild autism.) in roughly 04-05.  My sister was chosen as my rep-payee, and the living situation was that I lived on the upper-floor of a two-story house, while she lived in the lower.  She is gay, and had recently gotten a girlfriend who was around the same age as me when all this happened.  Things were okay for quite a long time, as I used being on SSI/SSDI to go to college, with the intention of one day getting off of both of those programs and live independently.

A lot of things have changed however.  Among them being that the two of them had children (sperm-donor, obviously), my sister was diagnosed with breast cancer, (of a kind that was being fueled/fed by female hormones/estrogen? Basically, she had to get a mastectomy AND a hysterectomy) and while my sister was going through chemo, her girlfriend/then-wife cheated on her and eventually moved out of the house to live with an ex-con who knocked her up.

Needless to say, I've had to be very reliable for my sister, within the limitations of being in college and not having a driver's license. (I get very tense, worried, and anxious behind the wheel) Both before and after her chemo-therapy.  However, among the general stress of that along with finding out how spoiled, lazy, and devoid of morals her Ex is, was also dealing with the Neuropathy and ""Chemo-Brain"" side-effects.

As horrible as this is going to sound, but it is the truth; my sister was in a better state of mental health when she was firmly in the camp of ""F--k that c--t."" regarding her ex.  It's a very bad family trait, I think, where we are more motivated when running on spite than on dedication for doing the right thing, or something like that...point is that 2-3 years ago, when she started letting her Ex have more influence on her/their life, things have gone horrifically downhill.  Or maybe exposed the rot that was always there underneath it all...

I'm putting this out very late at night, because I need answers ASAP, and will reply as questions come up for specific details, but I'm also emotionally and mentally exhausted, while physical is catching up to both of those at the moment.  What I need answers to are these questions, which largely pertain to laws and such in Wisconsin.

1. How to QUICKLY change a rep-payee, or similarly, quickly make a change to declare that a 'representative payee' is not necessary any longer.  
   1. I am on the fence whether or not I want to officially/legally throw my sister under the bus for why her recent decisions regarding property and financial dealings should disqualify her as a payee, but if that's what's needed so I can decide what happens with my money, so be it.
2. How to report people who are under the auspices of ""housing authority"", or report ""on their behalf"" when they fail to bring up issues with their living arrangements.
   1. Ex lives off of social security because her dad is dead, and my niece and nephew were diagnosed as autistic.  Her boyfriend lives with her, even though that's not 'legal' and they have a 2-year-old child.
   2. The ex and her family (and niece and nephew because shared custody) live next door to a methhead woman who knowingly allowed her fellow methhead boyfriend pedophile to video-tape her grandkids naked.  This was anonymously reported by my sister to the cops, but the guy was and is still living there despite video evidence.  Monday last week, both methheads got into a domestic violence fist-fight in the middle of the night, in the driveway of their place.
3. How to get the non-birth-mother of a divorced lesbian couple sole-custody of their children because the birth-mother is an unfit parent.
   1. My sister's ex is a non-functional stoner, spoiled brat and a horrible person who has lost 30 IQ points in the last few years.  She was giving my severely autistic 10-year-old nephew weed to help with his insomnia.  And he was 10 when we found out about it, but it had apparently been going on for more than a year before then. And she's probably doing other stuff to 'help' him now that we don't know about yet.
      1. My sister has chemo-brain and neuropathy, and has been going through wild mood swings thanks to a horrible shrink that subscribes bad prescriptions.  Given the choice between her or the pothead who won't report domestic violence going on outside her house because ""It happens all the time, but the kids don't hear it normally"", it's fairly obvious which one is the better choice. (though foster-care is probably the one true BEST solution...)

All of this I am asking because unless I get an answer or a miracle happens, the ex and her family are going to end up living back at this house, but only as a 'temporary' arrangement until we ALL move down to Illinois, very much so against my will.  And my statements of wanting to stay have been met with verbal browbeating, cussing out, and emotional manipulation designed to either shame me into cowing to her whims, or goad me into a screaming match that I will not win, and then submit to my sister's chemo-brained, haywire-medicated, easily-manipulated-by-the-ex decisions.  Because I ""have to move with them"" so my sister ""can live her life"". (those were the exact words that she used.)",19Jan2020,1
400,"Bad Roommate/Friend Situation

I’m a 21 year old college student. I’ve had these two roommates, both guys who are also 21, for the past year and a half, one for longer. We’ve always been a close group of friends, but there’s been a significant shift this past year. My relationship with both of them has deteriorated pretty significantly, and my roommates girlfriend recently went on a drunken barrage against me in front of all of our friends, really embarrassing. Talking things out has failed, they won’t sit down with or speak to me anymore. I’ve tried to distance myself from this group but things have only gotten worse. I planned a day trip, hours away, with two other friends, my roommates wanted to go to the same part of the state with their gfs, so they pushed our mutual friend into having us go elsewhere, to the other side of the state.

401,"Basically  a couple of months ago my best friend (who lives with me) confessed she had feelings for me after a few drinks. It was mutual. She begged me to have sex with her but I said no, because she wasn't sure of her sexuality (her words) and it would be wrong incase she regretted it when she was sober. She then got naked in front of me and begged me to, it was really hard to say no, but I did because I think it would've been wrong to do it like that. When we were sober she said the feelings were very much real, and I suggested we give it a go, she said she would think about it. We spent the better part of two days acting like a couple. She came back and said it would be wrong for us to be in a relationship. 

After this it was a bit angst for about a week and I confronted her and said that it sucked because I kept thinking how great we could be together. She lost it, and started crying and said she hadn't thought of it that way. She came back to me a couple of days later and told me we wouldn't work because I was too intense and am too emotional for her to be with. 

I accepted that, if she doesn't want a relationship, I can't force her to want one. But it still hurt and felt like rejection - rejection hard.  We've since been hanging out like normal etc. 

Now she's organised a date with a girl from tinder on Friday. I know as a best friend I should be happy and excited for her but it just fucking sucks. I feel like I got the short straw?  She put the feelings on me and now she gets to walk away and potentially be happy with someone else?  Why wasn't it enough for me just to have a chance with her? Why did she even say she had them, I was perfectly fine before that even happened. 

What do I do? Does anyone have any experience in getting rid of feelings? I just want to bleach them right out so I can go back to being happy for her dating people.

I am currently a dropout, living in Melbourne Australia, I don't really have much hobbies other than gaming and my love for singing and voice acting, however I currently have no money to buy any musical equipment nor do I understand anything in regards to music.

One particular time I said something a little more suggestive, and  she must’ve told me to cut it out because she was engaged (totally forgot about that every time). After that exchange, I must have deleted the conversation knowing I wasn’t going to message her again, but I didn’t remember once I woke up.

409,"Tl/dr my creepy neighbor scares me what can I do? 

Hi obligatory on mobile and pretty long  but Idk what to do I have lived in my apartment complex for the past 6 years and everything has fine since about 3 years ago, until “mike” and his adult children moved in to apartment across from my family’s. We never had issues with mike’s family until we noticed an unpleasant smell started to creep out their apartment. Since we live right across from them most of the smell gets trap on top of the stairs as it’s enclosed by the building. The down stair neighbor’s also get hit with the smell but it’s not as bad as it is at the top of the stairs. It’s so bad no one can eat in the kitchen comfortably without noticing the smell. 

We have tried cleaning the stair spraying febreze  and other sprays with no help. We have complained to the complex manager and they can’t do anything since the smell is related to mikes lack of hygiene. It’s gotten to the point any time we want to go out side we listen to see if anyone from mikes apartment is leaving if so so we can wait so that the smell isn’t as bad. However things have gotten a little creepy and honestly I’m really terrified of mike at this point. At first mike would always say hello to us if we ran into each other and not wanting to be rude we would say hello back. As time progressed he began to get creepy and weird. 

Anytime I would run into him he would always say “hi you’re really pretty! 😃” and I would always be in a rush to work or school anytime he would run into me so I would just smile at him and walk straight into my apartment. At first I didn’t find his actions creepy until he started to wait at the base of the stairs when he would see me or my mother. It got to the point that we would not leave our cars until he left the stairs. Then he proceeded to wave us down anytime he would see us drive out of the complex and would not stop until we acknowledged him. We continue to try to avoid him but it’s kinda hard when he lives next from us.  

Last year was when I began to feel uncomfortable when I saw mike. As I was getting the mail he came out and began his usual dialogue but he decided it would be great to add some extra creepiness to mix by asking for a hug. Mind you this man is well into his 70 and reeks of B.O. I flat out said “f*** no” out of shock and he apologized and went on his way. Not two weeks later while I’m in the complex pool with one of my younger brothers he stops at the base at the stairs and just stares at us for 15 minutes not moving just watching us. I was so uncomfortable I only let half my face above water.  

After the pool incident I have not had an issue with mike until tonight. I was on FaceTime with a really good friend of mine and I saw sitting in my car while chatting with him as I had just came home from work. My big mistake was that I had turned on the light inside the car so my friend could see me better. It’s about 10 at night almost 11 and I see that mike had left his apartment and I’m like  “ok ima just wait until the smell goes goes away” and continue to speak with my friend about work and life. I’m laughing with my friend and I don’t know why I turn to my left and who do I see at my window leaning into my car window... mike. As soon as I see him I let out a blood curdling scream that sacred my friend and I slightly rolled down my window about 1/2 inch. I asked if I could help him and he asked for the time I gave it to him and he saw I was alone in my car and proceeded to ask if I was lonely. I quickly rolled up my window and I slightly began to panic and mike walked away and my friend had asked if I was ok I said yes but that  I was scared to exit my car and I told him I would see him later and hung up on him and texted my brother to come out side and walk me out of my car. I told my parents and they were concerned and said they would mention it to the complex manager. 

I’m honestly really scared of him and I’m not easily scared what can I do?",19Jan2020,1
410,"hi everyone; so as the title suggests my mom thinks i have an eating disorder. i'm 16, 5'7"", and i weight about 180. my weight tends to fluctuate a lot and i did get down to about 160 a bit ago before some things changed and although my eating habits didn't i believe the stress made my body keep the pounds on. i am aware i am overweight for my height as well as age, but after starting puberty the weight really hit me for some reason, i went from stick to thick. my eating habits are pretty odd, i live 50/50 between two states and parents homes. while at my fathers i tend to not eat often as most the food is junky quick meals and i try to stay healthy which usually tends to me eating at work most days (i work at a fast food place, not much better i know.) whereas, at my moms i usually eat dinner and eat later in the night as when i'm with her i sleep until about 11-12 and thus dont have breakfast, or lunch besides coffee. although i do exercise the weight doesn't seem to change much (but i'm not here to talk about me trying to lose weight.) anyways; she told me that she had anorexia when she was a teenager basically (she never said the words but said she threw up often) and now she thinks i'm bulimic (i assume because i dont really look like i could be anorexic.) but now shes very worried and its making me worry too. i don't actively avoid eating or excessively exercise and although i am self-conscious i'm still confident. my question with all of this is; do i sound like i have an eating disorder?

418,"Hey everyone, so as the title says, my friend, Shell (made up name) is in a long-distance relationship with Jack (made up name), however, yesterday 2 of Shell's friends got drunk and messaged her, saying that they like her and want to spend the rest of their lives together etc.

Shell hasn't done anything yet but says that she plans on rejecting them the next time she sees them in person (they told her these feelings over text) 

Anyway, Shell contacted me because she wanted to know if it would be a good idea to tell Jack about what happened. At first, I thought that it wouldn't really matter since she's going to do the right thing anyway but Jack can be a very sensitive person when it comes to his relationship with Shell.

I occasionally have about 10 minutes for a nap at school, but I’m afraid of saying someone’s name aloud, or moaning.  Last year someone pointed out that I was drooling when I took a nap in a stairwell. This has kept me from taking naps at school, and I tend to get really self conscious when sleeping around other people, like when I’m in a car or on a plane.

TLDR: M20 thinking about abandoning relationship to try other things.  
  

Well, I am 20-year-old male and often I am unintentionally d\*ck person. I mean, I have girlfriend, we met in summer and it was the most awesome summer ever for both of us. We went camping several times and etc. Then we started university, my girlfriend had random sadness and anger issues and she always said things that made me so upset, that I had to turn my phone off to not think about that.... Well, once I went at my university course (it was like 3 day stay at school, sports, dance and etc.) and I just had to turn off my phone again... I was so upset and went to have dance with my friends (it was better than sitting somewhere alone and sad.) I am not party guy but if I do party with my friends, I can do all the crazy dances and etc… and then I ended up on slow dance with girl (there was nothing wrong with it, we were just chatting and got dancing together just by accident... BUT there was a spark between us, like huge spark and we actually spend rest of the night smiling at each other and talking (but still, just as friends, no flirting and anything like that), it was nice but I was sure I want to stay with my gf.... But that spark never left me (and never left her)... She knows I am in relationship and when I tried to turn her down, she said she really likes who I am, my personality and she is going to wait. She is the kindest person I know and even thou she is not the sharpest one ( but honestly, I am also not the sharpest too), she is super hard working (I can brain out lot of things without much effort, but she can learn anything she wants (she has a strong will))  
   
 

3 Months later, me and my gf had really hard time understanding each other, we broke up and I just started to talk to THAT girl again and bought her flower just to make her happy (there was no date but it was still d\*ck move in my mind). Well one month after breakup my exgf wrote me, we started chatting and I decided I want to try that relationship again, because of that awesome summer. We are still together, I doesn’t work perfectly, especially while we are chatting (I am quite a busy person, I have my work as IT specialist and also I do tech help, web development, develop my own arduino solutions and repair/build laptops/PCs, graphics stuff and etc. so chatting is must and we were together for ""only"" about 20 hours a week). 

 And now I am here, we are arguing a lot while chatting but most of time when we are together, everything is fine and we are quite happy together. I think our personalities are ""incompatible"" in long run, and after one pregnancy scare, I realized I am not sure if she is my person for life (I would never leave her if she would be pregnant), but I don´t want to break up with her (actually half of me wants to break up because I am not sure if she is the correct person for me (she is crazily unproductive, stubborn, often lazy, don´t like to study but also loving and intelligent person)). 

I know, I was/am d\*ck person, but I don´t do that intentionally, often it is just random bad luck and lack of ""what could go wrong"" thinking.",19Jan2020,1
427,"So, a few months back, 2 months ago to be exact, I have been encountering some issues with my health ever since I started studying mental health. No, I am not becoming a doctor, it's just my hobby. Anyway, I have been getting a lot of dizziness, losing balance, unstableness, sleeplessness, headaches, blurry vision, ringing ears, and intense coughing. Even though I dig through health problems, I couldn't find what this is whatsoever. I tried to tell my parents about it, they just told me that it's because I spend a lot of time on my computer (Not even a lot, around 2-4 hours with breaks.). So a little information about myself; I am 14 years old, I spend most of my time coding and playing video games if I don't have a lot to do in my free time. My current mental health state is okay, but my parents are telling me that I might have ADHD and OCD/Obsession, which I think is very unlikely. I have lacked vitamin D, which I think its most likely that. If you guys know what's up, please respond.

He said he kept every one of them and how sweet they were and we agreed we never were like that with other partners. Then he told me stories of how he had recently been to places we used to hangout and secretly meet and fuck at in high school

He told me to text him when I got home and I said “I’m home, I miss chillin with you!”

He said: “Good I’m glad you made it home safely! 
Yeah I agree, it’s always a good time seeing you and I just so appreciate you!
I miss hanging out and your energy too! Thank you!”


I told him this the next day: “Yeah it’s always a good time even when we’re just talking, so I’m glad we can still be friends. For some reason I can ramble on for hours when hanging with you! So feel free to stop me lol and sorry if hugging for that long was weird to you”

He responded with: “Well I feel the same way and I’m glad we can too! Means a lot to me! Well for one thing and something I can def speak to, is that it doesn’t feel like hours so that could be a theory haha 
And no it wasn’t weird at all, rather the opposite in my opinion! Felt healthy!”

I said: “Yeah! It’s nice to talk about things I enjoy and love and have someone reciprocate that energy about my interests. For real! I was like whoa it’s way later than we agreed on staying out last night but thanks for pushing through. 
It did! I didn’t know if you felt I was keeping you hostage lol 😂”

He said: “I couldn’t agree more on how enjoyable it is to talk with someone that is also naturally curious and contributes in an educational and interesting way! Oh of course, I didn’t mind at all! 
No it didn’t at all, it was def mutual! I thought maybe I was doing that to you haha”

I said: “Well I feel like our interests and values align more than before. 
Honestly I just didn’t wanna push anything because I know you don’t really ask to hangout or initiate so I feel like you do stuff just cause you think I like it not cause you actually want to”

He said: “I agree! I’ve had some catching up to do haha
Well I can tell you that that is not the case but that I do genuinely enjoy it and do things because I do want to! Don’t overthink it haha “

I said: “I always overthink. Well invite me to hang more and I’ll feel less like a nuisance”

He said: “ok, I will! I just did my improve class and I really had to push myself but it was silly and I enjoyed it!”

I said: “glad you enjoyed it”

Who is flirting more? He says he doesn’t ask to hangout because he doesn’t get those vibes from me

434,"Before anyone points it out, yes, I did make an account just for this. Also, this is going to be long, just a disclaimer!

So, here's a little bit of background on the situation. I am currently a 16-year-old girl. Four years ago, I made this friend who we shall call Mary. Mary initially was a very nice person, really sociable and extroverted and just what I thought I needed as an introvert. We hit it off right away even though we had little in common, and we have been best friends ever since.

This year, many new kids came to our school. I promised myself that I would not rely on Mary for social interactions anymore and basically forced myself (with her advice and prompting, of course) to be more extroverted. I made some new friends and everything was well until Mary started intruding in these relationships for no reason. I have no problem with her making the same friends as me, but the moment I talked to someone and she noticed, she grabbed the person and walked off to talk to them on her own and next thing you know, they were best friends and that new person had forgotten all about me.

I don't know if it's really my fault. Maybe it is. But then Mary started being extremely toxic.

Over a couple of months, we developed a common friend group of 5 people. Us five went out every week and were really close, and I was really happy to have made new friends. But then weird things started happening. Mary started being very controlling and always had to be the one to choose where we would go on our night out. I hadn't become fully extroverted yet, obviously, so I always put the idea of just going to a nice coffee shop on the table. She always dismissed my ideas as 'lame' and 'not something she wanted to do on a Saturday night'. 

Within the group, one guy always supported Mary and it hurts to say that he was being quite clingy to her as well, another guy just existed and stuck with Mary's supporter since they were good friends, and the other dude was mostly neutral but tended to have my back. This guy was one of the only reasons I stayed in this group. One day, Mary literally proposed we kicked him out, and after some grilling she revealed that she wanted him out because he kept supporting me. 

Mary proceeded to create this clique in which I was unfortunately in as well. She started and still starts drama with everyone. I think about 90% of the people I know and have asked outside our group currently dislike her, but won't tell her. During the last few months I have lost a massive amount of friends, and when I asked those people if I have done something wrong, they usually say I am a good person but have stuck with Mary. 

It doesn't end there; every time they want to go out and I say no Mary seems to actively try to make me feel guilty. She says that if I love her I will go out with her, that I don't need to study, that she doesn't want to stay in so I have to come, too, and when I am sick she insists that I join them even if I'm feeling awful. Either way I end up feeling so bad when I do stay in, even if I enjoy the solitude. Furthermore, she keeps degrading me, calling me stupid quite directly and insinuating that I'm ugly, fat and bad at everything. Whenever I chime in with my opinion in a convo she huffs and says 'Forget it, you're too stupid to understand'. And even though she acts this way, she always copies from me on tests and tells me to study hard because she can't bother to.

I understand she is being toxic, but is it really her that's the problem? I don't know if I am on the right side of the argument here. Also, if I let her go, I will also let go of a group of friends that's dear to me. Thankfully I do have other friends, and I plan on rebuilding my relationship with the people I lost, but they are all in different classes. What do I do? How can I deal with her? How can we both be happy? 

Thank you. Sorry for the long post.",19Jan2020,1

I told them no, and added offhand that it was good since I didn’t have a second layer underneath (besides my bra and underwear, not that I told them that).

But the issue is one of them - I found out she had put our apartment on Craigslist to sublet it without telling me or the other roommate (I am unsure if she told our landlady or not but when we signed the lease we agreed to no subletting). I don’t like our address being available online, but I figured if she wanted to move out that badly now it’s a good call. 

But now, she’s stopped locking the doors to the apartment. It’s happened 3 times now: once when I came home from work during the day to find the apartment completely open, door ajar (I spoke to my other roommate about this and told him it made me uncomfortable), once just now tonight while I was home (at this point I texted them in our group chat asking them to double check the lock), and once again this morning when at 4 AM I was woken up to an extremely loud banging when I am a super heavy sleeper and found our front door again totally open. When I woke up, I was terrified and thought someone had broken in (we live in a city known for this). I texted the group chat again asking if everyone was okay, and she told me to “stay confused”.

I know I can’t reconcile with this girl at this point, but we’ve gotten noise complaints in the past from our downstairs neighbors and I really don’t want our landlady to kick us out or not allow me to stay in the apartment after they’re gone in June. I have tried to speak with my roommate about this, but it leads nowhere. At this point, I’m thinking I should text our downstairs neighbors to apologize or that I should call our landlady and explain the situation so I can at least stay in the apartment, but I don’t know if that’s appropriate or not or how I would word it.

443,"So I have been dating this girl for the past 2.5 years. I'm madly in love with her. A month ago we broke up due to something I did. I let one of our mutual friends sleep in my bed. We were hanging out until 3:30 and I live in a big city so I did not want to send a girl home by herself so late at night (being a gentleman). Nothing happened between us but it is pretty well known that she kinda has a crush on me but I ignore it. In hindsight, I should have made her sleep in the guest bedroom. So I tell my girlfriend the day after when we are calling (she was in the USA on vacation and I was still in the place we both live) she gets really upset and breaks up with me. So at first, we are both really mad. her because of what happened and me because nothing happened between me and that girl and I thought I was just being a good guy. Eventually, we started talking again as friends. We both decided we would try to work things out when she gets back and see if we can get back together. She gets back and we have sex twice on Monday. She says goodbye and I think that this is it, we are getting back together. On Wednesday she tells me we need to talk and says that she loves me but she doesn't want to get together unless there is a future. We go to an international school and will go our separate ways to college unless we can figure something out. I'm upset but I basically see it as a chance for me to prove that I'm worth staying forever with. I can see myself marrying this girl so why not. On Friday we go out. A guy I considered my friend comes up to me and asks me to come to talk to him outside. He tells me he has been dating my girlfriend(ex). I AM HEARTBROKEN. I sit in the bar crying while my friends try to comfort me. I confront her about it and she confirms it and tells me that I broke her heart and this new guy was being nice to her and that's why she is dating him. after trying to stay and party for a while I can't take it anymore and cry my eyes out when I get home. She told me to call her in the morning to talk about it more because she still says that this guy is just temporary and she wants to get back together with me if we can go to college together. I call her and she doesn't pick up. It turns out that she is sleeping at his house. she was awake until 6 am having sex with him and is now too sleepy to talk to even though she told me to. Eventually, we talk and everything is unveiled. After that Monday where we had sex she kissed him that night and started dating him a day after. On Wednesday I saw her naked ((no sex) and on Thursday again. They had had sex 3 times already. I know that they were broken up but it felt like cheating. It was so soon after and we were seriously talking about getting back together. I went over to her house that day to actually talk to her without the guy knowing. We had a really great day together and we really connected like the first time we dated. I told her she needed to let me know by the next night what her decision was. Either get back together with me. we can figure out college together and marry eventually. Or stay broken up because I can't do the 2 months seeing her with someone else. So she called me today and told me she doesn't want to get back together because she doesn't want to get her heart broken again. She will only get together with me if it 100% certainty that its gonna be forever (college acceptance, financially viable, other stuff). I told her that it breaks my heart and that I can't really do it for that long. She says that it won't be that long to find out only like a week or two. I accept but I ask her to basically not be romantically involved with anyone until we know what is happening between us. She says that she is really growing as a person from being together with this guy and that it will make our relationship better in the end if she can improve as a person. My question is what do I do? I really love this girl but she is breaking my heart. I have no idea what I should do because I miss her every day and any time I think of her I cry. I can't stand seeing her with this guy. Do I tell her that I need an answer now or am I being too selfish if I say that? I know this is all really highschool drama shit but I need some advice.",19Jan2020,1

446,"My boyfriend (20M) and I (20F) are having to go our separate ways... we planned on getting married in the near future and so much more.. 

He’s been a bit lost, we moved in together and god we loved that time together but we bullshitted around and his parents weren’t happy that we weren’t making progress. He finally found his purpose and wants to go into the military. Which I initially thought I’d be waiting around for him until he come back from training and proposes to me. 

He went to his parents house and discussed going into the military and I told him before he left jokingly “don’t let your dad convince you into breaking up with me” but I think he did get convinced... 

He came back and explained he’s so excited and devastated, because he’s found his way and has to do it on his own. He went on about how his dad is making him come back home and getting him a trainer for the next 3 months and that he would have to cut contact with me so he can focus on being the best soldier he could be. He explained it as this, “if I’m out on the field worrying about you on the outside, those on the inside are depending on me to help defend them. I could get someone killed if I’m not paying attention and my head is somewhere else thinking about you.”

I didn’t fight back, I just cried. I agreed. I am shattered. We are the most in love couple you could ever imagine. He’s my absolute best friend, we don’t lie, we don’t cheat, we’re extremely loyal to each-other, and we certainly tell each-other exactly what’s going on, straight like it is. 

I’m so happy for him, I know he needs this. I just can’t stop crying. I cried all day yesterday. We’re spending our last few days together before he moves back home. I just want to make it the best it can be but I’m so emotional because it feels like my world is dying. My absolute best friend in the world will be gone.. 

It makes it even harder because he didn’t cheat, he didn’t lie, he never did anything to ever hurt me. I just have to let him go. We live in Mississippi in an apartment. He’s moving back to Louisiana, and I’m having to move to Florida back with my parents.. all my furniture, my cats, my little family I have created are going to be gone. I can’t even take my cats with me to my parents. Those are my fucking children.. I also have to sell everything. I’m having to restart.. I wish I could afford bills on my own. 

He did tell me when he gets out he plans on getting back in touch to see how we feel, and maybe we will end up together. He told me he wouldn’t have let me go if he could have it any other way. I just want this to be easier. I feel like I’ve failed. I love this man so fucking much, it makes me so defeated. I’m currently laying next to him, watching him sleep for one of the last times.. crying my eyes out because this man is everything I love and everything to me. I know we’re going to be hung up on each-other for years.. I wish this could be different..


How do I make this easier? How do I do this on my own? How do I move on, when I know both of us don’t want to move on from one another? 

TL;DR- my boyfriend is leaving me to go back home and I just want to make this as easy as possible",19Jan2020,1

453,"I am 24(female) and it is currently 5am and I am up because I cannot seem to pull myself apart from horrifying thoughts regarding my dad(63). 
When I was younger, my dad was extremely aggressive towards everyone in the family. My family consists of me, my sister(35), my brother(30), and my mom(57). I am going to share a story that took place when I was in 6th grade. My mom and sister flew to New York to attend her sisters son wedding. Everyone was invited but I think due to the travel cost, not all of us were able to make the trip. Anyway, my sister returned a couple of days sooner than my mom. The evening my mom came home turned out to be the beginning of seeing my dad as someone I was scared of. My dad and sister went to pick my mom up from the airport and I stayed home to make sure it was nice and clean for when she returned. My mom walks in the house full of tears. She sits on the chair in the kitchen and shes crying quietly. My dad was going off on her about going to New York. And looking back now, he was so petty and kept stabbing her for someone so normal to do, only because he is a miserable person. He said extremely unpleasant things to her. Along with the screaming, there was so much of slamming and banging cabinet doors. It scared me. He was throwing things in the kitchen and just kept screaming at my mom. I was hiding in my room so scared for her life. It was midnight on a school night and I was shaking in my bed because I didnt know if my mom was safe and I was too scared to go check on her. I feel like such a coward for this. We had a landline at the time, and one of the phones happened to be in my room. I called this lady who lived down the street and told her I was scared of what was going on at home. I dont think she wanted to get involved and just said everything will be okay and to try to get sleep. Eventually, it quieted and everyone went to sleep. I was exhausted the next day at school and scared. My dad was silent for days. My mom was clearly hurt by the things my dad had said. I was scared of his presence. He was so aggressive in his tone. I cant even explain the severity of this because I lack the words to express how it came off. The thing is, later on, my sister shared things with me about how my dad physically hurt my mom. It was so hard for me to take this in and I didnt doubt it. I've seen my dad throw a mug at my mom. I've seen him beat my brother with his skateboard. I've seen him get drunk with a friend and break all the glasses and dishes in our kitchen. The way he has yelled at all of us and made us feel, is just as equally traumatizing. In 2019, I made the decision to be a pilot, and he made it clear that I will fail because I am not smart enough. This week, there has been tension at home. My mom told me hes been yelling at her and then stopped talking completely. Shes not really sure what the problem is this time but I can see it hurts her. I do still live at home and unfortunately, right now, I feel the way I did when I was in 6th grade, where his presence scares me and that he may physically hurt someone. He has not gotten physical with any of us for many years now, but for some reason, right now I am scared that he might again. Maybe, and I hope, it's just the fear, but what if it starts back up again? I am ready to take my mom and move into a condo with her...however... my parents come from a different mindset and I dont think she'd walk away as she hasnt thus far. And I solely believe it is because of the culture she and my father were raised in. Unfortunately, they are accustomed to that culture, and I dont think they will change their beliefs and ways of resolution at this point. 

I guess I really needed to let this out somewhere since I havent been able to fall asleep for a few hours now... 

I know this story may not seem so bad to some, but it is what is primarily lingering on my mind right now, and I do not feel ready to get into greater detail about some of the awful events that took place.",19Jan2020,1
454,"i made a different account because one of them uses reddit

so i have two friends that started dating earlier this month, so their relationship is still new to them and their pda is very overwhelming. i know that theyre excited and happy to be together but it gets very annoying when they insist they want to come over and spend time with my boyfriend and i and they spend the whole time doting on each other and ignoring us. we just had a sleep over and they spent the entire time snuggling and flirting two feet away from me and they ignored me pretty much 90% of the time. i gave up eventually and just started playing video games and they almost didnt notice. 

i feel guilty that im annoyed by all their affection towards each other, but they never ignored us like this before they got together and we would all hang out as friends? why cant they hang out and be normal now and then be lovey dovey when they hang out on their own time? in the three years theyve been hanging out with the bf and i theyve only seen us kiss once and we make sure to never focus on each other especially if we invite them over to hang out because we think its rude to do that. (i feel its also important to mention that friends knew the bf and i while we were still going through our puppy love phase too and we were never this intense with it)

ive tried to subtly tell them that theyre making us uncomfortable by “complaining” about how my aunt (same age as me) used to invite me over  to her house and then just make out with her boyfriend and ignore me for him and about how that hurt my feelings that theyd ignore me like that and my friends agreed that it was rude and then immediately ignored me to start flirting and massaging each other.

how do i ask them to tone it down? its not like i expect them to act like theyre not together and excited about it, i dont mind a little bit of cuddling and maybe a kiss sometimes, thats whatever. its the cuddling, petting, moaning, flirting, and blatant ignoring that gives me half a mind to dump a bucket of water on them. should i just avoid hanging out with them until they chill out a bit?

i love the two of them dearly and im very happy that theyre together because they make a great match and it really breaks my heart thinking about not being able to hang out with them anymore because of this :(

tldr; my friends got together and wont stop flirting with each other and ignoring me when we hang out and i dont know how to ask them to calm down

(Viridian's method)
Currently I'm using the method of mixing turpentine, a bit of my own blood, and holy water. A small glass enough to banish smaller interdimensional beings but not larger ones.

(MasterGEEZ's method)
The other method can banish larger interdimensional beings but at the cost of a part of one's self being ""sacrificed"" to the entity. Frankly this method is too risky, ended up with a hospital stay over it among other bs (sorry MasterGEEZ I appreciate the advice though)",19Jan2020,1

468,"Disclaimer: the root of this is that I had a brief relationship that I thought I had to break off at that moment to avoid more hurt later. This was a TERRIBLE, thoughtless decision that I take the utmost responsibility for. I consider it by far the biggest mistake of my life. I am not attempting to justify that mistake in any way. This whole thing started over something that was my fault. 

&amp;#x200B;

In essence, the friend group that became my only one recently (we're all in our first year at university) have not known me very long and a large number would not say they know me well at all. The girl who I was in the brief relationship with is a childhood friend of the girl who thinks I am a psychopath (her own words). However, while I take the utmost responsibility for my mistakes, I am NOT a predator, I am NOT a psychopath and I genuinely liked this girl and care for her an immense amount. Anyone who has known me for a while can attest that I am absolutely the opposite of anyone that would use another person in a way that is being alleged. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, the childhood friend of the girl has essentially attempted to persuade my friend group (I don't know exactly how many people she has spoken to but I know it's at least the two people I've spoken to since the incident) that no matter how I come across, it's an act and I am a psychopath. Now, I live with some of these people. I've been utterly TERRIFIED to go into our kitchen for over a week. Thankfully, I have had wonderful support from a couple of members of the flat who know everything and have not turned against me, but it feels like an impossible task persuading my friends that I'm not faking, I'm a genuinely caring person who made a decision they thought was right but was a serious misjudgement that I now fully acknowledge and have reflected on.

&amp;#x200B;

The girl in question (whom I hurt by breaking things off in the way I did) has been to see me and is far less angry (though I would fully understand if she was). She said she didn't know whether to believe her friend at first but is now somewhat confident I'm not a psychopath (if I read her words right). I still, however, feel I have lost all my friends permanently because this is something that's so hard to PROVE. Any nice thing, any evidence against me being some crazy psycho is something a psycho could do to fake being nice. I haven't been in this group long so they haven't had a chance to properly know me, and now I feel hopelessly sad and lonely. I know I deserved anger and more for my original mistake. But I am not what I'm terrified my new friend group thinks I am. I have no idea what to do. If you read all this, thank you SO much :)",19Jan2020,1

471,"I (16) am FTM transgender, I came out June 21, 2019. I pass pretty well considering I already have a pretty high level of testosterone. Anyways, all my friends, their parents, and strangers/cashiers/random ass people just automatically assume i'm a cis guy. My parents are very religious, even lived with the Amish for several years and had an amish wedding. Shit with my family is VERY toxic and complicated, they are now separated and a divorce is moving forward (my mom turned mentally ill and VERY abusive to our family, but particularly me ((even before i came out))). Nobody in my immediate family supports me (brother, dad, mom)

I live with my dad (46) and brother (17)  now. Neither call me my name (Cameron) or he/him, even though ANYBODY that doesnt know me just calls me he/him even AFTER i talk (again, high testosterone, aka already pretty deep voice). It doesnt help I live in Georgia, USA. 

They have both made it very clear im making a mistake i will regret greatly. Its really fucked me up. Ive had such a long history of abuse (physical, sexual, AND psychological), rape, and so many mental health issues due to that. I was a heavy cutter from 6th grade through 9th (11 y/o to 15 y/o) and attempted suicide over 30 times during that span (flat lining/heart stopping 9 out of those times).

Since ive come out, i stopped cutting completely. Im genuinely HAPPY for the first time in over a decade (literally considering my first major trauma outside my family happened when I was 6). 

Since I dont have a mom anymore, and ive always been really close with my dad and brother, especially when i was younger, it has really messed me up. Lately ive been reconsidering everything. I even emailed multiple conversion camps and ""reconstructive"" therapists. I dont care if it makes me happy. I dont care if it gives me a will to live. i literally DONT FUCKING CARE at this point. I just need my dad and brothers support. 

Anyways, the advice part, is how i can transition back into a girl fully before getting to the point where i want to kill myself so I can at least be accepted for a bit? and how do i deal with the depression and shit that comes with it?

473,"I feel like I’m dying. Everything in my life is falling apart. My husband and I were already occasionally (it’s expensive) going to counseling for marriage problems. He’s made some bad choices that have made our life hell and we are working though them together (and the consequences of them).  We are pregnant (27 weeks). We are struggling financially. We’ve been really responsible and careful working extra and saving up, but new things are coming up to just push us over the edge. Last week I went to the ER for a blood clot in my leg. Had to spend $300 for a months worth of blood thinners, and have to do that for next couple of months at least. Every day I have to inject myself twice with the blood thinners, and I have a big fear of  needles. Every injection feels like an assault.  I was told I cannot have the natural birth I have been dreaming of and my birth center told me I have to transfer out to a hospital. So now I, who was comfortable and safe in my support system at the birth center, and being kicked out when I am only 3 months away from delivering. I, who am terrified of hospitals, am now frantically looking for a hospital to give birth in in 3 months and might be willing to accommodate my desires for a natural birth. 

In addition to all this, my husband has been suffering from a painful skin rash that we do not know the cause of and have not been able to throw a lot of money at it. But it has been getting worse and worse and the past few nights he has woken up sobbing in pain, and I have to give him ice and ibuprofen and put cream on the rashes and my heart breaks when I hear him in so much pain, but I know all we can do is survive until the end of the week when we can see the allergist (we finally decided to spend the money on an appointment). He doesn’t know how he is going to be able to hold down a job and finish school (he is doing both right now) with this ongoing pain, and we desperately need him to keep working to survive, especially with the baby coming.

I have so much anxiety, even though for most of my life I’ve been a pretty chill person. I’ve been getting panic attacks at least a couple of times a week and struggle with feeling hopeless and alone. I feel like I can’t even show all of my sadness and despair I feel openly with my husband, my closest relationship, because I don’t know if he can handle the stress of my emotions on top of everything else.

I’m really worried about my mental health. I’m worried about my husband too. I am worried how this will affect my baby. I am worried that I’m at risk for depression once the baby comes. I’ve thought of going to our counselor for 1-1 help but sessions cost $90 and there is no way I can afford that with an semblance of regularity like I need. I have no one to talk to and feel pretty lonely and drowning, but I know I can’t neglect getting help for myself.

What a girl to do? Advice appreciated.",19Jan2020,1

For reference, I’ll be staying in hotels and carrying a rucksack from city to city, I’ll have a backpack to carry around day to day. The goal is to travel light.

I got frustrated and allowed my emotions to get the better of me whilst I was at college and damaged some of the schools property. the property is easily $1000-$2000. I feel horrible and want to tell someone but I'm worried It will get really serious. Like the police will get involved or I'll get kicked ot of my course.

477," Im 21, male. Last night my father told me he is going to put my name under a hefty 4 million worth of estate(mostly land) soon as im the only son in the family. I know normally anyone would be extremely happy about this. But truth to be told, i worked for a few years after my high school and im just planning to start my college this year. I suffered depression from time to time so my career up until now is not that great. I got not much experience nor good connection in this society...Also up until now my parents have been babysitting me too much...They pay for my insurance and everything...

He told me this and that, i need to renew this and that or else bla bla bla...so much stuff and i need to remember those stuff. im just genuinely overwhelmed by all of that, the pressure is too much. Not to mention, the estate worth will rise too...

Im not planning to get married or having a child so, what do i do if im old or im dead?? All of it just go to the government or some stranger? I got so much question i dont even know what to do or ask anymore...Im always hoping to get rich but then the wish come true and now i cant believe how stress it will be...I just want to live a simple life...

But for now all i know is, i need to get out of my comfortable zone and live independently but how? What to do with those inheritance? How?

Since i got no good connection in this society or good career, imagine working as a normal white collar with low wages and my boss or someone just take advantage of my inheritance or what not. Im afraid...Those inheritance will just go to waste on me...

Also sorry if what im saying doesnt make any sense because i really dont know much about this, im confused...sorry...",19Jan2020,1

480,"From a young age, I’ve always loved animals. However, it was never something that I really wanted to pursue as a career; I just love animals. I always knew I wanted to go into something art-related. In high school, I put all my effort into art courses and spent my last two HS years focusing on the school yearbook. On the side, I was the leader for my school’s environment club, running events, projects, meetings, etc. And outside of school, I joined a summer environmental sustainability camp. These things were just for fun, as I really love animals and the environment, but I mostly put my focus into art/design. 

Now, I’m in university studying graphic design. I used to want to be an artist, but I sort of lost my passion for it and instead found a passion for design instead. I’m 2 years into uni, and ever since it began, I’ve had this feeling like I just don’t belong here. Through first year, I felt like nothing was interesting, but I figured it was just that case for all first-years. Now that I’m almost done my second year, feeling so drained because I just can’t find enjoyment in anything I learn/make, and I don’t think I’m really skilled or passionate in this area anymore. I just haven’t found joy or passion in this at all, and I cannot see a future for myself in this industry/path. As a result, I've been feeling really depressed and stuck for quite a while now. I’ve begun questioning my life choices. 

A while ago, I started watching Maya High, a Twitch streamer who often does livestreams with animals. She studies Animal Science at Cal Poly, I believe, and I’ve fallen in love with watching her streams. I’ve related to her love and passion for animals, and I’ve felt envious of her life around animals all the time. Animals are one of the very few things that still bring joy into my life. So I’ve been doing a lot of research into Animal Science, and now I’ve been feeling incredibly conflicted. 

Throughout high school, I didn’t really like sciences. I didn’t dislike them either, but I was just more of an arts/English kind of person. I put little effort into my science courses, and by senior year, I wasn’t even taking any science courses. I’ve always been a straight A student and very fast learner, but having little experience and knowledge in science, I don’t know how I would fare if I were to drop everything and pursue Animal Science at a uni. Plus, this would just be a **BIG/RISKY** change. I’ve spent the last many years moving in one direction and doing everything around art/design, but this would be a turn in a completely different direction. 

I’m also not in the best spot financially speaking either, so finances would take a big hit if I were to choose this new path. And there aren’t many great Animal Science courses in Canada (where I’m from), so if I really want to find a good school, I might have to end up looking internationally, taking an even larger hit to my finances. Additionally, what if I realize that Animal Science isn’t right for me either? What if I end up becoming more stressed and drained and lifeless through years of science courses that I had never prepared for? 

I don’t really know where to go from here. I’ve been trying to stick through with my graphic design degree, but I just don’t feel right in this direction anymore. I’m stuck, and I don’t know what to do.",19Jan2020,1

I met my friend 3 years ago and despite living on different continents we talked to each other daily. He has helped me accept who I am and has helped me embrace different sides of my personality that I had suppressed for years. I found out that he died through his mother who told me the whole story. After he and his brother got into a fight, his brother shoved him and as a result, broke his nose. An ambulance got called and he was brought to the hospital. Just after arriving at the hospital, my friend got attacked by a stranger who stabbed him several times with a knife before running off and he was later caught by the police. Once inside the hospital, the doctors couldn't save him and he died on the operation table.

483,"I'm currently in my junior year of high school and the stress of it is starting to get to me. I'm under constant pressure because I feel like the only way to validate myself in the eyes of my parents and others, is through academic achievements. They only ever seem genuine with their pride in me when I do well academically. I had a few years where I didn't care about my grades because I had bigger things to worry about, but those settled down and I improved, but now there's the added pressure of keeping my grades at the level they're at now. 

I have hobbies I'd like to work on, I'm learning guitar, I started making cakes recently, there's a video game I'd like to get good at too, and these are things I don't want to give up, but the stress from school transfers to everything else and I don't have enough time to do everything. It's like I can't achieve one thing without having to sacrifice another. My parents also expect me to get a 1500+ on the SAT and have helped buy prep material, but honestly speaking I don't care about that gosh darn exam, I just want to be able to relax and do things I enjoy for more than one freaking day. I keep getting pushed into competitions by my school, and my holidays are spent preparing for them, and I'm always afraid of my grades dropping. My weekends are just spent sleeping.

I feel like I'll be a huge disappointment if I don't get into a good university, but I know I'll hate it if I do, I know I don't even want to go, I don't even know what I'd study because I don't like anything you'd go to university for. I feel like I'm just going to live my entire life trying to please my parents and not being able to do the things I enjoy and it's scary to me. I constantly feel like my brain is about to shut down, and like I'm losing it I don't know how my longer I can keep up until it starts affecting my physical health as well.

485,"I’ve really given things my best shot, but I just can’t do it anymore. Over the last 6 months he’s really changed. Hes stopped caring about taking care of himself, gotten much meaner, and our intimacy has taken a nose dive. We were planning a wedding, but every step of the way he made me feel awful and guilt tripped me over everything. He started insulting me and yelling at me in front of his friends and mine as well as my family for no reason. 

I can’t do it anymore. I’m only 25 and I feel like I deserve better. I do take care of myself, I just got a great new job and I graduate with my bachelors in a few months. I want to take some time to myself and rediscover who I am.

My issue is when I try to break up with him he becomes very mean. He’ll refuse to cooperate and start asking for me to pay him back for things he paid for in the relationship such as clothes, the wedding venue deposit, engagement ring, etc. He says if I don’t he’ll take me to court. Likewise, he’ll tell me that despite my name being on the lease too, that because he makes more money if we break up that he gets free reign of the house and I don’t. So basically he gets to choose what rooms are “his”. 

We do have an entire year left on the lease. I just want to do things cordially, where we split rent and share the house like adults. I do love our house so I don’t mind staying here if we can both just act like adults.

487,"I have a friend, whom I known for quite awhile now. We used to talk to each other a lot around two or three years back, but as time went on I began to notice and major shift in his personality when it came with talking to others and to me. 

It was only around a year back that I found out he suffered from major depression, his personal life has greatly affected his mental state and he said that he tried attempting suicide a number of times. 

I’ve done everything in my power to help him, from begging him to seek professional help to asking others to help talk to him as well, but he’s so damn stubborn each and every single time that it’s honestly exhausting at this point. No matter what I do, he would either say it’s pointless or respond back in anger. How am I supposed to help someone who won’t even help themselves?

He also has a tendency of forcibly pushing those that care about him away and then immediately blaming himself for it which just creates a constant negative feedback loop. Each and every single time I have been understanding towards him, but today honestly  feels like the final straw for me when he decides to cut all contact with me and basically toss me out for good over something insignificant. 

I really want to just move on from all of this and just cut ties with him as well, but a part of me feels conflicted because I know why he keeps doing it. But another part of me is fed up with him pushing aside all the help I’ve tried giving him so that he can eventually get out of the darkness that plagues his mind. He doesn’t want to change, and refuses my kindness no matter how many times I told him I would be there for him.",19Jan2020,1
488,"Okay, so here I am posting on reddit now because I have no other idea of what to do.

This past week, This girl and I have been talking a lot more than usual. Some of this is due to some shit that happened in a Snapchat group chat; someone added her in and joked to leak her year old nudes to the 20+ people in there. I didn’t think it was right so I kinda spoke up and she was texting me on the side for emotional support i guess. Since then, I’ve asked her how she was feeling the next day and such and we’ve had nice, friendly, and actual conversations since (I know she isn’t trying to avoid me with one word responses, I mean like actual conversations). 

Okay so anyway I sort of realized yesterday that I’m now thinking about her like almost ALL day long, not in a sexual way either let me clarify but I can’t quite figure it out. Now I seem to go to sleep thinking about her and wake up thinking about her. I feel like that sounds like an obsession, though I’ve made sure not to litter her with texts, we’ve had good conversations every day this week. 

But now I’m at the point where I can’t let her out of my mind. She’s kinda way out of my league too physically so yeah. I’ve thought about telling her and having her tell me to fuck off, but I’d rather not sever at least a nice friendship. Anything else I can do to kind of focus on other stuff. Not distracting myself but really just letting go of the thought.

""What if they start stalking you?"" ""I can just block them/get the police involved.""

I have two little sisters who live with my mum and I love them to death, however, in order to have a relationship with them I have to deal with my mum who is diagnosed bipolar/ borderline schizophrenic and is also a complete and utter racist. I’m mixed race and all she talks about is how “unevolved” the races I come from are and how I’m unclean and how messy my hair is (its very curly and thick, which i got from her btw!) and a bunch of other stuff. At the same time, she says I’m “different” and “beautiful” so she’s confusing me and psychologically messing with my head. She attacks me and compliments me at the same time. She accepts me for who I am but looks down on me simultaneously.

I’ve tried to keep my mouth shut whilst she attacks my identity and the people i care about because it means the world to see my little sisters for those few hours every second week or so. But i dont know how long i can do this for. I’m a medical student with alot on my plate, and I can’t take the mental pressure of her abuse, but I don’t want to let my sisters down at the same time. 

I’m afraid that one day they’ll resent me for leaving or for not being strong enough to deal with her for them, but I’m scared that I’ll lose my sanity and ability to be a good sister to them if I continue the way I’m going.

I can’t talk to them or call them or text them without her knowledge because she has a phone tracker and receives every text and call they get on their phones. 

I don’t know if I can cope with having a relationship with her anymore because she’s so toxic, but I don’t want my sisters to lose their big sister.

498,"I’m in a sort of dilemma trying to figure out if my upcoming weeklong vacation is fairly calculated between me and my 3 friends. 

My friends have asked if I want to go on vacation to North Carolina and I agreed to go. There is one 1 couple, the wife’s sister and me with a total of 4 of us. Initially when they asked if I wanted to go I agreed to it under the presumption that we split the condo rental 4 ways. They told me my share is $650 and some cents and I thought okay no problem, it may be a bit pricey as I did some math in my head and figured they must of rented a a nicer condo since the calculations seemed a bit more then I expected them to be. Fast forward to a few hours, after I agreed to go they in a round about way slipped into a conversation that this is going to be a 3 way split between the couple (counting as 1) the sister and me. 

I think this unfair as I believe it should be a fair 4 way split between 4 people. There are 3 bedrooms and perhaps that’s the metric they are utilizing. But isn’t that flawed as we are all sharing the kitchen, the living room and all other amenities? Aren’t me and the sister subsidizing the couple? Is one of the couple basically renting the condo for free?

when does being a “healer” becomes a toxic trait

always going out of my way to fix people’s problems as soon as they complain about it

she told me often a fixer mentality is a sign of codependency, that you feel you don’t have any place in the relationship unless you’re the fixer. (that shocked me tbh)

and I get that but isn’t it natural if you see someone you love hurt that you want to pull them out of that,I know enough to let them go through their own issues and journey but i also want to heal them i want to see that sad face turn into a smile it’s a very rewarding feeling I realized.

There is a particular manager that picks on my little brother. We are both in a protected class (He has schizoaffective disorder, anxiety, depression and I have Myoclonic Epilepsy as well as anxiety with depressive episodes.

I asked my brother's manager why he was sending my brother home and he all of a sudden accused me of drinking on the job. I left out of embarrassment (I wasn't drinking and they didn't breath test me or blood test me), told him he was being hostile and left with my brother since he was sent home. We came back for second sort 2.5 hours later to talk to HR but the HR person who deals with this type of stuff wasn't there.

We both went back the next day to talk to the HR lady, I wrote down what I wanted to say when it was all fresh so I wouldn't forget anything and my little brother recorded the conversation on his phone. There were a couple of things I said appertaining to how MY own manager treats people, especially a couple of teenage girls that are on my crew (he's pretty obviously unfair to them) I brought it up and she asked who my manager was, I told her, during the course of the conversation she asked me who my manager was multiple times, like as if she forgot (I've gone and listened to the recording multiple times). If other people had told her I had been drinking I assume she would have asked them who my manager was, she wouldn't have had to have asked, the only people I talked to were my manager himself and people on my crew. The reason I bring this up is it is kind of obvious she made that up, also whenever I kept bringing up that my brother's manager embarrassed me and ruined my reputation at work she kept pivoting to other things. If she had truly received sources from other people I imagine that would've been the main topic of discussion on her part, me coming in to work intoxicated is probably the best reason they could have to fire me and not risk a lawsuit.

509,"I’m 19 F currently, and I don’t think I can feel love. The only living being I truly care about is my dog. I would legitimately die for him. I’m not a cruel person — I’m kind to my friends and the people around me, and I try and consider how others feel around me. I just genuinely think I’m incapable of forming attachments or truly caring for another human other than myself.

I’ve never been romantic. I’ve dated 3 people and enjoyed their company, but even after I broke up with my girlfriend of 18 months (my longest and only semi-serious relationship), I wasn’t particularly sad. My other relationships have been the same way, where I have to — for lack of a better word — fake love, if that makes sense, even if I enjoy being around them. I don’t want a relationship at all now (I’ve been single for 2 years now), although I do like sex and one night stands. I don’t believe in soulmates, nor do I want one. I’m perfectly happy never being with someone permanently, like ever. I can literally never form an attachment with anyone. It just feels so superficial. This sounds like a terrible thing to say, but love is just so fake to me. I always have to fake it, even if I enjoy talking to them. 

I don’t love my friends, nor do I love my family. Honestly, I’m indifferent to all of them. I do care for my mom, but I don’t really love her either. If she died, I’d feel sad, but it wouldn’t affect me terribly. I can’t imagine truly grieving for her. 

I just feel like all my relationships are superficial. I don’t have a best friend or confidant, and although my friends are nice and I never feel truly lonely, I’m worried that my life is lacking somehow? 

If it helps at all, I was never abused, but I hate touch. Hugs, tickles, cuddles, etc., I never crave touch and actively avoid it. I can’t remember the last time I touched someone, and I never feel touch starved. I think I lack some empathy, but I don’t walk all over people with no remorse, so I doubt that I’m a literal psychopath. 

I have no mental health problems, and I’m fine with my life. I’m perfectly content and am not even slightly lonely, but is it an issue? Do most people feel the same, and just fake love?",19Jan2020,1
510,"I find myself often saying ""I fucking hate people."" Today I realized my negative interactions with people far outweigh my positive ones. It's having a significant impact on my wellbeing, and I'd like to talk about it.

Thing is, I'm very principled. I also grew up in a traumatizing environment. This means I have a tendency towards conflict with people. When I run into someone doing something shitty, I respond.

For example, earlier today I went to leave a fast food restaurant after getting some food. The exit path crosses the drive thru path. However, there is a sign telling cars in the drive thru not to block the driveway. Whadya know. I didn't honk, but I gave her the palms up hands, implying ""What the hell are you doing?"" She gestured back that she was stuck between two cars and couldn't move. I pointed at the sign. She got pissed and started gesturing frantically.

Yesterday I pulled into a restaurant to find a Caviar delivery driver parked in the handicapped spot. I stared at him as I walked inside. He came in while I was waiting. I said, ""You don't look disabled."" He gave me the ""No Ingles."" response. This escalated to him in the parking lot going for something in his trunk. When I didn't get scared, he started gesturing and telling me to suck his dick.

Those are bigger ones that happen less often, but these both happened pretty close together. Throw in some smaller, annoying acts like someone cutting me off in traffic or pulling out in front of me nearly causing a collision, and it equals a bad day. Lately I've been having a lot of bad days.

The pizza shop clerk didn't give me the two specific pieces of pizza that I asked for yesterday. Unfortunately, I had already tipped her. I could go on and on with examples, but I think I've illustrated my point. I often find myself saying ""People are just fucking stupid,"" or ""I really fucking hate people.""

I'm looking and asking for an alternative solution to my anger because people respond with anger rather than sekf reflection when confronted with their own ignorance.

To head off the people who are going to reply unsupportively, I hold myself to the same standard that I hold other people to. I'm nobody special, and I'm not doing anything that others can't.

But I'm tired of the public's low behavioral expectations for itself. I'm not likely to lower my standards; I'm not going to contribute to a dumbing down of society. So what can I do?

*tldr*; I find myself often saying how stupid people are and how much I hate them, and it's taking a toll on my wellbeing. So I'm looking for an alternative coping strategy.",19Jan2020,1
511,"t this point of life, i've just realised that I (26 F) am quite the bimbo idiot compared to people around me (no, really, i'm not exaggerating). 

I can't really socialise properly with people...I either get super awkward because I don't know what to say, or I overthink and am afraid to say anything. Or I get along well with them, then later be afraid that they secretly dislike me, or are angry with me for reasons that I create in my mind.

Even with the existing people I know or are friends with, conversations feel shallow. I can't seem to get deep, or make meaningful conversation. I tend to be the listener, or agree to whatever the other party says, without much input or anything to contribute from my side (i really have nothing to say). My brain usually feels blank, empty.  This results in the deep loneliness I feel.. I want to reach people, but I can't.

I can't seem to make decisions on my own. I can't even articulate my thoughts or explain things properly, which affects my interactions with people, and work as a writer (which requires me to present my work, explain stuff, and interact with other co-workers).

In fact, I think i'm slowly losing my ability to think critically (or maybe i've never had it at all). I don't really have any hobbies anymore other than looking at stuff on reddit and social media.

We have always gotten along really well and we each think each other are great people, and share practically all beliefs/values. I love her, she says she loves me but is unsure and thinks that there is something missing in our connection. We were best friends. We left on good terms and both hope to be friends when we are over it. We go to the same university and share similar social circles. Although we both really enjoyed being in the relationship, we had our differences and our relationship wasn't perfect, but is any relationship really? Her feelings come after I had a bit of personal slump for a couple months due to being overwhelmed/stressed and not feeling myself, but I have been feeling much better about this stuff more recently and have been working on myself. I wanted to try to work on the relationship, but she didn't and I respect her decision.

I know I need to move on but I can't really find any reason to not love her anymore which is making this more difficult. This is my first time having to deal with a break up. She is so wonderful and I have never really met anyone quite like her which has me wondering whether I will ever connect with someone as much as her.",19Jan2020,1
516,"Alcoholics? I'm kind drunk rn and here's the thing. I upset with the person I am.

I get drunk at every Saturday/Sunday, I hate the fact that I'm the person I've become. I know i have a lot of issues and that I need to address them like my father issues and how I cant trust people and my impulsive lying. But all of that's gonna be address later.

For breakfast I had 4.5 liter of wine and it's only 9:16 when I started writing this. I'm alone in my dorm and I know that everytime I get drunk I try and look up an ex girlfriend I had many years ago. She and I had an on and off relationship for many years and she was also my 1st girlfriend. I know she had a baby and moved far away from where she used to live but I cant remember where anymore(probably got the better) and cant find her on any social media. I dont know what I would do if I did find her. Probably just be happy to know shes getting on with life even though I've been in the mil for longer than I'd like. It kinda brought me a bit of joy know she was atleast progressing in life and maybe even happy. 

Well other than that I'm still drinking a bottle and almost done with it so add another 1.5 liters. I know this one wonderful chaotic girl who is in a relationship but o cant help but fall for her. I've grown too close to her for my comfort. I dont want to hurt anybody and I know I've done that in the past. I know I can become a Moraless person. And I hate how easy that is for me. I just want to try and keep to myself even though I'm a very social person. I know If I drive others away I have a lower chance of hurting people, but being alone hurts too.

521,"I (31 M) work with a girl. She shows a lot of interest in me. Found out she has a fiancé. She never talks about him. She tries to flirt with me a lot, hits me a lot (playfully), says double entendre a lot. I don't want to be a homewrecker so I try to just be nice but I have to admit I flirt a little bit and appreciate the attention.

At work she did something small for me and said something along the lines of 'if I have to do this (insert thing that would take 5 seconds to do) again you owe me a coffee' so I had to have her do it again and she stared at me looking serious about her 'offer' and I didn't know what to do so I just brushed it off laughing awkwardly like a dumbass lol.

I don't want to help her cheat, but idk the best way to tell her how I feel, especially in a work setting where we have almost no private time to talk, and if she wants to KEEP talking someone might come near us and listen which I don't want either. I also don't know if I should even consider going somewhere with her to talk (I'll probably have to drive us, she has no car right now) and Im not even sure if they live together, or if its okay to even get coffee with someone who is engaged at all since, personally I have always decided to never do anything even remotely close to cheating when I was in a relationship.

524,"My older cousin and his wife are calling me a narcissist and a sociopath, they laugh and smirk at me, and tell people about embarrassing things my family and I have been through. The cousin's wife rolls her eyes at me, called me stupid on several occassions, makes pouty faces at me, and had told me to change a shirt she didn't like (It was not edgy or shocking, or had any political or ideological slogans just a clean baggy black graphic tee with a classical painting on it; they just told me to change it without explaing why they disliked it). All in all, being around them is humiliating. Whenever I try to call them out for this, they call me a liar, and the wife especially thinks I'm manipulative.
At first I thought they were just joking or that it's their weird way of messing around, but then I realised my cousin's wife would get really upset with me and actually scream if I said something she disagreed with. At one point she misheard something I said and went on to berate me and call me ""privileged"" and ""ungrateful"", I was kind of at a loss as to what she meant, but then was told that she thought I wanted a career that will allow me to ""order people around and give them chores like scurrying little cockroaches."" I think that really shows their preconcived notions about me. 
  She also managed to convince my cousin that I was some kind of millitant athiest (I'm not though, lol), after which they would hound me and ask me questions about my beliefs and then follow me around with some book about Russian gulags, which I had already read, but they wouldn't take no for an answer and so gave me another book on the same topic to read. They're very obsessive for some reason, as if I were an extension of themselves.
  Like I said, they don't seem to like or respect me, but they keep asking me to come along with them on their regular outings. For background they do this whenever I come over to my aunt's on a family visit, along with my immediates. I tell them to leave me alone, you know since the best way to deal with a narcissist or a sociopath is to drop them, but they just won't budge. The way they act also shifts incredibly in any given space of time, it's just weird, honestly.
I had also talked about this with a sibling who would tell me I was overreacting, even when the wife had screamed at him the year before on several occasions, which would lead to him ranting to me about these instances. I had also confronted my mother about this, and she admitted that the cousin can be a bit of a gossip sometimes, while his wife can act out, so I don't think it's just me. 
  
  Anyway, what I wanted advice on is how I should deal with these people, as I'll be seeing them a few months later during another visit. My family forces me into these situations, since we're from a background that upholds strict family values, so just bailing isn't an option. It's messing with my head a bit, and I would appreciate some tips on how to set boundaries, as they don't seem to respect mine, and just force themselves on me, despite not really appreciating me as a person. How can I convince them that I don't need them to ""fix"" me?

531,"I need some help: 

I am 16 years old and in grade 11 So, on Monday, at lunchtime, my friend called me to the washroom and showed me his hunting knife. He asked whether I want to hold it down (keep it for a small duration of time). I said yes, and took it and put it in my pocket. After that, when I went to class, I showed my friend, A, the knife. A took a snapchat of me opening it, but then deleted it. I showed him 4 dollars, and he took it. I said, ""Give it back"" and he said to show ""S and B"" the knife. Then, I went to these two kids - S, and B. I went to them and opened the knife, but not in a way where I was threatening them. (I am 4ft tall, just to let you know). S and B then said: ""lmao bro, we didn't flinch"". I said, ""Time to get 4 dollars"". After that, I was closing it and accidentally cut myself. 

After that, the vice-principal called me down and told me that two students accused me of threatening to stab them. I told them I didn't have it: (even though it was in my pants pocket) and they emptied out my bag and locker and didn't see anything. Then, two police officers entered, and asked me whether I want to tell them where the knife is because they know that I know where the knife is. I lied to them and told them I don't know where it is, and they said that they're going to put the school into lockdown if I don't tell them. I confessed and surrendered the knife. After lying for 1 1/2 hours, I gave it. They told me they're not gonna charge me and they then sent me home. 

As they got more statements and witnesses, my mom got a phone call from the police station saying I need to come to the station on Monday.

It’s essentially just a teenage version of tinder but rebranded as a place to make friends. I personally use it as a place to make friends, but I know others who use it as tinder. So I heard about this app and started using it to become more comfortable talking to girls. And through that app I met maybe 5 people that were genuinely nice and I enjoyed talking to, so I added them on Snapchat and started talking to them more.

Now these 5 didn’t happen all at once, they sorta piled on so it wasn’t immediately overwhelming, but now it is. Again, I’m used to talking to only 5 *mayyyybe* 6-7 people at one time. I can’t handle 10. But I didn’t wanna just stop talking to any of those people on snap because they are so freaking nice and just kind and caring and I would feel like absolute shit if I did.

He still comes over every day but I've only been to his  new house once. Our families are good friends and talk about all their issues. Well his little sister got a bug bite our of nowhere and got a huge rash. After a week or two they found out they have bed bugs. They were presumably there before they moved in and the previous owners left half their furniture. My mom and dad have given them a bunch if advice and said they can sue the shity landlord and not to get the cheapest exterminator. I'm worried because my mom said she thinks they're not handling this super efficiently while we would do everything to get a hold of the situation right away. But we are more financially stable so yeah. And apparently his mom is freaking out since they just spend money on a bunch of new stuff and they were already poor and can't really afford to take care of it. My mom told me and my brother to have our friend keep his book bag outside and stay downstairs whenever he's over incase he has bugs on him. I'm worried since I love and care about him and don't want to be rude, but I also hate bug with a burning passion. I had head lice in 4th and 5th grade and it sucked. I have really thick wavy hair so it took forever for a docter to acknowledge it. I got rid of it after 2 years after I got the prescription brand. My mom knows why I'm conflicted and knows it's not his fault but were in a situation were we can't do anything about it apart from protecting ourselves.

He's going through a lot already and he's only in middle school. I'm frustrated that I can't help him. My mom is too.

Some background to the situation at hand...
Me, my best friend (BFF), my current boyfriend (BF) and his brother (BFB) all met at a government youth programme. My BFF started dated BFB as soon as the programme ended and it’s been around 5 1/2 years. I started dating my BF almost 4 years ago now. We’ve grown into our 20’s together and been through so much as a group. I currently live with BF and BFB, along with 4 other boys in a student house at our uni. BF is at a different uni around 2 hours away but usually spends most of the time up at our house instead of at uni. 

At the start of 2020 BF told me that BFB had told him a secret but he couldn’t tell anyone. I thought perhaps BFB was going to propose but in fact BF suggested the opposite. BFB was going to break up with BFF at the end of January. Now I was thoroughly shocked. It’s not like in the past BFF hadn’t told me that she wanted to break up with BFB or be in a committed relationship with another of our friends, but recently she was once again besotted with good ol’ BFB. With the knowledge that BFB was going to break up with her as he had fallen out of love I suggested to BFF that when he next visited her at uni she should romance him and make it special as I knew she didn’t want it to end. But I didn’t say why.

BFB went to visit this Monday but I was assured by BF that nothing was going to happen. Thus I went about my regular week before uni activities, i.e. clubbing at my favourite LGBTQ+ joint. On Friday morning/ Thursday night I got a text when I exited the club (as it’s underground and thus no signal) saying BF had just been broken up with. Once again I was shooketh, along with being drunk and slightly drugged up.

I’m think i was just really hoping he’d realise he was in love with her and it was just a wobble. As previously mentioned we’ve been through so much together and I’m honestly just so upset (I know I probably don’t have the right to be). To me they fit so perfectly together. 

I don’t know how to comfort BF from afar and don’t know what to say to her. At one point she asked me if I already knew about what might happen as she knew BF and I told her no as I knew it would break our friendship. Not only this but she now hates BF as he is related to BFB and knew about it.

I’m just feeling guilty and upset and don’t know how to proceed. 

TLDR- best friends boyfriend broke up with her. I live with him. I’m dating his brother and best friend now hates him. I didn’t warn best friend as I already knew as I lied to her about it. I don’t know what to do or how to feel except sad.",19Jan2020,1
545,"Kindof got in trouble with my parents. Somehow everything happened at once.
Basically I’m in trouble for multiple things.

First, I dented my mom’s rim and made her other tire flat, which pissed them both off and they want me to pay for both tires, a new rim, alignment, and any other damages. (I hit a curb pretty hard) but there doesn’t seem to be any other damage besides the wheels.

Also, the found paraphernalia in my room and she had caught me before and told me not to do it again. And my stepdad saw my window was cracked open and they thought I was sneaking out (I normally would, but it was cracked open because I had to sneak back into my house because I left my key at home)

And I went over to my girlfriends house in the middle of the night and my brother snitched on me on accident.

So basically they’re really mad and want me to quit my job (I’ve been working there for hardly a week (fast food), and pay for the tires and stuff. And I’m grounded. But when I asked how am I supposed to pay for the tires without a job she told me I have 1,000 dollars in my savings account. Which is true, but that was supposed to be for college or around that age if I need something. I know it’s not much but it sure as heck sounds a lot better than 0$.

The rest of my family (like the relatives) is still living there and my mom feels guilty for living a decent life here while her family still struggles with money. She sends money regularly to her sister since she's old and can't get a job anymore.

My cousin has two kids and both her and her husband don't have a degree. She woks as a retailer and her husband i don't really know, just small jobs here and there. My mom helped them many times before: sending money to build a little restaurant ... didn't work (idk exactly but my other cousin said they wanted to make it too big but couldn't keep up); sending money to buy a car so he could work as a taximan ... apparently the car keeps getting broke and he doesn't drive well so they had to resell it; helping them get a little shop ... didn't work because many concurrence or something. And my mom keeps sending money every holidays, birthdays and such. 

Now nothing seems to work, i wanted to know guys if you have any ideas on how to help them without sending money constantly. I want to find a way like giving them the tools and then it's up to them.

561,"I need advice.

My (13F) classmate (13F) was caught sending nudes to her boyfriend (13M).

First, a little backstory. My classmate is known to be very... hmm... I'll just say that she is known to be very racy. She has grown to be quite curvy and physically mature. She has used it to her advantage. she has been with 3 or 4 different guys in some very intimate relationships and has been voted the most likely to get pregnant by my friends and I. But, like anyone, she isn't a total \*female dog\*. Sure, she does stuff for pity, and attention, but she is still a good person inside, I think.

She keeps doing YOLO's on Snapchat and everyone says that they saw the nudes that she sent to her boyfriend. Over and over and over again. When someone asks a question on YOLO, you don't have to post it. But she does every time. I told my dad, and he said that it is actually a criminal offence for a minor to send nudes here (we live in Canada). So, I did some research, and he is right. It wouldn't have been illegal if she hadn't sent it to anyone. It was illegal when she sent it to her boyfriend (now ex), but I am sure that happens all the time. It became worse when other people saw it.

I also forgot to mention that she tells people that she would send them a picture of her bra on Snapchat if they send her a picture of their abs. That could lead to other stuff...

I just want her to be careful. I am the kind of person who knows they have an obligation for the rest of humanity, and I can't not help someone.

She knows that I know when things go wrong; I am known as Mom at school. She once took me bathing suit shopping because she wanted one that she could wear in front of her brother (10M) and his friends. I like to think that she trusts me with serious stuff, even though we aren't friends.

I feel like I should talk to her. All it would take is one conversation from me to prevent her situation from going from bad to worse.

My boyfriend and I moved in with his mom about 4 months ago due to financial reasons (and he plans on taking over the mortgage in the summer). Things are pretty chill around here most of the time, and I like living here for the most part, but lately his mom has gotten a little *too* overbearing. 

By overbearing, I mean that she really tries to parent me, which gets under my skin... if I wanted to be patented I would have moved in with my own mom. Some examples of this are that she will text and tell us to bring our dirty dishes or garbage upstairs. Or she’ll talk to me like I have no clue how to exist in the real world such as “make sure you plug in your car tonight” “make sure you do this... or don’t do that like *that*”.

569,"My dad started his own business years ago doing income tax preparation. After graduating college I decided to work for him. I never planned it and it wasn't my dream job, but since I didn't have another good plan that's what I decided to do. I don't mind the work. The best thing about it is I work really hard 3 months a year, and then the rest of the year is very minimal so I am basically like a stay-at-home mom the rest of the year. I can schedule any clients during my son's therapy hours most of the time so I don't have to worry about arranging care for him while I work after tax season.

My husband works in a different field entirely, but about 6 years ago he was able to arrange it with his job that during tax season he could work 3 days a week doing taxes. We did this because my dad was getting older and he wanted to stop working. This has been great because he still makes about the same at his main job, plus he gets paid for working for the business during tax season. He also gets to retain his full time status at his main job so we can keep our health insurance and other benefits through that job, which is at a large national company. He has decent benefits and the health insurance is affordable.

The problem is I feel eventually we have to make a decision to either go full steam ahead with the business with him quitting his main job or we need to close the business and let him pursue better opportunities with his company. He had been in a management position before and stepped down so he could do taxes. Because he was on the bottom level of mangement his pay didn't decrease that much when he stepped down and now a few years later it is about the same as it was after yearly raises. Plus he makes money from our business. But I think about how he could be moving up in his company and slowly getting bumped up in salary. It has been 6 years now of him doing taxes and not being able to move up in his main job because of it. 

Right now we both get paid a salary from the business. It hasn't increased since we started because the business can't afford to pay us more. My dad was taking a very small salary and he passed away last summer. Since he passed we have let that money stay in the business. My mom gets paid also but in reality she doesn't work for the business anymore. She gets paid about the same as I do. I know this is morbid, but my dad and mom have always talked about how my husband and I can do well for ourselves with the business after they pass. Which is true, after my mom passes away I could double my salary immediately. If we closed the business and my husband moved up in his company, he would probably never make as much as we would if we ran the business and you take into account my mom's salary. But he could maybe make as much as we do now, but it would take a few years to get to that level.

The other complication is we have one son who is 6. He has autism. During tax season we are able to arrange it so my husband drops him off at therapy in the mornings. My mom and mother-in-law take turns watching him in the afternoon and evenings until we get home. My mom is 70 and my MIL is 68. My MIL is in great health and my mom is in decent health. However one day they will either be in poor health or will pass away and won't be able to watch him for us. Since he is nonverbal and has a developmental delay, I can't just put him in an after school program or bring him to my office to hang out quietly. If we closed the business I would be able to stay home with him, and maybe I could find a part time or even full time job during school hours to make a little extra money while my husband tries to move up in his company. If we decided to have my husband work for the business full time, one of us could shorten our hours and be with him after school. (Realistically, that would be my husband.)

I know this ended up being really long, but I am trying to lay it all out there. The facts are, one day we could make a good deal of money if we decide to keep the business once my mom passes away. We would have to pay for our own health insurance though which could eat up a big chunk of this extra income. On the other hand in the meantime my husband is holding himself back from promotions at his other job and my mom could live 20 more years. My mom could survive without the income from the business if we decided to close it. Also we have the problem of having to have someone watch our son as long as we are both working the way we are. Another thing is we would both like to have another kid but haven't done so because then our moms would have to watch 2 kids and we feel it would be too hard for them. It sucks because all of this only affects 3 months of the year but it is still a problem.

Our lease is up for our business location in 2 and a half years. I feel we need to make this decision before we renew another lease. My husband and I have talked about this for years now and we still don't know what to do. Any advice is much appreciated. What would you do in this situation?",19Jan2020,1

At the same time where we kinda ended things but still had a bit of contact I met a person who I was really interested in, the first impression of him was basically all I searched for. We hooked up but i had feelings for the other person who turned out to be a good friend of him, also we had a conversation and clarified that neither of us is looking for a relationship rn. A few weeks later he got into a relationship and only then somebody told me he really was interested in me, since then I couldn't stop thinking that I made a bad mistake. (Everything between june-august 2019)
Fast forward to now he asked me to hang out and we hooked up again and I just can't stop thinking about him etc. But I know that he still was with his gf on Sylvester so the breakup gotta be fresh. Also I think this time he isnt interested in me? We don't really text and since we hooked up last week we didn't meet. 
So I'm asking myself if I just should take the chance and ask him to hang out, also was thinking about asking him if he would be down to drive somewhere with me as i would actually love to visit another city, or if i should let him be and wait because it's just to early and he would break off the contact altogether if I ask because he may be scared that I want more from him while he doesn't.

initially i felt awful but the more i thought about it the more i was angry. they had 3 months to give me criticism and tell me what to do better in that time. they even admitted that they only actually noticed it in the past month. they basically said that i'm great one on one with customers but my multitasking isn't great and can lead to some people being neglected, which is fair and i don't communicate with staff as well as i should. 

i realize that they can do whatever they want to me legally but i'm asking from a moral standpoint i guess. after that shift where i was pulled aside, i IMMEDIATELY improved in what they asked me aside (and they said so themselves) from one apparently big fuck up where i basically scanned the wrong item and they had to email for stock. which i said my bad, owned up, etc. 

i dislike how i was given an ultimatum to improve immediately when they had months to give me criticism and i had specifically asked for criticism. how can they expect me to naturally improve something over months that i am not even aware that i need to improve and THEY didn't even notice or say anything about? i also feel like the instances they stated were not exactly as they seemed. i definitely agree that i needed to improve.

She and I started working around the same time just 1 week difference. At one point long before becoming a manager she and I were talking about our pay. She told me hers and she just assumed that I made the same but I got $.50 because I negotiated before accepting the offer. I never confirmed my pay with her, I just let her assumed. I believe that she just accepted the pay that was offered at the time. A week ago I found out that she got the same raise as me, making our pay difference of $.50 still. I am deeply hurt and disappointed that he would give her the same raise, when she doesn't have half the stress or the workload of a manager. I feel that he should've just given her the position if this is what he was going to end up doing anyways. I have implemented new processes and procedures on how we do things, I often stay late at the office to make sure that numbers are correct and ready for him, I am cleaning up the system and auditing several reports because of overpay that eventually the company will get back as credits etc.  I definitely am dedicated to my work and have gone above and beyond. It has been 4 months since I got the promotion and with this new information I believe that I have to renegotiate my pay. I do not think it's fair that I get only $.50 more for all my work and effort when the only thing she does is what I tell her to do. 

By all means I am not saying that she doesn't deserve the raise that she got because she does, we both have worked hard when we were in the same position. I just don't think that my raise is fair now that my position has changed. 

I was thinking of renegotiating in March because it'll be the 6 month mark as a manager, except that I cannot stop thinking about this and so I have decided to do it tomorrow instead. I already have a number in mind and if I don't get it I am willing to walk away. 

I know that employers will always pay the least amount of money that they can get away with and I do get paid way below the average in my city.

578,"I am a people-pleaser.

I have lived my entire life being the ""mediator"" between my friends who don't get along, and the guy who everyone is cool with. Half of it is because I try to be open-minded and empathetic to everyone's feelings and wants. The other half is because I **hate having enemies.** 

The thought of someone hating my guts or someone disliking me makes my stomach turn. It sinks, I get anxious, I can't stop thinking about the person who I wronged. Why? I'm guessing it's because it feels like it became a failing to make things right on my part. Like if I did X or Y, I could become friends with that person.

I don't even need to *like* the person necessarily, I just don't want them to dislike me, as selfish as it is. I have done well so far because I am agreeable, but...

I can't spend my whole life without a **single enemy.** I can't make everything better because some people are just awful and unreasonable. There **will** be times where I just have to live with my mistakes and the things I may or may not have ruined because of them.

I want to learn how to do that, though. I'm sick of dwelling in my head for half a day whenever I've wronged people. I'm sick of being a pushover with no conviction because I don't want to hold firm and strong opinions out of fear of pushing away a potential ally. I'm weak and so used to fading into a crowd of people who like me that I'd have no idea what to do if people suddenly hated me. My anxiety will increase a shitton because some person on the internet is talking shit about me to other people.

**I just want to be genuinely okay in my own skin.** I want to be okay with my good, learn from my bad, and more importantly **I want to be cool with the idea that I won't always make a good impression, and I won't always have people like me.** I want to learn to not care about what the average person thinks of me. My anxiety, my submissiveness, my ""pleaser"" attitude - I'm so sick of it all. Please someone, anyone, tell me how I can approach changing this about myself.",19Jan2020,1

581,"So I met this girl few months ago, she was really nice at first but after few weeks of knowing her she changed slowly. To the worse. She’d constantly tell me about her “problems” that don’t even make sense (I believed her at first but then she started telling things that are hard to believe that they happened to a 14 year old girl..?) I’ll tell you one of the things that pissed me the heck off: so one day she came to school crying, I tried to ask her what’s wrong, tried to make her smile, but she didn’t tell me anything nor did she smile. I got worried about her but decided to give her some space and go sit with other girls because the teacher told me so.
Then the popular kids (who she wanted to be friends with so bad) they came up to her and asked her what’s wrong and she told them every-effing-thing about why she was crying. They weren’t as close as I was to her but she told them anyway! Kinda seemed like attention seeking..
She likes drama and playing off as a victim ALL the time. I hate it. I don’t like her. She constantly texts me and I literally missed my life since she keeps texting me 24/7 which is another problem 🤦🏻‍♀️
I don’t know what to do, I’m afraid I’m gonna hurt her feelings or something 
I’m also afraid that she will talk sh#t about me and plays the role of the victim to the class and make me seem like a bad person.. Idk why I think that like my class, all of the students, they like me and I’ve always been super kind and nice to them so I don’t think they’d believe her but I’m still afraid..",19Jan2020,1

A little bit of context about myself. I'am from Eastern Europe and I live relatively good life without worries and hardships because I was lucky enough to have caring and relatively successful parents. Also I have 2 brothers who can I trust and an older sister who can I turn for advice and lovely little sister. I'am currently put a pause on my IT/electronics studies and found a man who works in IT and is ready to guide me through IT world.

So getting straight to the point. I've been unhappy and unproductive for 9 months now. My studies suffered and I took a gap year eventually, because I couldn't do assignments on time or at all. The man, who agreed to guide me in learning programming also sent me some exercises/tutorial to learn from. But I cannot and I don't even know if I want to sit and do things I need to.

My assumption is I lived too much without worries and got into my comfortable zone and lost motivation altogether with an ability to decide for myself. I can't decide for what I want to do now. I can't do things I know I need to do for my own well being. I don't even know how can I start wanting certain things to happen

So my questions are:

How do I do what I need to do, even if don't want to? (being productive)

585,"I 20F am going through a lot these past few months. I was a sophomore at a university in my town. At the beginning of the year I realized I had to take a semester off due to how crippling my lifelong anxiety disorder had become. This semester led to me taking a full gap year, as things had progressed into me being pretty depressed and unable to get myself off my feet properly. I am in therapy. 

After doing almost nothing since September, I finally got a job with one of my best friends the other day. I was ecstatic about it, until I started to work there. Our job is working the ski lifts at the mountain near us. 

The point of me getting this job was less about money and more about waking up with a purpose in the mornings and eventually getting myself back into a normal routine of living. The problem is, I’m starting to hate this job. I thought I’d love it because it’s outside, I get to see the snow everyday, and get fresh air in my lungs. But that is totally overridden by the fact that all of the shifts are no less than about 7 hours, and I understand thay is normal for someone my age but I feel as if I shouldn’t have started working for that long right off the bat granted I’ve been isolated and stagnant the past few months. Also, the people there absolutely suck. They all have a criminal record, are ex drug dealers, are still drug dealers, or have absolutely no ambition about their lives. I feel as if this job is making me more miserable then anything. 

I have a quitters mentality due to my anxiety; all of my life without realizing the negative effects, I have quit things when they become uncomfortable. I know now that this isn’t a beneficial strategy. But I already really want to find another job. 

I need to grow. It makes me sick that I am still in my hometown for school but I understand it’s what’s best for me right now.",19Jan2020,1
587,"So, when people are sad, my first thought is to hug them (I personally like to be hugged when I'm sad, or drunk, or excited, hugs are good stuff), and when I do do that, it usually seems to make people calm. But I don't really know how to get to that point? I have a good ""superficial charm"", so actually making people feel better once I'm confident/in my zone/in control of the situation isn't the problem. I just don't want to hug someone that dislikes it.

But how the f*** do I initiate something like that? What should I ask them to make sure it's ok? Should I just ask ""Would you like it if I hugged you?""? And once I'm holding them, do I just ask ""would you mind if I stroke your hair?""? Especially that last sentence sounds really awkward, but I don't want to startle them by just grabbing their head all of a sudden. And do I ask ""would you like"" or ""do you mind if"", that second one sounds like I want to, and I don't want to make them feel any pressure to accept my hug.

Up until now I've just relied on my intuition, but about a week ago I just kind of stood there trying to console someone with words because I didn't know if they wanted me to touch them or not. And in hindsight I should've probably hugged them, and I want to prevent that from happening again.",19Jan2020,1

590,"I’m a 19 year old guy, my boyfriend is 25.

I am asking for some help because I am so lost on what to do in me and his situation.

Me and him have been together for around 5 months. I truly have never felt this way about anyone and me and him connect and work together as a team very well although our scenario is very very challenging and that’s why I need some help, it’s driving me crazy.

The story... He is currently in school at a local community college, works as well, and does design work in his free time. He also isn’t out to his parents. But with all that’s going on in his life we aren’t able to see each other much and it’s tough on me. I can see a really bright future for me and him and whenever we are together it is amazing, and when he isn’t busy our relationship is the best thing ever, but when everything starts getting extremely busy it starts to slowly crumble I feel like. 

There is also a high possibility he will have to move out of state by May or June (when college is over) to peruse his dream career. I have been super supportive of his career path, school work, and dream to my fullest extent and want nothing but success and happiness for him. 

I just don’t want it to come down to him not being ready for that commitment of moving together and I essentially never see him again and our relationship ends. I fear that he will want to move and not feel attached to anything from home because he is an extremely independent person which I admire deeply, but in this case it really scares me. 

This man means the world to me and is my best friend. I never thought I’d find someone like him but I just worry that I’ll be left in the dust even though I truly can see a future with us, but I fell as if all of the external circumstances won’t allow that to happen. I just want to be there by his side while he achieves his goals and I achieve mine... together.

Me and his communication and our relationship as a whole has gotten a lot better and my needs have been getting better fulfilled and he starts back in school for his last semester and I just don’t know if I should ride the wave and trust his level of seriousness and commitment will shine at the end of the day or do I stop it in it’s tracks so I don’t get devastated if that happens?

591,"My situation has become so stressful I don’t even know where to begin. I’m 20 years old and when I was 18 I got my girlfriend pregnant and we’ve stayed together since then and raised our now 19 month old son while living at my parents house. However, around 7 months ago my girlfriend’s adoptive mom got in contact with her birth dad who she had never met before.  We ending up meeting him and his wife and three kids soon after that and they immediately were very invasive. They began sending both my girlfriend and her mom lots of money and then offered to have us move in with them 3 states away and work for their plumping business. This might seem like a good thing but it was alarming to me as they were strangers we just met.  However, my girlfriend was in favor of moving in with them we just couldn’t at the time because she was still 17  and her adoptive mom didn’t want her moving 3 states away. As time went by my girlfriend continued texting her dad and his wife regularly and eventually they offered to pay for our son’s daycare if we moved in with them once my girlfriend turned 18.  This eventually made me change my mind about moving there as I thought daycare would be good for my son’s development and I told myself it would be worth the sacrifice of living with strangers that I’m extremely uncomfortable around. At the time my girlfriend watched our son all day at my parent’s house and finished high school online while I was working 30 hours a week at a gas station making 9.60 an hour.  My girlfriend also still doesn’t have her driver’s license so she couldn’t take our son anywhere and I was sick of him just being stuck at my house all the time. I was always really invested in his development because I know the first years of life are crucial for brain growth. I made sure my girlfriend breastfed him for as long as she could and my entire life has revolved around playing with him, reading to him, taking him places, etc. I literally don’t have any friends anymore because I don’t have the time or energy. I also have pretty severe social anxiety and I’ve struggled with depression and I’ve actually been hospitalized 4 times in the past due to suicide attempts and issues with alcohol and drugs. I actually met my girlfriend at a mental hospital. So long story short now we’ve been moved in to their house for a week and I feel like shit. I thought I could be strong and do this for my son but I don’t know if I can. I’m about to start working for their company tomorrow and I don’t know if I can do it. I’m also struggling with a terrible addiction to a nootropic called phenibut and adderall which I’m prescribed but I abuse it instead of taking it as prescribed to cope with depression and to have the energy to get things done and to take care of my son. Since we’ve been here I’ve just felt horrible and I just want to leave. I cut myself on my thighs the other day which is something I used to do when I was too stressed and I’ve had some suicidal thoughts. I’m only here for my son if it weren’t for him I would have probably broken up with my girlfriend a long time ago. I used to be in love with her and wanted to spend my life with her but as time has gone on I’ve changed and learned more about who I am.  I still care about her but I don’t think I love her anymore. I just don’t know if I can bring myself to leave my son and move back to my parents house but I feel like I’m going to have a mental breakdown.

Example: On one lesson I decided to sit alone, because I wanted to focus and for the rest of the day my friend was passive agressive towards me, regardless me explaining why I decided to sit alone. 

Another example is that me and another mutual friend of ours work-out together sometimes, because we both like beeing outdoors and active. My friend, who hates beeing outdoors and all kind of sport, got jealous at me for not inviting him/her. Which I understand can be seen as hurtful, but I thought it was no biggie. Mainly because he/she also hang out with mutual friends without me.

I didn't want a child either, but if i gotta choose between raising this children by my own or leting she corrupt the child and raise that person telling he or she that his or her father is a crazy guy or whatever she comes up with. I just don't know what to do! I am a 22 year old teacher, and i am unable to raise a children with how my financial life currently is, but i am not giving up on that child either.

610,"hi guys. sorry this is really difficult for me to phrase and type out because during the majority of the story i was either drunk or high so i’m sorry if some parts lack continuity but i think a general idea about the situation should be easy to grasp.

i have history with the guy (18m gonna refer to him as J) who i think took advantage of me. last year i was in a sort of experimental fwb relationship with him. we didn’t have sex but there was touching involved and making out involved. J is completely sober throughout the whole party.

yesterday i was at an apartment party with my friends and before the party started i had took a couple hits of a joint. i’m a lightweight so i was quite high. i was interacting as normal with J i guess and he was   sort of making excuses to touch me i think. like i was lying on the sofa and he was stroking my back so i sat up and moved away. as the night progressed the highness wore off so i did a couple shots and i got pretty drunk so one of my friends asked J to sort of keep an eye on me and make sure I didn’t hurt myself because i was rolling around and thrashing and stuff. i think i was drunk and i kept talking about how i wanted tea which is an inside joke at our school for wanting sex. i was lying in the bathtub a while later and J came in and asked me to get out so he could use the bathroom. i was being stubborn so i was like “give me a kiss and i’ll get out” and he blew me an air kiss, so i was trying to get out but obviously he had to help me get out because i was so drunk to the point that i was falling over. he grabbed me and he kissed me. i’m not sure if this is all that happened but i was rlly drunk and everything seems rlly fuzzy in my brain but i’m sure that we didn’t have sex. i kept on doing more shots and i think i approached him to kiss him a few more times. my friend walked in on us kissing but i was lying on the floor drunk as hell and he was kissing me from above. at some point i went home with my friend. 

i woke up today and my friend told me that she had seen me and J kissing. i called my other friend and she told me that i had been really drunk all night and i definitely wasn’t sober enough to consent but i don’t know. like i know i initiated some kisses but i woke up this morning feeling absolutely shit and a bit violated. 

i’m so distressed and i would really appreciate advice. i know i was drunk to the point of not being able to stand properly but i also initiated kissing so i’m not sure if that would make it consensual or not. :(",19Jan2020,1

626,"Hello everyone, 
I’ve had something been troubling my mind for a long time now and I figured this sub would be the best place to ask.

I’ve known this kid, let’s call him Dan, for a long time. Since I was in 7th grade, he was one of my best friends, and I was really close with his family since he lived next to me and his father was also a part of the military. Now my friend started smoking weed and drinking a little before I did, but that’s because he was older than me. At around my sophomore year of high school and his junior year, both of us were smoking everyday and loving every bit of it. He originally mentioned using psychedelics one day and decided to take acid on a Fourth of July parade and really enjoyed it. Over the course of a little bit, he took shrooms and acid a few more times, but he would start to talk more and more about DMT. Whenever we would talk, he would mention how when we die our brain releases DMT and we trip balls (I’m not sure how correct or not this information is I don’t have much knowledge about any of this) and if we’re all just tripping right now living a past life and watching it as a soul or something. Me and him kind of had a falling out for a little while but I heard at the time that he was experiencing HEAVY with DMT, with one of my other friends that was a year older than me. Around this time he also was going through some family issues or some shit. Anyway, I started noticing weird signs. He would just be wandering around the neighborhood by himself occasionally, (and once walked over an hour to another part of town) his sister told me he doesn’t talk to his family anymore, and he doesn’t go to college. When I hungout with him, he wouldn’t do much but just stare and randomly laugh, completely tuning out to our conversation and when we were asking him questions. Other than this, he told me he was gonna shoot up our school and said he was joking, and texted me some other stuff saying how he was God and can control anything. He told me he spends all his time alone and just thinks about how bad the world is, and everytime I mention something to her sister she completely avoids it. I’m very concerned about my friend considering I moved from where I used to live and go to college very far away. I know using drugs like these open up your mind and can change your personality, but this is someone who I’ve been close with for years and in my opinion, has lost his mind. I’m personally really scared he’s gonna hurt himself or his family. Is there any help I can suggest for him or is it just water under the bridge?

TLDR: Friend started taking a shit ton of DMT and now has gone crazy and completely changed",19Jan2020,1

635,"I've been working for a doctor for the last year and a half while I get my life back together after having to leave a doctorate program for health issues. It's a small office, and the doctor and I get along very well. I have two coworkers. One I get along with (the 20 year old) very well and the other is a problem for everybody (the 34 year old). The older one is known to have issues with other girls in the office. I am the 4th of 5 girls she has bullied. When I first started, she was like a hawk and watched everything I did. She has a lot of jealousy issues with me, and as a result, I am treated very unfairly by her. If I made a mistake, she would run back to the doctor to tell him. He likes and respects me, so he never got upset with me. I work my ass off while she tends to be lazy. She would also call out any little mistake I made during a meeting in front of everybody. But then the next minute she is nice to me like we're best friends. She got better for a little while, but now she is making our younger coworker uncomfortable because she is apparently obsessed with talking about me constantly. My coworker said that she will follow her around the office to complain about me. I am good at my job, but sometimes I do make mistakes. I had two very bad concussions that have left me a little forgetful at times, but I have been told by the doctor I work for that I am the best worker he has had in the office. I have more responsibilities than the coworker who bullies me even though she has worked there for six years. She sits on her lazy butt in the back and gossips about me most of the day while I work hard. She will add patients to our schedule and not tell me even though when she trained me she told me that we should always let the whole office know about the schedule changes. I saw her make faces at me in a reflection last week for no apparent reason. Reminder, this woman is 34... :-/ ... The other day I made a minor mistake and she told me about it while we were alone. I thought it was all resolved. When the doctor walked by to show me something on the computer, she told me about my mistake again as if she had never told me before. 

Anyway, she is unprofessional and will talk quietly about patients when they're in the same room thinking they can't hear her. The doctor is aware to a certain point about how she is. I have gone to him multiple times about her, but he hates conflict. So now it becomes my problem. He has had to stand up for me multiple times, but he never does anything drastic with her. My younger coworker (the 20 year old) is getting nervous around this girl now. I am actively looking for a new job. We both want to talk with our boss about this, but I'm not sure how to proceed at this point.

Since graduating (3 years ago) I've been sleeping around 7-9 hours and I've been much better off. I dont stress at all (except major things worth stressing about) and I've been much more social and less irritable. No I'm in college, with a full time job and a student-manager for the basketball team, and I'm back to how I was and this time only getting 3-5 hours of sleep.

I could sacrifice free time to get more sleep most nights, but where I cant seem to make up my mind is the inconsistency that I will have. I work at 5am. On game days, the games dont end till 10, wo this will lead me to get a max of like 5 1/2 hours of sleep. Is this okay? Is it worth it to get 7-9 hours maybe 5 times a week and the other nights get 5-6? Or should I make it more consistent and just get 6 every night?

655,"I live with my mom, for about 2 years our relationship has just completely deteriorated. Yeah we've had some happy moments in between, but its not enough to cover the bad. It's screaming and cursing and accusing every week, and if its not that then it isn't anything. Theres no hugs or affection, up until last week I actually don't know the last time we hugged. There's little to no talking and when we do, I just don't feel the need to try anymore because I don't want to move past any of this and keep trying to help our relationship, I just want to drop it and forget about it. I don't see it getting better, but it's not something that bothers me anymore. I honestly don't want it to get better. My dad got stage 4 cancer about 2 years ago, he was going to die, but he pulled through and in November of like 2018, he finished chemo. In November 2019, he had a seizure and I basically just accepted that this was it. He got treated again, the cancer came back, last week he had another seizure, then he got hepatitis. He's not bed ridden by any means, but hes becoming more and more forgetful and his mind works slower now. 
Since November, I told myself that I was gonna lose him so that I would be a little more prepared when it actually happened. It just led to me being de-sensitized to the situation. It looks like hes getting better now, but I feel like I might as well have lost him already, there's an emotional disconnect where it makes me feel like it doesn't matter whether hes here or not. I love him more than anything and hes the best man I know. It's taken a toll on my mother obviously. We were arguing about something while driving and she tried to put her hands on me. I was trying to hold her back and she was screaming and cursing at me and yelling don't hit me while still trying to hit me back. My mom says these terrible things and expects me to get over them instantly, but she doesn't realize that they take a toll on me, yet she wonders why I have so much animosity towards her. She gets upset cause I can't just move past things, but I don't know how Id be able to move past some of the things she's said. Whenever I try to address something calmly, she gets angry and it ends with yelling. She claims that I'm stubborn, which I can be, but she doesn't hear anything when I speak and yelling doesn't make it any better. I have a steady job, I'm working to save up quite a bit so that when I do move out, I'll have a little less to worry about initially when it comes to money.

657,"Hi all,

A few months ago I got my first ""real"" job. To quickly give some backstory, I decided it was best to take a break from college and get my loans paid down a bit, save up some money and then go back to school and continue working full time once all of those have been fulfilled. I also wanted some ""real"" experience that wasn't retail like I had been doing since HS.

After months of interviews and no offers I landed a job at a prestigious office, which was offering really good benefits and so on. I accepted the job immediately. The position was really basic, and despite not having a degree I was hired anyway. Some of my tasks include scanning papers, opening mail and well, honestly I don't really do anything else worth mentioning. 

This job is nothing I expected. I do literally nothing. There's like never anything for me to do, and when there is, it takes up usually not even a half hour of my day. There are a few interns at my job and they are always overloaded with things to do. At this point I'm starting to envy them.

The whole ""not doing anything"" I'm sure to some people is great - you get to sit at a desk all day and do nothing and get paid. Personally it makes me feel absolutely useless and I'm starting to become depressed. I'm capable of so much more than doing NOTHING and it's really starting to affect me mentally. 

A typical day for me includes sitting at my desk pretending to ""be busy"" until lunch, and then repeating ""looking busy"" until I get to leave. It's awful. I ask if there's anything I can do, if I can do intern stuff too for some experience and am never given anything. 

The other day an intern promoted to be an employee because her department really needs someone. It made me feel terrible. I sit and pretend to do shit all day while this intern, who works 2 days a week, gets hired. I'm hesitant to look for a new job because I feel like I won't get any decent job without a degree and this one just happened to be pure luck. 

Also, the interns are so busy doing actual work that the things interns are required to do (run errands, pick up food, clean) is placed on me. 

I didn't mean to ramble but I just feel so down about myself. I am sick of pretending to work and meanwhile interns are doing so much more than me. Any advice? I feel so stuck",19Jan2020,1

I'm actually a pretty good singer, atleast that's what people say (I don't think well of myself). I've been singing in choir for 10 years and started taking it seriously 2 years ago doing vocal exercises and breathing exercises.

665,"I should probably start off by saying that I'm 21M and I still live at home. My situation is a little complicated, so I'll spare the minor details. My parents split a few years ago (due to neglect/abuse) and my mom found someone else and we moved in to his house. 

I should have known it was not a great idea due to the fact that he and I had a couple arguments before I even moved in. Despite this, he seemed to make my mom happy so who was I to say anything? I've attempted to make amends with the guy and stay out of his way while I live here. I try to do whatever bit of housework I can do to lighten the load, even offering him help with his daily chores when I'm not busy. He and I don't spend any time together but he and my mom seem to have a pretty normal relationship now.

Anyway, just recently he expected me to clean the driveway. Despite me not knowing this and having everything else around the house done, the guy starts with his usual passive aggressive behaviour. Rather than be direct with me, he'll ask little questions so I have to piece together what I did wrong again today. This eventually lead to us having words, with him proclaiming that I need to watch mouth. He then got in my face and smacked the hot cup of coffee I just poured out of my hand and all over the floor. Before things could get any worse my mom split it up.

Overall, I'm tired of being patronized by him. There's nothing I can say that will change things. Any moment I try to explain myself I am wrong and risk causing another one of his outbursts. This only makes things worse because my mom always jumps to his side despite this. I have no car, no other family, and no place to go. I'm lucky to know someone at work who gives me rides. My entire life was growing up in a household 100x worse than the one I'm in now. You might think that would make you conditioned but it only makes things worse by bringing back the bad memories while creating new ones. I just don't know what to do about all this.

668,"Throwaway because of first detail in post. I made a post in legal advice about this but am curious about general advice from this community. There's a ton of toxicity here aside from what I’ll share, but the important part…I wouldn’t trust these people with $5 and need to figure what to do about my deposit and notice on move out.

I met my roommates on a reddit, a couple. Everything seemed nice at first. I came by to look at the place and it checked out, a small open room in a 2br in the bay.

I stressed that being on the lease/legal was important to me because I had not established residence in CA yet and wanted to do it all by the books. I was told the landlord would be contacted and paper work available on move in day (I know, dumb, I was eager to a get a place locked down)

When I showed up with all my stuff and nowhere else to go I was told the paperwork wasn’t ready yet (I know, red flag, poor and nowhere else to go)

I paid the deposit and rent to the couple, still optimistic, they seemed functional and i wasn’t worried yet. We agreed on month to month for now.

A few draining weeks later I finally got the answer, they had not told the landlord and were refusing to. I didn’t have money to move so I stayed for the time being.

Now, I am moving. 3/1 at the latest but have a spot that, if approved, can move asap

The QUESTION,

Do you think it is fair to leave asap, leave deposit as February rent, and leave a line open for any damages (it’s a \~100 sq ft room, there are no damages, but i would throw a couple hundred at the situation if it would pacify things and bring them to an end). This is the option I’m leaning towards because I genuinely don’t trust these people and don’t want my stuff around them when I’m away once I tell them I’m moving. I work full time, they both have anger issues, it seems bad.

OR

Do I owe them the 30 days notice (so let them know and pay February)? If so, there’s no way I get the the deposit (that it turns out they pocketed back), right? Small claims court aside.

Since the landlord was never contacted we never did a proper walk through, and I’m confident these people are going to try to take money from me for scratched wood floor that was there long before me.",19Jan2020,1

She gets whatever she wants, and if you try telling her no, she'll just bring up the fact that her dad left by saying ""Well, I don't have a dad to buy me stuff, so who will"".

She's rude to everyone she meets, especially strangers. Literally, just a few hours ago, we went out to eat and she stayed on FaceTime the entire time. Including when the waitress was trying to take our order. She was the loudest person in the restaurant.

She never thinks about how much money she spends, she just goes in the store, gets what she wants, and if she doesn't have enough money, she'll demand my grandmother (who has custody over her) giver her more.

She never asks for anything, she demands someone get it for her. And she has my grandmother buy her all the expensive trendy things. Airpods, a hydro flask, clothes from the most expensive store in the mall, the most expensive drinks at Starbucks, it never ends and she'd never satisfied.

673,"So let me start by saying this is a person I met online and we talked / spent a lot of time together after that for almost 2 years but they've slowly been pulled away from our friendship due to developing more of a social life outside of the internet. At first I was a bit upset by this, not because he's making more friends and experiences but because he so quickly tossed me to the side and ""minimized"" our friendship. I don't think i helped this either by trying to talk to them way more and overall just coming off as clingy but since then I've backed off. I understand now that we've probably just grown apart and and should live our separate lives and talk if and when we both have time / want to. But this leads into why I consider him toxic, well not really him so much but more so my relationship with him. We don't talk nearly as much which is fine but every now and then he'll message me and I'll get pretty happy to hear from him. But he only ever messages when he's sad about this one girl and I've tried to help him with that as much as I can and I'm open to listening to his problems if he wants to vent but he ONLY messages when he wants to vent and I think it's because he knows that I'll respond fairly quick and actually listen. He never wants to just talk or see how things are going in my life or whatever and I don't mean to sound selfish if I do, I just feel like I'm being used at this point. Lately though I've stood my ground and let him know that I'm not just someone you can dump your problems on and then go about your day. Now he doesn't really message me at all and if he does it's usually just because he needs someone to respond (he has anxiety and likes to distract himself this way in certain situations). I've also noticed recently that when he does message I'll try to talk about things we used to or whatever and he'll typically just come off as uninterested and stop responding that quickly or at all and then I'm left feeling like a tool. I know someone else who once blocked an irl friend online on all platforms over an argument one day and I used to be pretty confused by this; How could he just throw away their friendship over one argument but I've realized since then it wasn't just one argument it was an almost constant cycle of antagonizing from the now blocked friend and I've talked to the one who blocked him since and he is much happier now and surrounded by people who are more true friends to him.

684,"There’s a lot to explain to give the full picture so here's a summary of my entire life so far, but I’ll keep each part as succinct as possible.

1. Early childhood. 

I was a precocious child, always several grade levels above my classmates, very interested in math and science, but my schools mostly sucked. In retrospect, would have loved the math and science competitions, but didn’t even know about them at the time. Every year my mom and I asked the school to let me skip. They thought skipping would be bad for me socially, which was thoroughly debunked nonsense even at that time. Mom cared but didn’t know enough to help me herself. Dad was career military, electrical engineer, not around much, more like a disinterested uncle who participated only in the fun weekend activities. We moved a bunch. I had several terrible flus that almost killed me (104-107 F) and a blood infection that made it impossible to walk on one foot for over a year. I was, and am, OCD but my military father instilled a fear of weakness in me. He thought psychology, philosophy, and self care are some combination of voudou and gay. I might've benefitted from being diagnosed as OCD so long as I was not stigmatized. I had a hard time reading quickly because of my OCD, but my comprehension was very high. My eyes would get hung up on periods. For example, I once found a single square period in a textbook with entirely circular ones. I'd count constantly, and insist on things seeming even, being in groups of fours or tens, etc. Not a single teacher noticed because I remained the top of my class, which sucked for me later on.

Dad once abandoned my brother and I in a park downtown to teach us a lesson about coming when he calls us. Also saw a man die in a car crash when his body hit the window near where we were sitting in a restaurant. I very much enjoyed aquariums, zoos, museums, and science projects. 

2. Early teens. 

Became aware that childhood wouldn’t last forever, and it was too late to keep counting on my school system or parents to do everything for me. I started looking into schools, getting hooked on the idea of the Ivy League and all that, partly because my father made it seem really important half the time, the other half telling me I wouldn't amount to anything. Became determined to keep straight As. Also came to realize I was indoctrinated in the cult of Mormonism. My family, thankfully, left the church but it was a traumatic experience. Found myself without any friends at all for a while, but managed to latch on to a group of frenemies that often ditched me. Felt pretty alone. Mom was kindof a pushover with my father. He would alternate between demanding she get a job, calling her a freeloader, and telling her she needed to stay at home so she could take care of the house and be available to him when he wanted to travel or whatever.

3. Freshman and Sophomore at High School. 

The recession, mismanagement, and embezzlement led to budget shortfalls at my school. Some good teachers of mine were laid off or moved to other subjects. One was accused of sexual impropriety with a student and removed. Had numerous substitutes for extended periods (one class didn’t have a teacher for almost a whole year), and lots of classes were canceled. Still, Mom tried to help me navigate it and find the right path. 

I became aware that my father was bipolar, probably narcissistic, and not very self aware. He had a hair trigger that led us into physical conflict frequently. Thankfully I learned to wrestle and defend myself. Mom was afraid of conflict with Dad, and Dad was emotionally abusive to all of us. Never felt like I could ask for help because as bad as he was, I didn’t want to break up our family. He told me that he expected me to move out by the time I turned 16.

I committed myself to study on my short breaks from school. Managed to skip a grade of chemistry and two of math, entering AP Chem and AP Calc as a sophomore. Got As in all my classes, 4s and 5s in those, respectively, and my other AP classes. That felt redemptive. As I got closer to my Junior year many decent teachers were retiring and classes were being cancelled, making me worry whether Id get to do any classes I wanted for my last two years. I also felt motivated to learn Math. Started arranging to take classes at the community college and university.

4. Junior and Senior at High School. 

Summer (5 weeks) after sophomore year I had three tasks: Calculus 2 at community college, arranging with School District to allow me to take college classes while in High School regular session, and tutoring others in math to make some money. My dad would become irate over the cost of my textbooks and insist that I pay for them myself or pay him back. He told me I was a bad investment.

Would up tutoring a cute girl that I later found out mas extremely manipulative, and maybe a histrionic narcissist. I became 

The school districts made everything extremely difficult. Was lowest priority at the CC, treated as general public rather than HS grad for registration. School was impacted and I had to crash to get in to classes. This made it hard to predict what periods I’d get, if at all. Between classes being cancelled at my HS and some being full by the time I knew what my schedule could be at CC, it was too late and I had to take mostly CC classes and show up late or be absent to many HS classes. This pissed off my HS teachers, leading them to hate me and actively sabotage me. No surprise there.

Wound with my first B, and shortly after my first C. Had an altogether terribly moronic AP US History teacher, which didn’t help my situation. Came to regret even trying to take college classes, but felt invested. Also became depressed after tutoring the cute girl for over a year for free, being manipulated by her, and prioritizing her over myself. Wound up hanging out with some shitty people, smoking weed, getting sexually assaulted by a male ‘friend’, threatened with murder by another. Also got arrested for shoplifting some books from my college bookstore (not a noble act; I took some I didn’t need, just wanted).

Got Bs at the university in Diff Eq and Discrete math. Dropped other classes of Diff Eq, Linear Algebra, and Organic Chemistry for fear of getting B or Cs. Became yet more depressed to the point I could hardly get out of bed to attend classes. Rarely studied, but managed to pull Bs. Had physical altercations with my father and brother that led to my shitty desk and bookcase being destroyed. One time gave a presentation to a teacher with a torn shirt and blood on my chest.

I rarely slept because I am an insomniac night person, was depressed, my brother stayed up late yelling at his video games, neighbors kept a flood light on and pointed at my window, and my dad snored extremely loud. Lived on 5 hour energy and maybe three hours sleep per night. One time I went five days without sleep.

Teachers were so mad at my attendance they lobbied the administrators to show me the door. I was forced out to some program that was originally made for accelerated students but became a catchall for failures, because bureaucracy. Went to ask for letters of rec from my sophomore year teachers. One was in the hospital because he ate nothing but little Debby snacks and peanut butter, another refused to give me one despite the fact that I got at A in her class, a 5 on AP, and taught her class while she was out for surgery for a year. She said it was because she heard things about me and couldn’t write one in good conscience. Another said he would write one but he laughed at me and shunted me out of his class.

While all this was unfolding Facebook became a thing. I fell deep into the FOMO given that I missed practically my entire Junior and Senior years, could see all the fun online, and was being manipulated by a girl. Sex drive was on overdrive and I was a friendless, depressed virgin. My best friend was becoming popular-ish and wasn’t there for me.

Applied to a couple schools, as many as I could afford which wasn’t many given the $80 application fee. Wound up getting rejected from all the schools that needed a letter of rec and some that didn’t. I got accepted into only one school, my last pick. I was so extremely depressed already. Felt my passion for science and math was being tainted by all these hellish experiences. Parents didn’t have money to pay for my schooling, much less for me to live on campus. I knew I couldn’t stay at my parents house any longer given my constant run-ins with my father.

5. 18-20.

After High school. I couldn’t go to college for four years. Dad made too much money for me to qualify for much financial aid as a dependent, and he didn’t want to pay. Went to a welding program over the summer. Later, tensions came to a head with my father so I took his car (an expensive one they never could afford, but bought instead of helping their kids), loaded it with whatever possessions and food I could find, and hit the road. I went to a CC in an extremely expensive area a few hours away for a one year technical program that existed only there, living in the car. Dad didn’t put up a fight over the car. He would act marginally more generous and caring when I wasn’t in his house so he could feel like he was a good person.

I was frequently awoken by police, random homeless people, and passersby. Was ridiculed by my classmates when they found out I was homeless in an expensive car. Had zero social or sex life. Managed to get a job changing oil and rotating tires, and another part time one in my industry (got hired alongside a guy one semester ahead of me; see later). Had to spend all my money buying equipment required by my program. Had one friend who would occasionally let me sleep in the loft of his apartment.

After I graduated the program I was still homeless and working. The job I had required that I move to Louisiana to become full time, so I did so. Managed to buy a truck that I could live in and returned the car to my Mom. Found a coworker that rented me a couch for $300 a month plus utilities.

Turned out everyone at that job already hated me because a coworker of mine that I hired with but was a semester ahead of me disparaged me to them because he felt it was unfair we were promoted at the same time despite the fact that he had been full time for longer. Had a hard time getting work or getting good reviews because of it. Felt my life slipping away.

One of my two roommates came home drunk one night with his friends (also coworkers), one of whom picked a fight with me. He socked me in the face, breaking my glasses then tried to tackle me as the others watched or egged on. Thankfully my wrestling experience came in handy and I choked the guy out. He weighed about 50-60 pounds more than me and was taller, albeit drunk. This made me even less secure, and desiring a change.

I met a girl online that was down in Florida. We were getting along well online. At that point I wasn’t getting any work, so I said fuck it and drove down there to meet her. Two days later I get a call saying hey you’re on a job and we need you on a flight ASAP. I say umm I’m in Miami. This guy says that’s fine but I get a call from an ex military anger management case who threatens me. Fed up with it all, and concerned about the mental stability and acuity of the people in this industry, and how that reflects on their ability to not kill or maim me in this dangerous job, I quit. I just wanted to be with my new girlfriend.

I was still homeless for a while until her family let me stay with them. I got a job at a department store to pay for some of my own bills. We (she and I) had a falling out with her parents and wound up living in my truck together. At this point my parents tell me my father will be working across the country for a few years and that I should come back to attend school. After a while I thought this was my only option, so we went back.

6. 20-21. 

Of course as soon as we go back my dad decides to retire and work from home. Nightmare complete. My girlfriend and I went to a courthouse and got married. By the time I was in the process of reentering CC, and trying to transfer to the university I passed up in the first place, it was totally intolerable living with him. I wasn’t sleeping, full of stress, etc. The bathroom by our bedroom had been broken and gutted since I was in middle school. Practically needed a chamber pot to get a good nights sleep, otherwise it's down and back up 30 stairs and then good luck. 

My dad was as much an asshole as ever, leading my wife to tears every other day, and emasculating me. We decided we’d have to move somewhere less expensive and fend for ourselves. We picked this in a hurry and wound up homeless in a rocky mountain state. Managed to get an apartment.

7. 21-23.

We both get jobs. The apartment we were in was hardly functional. A real hole in the wall. The stove smoked whenever it was on, people stole our mail, it was a basement spot with creaky floors and night shift workers overhead, shared with a laundry room, and there was this extremely creepy guy there who didn’t legally reside there, bumming off a woman who lived on some kind of welfare. He’d pop into the hallway every time we left the apartment and stand near our door frequently when we were inside. All this distressed us. We needed to leave again.

We made enough money we could afford to buy a house in the area, but just barely. After we moved in things seemed to get better for about a year. But our jobs were terrible. I worked 55-80 hours per week without benefits and was considered part time. Was rushed constantly and given absurd deadlines. Never missed a minute for two years, then missed one day due to illness and they tried to fire me. I was going insane between that hell and the hell my life had been. I decided the only way out would be to start a business.

I started modifying the house to accommodate a new business or three. These weren't anything that inspired me, just things I thought I could do on a budget. I took out a business loan and spent it on equipment. Shortly thereafter I dealt with some racially motivated bullying by some coworkers, including threats of physical violence, on top of what I had to deal with from management. I had severe foot problems due to the nature of the job and was in constant pain. I went home after a conflict with one of these bully coworkers left me full of adrenaline. I couldn’t bring myself to return and committed myself to my business projects. I had planned to stay there until they succeeded but now that wasn't an option.

8. 23-26.

Over time depression set in. I got maybe 80% complete with setting up a business in a few months, but quickly became totally exhausted and depressed to the point I couldn’t do anything. Not much has changed since then except that I have gone deeper and deeper into debt paying for my existence during this time. Obviously it has taken a toll on me and my wife.

We have no choice but to leave this place. We have loads of debt and no significant income. We plan to sell off all the business stuff, the house, and many of our possessions to cancel whatever fraction of the debt we can. I have no choice but to go back to my parents house under the wing of my mother, hoping to stay as far from my father as possible. Third times the charm? I’m sure it will be hell once again. I’ll have to wait a year before I can go to school there with in state tuition, then it’ll be maybe four years, despite the credits I have, until I can complete my degree at the very same school I passed up. I’m considering a bachelors in math and trying to become an actuary.

9. Advice.

The things keeping me depressed are the feelings of helplessness at leaving this place (I have to fix a bunch of things in the house else I’ll take a loss on it, plus it takes time to sell a house), and the feeling of regret at my past experiences and the decisions I made under duress. I frequently lament what my life is as compared to what it could have been. I know regretting lost time just wastes more time. I’m terribly exhausted and I find it hard to see any hope going forward given what has happened thus far. I feel selfish at the same time for being so miserable when other people, especially in foreign countries, have it much worse. Still, I have to live in this expensive society adjacent to prosperity and with knowledge of the opportunities that I had and were derailed by foolishness on my part in response to a hostile upbringing.

After insulating the attic, scraping the popcorn ceiling, and skim coating the ceiling, snow blew in and melted, flooding a corner of the attic, destroying much of that work. My gigantic back yard has become infested with weeds. My newish, out of warrantee dryer just burned out, I replaced the over-temperature fuse, and it burned out again despite the ducts being clear. It destroyed a bunch of clothes and others are damp, trying to air dry. Life events like these seem insurmountable piled atop everything else. 

I have some very good business ideas that inspire me and would likely help the world, but would require years of dedicated study and work. These ideas have been with me since I was 16. They have to do with analysis, linguistics, concepts, mathematics, and computer programming. I don't see having that kind of time at any point in my future, given how precarious my survival is, and this makes me miserable.

Going back to school feels like opening a dirty wound to clean it. Maybe it needs to be done, but it's exceptionally painful. It's also hard to see how I could write a good resume to get hired after college, or how I could manage work, school, debt, and my passions all at once, while dealing with the same circumstantial factors as before (my father).

I frequently think of committing suicide and so does my wife. I need a way out of here, a way to prosperity. When I'm thinking rationally my biggest regret is not being able to use my abilities to the fullest to help others. But I need stability in my own life in order to do so.

Thankfully I have a loving wife, mother, and my former best friend has recently reentered my life to offer supportive words.

My parents' bathroom is still broken.

I need a way through, and I'm desperate.


TL;DR: A series of unfortunate events led to less fortunate decisions, and yet less fortunate circumstances, and now I want to die. Need a way to succeed so I can reactivate my former talents to help people.",19Jan2020,1
685,"I have great friends. And it makes me so happy when I hear how much they love me. But I can't say it back without anxiety forming in my chest. Even now writing about it makes me anxious. Sometimes it goes so far that I get anxiety from people hugging me. It feels like I have to get as far away from affection as I can. I know it doesn't seem such a big deal but I don't know why this is happening. At first I thought these feelings were normal but I'm not so sure anymore.

687,"Hi

So I’m a 23 yr old female and I was wondering if anyone’s ever taken a step back from ppl in order to make them realize your worth? 

Idk if this is healthy or if I’m doing friendship wrong but I have 2 close friends and I always feel like I’m on the outside looking in... the odd one out. Like I feel like I’m the 3rd wheel in their friendship. I don’t really feel valued. They show love to eachother but when it comes to me I feel they get hesitant. Idk if I exude awkward energy where they get put off, or if I’m the type of person they feel weird to show love and appreciation to, but it does hurt. I see so many girl friends love eachother like sisters and it’s so beautiful. I can get awkward but I’m trying to be more open and loving. I can be tom boyish and sometimes can’t relate to their interests, but like I wanna try. I can be child like so I feel they don’t rely on me a whole lot... idk I can be very loving when in a relationship but I wanna be like that over all. I just wanna give and receive love cause it’s such a beautiful thing. 

I wanna know if maybe I should take a step back from these 2.. make myself less available cause rn I am ALWAYS available. I try to give and Wte In hopes of appreciation and acceptance and love in return. Don’t get me wrong they aren’t assholes to me. But sometimes I don’t think they see that they can be neglecting when it comes to me... 

Maybe if I become less available and make my absence known it can spark something.. idk help lol",19Jan2020,1
688,"A little background: My mother has a lot of psychological issues. She suffers from paranoid schizophrenia and insomnia. These mental disorders have been with her before I was even born and my father noticed them really early. When he confronted her parents on this issue, they declined trying to help in any way. My mother has been to mental wards/asylums multiple times. She would get medication prescribed and she wouldn't take any of it. All of this was happening while I was in my childhood years.  
While I was young and impressionable I didn't know much of anything. My parents would constantly argue and I always thought my father was the instigator in every single conflict. My mom would manipulate me into thinking that he is a bad person with anger issues. She would always blame her sadness and depression on him. My dad, even after so many years of living with her problems, having to both work for her and me while also renovating our apartment on his own, still gave her a chance and never showed prejudice towards her. He is the type of person who is very strict and easily acts upon emotion, but doesn't hold a grudge and often forgets/tries to not bring up any arguments that happened.  
When I turned about 12-13 years old, I started realizing who my mother really is. I started to see thru her manipulative and two-faced personality. At that time, I also noticed that my father couldn't be bothered anymore. He was getting tired of her destructive nature so he filed for a divorce. I had a choice(not in court because I was 14yrs old at that point.) and I wanted to stay with my dad. My reasoning was because he already renovated my room and I needed to have a normal living and working space for school (that was the reasoning I gave to my mother because I didn't wan't to admit what I really thought about her.). After countless days of living with constant dread because of their nonstop arguing, the divorce went thru, my mother agreed and she wen't to live with her father.  
15 years old and my dad confesses to me that he has been meeting up with a woman from work for the past 1-2 months. I understood the situation and I knew how lonely he felt. He introduced me to my stepmom a week later and... that's it really. She is a great person. We both knew we had no connection but she tried her best to bond with me, not as a mother and son but as friends. We wen't to watch a couple of movies together and even went to the zoo on a Friday afternoon. Just a genuinely nice person who understood what I was going thru and tried to help both me and my dad. They are both very happy with each other which helped me cope with the initial divorce.  
After my biological mother found out about my step-mom, she asked me multiple questions nonstop. When I would invite my biological mom home so she could see me and hangout with me once every week, she would literally SCAVENGE thru my stepmom's things. This would occur multiple times and I even ""caught"" her while she was doing it once but she acted as if nothing is happening. My dad threatened her with police if she ever dared enter the apartment again so we started meeting outside every week.  
This evening, we met up and talked about how things in school are going for me and how things at work are going for her. She brought up my stepmoms work place and I asked: ""Why do you want to know where she works/what she works?"". She gave me a very condescending ""Not for any particular reason"". I knew who she was and why she would ask me something like this. I tried to avoid the conversation but she pressed on so I asked her: ""Why are you so obsessed with my stepmom?""  
My mom was apparently so offended that I called her out on her obsession, she began with her usual manipulation, trying to make me feel guilt for seemingly no reason. Till the end of our meeting she wouldn't stop bringing what I said up. How offended and how stupid it is that I even THOUGHT about calling her obsessive. I had enough for her and told her simply: ""Stop dragging the conversation. Nothing significant has happened and you said what you already had to say."" That was the breaking point and the reason I come here for advice. She told me to basically piss off and drove off while I had to go home by foot.  
What do I do. Am I at fault? I'm only 16 so maybe I'm in the wrong here? I genuinely don't know what to do anymore and I feel as if all of this is taking a toll on my mental health. I know I'm developing anger issues. I am constantly shaking, in a bad mood and even the slightest mishaps piss me off to a point where I feel as if I just wan't to break something for no reason other than to cool off.

689,"I'm gonna keep this short, but we're both around 18 years old. We've been dating for ~5 months.
When I'm hanging out with her, I have a lot of fun. I love cuddling and talking and just watching TV with her, basically everything. I'm really happy.
When I'm alone, however, I don't like her as much, but only when I passively think about her. There's literally no reason not to, but I feel kinda crappy when I think about her. I don't know if I feel like I don't deserve her or if she's not right for me, but I really want to know. When I think about everything we do together, I'm happy.

- It's possible I've accidentally Pavloved myself into associating her with my depression. When we're together, we talk about depression a lot.

691,"Last night my recent ex bf texted me drunk. He was telling me how he tried to make it work and that he still has feelings for me. 

I told him how I saw him on a dating site and he said that he hasn’t been using it (probably a lie). And later he asks how I knew he was on it to begin with. 

I told him I made one and saw his profile. He starts cursing and saying I have no loyalty or class....because we recently broke up and I’m already on a dating site. 

I feel like I could do whatever I want at this point because he left me and didn’t want me. I’m single!! I never once was unfaithful to him in the relationship.

694,"So I have a little bit of a predicament, and I'm kindly asking for advice and thoughts from you lovely people. 

June of last year, I started A relationship and my best friend got a little distant. (To clarify, she stopped talking to me for two weeks as soon as I mentioned the fact to her) 

Communication from then on was, sporadic and short.  It felt as if she was hateful and refused to accept the fact. Not too long after that I picked up another job, to which said friend began guilt tripping as I wasn't spending time with only them, etc. 

Fast forwarding to New Years (12/28/19 Not quite new years yet), I'm on a trip with my partner, as we planned and saved for it since August, Anyhow. The messages I got during said trip stated that ""Ever since you started dating so&amp;so I feel like you've been pulling away from me and ignoring me, avoiding me in games, etc."" (All the while I had been staying up past one in the morning to try and keep playing games with all of my friends.) Making me, and my sensitive self, feel like an absolutely horrible person. 

A few day's later I get the message ""I just miss you"" Followed by, ""I didn't wan't to be jealous and needy, BUT SURPRISE."" 

Since that moment (1/2/20), I've maybe said one word to the friend in a public discord channel, the polite ""hello! I'm back from trip safe"" you send everyone so they know you're okay, and was met with untold amounts of sarcasm. 

So I ask you, did I handle this an okay way? or am I a complete moron for thinking that it's weird for your best friend to basically say that she's jealous of your girlfriend.

I don't expect many responses, but this is all I've got for this particular question. There are other things this friend has done in the past, but those are for other stories. I thank you for taking the time to read this.

696," 

Hey Reddit Counselors,

Strap in, this is a bit of a longer one, though I’ve tried to keep it as simple as possible.

The setup in a nutshell: the family seat was in Camelot, and I moved there to go to college  and then stayed after graduating. I lost my job during the recession and ended up moving to The Emerald City in 2012 to try to get ahead in life and not starve. However, life in the Emerald City was stupid crazy expensive, so I ended up moving to a shady neighborhood with my best work mate to save money. I did really, really well with that, and ended up clearing my debts and saving enough money to buy a 2-season cabin in Shireton, about an hour and a half outside of Camelot. I visited my cabin all the time for the next few years. Usually workmate (now a best friend) came with me. Well, we both lost our jobs a few years ago, and we both decided to move up to my cabin in Shireton, which by then I’d insulated, added electrical, etc, etc and turned into an alright house. I found a good job in remote sales while there.

In the last two years, workmate had a serious health problem and moved home to her parent’s place. She is unwell and has cut contact. Two of my best friends in Camelot have kinda dropped off the planet, and the family patriarch in Camelot passed away. I’m now feeling incredibly isolated in Shireton. Add to this, my parents have been in a nasty cycle of moving every 2-5 years since the recession, which means that they are often living apart as one or the other of them lives in the new location while the other stays behind to sort out the house sale. They are my closest family, but both are a good day of driving away, and in opposite directions. (I’m not knocking my folks at all, this is the nature of things since the recession, and they have to do what they have to do.) My remaining two friends in Camelot – one doesn’t drive, and the other doesn’t really drive in winter, which is necessary to visit me, since I may very well have several feet of snow when they have none at all. I've tried to build a bigger community here, but after 3 solid years of effort, I've come to conclude that a single woman not in need of a boyfriend is a distrusted figure in this area, among other things. In summary, my support network is kind of a mess as long as I stay here.  
 

Well, several of my college friends got set up in Alaska of all places, and all live about 20 minutes from Fairbanks. They’ve been encouraging me to move up since workmate had to move out, and I really want to go… except….  

I actually like living in Shireton, tiny and remote as it is. I like the closeness of the woods and the mountains. I can walk for 20 minutes and be in the forest. I don't even have to drive to get away from it all. My cabin is a burden at times, but I like it. I love the fall and the spring, and I really like winter (though with climate change that is getting quite a bit shorter than it was.) I like that my neighborhood is actually kind functional – I know my neighbors and they know me, though I wouldn’t really call us friends (and it’s clear they don’t want to be much more than nice on a quid pro quo level) It’s cheap out here, and my salary goes pretty far. Given where my family is, I’m sort of in the middle, so anyone visiting someone else at least stops over here when they don’t fly. I am only a day drive to family, and only a little over an hour to my best friend. In realtor terms, I'm centrally located.  

On the other hand,I really like Alaska (I’ve visited quite a bit, though never in summer…) and I really like the idea of just moving to my group of friends and knowing that I could call someone and get help in 20 minutes. Or I could see friends weekly. The idea of a community is so tempting. But moving to Alaska is quite the undertaking. And it’s a commitment. It’s several thousand dollars to move up my irreplaceable stuff, and it’s a 5-7 day drive with the dog, through a rather less hospitable part of Canada. Or I can ferry up and ship the dog in. At any rate, there are a lot logistics, and it’s not something that is easily undone if it ends up being too expensive/too difficult. I know my salary won't go nearly as far. I’m scared of what I know I don’t, or can’t know until I’m there. I’m scared I won’t be able to see people because of the price tag associated with flying out. My family, and some of my friends are moderately opposed to the move.  (And I have some doubts about how altruistic that opposition is.) 

But, here’s what I feel is tipping me over the edge –  I’m too isolated, and beyond the reach of normal assistance. I got a sinus infection earlier this year (still fighting it) and I thought I was coming down with the flu. The last time I had the flu, I ended up in the hospital, seriously hypotensive, scared I might die, being checked for stuff as serious as adrenal failure. I was hallucinating, running a high fever. It was nuts. I don’t know what would happen to me if I was in that shape all on my own. I got that sick so fast. Last year, I fell down on thick ice and I just laid there for a while, waiting for the stars in my eyes to clear and the pain to stop being so bad I couldn’t even squeak. I hobbled around for several days. The last time I had to get up to fix something on the roof, I ended up calling my mom and asking her to call the cops if I I didn’t call back in half an hour. It’s a lousy compensating control, for sure. 

I’m afraid I’m chasing greener pastures. But I’m also afraid that I’ve been suspended in a sort of limbo for the last two years, and I’m sort of kidding myself into believing that Shireton is sustainable at length. It does not help that this year’s winter is not very wintry, and winter is truly the best season here.",19Jan2020,1

So I am right now doing a study for doctors assistant however a office job sounds so much better. Even though I have no idea what study I need to do for a certain job, no clue about it at all.

Plus I am really scared to tell my parents about it

Any help would be super appreciated",19Jan2020,1
699,"I’m in high school and going into this year i had a strong core of around 9-10 friends and we would all hang out together and have fun. After a few ups and downs with new people coming in our group and other people leaving, there’s now 10 of us. I had good relationships with everyone in the group up until around December.

I don’t know why this happened, but my one friend, let’s call him Adam, (obviously not his real name), just randomly started being an asshole to me. He’s basically like the leader of our group, and I’m not exactly a physically built dude, and whenever Adam would insult me I would just take it because i’m not naturally an aggressive person and i know he would take me in a fight. I think Adam noticed that I just take his insults and don’t do anything about them, because it just became this thing where anytime we were together he would just be a complete asshole to me. It sort of became a joke, but I seriously cannot remember the last time he has said something genuinely nice to me.

I tried to reach out to him and ask him why he does this and I politely asked him to stop because it was fucking with my mental health. He didn’t take this seriously and it has continued on now in the middle of January. To make matters worse, I feel like I seriously have lost respect from kids in my friend group. Like for example my one best friend, I’ve been friends with him since 4th grade and we’ve always stuck together, let’s call him Steven (again fake name). The other night we were hanging out and again Adam was just making fun of me, sort of playfully. Well Steven just sat there as this happened with a sheepish grin on his face, like he was just trying not to laugh instead of fucking doing anything about it. And he’s not an asshole to me ever, but I can tell that he just seems to like other kids in our group more than me.

There’s only one kid in my group that really ever stands up for me when this kind of stuff happens, and even though most kids are fine and treat me equally, sometimes i just feel like I’m a bitch to Adam and it results in me feeling like a shitty person.

Sorry if that was too long I don’t know if anyone is gonna read this I don’t really know why I’m putting my problems out on reddit, but I just don’t know what to do",19Jan2020,1
700,"I never learned how to ride a bike. I tried to learn how to ride a bike, but I could never put enough pressure on the pedals and I couldn’t balance correctly and everything just sucked. I need some tips or some advice on how to do it.",19Jan2020,1
701,"After getting out of a really toxic relationship, I've been working on cleaning up my life and getting it back on track. It's been going really well overall, which is great. But there's one thing that still gets me, and I don't know if I'm soured from her always making me feel like I was doing something wrong or what.

I've been realizing that for at least the last few years, so many days/events/things in my life fall into one of two categories:

1. Things that are just a constant uphill battle. Work is improving and challenges me, but seems like there's always problems. 75% of the emails I get are people who are pissed at me about something I didn't do or don't have control over. Money is often tight, and I sometimes wonder when we'll catch a break for all the hard work and effort we all put in. I have some long term health issues that are not a direct result of anything I did to myself (i.e. not lung cancer from smoking or anything), and after years of effort, I just wish I could wake up and be just as healthy as my friends. There's more, but in general, ""when will I catch a break?"" is a common theme. If I got a letter tomorrow saying I owe $5k because my insurance didn't cover something, I wouldn't be surprised. If my cat knocks my phone off the counter and it shatters, I wouldn't be surprised. If my rent goes up an astronomical amount and I have to move, I wouldn't be surprised. You get the idea.
2. Not just in work emails, but for a guy who tries to do the right thing, I feel like I'm just constantly the bad guy or ""wrong."" I get all that about not caring what others think, but given my friends/family regard me as a good person, I get frustrated sometimes at how many people just enjoy waiving the finger at me. I don't try to make problems, I try to fix them, and I try to make things that work and will make things better for everyone. If I hear a knock on the door, and my neighbor is pissed that they can hear my TV, I wouldn't be surprised. In some freelance work I do, some of my clients know I'm good at what I do (I'm not a bragger either), yet will go as far as giving me the silence treatment after a gig if I made a small mistake because I was at the absolute limit of what I can deliver. Sometimes this even comes up due to physical limitations. I've been really sick the past few days, still had to work both of my jobs, yet not only do others not care that I'm sick (which is not a big deal), but a few have gotten *mad* that I've been operating on minimal sleep too and just can't deliver 100% right now. Whether that's meeting up to hang out, or a work thing.

Again, I have a strong feeling that my ex making me feel like I was a terrible person pretty much every day has not helped me. Example there, she'd seem upset, so I'd take a few minutes away from my desk at work to call her and see what's wrong and cheer her up. She'd actually get more mad at me, and not talk to me the rest of the day. It's getting better quickly, but it gouged the shit out of my self esteem.",19Jan2020,1
702,"Background: Coming from a culture where mental health and psychological services aren't taken as seriously as I would hope it would be, it took me a look of courage to find some therapists to work on some of the social/relationship issues I've come across. While I wait for my first session next week, I wanted to know

Issue: **How does one stay friends with someone for more than a couple of months?** I've realized that ever since I left my parents house, in the context of making friends I would be super excited to meet someone and get to know them.

* When I get bored with them within a matter of weeks to a couple of months, I completely move on to another person and rinse and repeat.
* My longest lasting friendship was 9 months and we bonded over our struggles and depression and that fell apart recently. (I think we may have fell apart as soon as she was getting back on her feet)

Back in August I met a friend who I only had waved at whenever we crossed paths, but never got the chance to talk. Until the end of 2019, we've been good friends and currently I am getting bored of this person. How do I **continue** to maintain a good relationship with this person?

707,"I lived with my parents and three cats. I bought a 7-month-old cat before moving into a studio a couple weeks ago. I thought I’d really appreciate the company, but I found myself missing my old cats and resenting having to clean out the litter box every day, play with the cat a lot, wake up multiple times during the night to stop the cat from yowling and knocking things over, hide under my covers because the cat attacks my face and hands, and be greeted with a bad smell every time I come home. I know a lot of the issues stem from me not being home most of the time. The cat’s alone in a small apartment with a view of a parking lot. I think I could deal with the responsibility of taking care of the cat, but I feel almost constant guilt that the cat must be so lonely and bored. The adoption papers suggested he be placed with children and cats. I’d get another cat to keep him company but the apartment charges so much to own one cat. I just can’t afford it. 

My parents offered to take him in; that way he’d always have company and could go outside whenever he wanted. For the week or so he was with me at my parents’ house, two of the other cats were okay with him but seemed kind of annoyed by his energy (like “oh no not another one”). The other cat, who doesn’t usually get along with other cats, hated him and would hiss and be grumpy all the time. So while I think my cat would be happier there, I’m worried about the other cat’s happiness. And what if he IS happy here? I don’t think so, but it’s impossible to tell. 

I know the longer I wait, the harder it would be on the cat to change homes. I’m not a social person, so I like having a cat to come home to, feed, play with, etc. I feel awful saying it, but I don’t like having to always cater to a cat that will be unhappy otherwise. I just keep thinking “What if I hadn’t adopted him and he got put in a nice home with lots of space and attention?”
It’s ridiculous how much this is upsetting me. I recognize I overanalyze things, but I don’t think the resentment and guilt will go away until I figure out what’s best for the cat.",19Jan2020,1

709,"I don’t really know where to start off with this. I’ve had a rough childhood, I won’t go into details but it’s caused me a lot of emotional destress. I’ve currently been in a relationship for about 6 months now. My problem is that due to my emotional trauma, I have a lot of break downs where I barley have a grip on my emotions.  I cry and have a terrible achy feeling in my heart. The majority of the time I talk to my partner. It’s never about accusing them of doing anything it’s more about how I think I’m just not good enough. I’ve read up online a little and I’ve learned that I’m most likely insecure and that could be somewhat linked to my childhood. Another good thing to know is this is my very first “healthy relationship” I’ve been in and it’s definitely taking some time to get used to. I feel like I may be dragging our relationship down with being so emotionally broken all the time. He always tells me he loves me, and I know that’s very true.

Months go by, he moved to another city but I stumbled upon his instagram and decided to talk to him again but only as friends and I made that very clear, because he was a good company afterall.

He agreed AND said he would only talk to me again as friends and friends only. I was very happy and relieved since we both wanted the same.

We started hanging out again when he is in town, we talk a lot online and he even called me once to talk about life. The call lasted an hour an a half! Not once he flirted with me.

One night, though, he asks me what did I think of us having something serious. I was disappointed but answered that there was no chance because I don't like him like that. He stops talking to me.

I hang out with his friend on NYE and he tells me how much ""A"" likes me and I'm the only girl he would ever be in a relationship with. I tell his friend that there's no way.

Two days later, ""A"" posts an instagram story with another girl and a few days later, he posts a picture of them on his feed making the relationship official.

My boyfriend (37 M) is a really great guy, we’ve been seeing each other for about 3 months now, we’re exclusive, and talk about a future of marriage and kids together. My boyfriend is also a dentist (I want to apply to dental school) and has been very supportive and informative with helping me apply and get into this profession. 

My mom googled my boyfriend’s name (he owns his own dental practice) and woke me up this morning and threatened to kick me out because of it. She said she wants to see my texts and doesn’t condone me seeing him under her roof. I’ve told her that I pay for my phone and it’s none of her business to see my texts and that the guy texting me (my boyfriend) is a really nice dentist helping me with dental school applications/profession opportunities. She said if that is the case she wants to see the texts to clear my name. She says if I don’t she and my dad will kick me out.

742,"So I have a roommate and he never ever ever goes in his room and hangs out only in the living room. Any time I have friends over he will be in the middle of the living room, and guests don't always want to be around him which forces us to reside in the kitchen or my small bedroom. We've even had to sit on the floor in the corner of the living room before because we don't to socialize with him in the couch area on ""girls nights"". I've never said anything to him about it and he doesn't understand social queues but I think I may want to ask him to stop hogging the living room for once. Or is that just wrong??

Now I want to have a potential boyfriend over and want it to be semi-private, is it wrong to ask my roommate to stay in his room for the night?? I know for a fact he will not leave the living room. (by the way this is my condo that I own, i let him rent a room in it) he's also lived there for 7 months and has nothing in his bedroom expect a bed; fucking subhuman, so I understand why he never goes in his room unless he's going to sleep.",19Jan2020,1
743,"I'm 25 years old and recently moved to a new city. Upon moving, I started a position as an assistant manager at a boutique. It has been okay! I have a background in fashion so, while it isn't perfect, it isn't far off from my interests and I'm gaining some good skills. My coworkers are lovely, I have gotten two raises in the last 5 months, and I am learning a lot about running a small business. This job is my first, ""real"" full-time job since graduating college; I am a dancer/artist and, prior to this position, had been hustling around NYC trying to make ends meet while pursuing my craft. Although I am now in a full-time position, I certainly haven't abandoned my craft; I have been hustling on the side working on a variety of creative projects, things I'm REALLY passionate about, after work and on weekends. One of these creative projects I've been working on has turned into a really great business idea that two friends and I have slowly been chipping away at and trying to build. The fact that I work full-time is beginning to get in the way of this particular business project - especially because my business partners DON'T have full-time gigs and have more time than I do to put into it. While I do make as much time as possible to work on this, I am starting to feel like weekends and evenings just aren't ENOUGH. This project really excites me and I believe it can be something really great, especially once I'm able to put more time and effort into it. The more I put energy into this project, the more depressed I feel going into my full-time job Monday through Friday. If we were making real profit on this side business, it would be a no-brainer... I would leave my full-time job to really put 100% into it! But right now, though I know its potential, it IS fully in its beginning stages and it is a **big** passion project. 

Additionally, there is the issue of my boss and coworkers; I feel as though they really depend on me and it would be a burden on them to have to find another assistant manager after just 5 months of finding me, someone they've really enjoyed having so far. I've fit in with the team pretty seamlessly, which they have explicitly expressed to me. I know for a fact that it will be taken personally if I decide to leave. One more added complication that's small but that is plaguing the back of my mind - I'm getting married in the fall of 2021, and currently should be saving as much $$ as possible for the wedding.

**I guess the question is this: should I leave my full-time job and pick up more of a part-time gig (like a cafe or restaurant or another boutique that doesn't need so much of my time) in order to have MORE time to put into myself and my business, or do I make the more ""responsible"" decision and stay in my full-time position longer for the financial security even though I am not extremely happy and feel like I'm abandoning the things that** ***really*** **matter to me?**",19Jan2020,1

I know I should think of this as a lesson learned but I can’t help but feel so dumb for wasting so much time and energy on someone who ended up pretty much using me. I know it’s not exactly his fault for simply not liking me enough but all the mixed signals and leading on just fucking sucked. It all just SUCKS and it’s almost been a month since I decided to end things (even though I didn’t really want to) and I’m so hurt and it’s all so shit and I keep having these breakdowns ALL the fucking time.

745,"Used to be very close friends with a girl in my class, we had our little group and hung out quite regularly.
She has always been depressed, had self-esteem issues, family issues etc. but we have always been supportive, loving and helped her to get through all the troubles and generally tried to stop her from doing things that could be harmful and dangerous.

For multiple different reasons we cut contact with her, but some guilt of ""leaving"" her was there as well as worry for her health, so some people, who were talking to her, kept us updated about her well-being periodically.
We found out that her family issues became worse, she lost a dangerous amount of weight as well as we noticed that she lost a lot of confidence that she gained while we were hanging out.
Today my friend informed me that, apparently, she is planning on committing suicide.

I feel like I have some responsibility for her now, especially since we were friends, though I understand that her mental health is her issue and she is responsible for her actions, but, at the same time, I feel like a hypocrite for not caring about this at first, since I struggle with depression myself and I know what's it like to feel lost, unwanted and feel like suicide is a good way out.

At the end of last year i told her that i liked her and she said that she didn’t feel the same way and thought we should stay as friends which is fine. She said “i’ll be over here less often now”.

765,"Background: My parents and my husband and I purchased a house together, where we all live. I work from home part time and take care of our various animals during the day so I spend the most time with my sister. And unfortunately, that means I spend the most time with the boyfriend as well. My sister is 16, her boyfriend is 15. None of us like him. He's selfish, he's rude, he's manipulative, etc. I try to keep in mind that he's only 15, I really do. And I'm well aware that they're not going to last, so I do my best to bide my time and wait for the relationship to dissolve. 

The first problem is I cannot stand how he behaves in my house! He's here at least 2 times during the school week and all weekend long. He comes in bosses my dogs around, takes over the TV playing videogames all day (not even interacting with my sister), expects us to buy special food for him because he's picky (literally expects us to order take out for JUST him every night even though we've cooked a meal for the whole family), and then on top of it all if you say anything he doesn't like he gets all mopey and makes a big fuss so my sister has to baby him for a half an hour to speak. It's so frustrating!! 

Second, my husband also caught them doing sexual things in her hangout space which has since been addressed but now I don't really feel comfortable letting them go up there while I'm downstairs taking care of housework and such and cannot constantly check on them.

Third, he doesn't drive, my sister doesn't drive and his parents don't give him rides so it's up to myself, my husband and my parents to provide rides for him. I'm sick of staying up until 11pm to take him home, but if I, or my husband refuse, then my mom typically gets stuck doing it.

And finally, the reason I am writing this post. Yesterday, we went and adopted a new puppy. My sister picked this dog out and we drove for 3 hours round trip to go pick him (the puppy) up. It took majority of the day (we spent two hours at the adoption event because we got there too early) and then when we got home we had to introduce the puppy to our 3 older dogs, which was a process because ya know, dogs. Anyway, when things settled she wanted the boyfriend to come meet the puppy. Okay fine, my mom goes and gets him and he is all over the puppy. A bit later, I correct the puppy for nipping at the boyfriend, because we don't want the puppy to bite the older dogs and make them upset. So boyfriend freaks out! He starts crying saying ""You just don't want me to bond with him because you think I'm going to leave your sister! You didn't even want me to go with to get the puppy!""
Which is totally true, I didn't want him to go with to get the puppy because he would have made it all about himself and we would have ended up with the puppy he chose, not the one my sister wanted. But I was really just correcting the puppy because that's how we have trained all our other dogs. 

Basically, now he is upset with me and as much as I don't like him I know it's not my place. How can I avoid further conflict with him? I don't want this to impact my relationship with my sister.",19Jan2020,1

I often get phone calls on my days off but I always answer and help because I can and I don't want any downtime for the company. I don't mind because I can troubleshoot quickly with them over the phone and get things going. I like my job and I'm quite proficient at it.

So, I'm on days off. I get get a call at 4am from Joe. They have lost at communication...it takes a whopping 10 min over the phone to get them going. Everything is running smoothly... They have no more issues. And no downtime because we were so quick with the fix.

Joe sends me a text ""everything is going great but the customer would like someone to bring a spare cable out to location just in case it happens again... And one of our ccl's is acting funny can you bring us another ?""

I forwarded the message to my work group chat. At 11am (when I woke up) ....

770,"So for the past 2 years I've been having an existential crisis over how much of a garbage person I am. I decided to change myself when I entered college a year ago. However, simply deciding to do it... Didn't really help. I keep repeating the same mistakes I always have been making, pointing that out to myself, hating myself for that, trying for a day or two and coming back to my default state of being a garbage person.

Some of the main problems I have with myself is my incredibly short attention span and my complete lack of self-control. For example: I tell myself to study a subject, I do it for five minutes, then check YouTube, then go to sleep, because I've been on the internet the whole day. So I delete YouTube, tell myself to study, ro it for five minutes, then start making music or something like that and end up not doing anything again. And this loop continues indefinitely, piling up my self-hatred to the point, where I'm asking people on the internet for help with that.

771,"I [18M] haven’t consumed incel content in months but I’m still afflicted by it.

To preface this let me say that even though I was initially pissed that subs like /r/incels and /r/braincels were banned, I’m ultimately glad that such content isn’t as easily available to me and people like me. Thank god that the incel forums have shitty UI’s. 

With that said... I soaked in incel content for a LONG time, like 2.5 years. I still remember that day when I saw someone link to /r/incels in /r/AskReddit and I clicked on it because I had no idea what it meant and I was curious. That world of Chads and incels and normies is still the world I mentally live in. I’m not really ideologically an incel anymore, but emotionally (as in involuntary feelings) I’m 100% steeped in the beliefs. 

I still don’t feel empathy for suffering people like I used to before I discovered the black pill, and especially don’t feel empathy for women. I used to feel human camaraderie with other people, and genuinely felt that others and myself are deserving of dignity and happiness. Now, people aren’t worth much more to me than dogs or rabbits, I hold no particular disdain for heinous criminals, and not even my own self-interest is that appealing, I’m just like a specter roving the world. I still base my self worth on how much sex I’m having (hint: none) and absolutely despise people who are younger than me and having sex. To phrase it lightly, I would be entirely complacent and maybe even complicit with some of the worst atrocities imaginable if I was ever put in any sort of situation that required ethics. I’ve had plenty of thoughts that I would never in a million years type on the internet or tell a therapist. It’s all emotional really, like whenever the topic of sex and relationships comes up anywhere, I just feel sad and I can’t turn the sadness off. 

Recently it’s gotten much worse. Lots of anxiety, sadness, angst, regret, and hate because I’m not having sex and don’t have a relationship. The shitty part is that things have actually gotten significantly better recently, I had more social interactions, I had a much greater ability to stick to my goals, I made a tinder and actually got matches (about 11 in 3 days, I’m quantitatively not that ugly), but I can’t shake the feeling I’m living a lie. I feel like even if I use tinder or real life or whatever to have sex, I’ll still feel bitter and jaded that I wasn’t able to experience “young love” and had to wait until after high school. 

Any success I have is through the frame of reference of the lucky incel that got away. I am not a successful person, I am an incel piloting a successful body. I went through one really sad moment after jacking off where I saw how ugly I was and lost the empathy I cultivated over the past few months of not browsing incel content, lost the political beliefs I developed, lost motivation to complete my academic/athletic goals. Now all I want is to have a day of fun where I have lots of sex, do some drugs, ^causesomepropertydamageandlossoflife, and drop dead. 

What am I supposed to do now? I hear the platitudes over and over again (Sex isn’t everything, toxic attitude only holds you back, etc) but they never help. I’m never going to a therapist because I will never admit incel thoughts to anyone in person. What am I missing? My mind is still on the incel operating system even though I have no apps or programs for it.",19Jan2020,1
773,"TW: Cursing, Mentions of CSA, Threats, Possible Verbal Abuse, etc

I'm 17 and a senior in high school. I feel bad for saying I want nothing to do with her but rn it's true. I'm a trans pansexual man and she seems to be against both. She has gone far enough to call me slurs and other horrible things and demand I live by her definition of male (no pink, all surgeries, all possible hormones, no feminine stuff, sport loving jock type) for at least 3 years. Since we moved to do a wildfire she hasn't been able to get all her medicine (she has a pseudo tumor cerebri) and she takes this opportunity to take it out on everyone else. I can't call the police, cps, get her 5150ed or anything bc I'm lowkey scared of her and I also don't want to make it harder on my dad. Sometimes she goes through phases of being really angry and aggressive (hasn't hit anyone yet tho). She'll yell at me and my dad and slam doors extremely hard and very loud. She has essentially called me worthless, saying I was everything my grandmother said I was (No good, worthless, just a fuck up and a dumbass) she has called me a bitch and a fucking baby (because I told her the way she was acting didn't make me, or anyone else, feel great). She has made comments insinuating that she was gonna ""be gone"" when my dad got back from work (the last argument started bc his job isn't all that good with schedules) so far all of her threats (hurting herself, messing with the car, slashing 2 of the tires) have only been empty threats (the one that got to me the most was last time she said that if we got her 5150ed, she come after us when she got out). When I came out as a trans man, she tried to force me to call very homophobic and transphobic family members (1 which was her father who physical abuse his 2 kids) and she got pissed when I told her it would put me in a potentially harmful situation. She tries to blame me and my dad for all that goes wrong and her excuse is ""I'm in pain"" but that doesn't give her a right to do this stuff and I get really pissed when she goes and takes it out on my dad (he's the only one working and takes care of me and my little brother bc she's always ""in too much pain to""). I've also told her I'm not comfortable with changing my brother's diaper or anyone's or giving him a bath (he is 5) (I was sexually abused by my grandfather from 11 until sometime after I was 14) she told me to ""fucking get over it and deal with it"" and I was a shitty babysitter for it and that I didn't think parents should have kids to play babysitter or dishwasher (don't get me wrong, I'm okay with chores just not the way she angrily demands shit). A couple days ago I was joking and called my brother to the kitchen a couple times bc he asked what but I didn't want to tell him yet (I was originally gonna ask if he wanted to help me make food and if he wanted anything but did what Stewie did in family guy to a lesser degree) my mom made the comment ""If I was him, I'd hit you"" and she was dead fucking serious. I tried to tell her that was messed up and she brought up she would've hit me hard enough to scare the fuck outta me. And I can't get any of my homework done with this going on for days whenever she feels like it. She always claims she owns me and every part of me (it sounded really weird/creepy ngl) and that she ""owns my ass"".

I live in the Bay Area and I can’t afford to live on my own. The car I’m using isn’t mine. I’ve been taking care of my brother (13) now since he was (4). My mother hasn’t had a job for the last 15 years. My father thinks because he lets me use his car I should put up with the drama from my piece of shit brother and mother. They both start physical fights with me and I’m tired of it. I started working again after recovering from a major depression episode. I left the house and I am currently living out of a car. He said I could use his car but he thinks that I’m overreacting and can’t admit that they have been treating me badly. My therapist said they are the cause of my stress. They are religious nuts and don’t believe in therapy and think I am possessed. I told him I don’t want to live there anymore so I’m living out of a car right now. His car but the longer I use it the longer he thinks we are on good terms. I have been at my current job for 6 months and make $1900 a month. I have around $10K saved up and I want to get a new car. Toyota Corolla Hybrid or Kia Optima S. I’m going to finish my AA Degree at the end of this semester. My monthly expenses are $260 a month for food/gas/laundry/phone and gym. When I get the car it’ll be another $350-400 for payment and insurance so $600 a month. My question is what I am doing smart. I don’t want hem in my life anymore. Going to pick my brother and drop him off to school everyday and seeing these assholes isn’t good for my mental health. Also the brother that hasn’t ever had a job and starts fights with everyone is getting an inheritance. Their $1.5 million dollar house and inheritance money. I paid for my college,phone,clothes, and they paid everything for him. What’s the point of me being an adult if the brother who never earned shit gets all the money? He let me use his pos car but I’m paying all expenses for the car. What do you guys think?",19Jan2020,1
777,"I’m so tired of feeling sad and alone and crying all the time

My dad doesn’t like to be around when I’m upset, and I’m nervous as to how he’ll respond",19Jan2020,1
778,"My girlfriend's childhood best friend (who she dated and is still in love with her) is coming in from out of town and they're getting dinner with some of their old friends, but my girlfriend said she doesn't want me to go because her best friend ""has a thing against straight men."" Her best friend, who has also never met me, constantly talks shit about me to my girlfriend.
My girlfriend also has a guy friend who dislikes me because I had an issue with them hanging out alone when he's openly admitted to liking her and has asked her to run away with him several times.
Every time I talk to her about either of them she gets really defensive and thinks I'm trying to control her like her abusive ex, so I'm trying to figure out whether me having an issue with those friends is unreasonable or not. Is it normal to have friends who hate your partner, or am I right to be bothered by it?",19Jan2020,1
779,"So before I go into the actual question, I would like to point out that I am 15 (almost 16), and my parents and I have a great relationship. I feel comfortable telling them about things like this as I have a strong connection with them. For example, I was able to tell them I tried vaping a while back and they didn’t get upset, we just had a discussion about it and that was that. But this is a bit different, as cannabis (weed/hemp both come from the cannabis plant) is a more serious topic in our family than nicotine. Both my parents use weed and I found a 510 thread pen and a couple 500mg carts in my dad’s drawer, so it isn’t too serious, but this would be a much more tense conversation with my parents. 

So, I decided to buy about a 1/2oz of hemp flowers and a dry-herb vape while back and have been using it every now and then. I have been sneaking around the house using it and I feel like it would be so much easier to just stop hiding and be comfortable around them. Is there a good way I can bring this up without too much of a fuss and it being a decent convo? 

Also, quick side note, I just bought a sex toy yesterday and was getting out of the shower, when my sister opens the door and see it, along with my bottle of lube. What do I do? I’m really embarrassed right now. It doesn’t look like a sex toy, but if you just thought a little harder it’s a bit obvious. How do I tell my sister (13), and how do I make this a lot less awkward between us?",19Jan2020,1
780,"Background: I am a second year student doing a dual bachelors in education and science. I enjoy the science part of my degree quite a bit but don’t enjoy education much. My parents are the reason I chose to do education, as they convinced me that it is a good career that will allow me to settle down in the country I’m studying in (I’m from a third world country so this is important).

This all made very good sense to me, and that’s why I pursued it. If I am gonna pay so much tuition I should at least ensure I am getting an almost confirmed job out of it right? My original plan was to work in education for a couple of years and then focus on doing science. However because I am not enjoying I am considering dropping education. 

Pros of dropping education:

1) After I drop it i will be eligible to study a semester abroad in Asia, which is a massive dream of mine.

2) I will be doing more courses that I enjoy, will be able to explore my interests, and less work that feels like a chore.

Cons:

1) A science bachelor means practically nothing, will need to study further which means i need more $$$$$ that I may not have access to 

2) No guaranteed job upon graduation

3) No stability.

What should I do? Should I just suck it up since its temporary or take a chance a drop it all together? Thank you in advance",19Jan2020,1

782,"A few hours ago my boyfriend broke up with me. We've dated a year. I've met his parents twice and both times were just short dinners. I don't know why they hate me but they do.
A few months ago, his parents gave him an ultimatum that was essentially stop going to the college that we pay for or stop dating her. He lied to them and he dated me in secret. I didn't know for a while and then eventually found out because he was acting weird.
Last week, I guess they found out that we were still dating. He didn't tell me all week and argued with them about it. I don't know the details but I think that they probably gave him a similar ultimatum. And I guess we're done now. 
I don't know what to do. Or what I did wrong for them to hate me so much. I don't really know where to go for advice or even what kind of advice to ask for because no one gets it, and my best friend told me that he couldn't talk because he was on his anniversary date, etc.

790,"I go through phases of really hating and then loving my mom, and its really frustrating. Like, for example, she really pissed me off a couple of days ago when I asked her to stop commenting on my appearance, and then tried to justify why she did. Im just posting a bunch of images of our most recent text messages, as I feel as if I were to give a summary my bias would eventually come into play. She apologies alot, but she's also been really shitty to me in the past, like when I wrote her an angry letter when i was 16 and she hung it up next to my transcripts and accomplishments because ""she loved all aspects of me, even ones that hurt her"" or when she kicked a hole in the bathroom door because I locked it when I was having a panic attack. But shes also been a good mom in some other aspects, and I can see how being a single mother is hard.

I just wanna know if im being a dick or not man, alot of these messages were written in anger and im not sure if i should apologize or something

791,"M, 21 years old. 
Maybe it's just me overthinking everything but right now I'm terrified realising the path my life is taking. 

Context:
I guess I realised pretty early that there was something different with me. I've never been able to connect with people since childhood and not from lack of trying, trust me I've tried and still do. I was that kid that kept to himself. I learnt the hard way that i had to act ""normal"" around everyone. 

I have anxiety, clinical depression and have a complete mental breakdown every month like clockwork. I have zero appetite lately and can go throughout the day without realising I hadn't eaten. I'm halfway through uni right now and haven't told anyone except a few therapists. I guess I'm that good at pretending I'm okay.

Recently I watched the Manhunt series on Netflix and I'm terrified how much I related to Ted on some level. I do not want to go down a similar path of solitude. 

I have developed hobbies ( painting, writing, entomology, gardening) to keep my mind busy but even that doesn't help me anymore.  I did go to a couple of therapists for a short while but it didn't really help. I felt the sessions just going in circles and I couldn't afford it anyway. I haven't taken medication for this but I do sometimes light a J during the dark days. I just want to be happy. And I'm afraid eventually I wont be strong enough to fight this. 

What do I do? I know I can never make it go away because that's how my brain is I guess but any advice would he helpful. A different perspective maybe",19Jan2020,1
792,I (16m) am growing my hair out long. I used to get a short back and sides and the top of my head already has very long hair while the sides are at least 4 inches shorter. Should I cut it all to the same length before I grow it or just leave it to its own devices?,19Jan2020,1
793,"I am afraid that my friends hate my personality. I am pretty extroverted and not afraid to say what's on my mind (if it's not offensive or a sensitive topic). I sometimes might get passive-aggressive if I'm not feeling my best. But I always apologize for anything rude I've said and my friends say It's fine. 

When the three of us are together, I always feel like a 3rd wheel. They always make this eye contact that says ""are you thinking what I'm thinking?"". They also criticise me and make me feel so terrible. Every time we meet, one of them is rude to me for a while and then drops it like nothing happened.

I think they don't like me at all, and they might be talking shit behind my back. They've done it to a friend of ours. I know they don't hold back when it comes to gossiping. I can feel it how our friendship is not what it used to be. The worst part is that I actually can't even confront them because a) i would sound crazy and they would just dismiss it because i have no actual evidence and b) even if i had evidence, i couldn't do anything because they're basically my only close friends and i am terrified of being alone

should I just keep acting like nothing's wrong? or should I hope nothing is actually going on? maybe just apologize for everything I've ever done that got on their nerves? I really don't want to lose them, we've known each other for 8 years and they're the only close friendship i have.",19Jan2020,1

My dad lives just down the road from the school. It's a really nice school and I've gotten a lot of opportunities there, not to mention my friend group, but my dad and his girlfriend are horribly manipulative and emotionally abusive (to say the least). At this point I don't want to live with him at all, but if I were to live with my mom I wouldn't be able to open enroll across state lines.
At least, that's what I've been told, and I can't find anything about it online, so what do I do? I don't want to potentially sabotage my future by switching schools (the area school in my mom's district is notoriously not very good) but I don't want to live with my dad.",19Jan2020,1
797,"I’ve recently gotten myself into a relationship and we’re both quite happy about it. Well, I assume that she’s happy about it since she hasn’t broken up yet.
I can’t get into any detail why she is the way she is but she has her fair share of mental health problems, depression, anxiety and a lot of trust issues. (We basically came together because I’m experienced in that as well and I somewhat helped her out in her depressive phases, or so I understand) She has problems telling people how she feels, as far as I could collect because she doesn’t want to make them be worried about her. She also has a big problem showcasing her appreciation or accepting it. For example she doesn’t like it when I call her cute or compliment her a lot. 
I know why she has these problems and especially in a quite young relationship with us both being unexperienced about it, it takes a lot of time. I just need some sort of validation for how to react. I can only try to blend of my feelings for her so that it hurts less when she isn’t countering them. 
Talking with her isn’t an option right now, I already expressed that and I was so scared that I started doubting her intentions in managing it in a better way since she said “I literally can’t express my feelings.. I just can’t” but after some time she realized that isn’t true at all. 
From what I heard from her best friend she is still mad at me for that and that when I talk to her in a serious manner, I’m like a psychologist and I always doubt her negativity. (f.e “I literally can’t accept it.” “Yes, you can. I totally trust in you that you can and that this negativity isn’t really you. I believe in your true self.”
Anyways, even if there’s no distinct answer for this problem, it just feels good to write this off off my soul. Thank you..",19Jan2020,1

799,"So I am a 19yo who started college this year. In addition to that, 2019 was probably the worst year of my entire life as I lost family members from cancer, parents decided to go through a divorce etc. Lots of bad stuff pilling on which affected my mental health greatly. I also moved out and live in a dorm for the first time ever, oh and i also moved countries as well, which means i left all of my friends and one side of my family behind in order to pursue my career as a chemist.  

My mother, who is extremely supportive, told me before i started this uni (which is considered to be one of the hardest to graduate from in this country) told me and made me promise her that if i had ANY doubts about this choice i should tell her and we would figure something out.

Now, its been only a semester so far and i have had great trouble keeping up. Im lost whether i actually like this field of study or I just liked it when i was good at it in high school ? I have heard people say ''If you truly find something you like then you will be good at it'' or that it comes ''naturally'' yet i have 0 motivation. Is it all just in my head and if my mental health gets better will i bounce back and suddenly be good at it and get obsessed with chemistry all over again? Or is it just not for me? Is it too soon to drop out and search for something else or should i just keep trying ? Its only been one semester, less than a year.

However another burden i have is... disappointing everyone and most importantly my mom. I love her so much and i believe she deserves so much better than a failing stupid indecisive kid who is good at nothing. I know i promised her that i would tell her if i had any doubts but honestly id rather die than make her feel disappointed in me. I know she is my mother but I dont want to do that to her. Am i just that dumb? Why cant i get myself to work hard enough? Is it because of me and my messed up brain or because this school is not for me? Why am i such a lazy piece of shit just wasting my life? I dont know what i want honestly. I am currently failing almost every exam i take. I am so mad at myself. I keep procrastinating for no reason. I am barely capable of taking care of myself. Its so hard. But then again if i leave this school and switch to another profession will i fall back again and be like this? I keep taking 'breaks' but it all ends the same with me being okay for a few days then repeating the cycle again. More breaks more absences more messing up. And for some reason i cant break the cycle. Oh and btw, i have tried contacting therapists and school counselors and every response i got was either nothing or they were too busy. I just do not know what to do anymore.

I am so sorry for ranting but i needed to get this out of my system. I also apologize for typos or not making sense since i wrote this while sobbing.",19Jan2020,1

The net bill has always been me paying it with one of my debit cards from my bank and me getting their parts of the money in cash for the last month i got it back this month not. I recent opened a new back account got rid of my paycard i got paid on from work finally .  
Now heres the thing its been a week or 2 and 2 of the roomies havent paid me for it.  Which sucks because im flat broke i had to go tell my bf hey i need you guys to pay me back i have 5$ to my name and i need tampons which sadly 5$ isnt gunna cover.  I told him idc if he pays me back because we have a deal he basicly provides all the food in the house to me if il short.  But the other 2 roomies i get nothing from them in ways of trade. 

Before you ask i can not go up to them and say hey wheres my money because i speak 0 spanish they speak 0 english.  Bf said i would get it but welll this is causing issues because now hes starting to state im using my money on useless things 30$ on a game and 30$ on coat is why im broke . Which is a lie i would have 45$ which i could help provide with more food . And i remind him  its not my fault they havent paid me back.

Last month it took a few days of bugging them to get my money back but  i had a shitty paycheck this payperiod and the struggles real

803,"Sorry for the length of this!

I'm currently enrolled in a masters program at college but graduated from my undergrad degree last year and saw the masters as a ""buffer"" year since I had no job lined up and didnt feel ready to leave college. 

I've recently been offered a professional job which starts in July which I'm going to accept. However, my masters finishes in September. If I return for semester 2 (and drop out before the job begins), I would have to pay the full fees, but graduate with less than the full award. 

If I drop out now, I would get half of the fees back. In a disgustingly privileged way, money is not an issue in this respect, although the new job will require a fair amount of savings to get me on my feet in a new city (which I have, but would run dry to do this). 

I have a holiday job at home which I enjoy and know I could keep on until my professional job starts in July. I had planned to return to college essentially as a ""final hoorah"" and for social reasons, and then drop out in time for the new job but have realised this makes little sense as I will be financially far worse off. 

On the other hand, I thrive at college and love college life but do feel conflicted as, in the same respect, this is my last chance to spend proper time with my parents (who I get along with super well and was surprisingly super homesick for last semester) as well as make a good amount of money to stand me in good stead.

 I may be able to make arrangements with my work at home to work 4 days a week, allowing me to travel to my college town every couple of weekends for nights out etc but I know this wouldn't be the same as being there. 

Any experiences of similar decisions and how the worked out? Or perspective/advice on how I should make this decision? 

TLDR: return to masters program at financial loss for mainly social/lifestyle reasons or stay at home until new job begins in July and make money/spend time with parents",19Jan2020,1
804,"So as the title says, I am getting kicked out by my mother tomorrow after an argument I had with her. The fight was really bad. She says I am rude, and a disrespectful, useless person (even though I paid for most stuff last few months) and told me to pack already and tomorrow I'll be leaving.

When roommate B is away from the apartment, roommate A is a nice and agreeing person that behaves and even try to be as non-disturbing as possible. When roommate B appears, however, roommate A becomes a totally different person: tries to tease and roast me, and make somewhat offensive jokes referencing things that very much annoy me. Roommate B laughs and sometimes throws something in too, but, unlike roommate A, doesn't initiate any of this. It doesn't seem to be conventional bullying, as they don't try to overstep their bounds and get in my personal space. I don't get this behavior.

We are all dudes btw, and once I've seen a mention somewhere that it's normal for men to insult each other in a group. Is this it? And why doesn't roommate A act the same way when we're alone? I'm very much unaccustomed to this and don't find it normal.

I give her a ride everyday to and from school and i feel like she doesn’t really appreciate it. I also drive her everywhere else too. On some occasions i pick her up from her job which requires me to take a freeway to get there. She offers to help pay for gas but she just says that sometimes in the moment to be nice. She always talks about boys and is obsessed with them and i didn’t mind that at first but it’s become too much i’m sick of it. She’s so egotistical and is obviously obsessed with herself YET she still complains about how ugly she is which doesn’t make sense when her whole ig is pictures of her. I don’t wanna be rude but she’s kinda of not the smartest lol and it’s difficult to keep up with that. I feel like she doesn’t understand responsibilities. Last week she was with me while i was getting gas and that exact morning she said she would help me pay for gas so when i politely brought it up(i only brought it up this once time because i was sick of it), she was like i never remember saying that. even if u didn’t say that, it’s like shouldn’t you anyways like i drive you everywhere.

The family just hired me on the spot. They didn’t look into my background. They basically said, “Okay cool start tomorrow”. They don’t check up on us.

The problem is, I can’t reasonably stay on a schedule of being here seven days a week. I’m in a cna class now, and then I’ll be starting a full time job at a facility. I’ll only be with this woman a few days a week for a lot less hours in a few months.

I worry for her safety in the future. A lot of undesirable people sometimes use these type of situations to do seedy things like steal or abuse the person they care for - especially unsupervised. She’s also an extremely easy case - walks unassisted, transfers unassisted.

I wish I could have paid him or could pay him now but I have no way. I never gave him a specific date of paying but the last thing I said was that I am working on it and I intend to pay? I feel like such a shitty person, actually I am a shitty person. It all just feels so out of control. 

Not to mention, he used intimidation and would knock on my door randomly and loud. He would bring this mean girl over and they would wait outside my room til I came out and one time she verbally attacked me and I didnt even know her. He said that was his witness i felt so caught off guard. I have PTSD mind you so I'm a very neurotic, unsocial, anxious person :-(

810,"One of my relatives recently told me she has a bad feeling someone may be sneaking into her apartment during the day. She's noticed some small items go missing, most notably some prescription pain meds which she counted and would notice maybe 5 or 6 less until she started hiding them. She's also noticed stamps disappearing and some food supplies like honey going down in volume.

I was skeptical because she has a roommate that works from home every day, but there is a window where the roomate goes to the gym in the apartment for 1-2 hours every day so that would be the window for someone to get in. Its small, but if there is someone sneaking in they do seem to be pretty cautious and don't take anything major aside from the pills (hence food and stamps...)

She suspects the maintenance staff might be to blame. She doesn't think the roommate is responsible.

813,"To give some background advice I’ll list the basics:

- I am a couple years out of High School.
- I have worked retail for a year and 4 months.
- I am miserable and bored constantly in retail and I know food service is more or less the same.
- I want to learn to work on a film set.
- I don’t have any movie rental stores near me I could work at.

I am so sick of working for little pay and getting no closer to my goal to work in film. I know film school is more or less a hit or miss situation. Some people find it really helps them find their path in film and others say it’s a waste of time and to jump into the career head on. The problem is that I don’t know how to do that.

I would love to eventually work as a Director or Writer for film, but I don’t know what steps I can take career wise either at an entry level or to get my name out there on social movie group platforms. Any advice would be very helpful as I want to quit my current job ASAP.

825,"Sorry if this is awkward, I’m on mobile.

I remember clearly the first time I was home alone. I was 8 years old and sitting at the top of the stairs where I could see the front and back door and had a clear view over both floors. I had a knife clenched in my hand and I was terrified. It was completely unnecessary but 8 year old me thought it was life or death.

I can laugh at myself now and say “oh wow this is so petty and stupid” but when I’m in the same situation now that I’m older and the sun goes down I freak out. I have to do a sweep of the house every time I hear a noise, I turn on every light, and I lock or block every door I can. I still have my bat from when I was on the softball team at my high school and I’m grabbing it every five minutes to make myself feel more secure. There’s no point in me having it, we don’t have ‘stand your ground laws’ in my country as far as I’m aware. If I injured or killed an intruder, I’d probably face serious jail time.

I’m interrupting whatever I’m doing, every time the heating comes on or my stomach gurgles, to blockade my door and get ready to defend myself. It’s reached the point where I can only sit in silence with a bat at a vantage point in the house for hours on end. It needs to stop but I’m genuinely scared. Plus it’s really boring doing that.

I know in my mind that there’s nobody in my house. All the windows and doors are locked and closed, I would’ve heard it if anyone wanted to break in. Plus there’s nothing worth stealing in my house really. If someone wanted to rob a house they’d go over to the next street where all the fancy houses are.

I’m tired of being scared all the time because it just gets me so worked up and upset. My heart beats at a million times a minute and it makes me feel sick. Even though my rationality is screaming at me that nothing bad is going to happen, I still hear ‘voices and whispering’ downstairs and footsteps in the next room or by the door. I think I can see shadows moving in my TV reflection or in the corner of my eye. I really do know no one is there. I don’t believe my fear, I know it’s crazy and stupid that I freak out like I do but I can’t stop myself. 

If anyone has any advice I’d really appreciate it. I don’t want to be scared anymore and if it means showing vulnerability on the internet, then so be it.",19Jan2020,1

833,"Hey guys, I'll try to keep this as brief as I can. 

I moved to a new city in late May of 2019. Things were going well for the most part. In the new city, I had college friends who I adored for the most part. Throughout the rest of 2019, I've been working at my new job, learning the ropes about living alone and whatnot. After the honeymoon period of a new city, I eventually fell into a rut of trying to date women through online dating/porn addiction. I've tried things like Meetups, going out solo, and networking but its just so hard to people I vibe well with. I'm usually able to get people's numbers but at the end of the day -- I just don't like them because they didn't seem sincere upon our face to face interactions during the meetup. I fell off the meetup train and became a hermit. I only left my apartment for work, to watch a movie solo, or to grab drinks with my college friends. My diet eventually consisted of take out and fast food. In the turn of 2020, my friend and I made a pact to give up porn. So far we both are doing exceptionally well on abstaining from it. I slipped up once a week in but got back on the wagon. I've since also seeked out therapy and have been going once a week. I have my 3rd session this next week. A big breakthrough recently is that I have finally gone to the gym after such a long time. As I walk this road to recovery from porn, a lot of these feelings of loneliness/anxiety/stress are now coming up to the surface since I am not able to use porn as a means of shoveling down these feelings. I have no idea how to deal with them, they come and go. Some more intense than others. Along with this, I've realized that some of my college friends just seem toxic to me. One particular friend named Greg makes these off-hand comments that are meant to be playful but I feel like there is some hostility to them. I can't be myself around him. It just feels like I am constantly being judged by him. I am usually a jocular/easygoing person but I have to watch each and every word by Greg otherwise he'll make a joke about what I said or make me feel really stupid. Theres just not a lot of leeway. We used to be such good friends when we lived together but now its just... very different. My therapist has told me that a sense of community is helpful in the recovery from addiction. I've since have been going to a German class every Saturday and plan on signing up for this baking class in the local community college. I just feel so lost. I know I am capable of making new friends because I have done so in the past in college with joining a fraternity and other organizations but now its just so hard as a 20 something year old. Everyone out there seems like they're forcing it or just wants to get laid by going to meetups. I don't know. I am so sorry if this is long-winded. Any help is appreciated!",19Jan2020,1

837,"I’ve been equal business partners with a fellow musician for 6 years.

Their contributions to common goals have been inconsistent and attention divided, yet I forged ahead believing success would breed focus and commitment.

I’ve spent countless hours on our music, production, engineering, booking, marketing and promotion that were largely focused on this individual as the front person, admittedly I am camera shy but we were always presented as a team.

After years of this individual side dealing and seeking whatever opportunity would better their position, not ours collectively, I reached my limit.

Every time I held this person accountable they either acted surprised, defensive or ignorant to our many verbal agreements about work ethic and goals.

Recently, this person finally admitted to no interest in continuing to work with me and will not finish out our obligations to help promote an upcoming release.

Excuses like ‘toxic’ and ‘stressful’ were sighted as reasoning, as if holding someone accountable to their word was unreasonable.

This puts me in a very bad position, a release with no way of generating momentum via press, photos and shows is an uphill battle. 

Additionally, I performed video and editing services for a magazine this person worked for, in barter for publicity for the group. Due to end of our band/partnership, that offer will be rescinded by the publisher and I will not be compensated for my time and deliverables totaling in the thousands.

850,"My mother (60) has dealt with depression her entire life, within the last year she was diagnosed with bipolar and has started taking new and more medication to help stabilize. Recently she got an appointment with a psychiatrist. After one session with this doctor she was prescribed to take Lithium, 900mg a day. The doctor set up a follow up appointment 5 weeks later. 

In that time I noticed a huge change in my mother, her moods were way worse, her memory was getting worse, she was getting lost driving to places she went to everyday, she couldn't drive at night at all. Her hands started shaking, she was running into walls, and she lost at least 20 pounds. 

I knew she had been put on a new medication, but I didn't know what it was or that it was prescribed to her by a new psychiatrist. She has always been stubborn and keeps most things to herself, so the majority of these side affects were things she only hinted at, and she 100% didn't correlate any of them with the Lithium, she just chalked it up to getting older. 

Last week I get a call from her, asking for a pick up from the Emergency Room, come to find out her side effects were getting so bad that only half an hour after taking her morning dose she started loosing her vision completely. She couldn't find her car in the driveway to drive to work, and she finally put two and two together realizing that the Lithium was toxic to her body.  She called her psychiatrist for help, as she explained what was going on to the receptionist she was told (by the receptionist) to hang up, call 911, and get to the hospital. 

After hours of questioning, scans, and test in the ER she was told to stop taking the Lithium and she'd be good as soon as it got out of her system. She called the psychiatrist at least one more time within the following days and never got so much as a call back.

I just want to know if this is normal behavior for a psychiatrist, from what I can tell Lithium is a very dangerous drug, its dangerous to take with other medication (which she's on a bunch), and is especially dangerous for older people. I understand that my mom could have done her own research about this drug and learned about the dangerous side effects, but shouldn't the doctor be responsible for presenting at least some of this information? Also is it normal for a doctor to prescribe something like that and then not follow up for more that 5 weeks? And there was no need for them to tell her take an ambulance to ER (again, that was the receptionist not even the psychiatrist), couldn't have they told her over the phone to just stop taking the medication?",19Jan2020,1

We started texting in 2018, and were making plans to meet up, and then we got in an argument and stopped talking. 

I’ll go through phases where I just miss him so much that it physically hurts, and I’ll dream about him and wake up with a hole in my heart. I pass the house we used to live in on my daily commute to work, and it brings back so many memories.

Sometimes I think about what an idiot he is, and he isn’t even that attractive, and he’s not that great. But most of the time, I just miss everything about him. Sometimes I wonder if I should message him. He’s had two relationships after me. I don’t think he ever thinks about me.

I see him and spend time with him multiple times a week. I try to halt my feelings, but every time I do it never ends up working out. I try to distance myself, I remind myself that he’s straight, I tell myself that he would never find someone like me attractive, I try to do everything to beat the feelings out of me.

858,"I'm permanently disabled due to medical conditions, I can't work due to most of my time being devoted to doctor's appointments and being too disabled to work due to life threatening symptoms. I've found myself in a really toxic relationship, where I'm also financially dependent on him, and I'm leaving him because I while am disabled, I don't deserve to be treated like garbage. It took too long to realize this.

I'm on SS Disability, I'm applying for Food Stamps &amp; Medicaid. I will also be applying for SSI, even though I've been told I don't qualify but according to their online requirements, I do.

I will also be applying for Section 8 &amp; HUD, but I'm told the wait list is about 2 years. I don't know what else I can do or what else there is to apply for.

I'm restricted on the type of housing due to absurd life threatening reactions, so that's also a tough issue I'm working out. I don't know what else I can do to get this person out sooner, I'd need to be totally financially dependent on myself first.

The reality of my situation: Medicare takes a hefty chunk out of my Disability, leaving me with about $650 a month. My car insurance is currently $120, it will go down when he's off of it. My phone bill is the same, and will also go down when he's off of it. My gas is about $35, electric is about $120, and my rent is like $750. It's pretty cheap for around here, unfortunately. I'm on a wait list for a section 8 house, but that will take a while.

I don't have family to fall back on, or any friends. Anything to be done has to be able to be done by me. I just really don't know what else to do or what else I can do, but I'm sick of the way I'm being treated and how it's all being blamed on me. I need out.

861,"I just moved into a new apartment and met my neighbor, ""Nick"" who is attending the same college. I am starting my Master's degree and he is in his 2nd semester of a 4 semester program called the Bridge to Independence, a program for students with intellectual disabilities or who are on the autism spectrum. I personally expect he has high functioning autism. 

The day I moved in we swapped numbers. He has texted me every day (4 days) since, at least 2 different times each day asking to hang out. Today instead of a text he just came to the door and tried inviting himself in. On the day I moved in, my Dad and I did invite him to a public music event we were going to intend. He came but didn't leave our side for the event. 

To get to the point, I'm not sure how to handle setting a boundary with Nick. He is nice, but extremely overbearing. It took me 20 minutes to get him out of my apartment when I moved him, and he basically invited himself inside. In his 20 minutes of talking that day he also made several comments about how he had snapped on an ex GF of his because of some reason or another, which has left me slightly concerned about outbursts from him.

I'm not interested in being friends, just want to be neighborly and pretty much left alone. What do I do to get this across? Should I maintain my 'Sorry I'm busy' tactic I have taken so far or should I bite the bullet and tell him I do not want to hang out with him? I don't want to be a jerk but I also don't want to be uncomfortable in my new apartment.

I’d say we are more serious in the past two months (ie spending more time, taking all the time, conversations with more depth).

866,"I'm 37, my sister is 34.  

All of her life she always has a reason why bad things happen to her.  Her phone gets cut off,  it's the phone company's fault,  she gets kicked out of her apartment,  her landlord was an asshole... etc etc.  She never takes ownership for any poor decision she has ever made.

Me and my entire family has always found this with her ever since she's been living on her own.

Anyways,  now it's starting to cause some family problems.  She has been seeing a ""psychic"" who seems to be putting thoughts in her head.  She now believes she was sexually abused when she was 3 years old, once at 8 and once at 14. This is obviously a very serious thing and myself and my parents are really concerned about it.  The only thing is, she doesn't actually have any memories of any if it.  She only learned of this through this psychic.  Now she is angry with my parents and blaming them for letting this happen to her.  We are at a loss of how to proceed.  What does she need from us to get over this?  None of us know anything about it (including her from what I can tell) but she now thinks that we've betrayed her and is blaming us for all of her failings at life claiming this is the reason for a multiple of things.

What do we do with this information?  How do we proceed from here?

Obviously I don't want to dismiss it as a psychic taking advantage of her, at least not openly to her.  It wouldn't go over well.  My parents have tried apologizing to her as sincerely as they could (it's tough when you don't know what happened).  We've always taken her concerns seriously and not discounted them yet she has this contempt towards us.  She blames us for everything.  She personally blames me for her self confidence issues and as the core reason she didnt amount to anything (in her eyes only).  I was her older brother so obviously I did and said a few mean things to her when we were kids but I really don't believe it was anything that usual siblings do to each other.

870,"So I will try to make this as short as possible but I really really need advice. 
This is a situation that's tearing me apart at the moment. I'm 26 and I was with this ex when we were 19. I found out yesterday that he, my first love (even though we were young and didn't know much about love to begin with) is dying of a brain tumor that is inoperable and cannot be treated with chemo. 
We're in two different countries, it's been 4 years since we talked and it didn't end well because he was too intense for me after we broke up and wouldn't respect my wishes of not wanting to see him anymore, even though I loved him still(we broke up because he went off to college and it just wasn't working anymore, we drifted apart too much and didn't know how to make it work). 
He isn't a bad person, our relationship had its ups and downs as much as a ""serious"" relationship in your earliest 20s can be. 
Ever since my friend told me this yesterday I haven't been able to stop thinking about everything and feeling like I need to at least send him a message. I don't know what would that message even be since we haven't  talked in so ling but I feel like I can't let him die without telling him something, anything. I feel like I'm already mourning and don't even know what is the right thing to do here. Would I just upset him by contacting him, what can I even say in a situation like this. Right now I'm in a serious relationship with my current boyfriend and we live together so I'm also wonder if it would be unfair to him now if I were to talk to my ex, I mean, I've told him about the situation because he knows about this ex and I know he would say he doesn't mind because that's the type of person he is, but he might be hurt by it. Would I just be doing them both a disservice and should instead just live with the regret of it all? I don't know, any advice is welcome, thanks.",19Jan2020,1

Failing three classes is cause for alarm, in my opinion. He’s a teen and our parents are not very motivating about grades, and they were the most strict with me. My grades started slipping when I was around the same age, and I only ever had one teacher ask my mom to have me tested for ADHD, and my mom said no. 

I don’t know if my brother has ADHD, or if he is depressed, or if they just don’t push him. But I know him. I know he’s smarter than that. But I know that there’s more to grades than potential. There needs to be drive and motivation to meet that potential, and I’m just afraid that something is wrong. I don’t want to see him make the same mistakes I made in school. I had a full-tuition scholarship to a mediocre school, because of my low GPA combined with high test scores, and if I had someone helping me and guiding me I could have done who-knows-what. 

I really just think I should drive and talk to him, but how to I word this all to him? He’s mature for his age, but I don’t want to just say “hey, do you think you’re depressed?” I feel like there’s a fat chance our mom will do anything (see above anecdote about ADHD testing.)

If you are someone who either in the past or currently struggles with this, how did you overcome these thoughts or what are you doing to help yourself realize your self-worth? Guys are attracted to confidence and I'm really trying to find mine. I have a great job, education, financial stability, and so many other things going for me but I just can't get over the ditch in my mind that I'm not worthy of others.

901,"I wanna keep it short and sweet. My friend came over and we were smoking together. He asked to use my grinder so I gave him my spare one. 

We roll, go smoke, then an hour later he wants to roll again. He asks if he can borrow a grinder and I said what happened to the one I gave you. He looked around the area he was sat, lifted a blanket and said “oh well” and then leaned to grab my one. 

I asked him to look for the first one I leant him. For a few reasons, didn’t want a grinder laying around my home somewhere, didn’t want my own to disappear and most importantly.. I found it kinda disrespectful he lost my property that I leant him.

He said “it must be here somewhere, you don’t need to overreact, you’ll find it eventually”.

We exchanged heated words and he left. Am I really overreacting?",19Jan2020,1
902,"So I’m 24 currently. Back in college, sophomore year, I met a really cool girl (let’s call her) Patricia. We really hit off and became extremely close friends.  But it was mainly boy gossip for a long time. Junior year came around and because of her I met another friend (let’s call her) Jennifer. Now all 3 of us got very close and told each other practically everything. But it was a lot of gossip, especially about a guy Patricia was hooking up with that didn’t want a relationship with her. Many times told her to move on, etc.patricia obviously did not listen. So instead of continuously telling her, Jennifer and I would complain to each other. But Patricia and I would complain about Jennifer, and I know Jennifer and Patricia would complain about me. So we were all extremely toxic. 

Senior year comes around, and I’m at my breaking point with these two. Constant boy drama and complaining to each other. The friendships started feeling fake. And Patricia would only start to text me when she needed to vent about her guy she was still hooking up with or if she needed metro give her information about classes. Never wanting to hang out anymore and only using me and Jennifer for our resources or to babysit her puppy while she went out and partied. And Jennifer would also self sabotage herself with every guy and complain about them and how she was the victim but she was the one that mainly ruined the relationship. But that’s basically the only thing we would talk about, not so much about me or my troubles. 

Right before graduation, Jennifer and I decided that we didn’t want to be friends with Patricia after college. I did not pressure her and she didn’t pressure me into it. But after us telling Patricia our reasoning about ending the friendship, she went onto her twitter and blasted us. Saying how she was a great friend and felt that we were terrible people and we deserved each other.  Well that made me see that I made the right choice. Now fast forward 6 months later. Jennifer decides she wants to go and make peace with Patricia, and I guess be acquaintances. I didn’t think it was a good idea but told her to do whatever. 

After that them making up and I guess being friends, Jennifer started to get weird and be a little bratty to me. She tried to make herself be the better person anytime I complained about my problems. Basically saying I had nothing to complain about. She always made herself seem like her knew more and was more mature the entire time I met her. Well the last straw of our friendship was her telling me I had no right or reason to tell her she was being mean to a guy who she laughed at when he couldn’t perform while they were having sex. And he ghosted her. Well she told me when we first became friends to be honest with her. And I was. I stopped talking to her after that. 

In hindsight, I shouldn’t have basically ghosted her. But I wasn’t going to deal with her crap anymore. Well I recently found out that Patricia and Jennifer have become best friends again and they have been shit talking about me. I’ve seen text messages from both saying how terrible of a person I am and how extremely toxic I am. Even though we were all toxic for each other. I’m just mad that they would go and do that. We are all older and I figured we would put everything behind us. I don’t care that those two are friends, if they want to be toxic to each other again that’s fine. I haven’t thought about either one of them until today. 

I just don’t know if I should say something or leave it alone.",19Jan2020,1

904,"Hello! So this is my first Reddit post and I don't really know if it's advice I need or just a place to vent.
So 2020 didn't start out that great for me. I moved to Sydney in 2019 with the intention to work here for a little while which started out great! I had a job I liked and made enough money to pay my rent And put food on the table plus a little extra which, looking back, I should have saved just for this type of situation that I find myself in right now.
Then Christmas rolled in and I was let go. It came out of nowhere and it was a genuine surprise to me. 
So I wasn't worried at first, because I figured I'll find something relatively quickly. That didn't happen. Instead I fell into what I can only describe as,'try not to kill yourself every morning after I've had my bowl of cereal' type of depressed state. Now that is nothing new for me but I've always had a job to take my mind off things. It's also better to be depressed and have money, than be depressed and fucking broke. 
I've been applying for jobs and I've gone out and handed my resumes to as many restaurants I could but no luck yet,which puts me even more down than I already am.
Oh, did I mention that I live in a tent in a backyard? Because I do. Im not usually complaining about that because it's actually pretty cool. I can use all the utilities of the house and I've made my tent pretty cool to be in. It's actually pretty cozy. We did, however, have people over and I was made very clear,that this is no way to live and the person who told me that, also told me that he would rather kill himself, than live in a tent. People seemed to agree with him, which is unfortunate. I didn't really say anything because I was too busy holding back tears, so I just left. That was 2 days ago. Yesterday I found out my dog died in my home country. That fucking devastated me because how can things get any worse, right? 
I'm fucking homeless, slowly losing my friends and now my dog is dead as well. 
This shit is on a loop in my head and I genuinely don't know how to get out of it.
I don't even know why I wrote this, I guess maybe I need to speak to some internet strangers and maybe that will improve my mental state. Or maybe it won't... Thank you anyways and im sorry for any broken English.

906,"Well me and my girlfriend are together for a decent time. Since the beginning her family didnt really like me (especially her grandparents, because my studies were ""too low"" for them) .  Her mother also didnt like me for whatever what reason that was, but later on she got a boyfriend and finally after being together for almost 3 months she had the permission for going to my house.

Time has passed very peaceful and we were all glad the drama was over, well until her grandparents started to ruin the relationship of her mother, they are so ridiculous, her grandmother claims she heared messages ""from above"" saying her mom had to break up with her boyfriend. Well the guy worked on a construction site and that was not good enough. He also has a very sad past and tried to kill himself. Her grandparents litterly told her mom that he will be an addict etc etc, with no proof at all. Somehow she actually broke up with him bcs of that.

Well since then her mom was an absolute bitch to everyone, her mom doesnt really have that much money since shes a single mother with two kids, so she has to rely on her grandparents and does everything they say. 

(Oh and in the meantime her grandparents talk shit about me on a weekly basics.)

Well a week ago her mom was trying to keep my gf from seeing me and she ofcourse defended herself and wanted to see me.  Her mom said she was being disrespectful etc etc, last wednesday her grandmother started screaming at her she does nothing good for school bcs of me and im forcing her to talk to me and come to my home, her proof; voices from above. They also accused me for being a cheater in the future etc etc.

Well until now (sunday) this is going on every single day and I am scared that i won't be able to see my girlfriend anymore. So does anyone wanna give me some advice?",19Jan2020,1

909," 25yo from germany

Hi, I moved to a different city when I was 20yo to study Math, but dropped out after 1st semester. I had a lot stress with my family and it was all just too much, the college is also a rather tough one, compared to most other universities here in germany. 

I started working as a bartender, still am, and its alright, but the pay is really bad. It was/is enough to get around each month. 

My motivation started to increase heavily around a year ago, so started studying again this semester (in october 2019). The semester started great, no struggles with homeworks, had fun, felt good overall. Nice. I was pretty much going to university from morning to afternoon and then working from afternoon till late evening every day. I can't  reduce my working hours by a lot, I got bills to pay, although I am living overall very frugal imo, I got no expensive hobbies or clothes or newest smartphone or anything like that. 

Around 6 weeks ago, I started going less due to being exhausted and giving up quickly on homeworks; naturally I started  hanging behind more and more. I have had some smaller exams during the semester, passed them, except last one, I didn't study, so ofc I failed.

My next deadline on homeworks is in 11h30min. I have no clue about the subject, I haven't been in uni the past couple weeks. I need to do them to be able to write the main exam. Next week Monday I have a smaller exam, I need to achieve at least 55% to fully pass this subject in this semester and get my points. In the 3 weeks the main exams start, I haven't started studying yet.

Right now I am sitting with panic and anxiety at my desktop, feeling like a failure that will never achieve anything in life. The past weeks, I spent by sleeping in, working out, working, watching yt videos and browsing reddit. I have no excuse. 

What do I do? Homeworks looks rough, I can't ask anyone for help, the only buddy I had in college had to drop out due to health problems. I d have to do an all nighter and still unsure whether I make it or not. Should I just accept that that's the limit of my motivation? That it doesn't go beyond 8 weeks?

How do people with (almost) full time jobs study? It's so rough and I feel so bad and tired.",19Jan2020,1
910,"I got a boyfriend not too long ago and I think he’s AMAZING but I struggle to talk to him as I feel way too nervous and because of that i feel like we hardly even know each other even though we’ve hit over 3 months together. I have had socializing issues my entire live so this isn’t surprising that I am having this problem, but I know how important communication is in a relationship, but I don’t know what to do. Also I always feel like he doesn’t actually like me as I have been played multiple times and I have a severe anxiety disorder but I’ve never talked to him about it and I really don’t know what to do because I REALLY want this to work. Please if you have any advice please tell me :)",19Jan2020,1
911,"I don’t enjoy my job anymore after this promotion. I work in real estate. When I started at the brokerage I am now I was the assistant to the team. I wanted to quit to focus on being a full time realtor for myself. When I went to quit my boss offered my the job of team manager instead. That way I could make good money and have more free time since I wouldn’t have to be in the office 9-5 and make more money. Sounds like a great deal right? How hard could it be? I was already basically managing our team anyway. 

Flash forward to six months later and I am exhausted. I hate keep tracking of what everyone else if doing and if the team is failing it’s on me. I haven’t had a full day off from working. I have five new realtors to train who consistently call me all hours of the day.  I am still watching people make more money than me sinply because I don’t have the time to focus on my own business. I don’t know how people do this. 

I have a hard time being bossy or putting people in their place. I keep messing little things up which isn’t like me. I am stressed to the point where I want to quit. I don’t think I am cut out for this even though I know the industry inside and out.

912,"I know it sounds weird. I literally have everything a normal person would want in life but still feel sad. I'm 18 years old, my parents aren't divorced and I have a good relationship with them. I have a sister and a brother, both 15 and we get on really well too. My family does not have issues with money, just a normal middle class. We are not spoiled, we are happy for what we have and I wouldn't change anything about it. I play floorball since my 13 years and my team is doing really well in the league. I have a wonderful girlfriend and I love her so much. I'm pretty shy and quiet, I have a few really good friends from my class. But I'm happy with it, I have a lot more friends from school and from my floorball club, although they aren't nearly as close as my buddies from class. I have a car and I work one day a week. I just don't know what more could I want and still feel sad and as I don't matter sometimes. I wasn't like this half a year ago and don't know what happened to me since. I used to play a lot of PC games back then but stopped because I needed time to do school stuff and I want to have time for my girlfriend, because she makes me happy. I don't miss gaming, so the problem isn't there. I feel like I lost myself or I don't know. I had this idea that it may have something to do with my self esteem. I'm very skinny, I'm pretty tall and my weight is only 55kg, tried working out before a lot while eating like twice as much than before, but I gained only like 2kg in 6 months, which didn't make any difference and then I stopped gaining weight and stopped working out because of it. So I just accepted that I'm going to be like this. My girlfriend told me that she finds me beautiful like I'm, so I just don't think about it and don't care. I should't feel like this. I don't know what is going on with me. I'm thinking about visiting a psychologist, because I'm worried I might have a depression. I will be grateful for every comment or advice. I'll answer every question you might have. Thank you for reading this.",19Jan2020,1
913,"My dad suffered from a pulmonary embolism which resulted in severe brain damage nine months ago. A few days ago, his breathing became very labored, he stopped talking almost entirely, his pupils became dilated, he is not urinating, and he is refusing basically anything to ease him or make him comfortable. He's dying. We're pretty sure a bedsore led to an infection that is shutting down his kidneys and ending his life.

I work at a university and I have a lot of important meetings pretty frequently. 

I guess my question is, what do I do? We're used to having scares with him over the last nine months. We know this isn't a scare. Nurses guessed he has a few days left maybe, but most likely won't make it to February. 

I've never had a full-time job before. I've never lost a parent before. My boss is supportive and is aware of what's going on. I just don't know what to do. Do I just not go to work? Do I go to work and try to pretend my life is normally when I feel like it's ending? I literally don't know what people do when they expect someone to die, but they don't know when it's going to happen because they're used to having scares. 

I know it might sound shitty to sound like I'm prioritizing work over my father. I'm not. I'd do anything at the drop of a hat for him. This has been going on for nine months. We know he'd want us to keep moving forward.

918,"Ever since I was little, I’ve hated having my picture taken. I can’t remember a single time I’ve enjoyed being in a photo or video. I can’t really explain why, it just fills me with an overwhelming sense of dread for some reason.

Being told to pose for a photo pushes me into an extremely irritable and annoyed mood, which I now know later in life is just my brain’s way of dealing with anxiety.

This causes a lot of issues for me and is somewhat aggravating for my fiancé, as we have next to no pictures together.

919,"When I was 20, I was a guy who hated myself - I never liked the way I looked. Was never happy with my lack of skills, etc. Over the course of two years, I've built great confidence and self-esteem. I am great with people, have productive hobbies and doing fairly well at college. I am fortunate to have an amazing girlfriend (of four years) who has helped me a lot with life. As of now, I'm starting to focus a bit on my social life too.
However, I have noticed that since 5-6 months, I've been growing super lazy and comfortable with who I am.
I eat whatever pleases my taste buds. The moment my brain thinks it needs to do something, I enter the Netflix and Video-games realm. Outside college, my productivity is almost zero. I've lost touch with fitness - I can barely climb 2 flights of stairs without running out of breath.
In 5 months, I'll be graduating. I'm scared the real world won't be this easy and I need to get back into a life of more discipline. But my drive... Its missing. Initially, I used to have the need to impress people, but now that's gone. I have developed a 'happy-go-lucky' attitude which I really want to change.
What would your advice be?
P.S. - I am happy to admit that I never got into alcohol or drugs, so that's a part of life I don't fear. However, I'm always attracted to junk food which I know is worse for my health.",19Jan2020,1
920,"Everything started off back in 2016 when we both were on our first year at University. We went into different study programs, but we had classes in the same university buildings. When I first saw her, I was completely blown away by her. The way she walks, her looks, her style, her expression. You get the idea. I saw her occasionally on the floor and I found out later that she also noticed me. A couple of months passed, and I became good friends with someone that knew her very well and that was basically my gateway ticket for getting to know her personally. I took that chance and we got to know each other. From that point on we saw each other frequently also because there was exam season during that time. For about half a year we keep close ties with each other and would hang out regularly when we were doing stuff for our classes.

Now before I continue, I should mention that she is rather introverted and usually does not talk to guys at all. She needs to fully trust a person to express herself. Regarding myself, I am a really outgoing person and I like to create positive vibes and bond with people, I have a basic level of trust for everyone and I generally try my best to give a positive outlook when I talk to people. We both had just 1 serious relationship prior of knowing each other. I had also some acquaintances, but they were just short flings that I do not consider worthy mentioning any further.

We had a really good time together and I have to say that I didn't asked her out for a date yet because of her rather closed character and also because I have to get approval by her family first, especially by her bothers, which is really hard to get. We share the same cultural heritage and our culture makes is additionally difficult to just get things going on romantically. So I waited and continued to create a strong bond with her. I actually never have developed such deep feelings for someone except from that girl. **I was attracted by her looks, but I fell in love with her personality.** She has by far one of the best personality and character traits I have ever seen in a human being.

Things were going great between us but on one day we were sitting next to each other and I thought she was feeling uncomfortable with me sitting next to her and i suggested her that I move places to give her some more space. Boy have I been wrong. She actually liked sitting next to me as I realized later on but she took my suggestion completely wrong and afterwards started to hate me. And I felt that something was odd with her afterwards. She straight went to the bathroom and she cried there most probably. At this day I legit died emotionally. I was having a deep negative approach in my life, that could have easily been developed into a full blown depression. Al the effort I had made prior to get to know her and gain her trust were gone in a matter of moments. Through intervention of another common friend of ours, we were able to forgive each other.

At that point I expressed her my feelings for and she said that she was not feeling the same way for me as I feel for her and she assured me that she no longer hates me. But what I strongly think is, that she felt the same way for me but she was too ashamed of herself to admit having feelings for me because of what had happened between us.

For the sake of letting her in peace and for me trying to get over her, I cut the contact with her. We came across each other occasionally on the hallway, but we didn't talk with each other.

Last summer I graduated from college and she is now in her last year (my study program lasted 3 years and hers last 4). On December 24th, 2019 I was entering the campus to visit some friends I still had there and then I saw her sitting alone in the cafeteria studying. I first went straight to pass her, but I returned and moved towards her, because all in all that was the only thing, I have been wanting for the last two years, apart from getting my degree. We had a conversation about our lives and caught up how things have been going for us so far. It just felt exactly like the good times we had when we used to hang out together while we were studying.

I know this girl for over 3 years now and I know I should get over her, but I just can't. I've already tried everything. There has been no week passing without me thinking of her at least once. I wasn't able to cope the same feeling that I have for her with the other girls I have been out so far, and I think I never will. I have a good social life, I have a loving and caring family, I go regularly to the gym for 6 years now and I am currently employed and have a high salary. I should be really looking for my future but I just can't considering that she is not by my side.

My questions now are if I should try to contact her? And if so, how should I do that? I don't have her number since the time we had an argument. She recently deleted her Instagram and I don't have an account on Facebook. Would it be considered creepy or even sick if I try to contact her, seemingly out of the blue? And should I finally tell her how I feel for her like I am telling you right now?

TLDR; I know a girl for 3 years and I now want to keep in touch with her again, after 2 years of no contact (we had an argument because of a misunderstanding, that we have resolved by now). 2 Months ago, I saw her again and we had a nice conversation. I actually have never stopped having feelings for her since the day I first saw her and I was not able to get over her, regardless of what I did. What should I do now?

I am really looking forward for your answers and suggestions. I am grateful for every advise that I could get.",19Jan2020,1
