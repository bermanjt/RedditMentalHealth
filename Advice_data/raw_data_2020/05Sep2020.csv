2,"Apparently my cousin’s been really stressed lately so I want to send her some fun things. Howeverr I can’t really think of something that would be a good gift. A few months ago I sent her a a box to wish her luck on her exams. It had toys, Oreos, rings, fluffy pens, and stickers(she enjoyed everything). I’ve been trying to find things that are similar/might interest her but no luck. Some things that I know she likes are mint chocolate Oreos(and mint chocolate in general), Marvel comics, and Red Velvet. I think she might also like cute stuff like plushies.",05Sep2020,1
3,"So yea, I worked in California when it was the only medical state, and the whole operation was really sketchy, but technically legal. I’m not entirely sure how I was paid, but I know it was kind of under the table.

I recently got hired by one of the big new nurseries that’s all above board and legal. They said my job offer is contingent upon a background check. If they check my employment history, I’m not sure if it will come up, and if it does, I’m not sure whether it will be correct. 

What should I do? Should I email the person who hired me, and tell them it may or may not show up and could possibly be wrong? 

I’m worried that sounds really bad. What hiring manager wants to hear “the experience I told you I have might not be correct.”

Maybe I should I just pray everything will be fine?",05Sep2020,1
4,"I'm going to get straight into this. So for almost a week now, my dad has been completely ignoring me. He pretends I don't exist. I can tell that he's obviously mad at me, but I have no idea why. I have spoken directly to him, but he doesn't answer me and just pretends like I'm not there. I've asked my mom if there is a reason he is ignoring me but she said she doesn't know. My dad acts perfectly normal around everyone else in my house so clearly he's mad at me for something. I've spent countless hours trying to think of what I could've done wrong to piss him off, but I seriously cannot think of anything. 

This is not to be confused with neglect. I don't think not responding to your daughter counts as child neglect. This silence is getting really uncomfortable since we live in the same household. I don't know what to do anymore, since speaking to him directly hasn't worked. Am I overracting? What should I do?",05Sep2020,1

6,"Idk why I feel like that. I don’t like jumping from job to job. However I feel like this new job I got is not for me. I was somewhere else for 5 years and left to grow more. Now that I’m at this job I hate it. I don’t regret leaving my other job bcuz I left for a reason so going back is only going to take me back to square one. 

I feel like if I quit everyone is going to think oh yeah she couldn’t handle it or I knew she would quit etc. I don’t like failing I don’t like messing up but that’s all I’m doing at this job. Everything about it is ridiculous. 

Simple tasks take 50k steps to complete and I have to constantly get approvals from other people instead of just doing the job myself. No one took the time to train me. No one took the time to tell me how things are operated. Nothing. 

They constantly blame the new people for shit but everyone else is free to mess up and it’s ok. 

They literally come hunt you down and tell you that you fucked up. 

I wish I could just leave but I don’t want to feel like a failure.. idk how other people just quit their jobs and jump around. It doesn’t help either that I have anxiety and depression and this job is just making it worse.

I drive home with no music on and driving the speed limit sometimes bcuz I’m fed up some days 😂

Any advise on how to get over that feeling? 

Have you jumped from job to job? What’s your insight on that and why do you think it’s not a big deal ?

I’m venting a little I’m sorry.  😔",05Sep2020,1

8,"I was begrudgingly selling my switch lite on reddit to help pay for movers for a move I’m doing this weekend.  I got a buyer who said he wanted it for his son’s birthday this weekend and asked me if he could buy it off me. I thought that was sweet so I agreed to sell. After a little bit he asked if I could use Apple Pay instead of cash, and I agreed as well. 

So he shows up, sends me the pay option, and I give him the switch.  

Immediately after the exchange, he cancelled his payment and it didn’t have time to go through or something, not sure but I didn’t end up with the money.  

He had my number and I had his in order to do the Apple Pay thing, so I texted him and told him it didn’t go through.

And here’s what really upset me. 

He said he’d come back and bring cash instead.  He clarified the meeting place and time. And even told me when he got the cash and an ETA from there. I waited outside for 30 minutes and he never showed up, texted back, or answered my calls, he also blocked me from Facebook.

So I can’t really take any legal action, nor will I get my money or switch back, but I do have his phone number, stalked to find his twitter, and my fiancé found his Facebook because although he blocked me he did not block her.  I think I might be able to like sign him up for some annoying mailing lists or something but if y’all know of anything I can do with this info to let him know that stealing a switch and then making the person you stole from stand outside for 30 minutes just for shits isn’t okay? 

Anyways, sorry for the rant, but any suggestions appreciated.",05Sep2020,1
9,"I am in therapy and I have out of her house for a year and a half now but still.....all I can think about is her gaslighting, the way I saw her pull knives out at my dad, the way she would call me some of the most degrading names (I.e., retarded, worthless, saying that the dog is cuter than me), made me sleep on the living room couch, her false accusations against my dad and and et.cetra. She robbed me of nearly 23 years of my life and I probably only have 25 years left of a normal life since my brain contracted slightly back in 2008 due to genetic disorders and therefore I’ll probably get dementia by the time I’m 50. 

She has been investigated by CPS but is most likely going to have the charges dropped. This woman deserves to be in jail! And she should be in jail! It’s not right, it’s not fair. This legal system is seriously rigged and fucked.

And I am absolutely disgusted by my dad who won’t be sensible enough to leave her. Why is he so foolish to make it want to work with her? I mean, he is a good man. He is an intelligent man, He deserves better. Why can’t he see that? How weak can he be.

God, I just don’t know.",05Sep2020,1
11,"So for the past 7 months I’ve worked on the road, we had gotten really good at communicating. We have never argued over anything important. But I don’t feel I have her full trust. I tell her everything I do before I do it. I work on the road so she can be a stay at home mom which she wanted. I literally can’t tell her no 95% of the time she wants something. I know sometimes i slack in being romantic but I’m exhausted. And if I hurt her feelings I feel guilty and apologize if it’s my fault or not. Lately I feel my feelings aren’t considered as she gets defensive when I bring up concerns. I’m not sure where I went wrong.",05Sep2020,1
12,"I never express how envious I am, but whenever someone is doing better then me I get really insecure and self-conscious. I have trouble being friends with or dating people who are out of my league, wether it be how rich they are, how amazing their personality is, how lucky they seem to be, or how attractive they appear. My first thought whenever I have a connection with someone who is better then me is “when will I no longer have this connection at all?” 

Normally people are like “omg I’m so happy I’m dating this really attractive and nice guy,” but I feel bad because I can’t do that. I’m a very average dude, and generally I will purposely date people who I find unattractive or unfriendly because I just believe they may be misunderstood, and it’s almost like dating someone that low is all I deserve to have in life. 

It isn’t that I want everyone to be worse then me either, that’s a disgusting thought that I have never had, but I just want to feel like they deserve to have a connection with me. If they don’t deserve me then I feel bad with associating with them, I feel like a burden. I’m not depressive at all, I have pretty good confidence, I just don’t know how to get rid of this awful envious side of me, and I’m really afraid of opening up and talking about it. Are these feelings normal and how can I get rid of them?",05Sep2020,1

The daughter was sending aggressive texts to my mom and I replied to her saying rude things to her also. My mom didn’t reply a single word. Now I feel really bad because they don’t talk to me anymore, even tho I only said the truth. Believe me they’re shit. I can’t just go and apologize because I didn’t lie. But this episode consumes my mind for months now. Plus I’m a Psychologist. I’m afraid the whole family is talking about how I lost my mind etc. Have you been into arguments with relatives?

16,"I feel awful.  I recently found out my uncle I adored since childhood is an asshole who abused (""touched""  my cousin said) his daughters and was often a raving, hurtful drunk, probably some mental health issues. It ran in the family.  He may have been abused himself as a kid. His sister, my mother was by their stepfather. Although that story is murky.  I think the stepfather tried something with my mom and her mom moved her out and to the grandmother's. My uncle also went to the grandmothers at some point later. Back in the day, people didn't tell their kids everything like they do today, so I don't have details. I was also proud that my grandmother...in the 50s, stood up to him and got my mom out of the home, even though  my grandmother stayed married to him. He was an awful man, who I hated visiting.

 I am hurting for my cousins. There are three girls and I've only spoken to the one who shared the info. They all live out of state since we were teens and we connect mostly on FB. We're all bearing down on 60.  I feel like most of my childhood is tarnished. I can't imagine how they feel. She said ""when they were young."" I didn't ask for details. I was stunned. I think I said things that were ok. There was more hurtful information.  I don't know what to do. Should I reach out to the other two cousins?  Do I tell my brother who also adores him?  Do I tell my daughter who would want to know. She's not in contact with him, I just know she'll be pissed I didn't tell her if she ever hears it from the ones she is in touch with.  The longer I know, the worse I feel about it. I don't want to make others feel this way. Ugh. Why are people so shitty.",05Sep2020,1
17,"so i met this guy last year during my first year of university, cause we lived on the same floor in residence and we actually turned out to be from the same city as well (school is in a different province than our hometown). 

I never admitted to myself that i may like him more than a friend because i just thought it was the kind of situation when you’re just around a person so much u develop feelings for them and then they go away.

We’d always hang out together, and when either of us were bored we’d jus go to each other’s rooms. We did anything together, talk, watch tv/movies, take naps w each other, cuddle or just do random stuff until 6am (platonically of course). We kind of also reciprocate coupley energy with each other? Always hugging or if we’re standing in the hallway i’ll lean against him, or when we sit down i’ll have my legs on his lap. Also whenever i see him he gives me those big bear hugs and lifts me off the ground (i love those).

Here’s the thing I get nervous around him and get excited when i know i’m gonna see him next, but he’s also very much not my type. Physically i’m not attracted to him, and some of his personality traits i’m not attracted to. Like he’s more of a homebody and doesn’t like to leave his house (i’m very social and don’t like to be in my house), hes very academically driven (i am not), and he’s terrible at talking over the phone/through socials like texting or snapchat (and i use them constantly). Like sometimes if i snapchat him or text him his replies are so dry that i get the sense he doesn’t wanna talk to me. Yet even with all these traits i can’t seem to shake that i still like him more as a friend.

He’s staying at the school that’s away from our hometown while i’m transferring to a school in our hometown, so we won’t get to see each other everyday like last year, and most likely will drift apart. 

I think that’s why i’m debating just telling him drunk one night (to make it less awkward) that i’ve liked him more as a friend since last year since i’m going up to go visit him and my other friends soon. is that a dick move? will that lead him on? 

side note: a few months ago post moving out of residence due to covid, he told me a ‘secret’ that we kissed one night when we were both pretty drunk. I didn’t want to admit that i remembered because i didn’t wanna deal with my social anxiety and make things awkward so i just played it off and was like lol why didn’t u tell me earlier haha!! (this may be why he doesn’t text me as often/more dry replies cause i brushed off the incident)

i feel like he brought it up cause he may have had feelings for me too? and was just trying to scope out the situation? this is why i’m afraid of just fully admitting to him that i like him cause i have no intentions of getting into a relationship with him (i’m an anxious person and because of that i have never been in a relationship or had things with guys before) .because it’s like why would you even tell him if u don’t want to be in a relationship? maybe a little part of my wants something but it’s unrealistic since we’re going to different schools, and will slowly lose contact...

anyways thoughts? sorry this is so long i just wanted to give proper context of the situation",05Sep2020,1
18,"My now ex girlfriend was abusive while we were together. Physically, mentally and emotionally. It started very slowly. She made me rely on her for anything and everything. She made me quit my job, and cut out any female friends. I had reasons for wanting to stay through these red flags. I wanted to help her. She ended up talking to a few of her exes and cheating on me. I found this out when I was diagnosed with HPV. She ridiculed me, told me that I must have cheated on her (I never did) and was no support when I found we went to the doctor or got back home. She would call me anything and everything under the sun. Made me feel worthless and like no one else will ever want me. 10 months after we break up. I still feel it.

The past few days I'm feeling little low and some of the comments from my friends are hurting me like daggers. Body shaming a thin person is not considered a thing. I don't know why. I'm sick of being called a 'skeleton' and 'not having an ass'. How can I address this with my friends without hurting them when in the past I used to brush them off (not related to my body) with a laugh or a silly  stare.

25,"I am a person who is deeply concerned ,  but I seem to attract female stalkers who are deeply mentally ill. So far in my life , I have attracted 5 stalkers since 2016. Two men who had a crush on me, and they confirmed it. Four women who also seem to have a crush on me, but I assume their agendas are more mysterious, its like they are begging me to help them and cling on to me after I blocked them. 

Right, two of these women are older women who are on menopause. This woman thought I was stealing her guy she was attracted to, and accused me of microcheating. I later found out they were in a relationship for years and I wish her all the best and her crush and me were friends. This aside from the fact she was poly, but I dont understand those dynamics, and I dont blame her. These two have been following me for 3 years, and the other one for 1 year though the previous one for help, I believe and other people intervened, and she for all her breakups (3), mental health issues (cluster triad ), menopause, abandonment issues and 7 relationships at once, seem to have a good career, I would give her that. 

The  other woman had a good career too, usually a glorified alt career for housewives, but I think she retired or something and is having a breakdown and now is stalking someone she used to know, like we met yesterday ? she made her way out of being a glorified alt housewife career and is probably currently living on her husbands middle class income, which is fine, I never had issues with her till last year, I didnt hear from her for a decade, till last year when suddenly I had to suddenly deal with her menopause knighting, but she has children who are adults and can handle her, why me for carthasis ? Shouldnt she deal with a therapist ? Due to my history about women who usually stalk me, I would assume that she is going through some deep mental anguish or breakdown. Why the special treatment to me, there are other non mormons in that area, and there are other women in that area who have left that city, why specifically me, what makes me so special , and why are you obsessed with me for a year ? It doesnt matter if I was a waitress or working in design (I am) , why do you care, and why make the attempts to embellish my history. Didnt you know a zillion more people? Are you suffering from trauma ? Am I the only vocal anti mormon in that city?

There is a third woman who has an autoimmune disorder and is at the point where she is going through psychosis and has been diagnosed the first early signs of schizophrenia. I think she is coming to terms with the ten years she spend in poverty, in an abusive family with an escort career which I think I clipped wings off. She resents her family for taking away her drugs , and all her substance abuse options, and has no friends and is trying to be in a relationship with me. 

There was also once an escort who was attracted to me online, who claimed she was a lesbian and a sociopath, I dont know why these women that have breakdowns all go for sociopaths, that is not a mental disorder. And found me intelligent and we would conquer the world together or some shit, but she was white I think.

There was another blogger, and she had mental health issues which she resolved, maybe hormonal and anxiety. 

There is also one more, a fat woman, who doesnt have a degree or a job, but is stalking me for 5 years. She wants my boyfriend to break up with me and move with her, but spends more time stalking me than him. She is looking for weak points so that she can break us up. She probably has mental illnesses too, and hormonal issues, but she is trying to come to terms with it and is getting out of there as much as possible compared to the rest. 

There is also a star kid , who I guess didnt clear his liberal arts major in a good medium university in films , and resents me cause his dad supported me, Again, I am not responsible for your family issues, and I think you should focus less on me, and more on getting that degree. You have alot going for you cause you are a star kid, and will inherit whatever your father owns, I should not matter to you at all. 

Why all people who stalk me are in mental anguish or pain, at worst have mental disorders? Why do they stick to me for years, I dont understand it, If you really believe I am insignificant , then move on and leave me alone, cause I think you are too. If you think I am some therapist who can fix your anguish issues or a medium you are talking to for blessings, I am sorry I am not. I cant help you more than you can yourself. 

Could you all move away from my life and find new meaning in life or new hobbies? Maybe get an appointment with a well deserved therapist ? I am tired of feeling pity and disgust by being forced to interact with you. 

I am trying to talk to people here cause some of these people are my bosses and peers and I need to sort my issues and clarify stuff with them, or just spend time with them. You do not matter to me at all. Your internal battles dont matter to me. Your religious opinions dont matter to me. Your angst and emotional drama doesnt matter to me. I am not your therapist. You should get one. 

I feel really good, mainly cause of schadenfreude. I pity you all for being so pathetic. Even the ones with former good careers, I can see between the cracks, but till probably last year I had no issues with you and never thought about you. 

I have lived a very secluded life in 4-5 countries and with four thousand or so people I have met. I feel terribly alone with the network I have, they lack the je ne sais quoi that your lower than average IQS, and EQS and middle class at best rich , or ghetto poverty in slums friendships could have given me, and I shall repent that lost opportunity for the rest of my life, in deep sadness and despair when I get time to feel that. 

However, with my present, rest of the people who know me network , I feel great, I feel I am more accomplished via my academics, and my career, I have a place to live, even for the people with great careers, my family has equally good ones, we are all rich and accomplished and prolific than you and I have a great safety net and I am happy, not miserable at all, really loved, in a great relationship, wayy sexier than all of you, and I really appreciate your friendship , but last year has made me unsure of its value and I wish you would leave me alone, there are tons of anti mormons, medium range successful, pretty people in the world, I am sure if you stalk on the internet enough you will find some, you dont need to idealize me. And please , like mormons usually do, dont make me some reincarnation of Jesus. I am not one.",05Sep2020,1
26,"For anyone who knows they’re cool but isn’t “popular”
Something that’s been on my mind a lot.


Words to know while reading this:
A conformist = someone who follows social norms
A non conformist = someone who doesn’t follow the social norm
Irreverent = someone who doesn’t care about things that most people consider important 



The “Popular” kids in school aren’t actually cool.  They’re confident conformists right? And they’re pretty close minded, they don’t care about normal people below them as long as they’re also conformists, the confident conformists have this unspoken authority over them. Therefore they’re cool.
Because they’re so conforming they judge everything that is different and normal.
Conformists are afraid of being anything other than normal for fear of harassment/getting cast out called weird etc.

Whereas genuinely cool, Eccentric, different people are Confident non conformists. 
They literally do not care about anyone’s need to conform they want to be how they want to be and want to say what they want to say.
The normal conformists see them as cool as they wish they had the confidence to be like them and the confident conformists see them as a threat as they have no power over these people. 
They’re the ones who can bite back at a bully while having their hair dyed blue, wearing a full floral magenta suit and still win with every piece of dignity they still own.
Because even if the confident conformist says you look dumb you look weird. 
The confident non conformist says “thanks that’s what I was going for”.
They WANT to stand out but not for attention and adoration like the conformist.
But for more statement, personal and creative reasons if a true eccentric.

The lack of control the confident conformist has over the confident non conformist frustrates them so much. 
This is why a lot of the time famous people were generally bullied or outcasted in some way as a child for being different. 
But they become famous as they never lose that confidence in the uniqueness they have and they know at the end of the day they’re cooler than the popular conformists as popular conformists just conform to the highest extent and are intimidating enough to force almost everyone else to do so to. The non conformist sees through the facade and recognises their self worth as not higher but much different.

An unconfident non conformer may very well feel intimidated by a popular conformist, leading them to become very unconfident or becoming a normal conformist to avoid harassment.
Whereas a confident non conformist has absolutely no self doubt in themselves and takes the harassment in their stride, because if they weren’t turning heads they wouldn’t be rebelling correctly. The confident non conformer wants to make a statement about society and the harassment just adds fuel to their fire, nothing could ever convince them they are not cool, because they are and they know they are and 
they know that the Popular confident conformist is just extremely annoyed that they are completely normal and compared to this cool individual they really don’t stand out in personality or appearance.
Everything about them is the epitome of normal as they wanted to conform so much. 

But why do they want to conform so much? Because they feel insecure, they are scared of people’s opinions and thoughts so they let people mould them, parents words, teachers words, older people, people their age. 
Secretly they are extremely insecure in the fact that they will only ever be normal. But because they are confident they develop a god complex and think they are above everyone else who is also normal.

The cool confident non conformist does everything they do but with personality and style the conformist can’t or won’t accept different personality or style due to fear of being rejected by the higher archey of normal they are in.

The confident cool person has a dream and vision and makes it known, so they go on to become famous in creative areas. They do not care about the current society as they have a better vision for the future and want to make that known.

Whereas the confident popular person has a need to stay on top and be relevant, as a normal person they can’t use quirkiness or creativity so they rely on being the best in their current society so they focus on objects and money
Becoming businessmen or accountants or marrying rich people to move up in class

Genuinely cool people are unapologetically themselves and are willing to prove that to anyone. they want change and will make it happen, they are the reason the world improves.

“Popular” people live a life of constant fakery always trying to prove their worth or impress someone, they will lie about themselves and others to do this.

Now what makes a “popular” conformist?
It’s their ability to control unconfident people as 
People are afraid of harassment or abuse for being different. 
People being unconfident leads them to not express themselves.

What makes an unpopular conformist?
Normal people who are unconfident and follow a popular conformists rule.
They are not special to a popular conformist or a cool nonconformist as they are not strong in opinion and just seen as rule abiding subjects to popular conformists with god complexes and scared sheep to the cool nonconformist. 

What makes a cool nonconformist.
Someone who just doesn’t give a fuck and who is ready to challenge conformers.
They are worthy opponents for popular conformers as they’re ideas can spread to normal conformers and cause change resulting in popular conformers becoming obsolete.
Completely irreverent. (Not to be confused with irrelevant)
Someone who is open minded and generally either creative or socially confident.
They do not hide they’re personality.
They are admirable because people desire the same authenticity as them.
Normal unconfident conformists and unconfident non conformists find them cool for these reasons.
Several popular conformists will also feel this way as they wish for authenticity whereas other popular conformists will find them weird as they don’t understand them.

What makes a unconfident non conformist unpopular/uncool.
They are not confident in their eccentricness and the popular conformist still has leverage over them as they have the power to make them feel insecure leading to them being bullied as they are not confident enough to handle harassment and often back down and do not challenge.

Thanks for reading :)
You’re one of the cool ones.


{Confidence issues are very easily changed with CBT (COGNITIVE BEHAVIOURAL THERAPY)
you don’t need to have an mental illness to visit a therapist, if you lack confidence it can actually give you confidence back as you get thought how to deal with negativity and thoughts and emotions. It’s a very healthy way of dealing with feelings of unworthiness because remember no matter what anyone says you’re okay anyway. You are so worthy.}",05Sep2020,1
27,"Disclaimer - This post contains some very sensitive and triggering topics.

Some context. Morning of august 3rd 2015, my mum left the house to go to Tesco’s. I got a call from my dad an hour later saying there had been an emergency. My mum had texted dad and said she was going to take her own life. About 15 hours later of endless phone calls and searching around our town for her, my brother convinced my mum to come back home (at the time I was 12 and my brother was 10 so it was very traumatic to hear). After a lot of tears, we agreed that it was late, we’d all go to bed and talk about what had happened as a family in the morning.

I woke up the next morning to find my mum had overdosed on painkillers. She was rushed to hospital in an ambulance and had her stomach pumped. Being so young and naive, I’d never spotted any sign of her being anything but okay. 

Since 2015, my mum has been sectioned under the mental health act twice (2016 for a week / 2018 for a month), in a hospital that is absolutely VILE and rated as “totally inadequate” by the government (unfortunately its the only mental health hospital in my area for 30 miles). She’s made several claims of receiving death threats against herself, my brother and I, that I (at 13 years old) was working with the police to murder her, the house would burn down etc. This has all stemmed from viral tik toks, innocent Facebook posts, and YouTube videos - that should give an idea of her mental state.

My mum told me at 14 years old that she had never loved my dad, and it almost tore my parents marriage to shreds. She was diagnosed with persecution disorder in 2017 she’s been put on hideous amounts of medication for months on and off. This has been ongoing for 5/6 years. I’m now 18. 

Well after a year of no medication we thought things were okay, until recently. I found out i was going to uni 3 weeks ago and mum has been so anxious about me leaving home. But this has triggered her psychosis and it’s worse than its ever been. Over the past weeks, my mum has not been eating or showering, vomiting, has been drinking 2/3 bottles of alcohol per NIGHT, had no sleep and wore the same clothes for weeks on end. She doesn’t have a job and since she hasn’t been cooking my brother, dad and I have eaten takeaway for the best part of 6 nights a week.

Two days ago we discovered she‘d taken 20 tablets in about two hours. I drove home from uni shopping to find her in a daze drifting in and out of consciousness. My dad rushed home from work and took her up A&amp;E. She looked my dad and me dead in the eye and said, and I quote:

“I want to k*ll myself”, “I didn’t want to wake up this morning”

Two doctors said they were “very deeply concerned”, and any more tablets could have done it. After this, we found razor blades in her car, and over 20 new boxes of anadin, paracetamol, aspirin etc in the medicine cupboard. She spent last night in a general hospital having her stomach pumped and after lots of assessments, the doctors have sent her home with two visits from the crisis team every day and loads of new meds. If she makes no improvement in the next 10 days, she will be sectioned again for a MINIMUM 6 months (we won’t be able to visit because of COVID) and she will lose her drivers license permanently.

The doctors have told my dad clearly that if she goes into the mental hospital, it would have an irreversible effect on her health. “”She may not even come out of the hospital at all”” was their exact words. I wish I was joking. 

The one thing I have not told anyone yet, is that they think my mum may be diagnosed with schizophrenia.

I can’t express how worried I am about her. I go to bed each night, wondering if I’ll wake up in the morning with my mum still alive. I am struggling like crazy to deal with it. I tell my friends and boyfriend that I’m okay, but ive been eating so little and have started to lose weight. I’ve cancelled on multiple plans with friends over the weeks because I don’t have the energy to go out. I’ve spoken to my boyfriend and I’m sure he thinks I’m overreacting, but I can’t express the hell im in. Even worse, I leave for uni in a week and won’t be able to see her.

I don’t know what to do. Any advice on how to support my mum / my family would be amazing.",05Sep2020,1

30,"I just graduated from college this spring, and began my new job as a fourth grade teacher this month. This is my first full time job and it's important to me, of course.

All the teachers are pretty close knit, especially those teaching adjacent grades. I spend a lot of time with another teacher and I find her rather, incredibly cute. We talk a lot between classes and when we have both our kids out at Recess, and she even complimented my outfit the other day, and it made me feel wonderful.

But I have no idea how dating works in a professional setting, or if it's even a good idea. I could see it being an HR nightmare, for one thing. For another, I forgot that this isn't school anymore, so we aren't necessarily that close in age. I assumed she wasn't much older than me, it turns out she's been teaching for five years, meaning she's at least four years or so my elder (though if I asked you to guess which of us was 23 and which of us was 27, you'd nearly certainly get it wrong).

I know all the teachers go to happy hour sometimes, and part of me really wants to offer to buy her a drink at one of those functions, but I'm a bit terrified. I haven't dated a ton before now, and I wonder if something like this is way out of my bounds for a guy in a new job, new position as a self sufficient full time worker and teacher, and guy who has very little dating experience, let alone opposite a grown ass woman.",05Sep2020,1

There are a few that live where I currently live but they choose to not hit me up to hang out and when I do ask they don’t respond, so I’ve given up on that. Recently I made a new friend but I’m finding it really hard to maintain it on a personal level.

The landlords (just a couple, not a company) informed me that wouldn’t be in to see the place for 3-4 days after we moved out; today landlady emailed and said the place smelled really strongly of cat and that she can’t show it. Husband and I do have two cats but are extremely diligent about cleaning. Box is cleaned 1-2 times per day, rocks immediately taken to outside trash. Vacuum 1-2 times per week. Neither cat has an issue with peeing outside the box, not even so much as a hair ball on the floor! Both cats are young and healthy and can clean themselves.

We have asked the few folks who have been in our place since lockdown (we only moved into this place in February this year) and all three of them swore it did not smell like cat.

I can’t decide if I should keep my current car, 2010 subaru wrx, or sell it while it’s still worth something and buy something else newer/better.  For those who care enough, it’s a GH narrow body hatchback with just over 100k miles.  I bought it about a year and a half ago and love driving it.  I just moved into a house with my fiancé and money’s a little tight, but a promotion just kicked in that was delayed because of Covid.  The reason it’s laying so heavily on me right now is because rates are so low in the world that they’re pretty hard to ignore.  A part of me says it only has 100k miles, it can last another 5 years at least and I can buy something then, maybe even modify the car a little to change the feel.  The other part says i haven’t put a lot of miles on, and can probably sell it close to what I bought it for.  My fear is if I buy something now, I’ll be stretching finances a little too thin, and if I keep it, it very well could die because well, it’s a wrx with a few previous owners.

So title pretty much says it all. My gf/Kids Mom of about 2 yrs has a guy friend. He has made a couple subtle passes at her. I haven't ever told her I don't want her to stop being friends with him but I am uncomfortable with them hanging out. It's not that I don't trust her. I trust her more than I've ever trusted almost anyone. I don't worry about her being unfaithful. She worries about me but I have never been unfaithful and never would. Just a personal standard for me and I wouldn't purposely doing something to hurt her like that. She even said at one point in you're uncomfortable with me talking or spending time with him I'll stop. Which was after he made a pass at her. I said I was but I wouldn't tell her what to do that she's an adult and she can what she wants. She said she'd stop talking to him.



&amp;nbsp;



So fast forward to last night. We've had a rocky few days with both of us being emotional but got through it. Overall we are great though. She works thirds and drives a truck for a living. She can take passangers with her on her routes. She's only ever taken her female cousin and our dog before and only once each. So after we talk and say good night/I love you to each other she goes to work. I'm asleep and she meets up with him at her work and he rides as a passenger. 





&amp;nbsp;




This morning she gets off work and surprises me with coffee and an energy drink as I'm walking out the door to go to work. (I'm not living in our home right now, I'm in a sober living facility as I hade a relapse after 3 yrs sobriety and felt this is where I needed to be to get my sobriety back on track.) She's excited to see me we say I love you I thank her and I go to work.




&amp;nbsp;



After I get off work we talk for five or so minutes on the phone. I ask her if anything interesting happened at work. She says well I took so and so with me on my route and this threw me off guard because it is VERY out of character. She never makes decisions like this without consenting me if she were to know it would make me uncomfortable. I asked her why. She says he wanted to go while they were talking at 1 in the morning so she told him to come along. I asked her why she would do that, why she wouldn't call and ask me or put it off until tomorrow until she could ask me if I was comfortable with this. Which she knows I would not have been. She says that she just didn't think about me or what I would think/care about the situation. Which is super concerning to me because that is very out of character for her. She's never done anything like this. She said she was stressed about us and wanted to talk to him about it. She says all they did was talk about their respective s.o's the whole time. Idk. Idk what to believe but I've been cheated on before and I'm seeing red flags. I just want a second opinion. Please tell me what you think. Thanks!",05Sep2020,1

41,"Okay so here’s the story:

Today I was driving from my parents house back to my apartment on a rather busy highway. As I was driving there was a pick up truck ahead of me in the right lane. It had a big ass heavy duty bucket and the lid flew off while going 60+ mph. I slammed on my brakes to prevent it hitting into my windshield and it smacked into my bumper. Long story short the person wouldn’t pull over and I decided to file a police report because I was pissed and thought there was more damage.

Here’s where the weird stuff happens:

I call to file a report and they tell me they’ll send an officer by soon to take details. Cue me and my girlfriend sitting on the porch for an hour before I get a call saying that an officer is not actually going to come but rather call me by noon tomorrow. That was around 6:00pm. Now it is 8:30PM and my girlfriend and i are sitting in our bedroom eating pizza when we see a flashlight blatantly looking through our living room window. So we instantly panic, I grab a huge knife and go to the back window and scream “HELLO WHOS THERE” -no reply. So then I go to the front window and see a police car parked out front with only it’s park lights on. I put the knife down and go outside and the cop is standing nowhere near my front door and asks  if “I’m the one who called.” So then he takes a super brief accident report and goes on his way. 

Now we’re sitting here wondering why he never knocked on our front door and went straight to our side window with his flashlight? He even said he saw my girlfriend freak out inside, and didn’t come to the door and knock. It almost seemed like he didn’t know why he was sent here but they have to clue him into something. Should we report this to the precinct? We’re both feeling incredibly uncomfortable and violated.",05Sep2020,1

48,"I have a problem according to my family. I only worry about my own priorities, I like school. I like to learn and I consider myself a rare breed of introvert and extrovert fused together. Parts of my family believes that I am an introvert while others say I am an extrovert who seeks attention. Some might say I am an ambivert, a unique mix between intro and extrovert. I am not however, I just have different personalities depending on the situation. Over time I have learned and created a single mindset where I do things only If I see a benefit, and If their is an unknown risk, I will not take it. I will take risks only if I see a good chance of success like a 70% chance of success. I live in the US and am A first generation college student. I was accepted into a top university in my state as a pre-med major.  I am doing remote learning at my parents house because I am still dependent on them. Not to pay for college but to have a place to stay. I am very strict about rules and I hate people who let their emotions make the decisions for them. I am a science man. I follow the rules and occasionally am a leader for others to follow. Today, I was disappointing in my father. Behind my Mom's back,  he talks about how she sometimes gets blinded by what she feels. Me agreeing since my mom has made poor decisions because of what she feels. An example would be

 "" My mom has an extremely weak immune system. If she gets Covid19, she will die. Its guaranteed. She suffered from her body rejecting food for as long as I can remember and the doctors still do not know what the problem. The point is she can not handle a disease, however she has always been moving since she was a child. Always doing something. That is most likely the reason to why she is still alive. Just less than a week ago, she wanted to invite her sister over to or house. I know very well that her sister will not wear a mask because she has a smoking problem. She also lives in the city, but not the good city. The city you think of where young kids are loitering and when you drive thru, everyone looks at you. A city where the majority of the people's houses are granted the ability to be paid by the government and the people to work in factories. It is not a good area. This would increase the chances of her to have corona virus. She also said she did not need the test. I was furious my mom was even considering bringing her over. My mom will die if she gets sick. I told her why it was a terrible idea, and became defensive saying I should treat my family better. I left her because I knew I was right but she ended up not bringing her because of what I said"".

Yesterday, My grandpa called my mother saying that he wanted to visit. My grandfather is around 50- 59 years old. He walks like a teenager in the movies, and can still get the girls he wants. However this may all be true, he also has a drug problem, suffering from diabetes, and he smokes, and he always and I mean always goes on a walk throughout the day since he has nothing better to do. He lives 6 hours away from where I live. He has not owned or even tried to protect himself from the pandemic. He tells my mom and his family that he does not care if he dies and to let him do what he wants. My mom already making the decision that he was coming because that is her father. I gave up trying to convince her and left. My dad later came to my room and agreed with me that No one should be coming, and it is a bad idea. I believed in his thoughts saying it will affect our lives not just my mothers. I believed him. The next day 45 minutes before my grandfather arrived, i got my mask, glasses and face shield ready because I knew that My grandfather has not been tested at all throughout the pandemic. It makes sense that since their is a pandemic all of my family should be wearing masks ,right? well no, Right when I saw him go thru that door, my mom and him had no mask. 

I live in a family of 8 people and the only one wearing a mask was me. Only me. What hurt me the most was that my father told me that wearing a mask is considered disrespectful. In my mind I once again lost faith in him. It does not matter if its disrespectful. The pandemic does not care about your emotions or biased preferences. If you have it and not protecting yourself, you will get people sick. He told me to go upstairs to my room and to not come out since I was wearing a mask. Me in my room working on future college work, my father once comes with my mother at the door and my mom tries to fix my face shield saying I forgot to take off the plastic. I took it off myself making sure I was not next to my parents since they were with my grandpa. My mom then asks why I was wearing it, knowing very well why I have it on. My dad says"" its because he is retarded"" 

I do not swear nor do I approve of it, but My dad is actually my stepdad of 10 years and he was raised with bad people. I was furious at that comment, but I kept my cool and simply said that I will not take my mask off and that they should tell everyone to have a mask. They both left, but in a span of 10 minutes, my father walked in front of door 6 times. I knew he was still thinking about it. he then came into my room and says "" Are you not going to introduce yourself to your grandpa"" I told him that the only way that I will greet him is if he is wearing a mask and I am wearing my protective gear. He then proceeded to take my phone. I am now writing on Reddit thru my personal laptop that I use for remote learning. He gave me a punishment for doing the right thing. He let his pride blind him and he lied to me. My mother understands and expects that I will not introduce myself because I really do not want to take chances however my dad needs to be more educated and needs to stop trusting people. He needs to ask more questions and be more safe. How am I to cope with this. I am not religious. I live in the USA. My dad is simply being unethical and risky for no reason. It sucks. I already know that their is an unknown risk. I know college students have less of a chance to get sick and die, but thats it. College kids are still getting sick and some are dying. It is too dangerous, but my parents are brushing it off, since its a family member. It does not matter who it is. Stay safe!!",05Sep2020,1

I have no doubt i'll do the last one tax free, as I completed the other 4 so far, but I keep feeling like a major disappointment to my parents, despite them saying they support me and my mom having recently gone back to her job.

They're now okay sitting financially, but I still feel the shame of not living up to my own expectations this year. Taking a part time job would be impossible even without COVID, due to the many hours of school and study, so I have to rely on them.

I don't have expensive tastes in the vast majority and only go out sometimes for a fastfood every two-three weeks or something, maybe grabbing a bagel on the way home/to school, and I have to pay somewhere around 200€ a month for housing in the uni dorms.

I share the coffee with my partner and we brew it from capsules, I eat casserole and try to only shop for items I can't transport, like milk, maybe some fruit and the odd bottle of ketchup.

My only weekly expenses are the subway card (about 35€), and my hobbies are mostly video games and books, but I always wait for sales, always  borrow the books or save up money for holidays/things I want and I try to never spend more than I have in my pocket, and I try my best to limit myself at two-three purchases maximum per year. The only things other than hobbies that I spend my money on are maybe one movie a month with friends/a waffle and a bottle of juice on any dates (most dates are just limited to maybe a walk or watching online, we rarely if ever go to actual concerts or live shows, maybe once every few years).

I look after my things, sew my own clothing defects if any and steer clear of big brands in general, which does help me save up a lot of money in the long run.

My parents went through a period of single-income household a few years back and now that it's over, they seem to change a lot of things around the house, like buying a new dishwasher that they needed.

But I’ve been looking at condos at the HOA fees have been pretty steep. From $350-500+ for things like “keeping the common area clean, water, sewer”.

This might make me seem like I’m asking for a lot... and like I’m a brat. But he never posts anything with or of me. We only have like two photos together and that’s it.

Maybe I’m being weird and stupid and immature?? Idk. It just bothers me. And I don’t want to say anything to him because I don’t want him to start posting only because I said something. I’ve never been shown off so maybe I’m just curious.",05Sep2020,1
56,"I have not had good luck whit online dating. Typically I get few to no matches and it breaks me inside. It's been a few years since the last try. Here's what I'm going to do.

1. Stay calm.
2. Get my hair cut to the ideal shape (i have it extra rock star long for fun right now but I know it's not appealing and looks better shorter).
3. Dye out my grey hair (yeah I'm in my 30s now that's a thing).
4. Take some pictures. Target ideas:

\- 1 standing smiling outdoors chest and up with trees/nature.

\- 1 playing an instrument,  not looking at camera.

\- 1 wearing a stethoscope and smiling as a doctor in my office but hopefully not looking like a ""Linked in"" picture.

\- 1 skydiving.

I wanted to have one of my torso and abs but I'm still 5 lb of fat loss  and 10 lb of muscle gain away from looking impressive there so this will have to be good enough. That will be for next try in 3 months.

Clothing - I like simple clothing. Jeans and a plain grey v neck shirt. Should I go buy some flashily branded designer clothes? I don't fear gold diggers. I fear zero matches. I can afford it. Maybe? I find button up dress shirts just make you look stuffy even if they're nice unless you could pass for James Bond which I can't.

Then I'm going to throw myself on the mercy of the mob. One can dream.

What do you think? Anything else I should be doing/thinking? I want to take a slim girl to a nice Italian restaurant (or invite her over with delivery) and talk. I want this time to be a WINNER. Not another ""put my ego through the garbage disposal.""",05Sep2020,1
57,"First of all hi, thank you for opening this post!!

I’m gonna try to outline my problem as quick as possible:

I live in germany, graduated from school and attending university starting Oct - Nov (depending on the university).

Due to germany’s system I got an offer for a city (in this case called “B”) and i’m waiting for an offer for another city (called “A”).

Here’s the thing: Since B gave me an offer already i got a place there SECURED. While me waiting on an offer from A could have me either get one or not (which would result me in having to go to B)

Pros about A:
-I’d be near home (easy moving)
-I’d be able to move in with my best friend (both being near someone i know and less rent)
Pros about B:
-I can fully “embrace” myself (do all the things i’d not try infront of my bff, such as streaming)

Cons about A:
-Can’t fully “embrace” myself
Cons about B:
-Full rent
-Far away from family and friends

Now the thing is, typically i’d wait for A to send me and offer due to a higher amount of Pros. The problem is simply that i’m gonna have to look for an apartment NOW whether i go to A or B. If i wait for an offer from A i might not get an apartment for B, if i get an apartment for B i might still get an offer from A.

I know this isn’t a lot of information but i’m close to having a mental breakdown because time is running and i can’t decide whatsoever........ PLEASE HELP ME",05Sep2020,1
58,"For context, they both have known this friend for longer than I have, i met the Crush lets call her ""Jessica"" at the same time that i met the friends that have a crush on her. I am much closer with Jessica than I am with the other 2 friends, Jessica and I talk everyday and we have talked about some very serious and personal things, so her friendship feels very special to me. We are all in a groupchat together (there are 15 people in the groupchat) so people can often see how other people are interacting with each-other. Although im not *that* close to the other 2 friends I also talk to them in another groupchat.

I started to realize that something was weird as one of the friends had left the groupchat, he didnt say that he was leaving, i just noticed that his name wasnt on the list of members any more.

In the other groupchat (the one Jessica isnt in) we were in a voicechat and both friends admitted that they had massive crushes on Jessica to the point that it was having a significant negative impact on their mental health.

They went on to say that part of the reason that it was having such a negative impact on their mental health was because Jessica didnt give them much attention and that it annoyed them that she gave so much attention to me. This really shocked me, it felt like they were trying to make me feel bad for talking to one of my friends.

Later in the conversation they started saying rude things about Jessica and blaming her for how they felt, i remained quiet as they were doing this but i felt extremely uncomfortable as i completely disagreed with everything that they were saying. Even after the 2nd friend (the one who didnt leave the groupchat) said rude things about Jessica he is still in the groupchat and has still been talking to her a little a bit.

So, what should I do? Should i tell Jessica how they feel? Should I tell Jessica that they were being rude? Should I tell them to stop saying rude things about Jessica?

I have no idea what i should i do, any help would be really appreciated.",05Sep2020,1
59,"My \[30/M\] sister \[28/F\] and I work for the same nationwide retail company, but on opposite sides of a fairly large city. Because sending customers to/from stores is a common practice if we happen to be out of stock on any particular item, everyone who works for my store knows everyone who works for her store (and vice-versa).

Recently I found out that my sister is constantly trying to get together small groups of people to do things (drinks, dinners, go to the gym, etc) and they involve my coworkers/friends. She has always been the more outgoing of us, and is constantly looking to talk to someone or be doing something. It bothers me that now all my coworkers are constantly talking with her in group chats/becoming friends with her and all I hear about all day at work is ""your sister sent me this meme"" or ""your sister told me this about you"". I have gone from having my own identity, to just being """"Mary's"" brother"".

This has happened before too. A couple years ago she became friends with a girl in my group of friends, and she started to come to our friendly gatherings, and eventually started dating one of my friends, despite me saying I was uncomfortable with it. 

I feel like she unintentionally latches onto my friends and my/our coworkers and then, because of her dominating personality, overshadows me and then I just become known as ""the brother"".

Is there a way to get over this? Do I have the right to feel upset/mad about this? Is there a polite and endearing way to tell her to stop/leave?",05Sep2020,1

61," 

I am really trying to better myself and become more humble. I am a sophomore in college. I have a long history of being bullied in highschool which has caused me to have insecurity issues. I really did not have any real friends until my senior year. I also have auditory processing Disorder and honestly probably ADHD as well. This means that socializing, especially in groups, is just that much harder for me. I have been a lot more confident in myself to where I do put self out there in terms of talking to new people but I am still overall really socially awkward.

Over the past 2 years I would say now I have become increasingly more braggy. I feel the need to come across as this smart and person who has friends. I recently joined a fraternity, where the people are all generally nice guys but I really havent made any real friends. Once again I feel like an outsider. In my head though I think of ways I can come across as smarter and better than them in ways. I even do this with my close friends. Also on social media. I have become increasingly obsessive with how many followers and likes I have.

One other thing I do and am ashamed of that I do is that I think about things to brag about before I go hangout with people. It might be a suddal brag about my GPA or something like that. Is this normal and how Do I fix it?",05Sep2020,1

63,"If your life has been hard lately and you don’t know what to do, this checklist is for you. Each of the following points is something important I’ve been repeating when helping people, both in and out of reddit, because they are common mistakes people make that affect much more than they think.

First of all, all you really have to fight through this life is a body and a mind. Even though some people speak of “spiritual problems”, believing in a spirit that is immortal but that can also have problems makes no sense at all, since what can be hurt can be killed. So “spiritual problems” only make sense if you believe in a spirit that is somehow vulnerable, which is not useful and does not make sense too for several reasons I won’t list here. It makes far more sense to say our problems are either physical or mental, and that our currently science has not understood many of them or the extent of all. This is also very practical, since we have very clear ways to improve body body and mind. Being practical empowers us. Being practical does not leave us lost. Simpler problems can be attacked more efficiently. So, without further ado:

1 - Feeling low on energy or without motivation? Tap into the natural energy you already have.

Let’s start with the worst case scenario: Not being able to do anything.
There is one thing you can do without actually doing anything, which is meditation. But I’m not talking about any meditation. I’m talking about something deep. A deep meditative state is VERY healing, but it requires shutting down the senses more. At the very least, you can wait for night to fall, and just close yourself off in a completely dark room. Use whatever room is available; even your bathroom if needed. If you can make it completely silent too, all the better. Choose whatever position you want and stay quiet as long as you like. The thing about meditation is that it must be a passive and observant process. You should try to understand yourself better and not use meditation as another way to control yourself by “trying to relax” or “concentrating on whatever”. When meditating, by having no goals at all you achieve self-knowledge. Also, by allowing yourself to bathe in complete darkness you’ll be producing a lot of melatonin, which is the sleep related hormone we produce in darkness. This hormone has many healing properties which by itself should give you at least a little bit of energy.

Then, when feeling a bit rested, the next thing you should do is check your diet ASAP! There are many foods that actually drain our energies instead of giving us more. STOP consuming processed crap and artificial junk full of weird additives. People highly underestimate the effects some foods and drinks have on their physiologies. To summarize it very briefly, if you keep consuming junk you’re giving your liver and your kidneys TONS of work to keep filtering crap all the time. This can have a high energetic cost and it WILL drain your energy. And that’s leaving out all the weird collateral effects these additives can also have. Not consuming ANYTHING except water can be much better than many foods out there. Everyone should be eating many fruits and vegetables everyday (something every respectable health professional keeps teaching). Also, the ONLY liquid your body needs is water. Think deeply on this. In a world full of crap soft drinks it’s even easy to forget the only liquid we need is JUST WATER. If you feel like drinking something else, MAKE YOUR OWN with fruits, herbs and so on. Like I said, both your liver and your kidneys will thank you dearly and contribute their energy to your overall energy. Learning how to make your own food is also an essential skill to live a better life. There are many simple recipes that can taste absolutely delicious while requiring very little work, like, for example, a fruit salad with honey and nuts sprinkled around. Extremely nutritious, absolutely delicious, VERY cheap, and doesn’t even require fire. Then, you can always check youtube and watch chefs make very simple recipes. Even the great ones like Gordon Ramsay will teach many simple things.

Last, but not least, C U T toxic people OUT of your life as much as you can. This has been said by many and I repeat it. Especially considering we’ll always spend far more time with ourselves than with others. Your personal evolution is much more individual than you think, and your connections with others are temporary, even if some stay with you until death comes.


Start with these and I guarantee you you’ll have more energy to fight your problems.
After you have rested more and have started a more proper diet, we go to the next step!

2 - Got energy but don’t know what to do with it? Invest it into quality physical activity and studying new things.

Even though our shit society makes it look like we need to earn tremendous amounts of money to live, most of said money just goes into “comfort” that makes our bodies and minds weaker by the day. You don’t need to run the rat race. You can be much happier and much healthier with far less resources if you adopt a more “do it yourself” approach to life; and such an approach should require at least quality exercise for both body and mind. You’ll get the bits of energy you built with the first step and turn it into more, working to have greater and greater energy reserves to LIVE life. For the body, do BOTH aerobic and anaerobic work. There are many people who think only one of these is enough, but IT IS NOT. You should do both cardio and strength training, and by focusing on intensity and efficiency one can do both in an hour or even less. Then, for the mind, there are lots of excellent books and even excellent courses around on the internet. Why not change that internet bullshit into something useful? Learn a new science, learn a new craft, build something, etc… Even happiness is something that depends on having good levels of both physical health and mental health. The more screwed up these are, the less happy we’re going to be. Everything else that is not YOU is secondary.



Naturally, much more can be said about all this. This is just a summary, and one I did not review much, so I am sorry for any mistakes or if anything is unclear. If you can relate to this, send me a message and I’ll be happy to chat and go deeper into these topics and many more. Take it easy and take care of yourself, because if you don’t, noone will.",05Sep2020,1

66,"2 years ago, I got extremely drunk with my best friend of 20 years at her house (I was celebrating something. It was just us two there). At some point (probably early hours of the morning, I don't remember it) her husband came home also drunk. I didn't know this, but she suspected that he liked me because of things she overheard him say about me to his friends. So she left me with him, went to bed, and set her phone to record to see if he would try anything with me. Apparently he did, and apparently we kissed, possibly a few times, and were sat talking and laughing for around half an hour. I say 'apparently' because I don't remember a single thing about it. I think sometimes people lie about not remembering drunk deeds, but I truly do not remember kissing him at all.

She told me the next day after she had listened to the recording. I couldn't believe I had done that to her (at first I literally didn't believe it. Not because I thought she would lie to me, but because it seemed so strange). I loved her - she was closer to me than my actual sister. I never ever wanted to hurt her. I was, and still am, so confused because I was in no way attracted to him (at all!) and I didn't even like him as a person most of the time. She would tell me how he would upset her, and it pissed me off so much.

I obviously apologised repeatedly and profusely.

She stayed with him (they have kids) but cut me out of her life. She deleted every photo of me and her from her social media profile (but a month later made a post about how much of a great husband he is). A month later she told me that she wanted work on things with me. But after around a year she cut me off again (she said she said speaking to me made her argue with him). 

I feel bad even speaking about my feelings, seeing as I am the one who caused the pain, and I know that I deserve everything and more. But after 2 years it's all getting too much to cope with and I don't know what to do. I'm not exaggerating when I say it derailed my life. I have lost her, the respect of her family (who I have known since I was a kid. I'm not very close to my own family), all my other friends (who I knew through her). I feel humiliated when I think about what they all say and think of me (apparently she has even discussed it with all of her work colleagues, who all know my name). I nearly lost my new job (which I started a week after this happend) because I couldn't make it through a day (or hour, sometimes) without breaking down - and that went on for months. I still struggle to concentrate now, so I may still lose it. I celebrated my 30th (which I'd been thinking about for years) with no friends. I felt I had to leave Facebook because most of my photos were with her, and most of my FB friends now hated me - so that makes me feel more lonely. I even have new frown lines and permanently swollen eyes, which I'm sure are from all the crying over these last 2 years. Meanwhile nothing has changed for him. 

I'm sorry to ask for advice when it's my fault, but I'm at a loss. Before this I was happy, cheery, goofy. I'm not like that anymore. I'm quieter and more self-conscious. Life is just dark. The first thing I feel when I wake up is heartbreak, and the last thing I feel at night is the same. I have tried therapy but it hasn't worked. I have tried making new friends (through groups and work) but I struggle a lot with that. I can't stop thinking 'why did I do that?' and 'how different would things be if that had never happend?'. My bf (who I was in a relationship with at the time but forgave me) used to say that time would eventually heal this, but it hasn't. The more time passes, the more evidence I have that I will never feel OK again. I can't feel like this for much longer. It's just too much. Is there any way at all to move on?",05Sep2020,1
67,"I had a party yesterday and the neighbors said that they had someone drunk knock on their door aggressively and we got in trouble with the housing complex, if anything happens again, cops will come and search the house.

I later found out that it was my girlfriends friend from home (who is also my neighbor currently) was the one who caused it, but he was actually just lost and apologized to the neighbor who said it was no big deal, my girlfriend said however that I’d my roommates found out that she would not come to my apt because she is worried that the blame would be put on her because they are technically her friends, and it was an innocent mistake, and she doesn’t want to be ridiculed by it. She even said that she would lie to her roommates if it were reversed, but I don’t think this lie would hold strong considering my roommates are sure to ask who it was.

72,"i have no idea how to start this, and i’m not sure anyone would have any idea how to start a thing like this. But here we go.

A few years ago, i began to see the signs. They were very subtle, like forgetting a phone number he used to remember, mixing up plans, forgetting to pick up his phone. Things we can all do from time to time, so i thought nothing off it. But this last year, it became very clear to me that something was very off, as in VERY off. I had to help with simple tasks such as sending a text, helping him open his mail, help him with his sentences, and even something as simple as finding a cup from the cupboard. This might not seem like a big deal, but seeing how your own father become incapable of things even a 10 year old can do, it becomes worrying. Even as soon as the other day, i had to help him sleep, because he was hallucinating. Seeing your own father fall apart like that, is extremely scary! this has led to me staying away from my father more than usual ( i knoe this isn’t good), because i get so terrified seeing him get weaker and more forgetful. Even me being in the same room as him can make me tear up. It’s horrible.

So we did what any family would do, we went to went his diagnosis. Which the doctor was very quick so say that something seemed off, and immediately sent him to a specialist. A few weeks ago he got his diagnosis of Dementia, but they are currently in the process of figuring out which type it is, and in which state he’s in currently. 

So my question is, how do i deal with this? I’m still in high school, i’m only 17, and the thought that my father WILL die from this disease is so extremely scary and sad to me. I feel empty, i feel like i lost a part of my soul, and i have no idea what to do. I tried speaking to my school counselor, since i simply can’t focus on school. I feel like i’ve lost all

I don't come out of each month with a lot more in the bank than when I started, but I'm getting by.

But I've been doing research into living in other areas and I've discovered that there are some studios for rent in Chicago that aren't too much more expensive than where I'm already living, and I can earn at least $5 more an hour working there than here. It would honestly be a step up in terms of living situation, and I'd be putting even more money in the bank every month since I wouldn't be driving anywhere near as much. It would also put me in a good position to apply for tech jobs (I'm a software engineering student) once I've finished my degree, which I plan to finish online anyway.

I would often wake up crying in the morning before school and ask her if i could miss first period to calm down a bit. After i did this a few times, she yelled at me and told me to get my shit together.

A couple weeks after i told her i was depressed, i broke my isolation and went to a party out of town with my friends. She called me in the middle of the night and told me she snuck through my room and read my journal. Obviously i was pissed at her for ruining my night and breaking my privacy and instead of giving me space, she forced me to spend time with her and make me forgive her.

Fast forward to later in the year when it was my birthday. I was extremely depressed the day of my party and told her i wanted to cancel it. She told me that was not an option and to pull it together. I went back to my room to cry more until she called me back downstairs to show me a video. The video was about half an hour long of a family whose life was ruined by their son killing himself. I was unconsolable after watching this and cried in my room for about 7 hours until my first friend arrived. My mom still forced me to have my party. Later on the night of my party i hid in a closet to call my boyfriend who was long distance at the time, and i was really fucked up and couldnt stop crying. My mom found me and yelled at me and told me to go back with my friends.

Those are the top things i can remember and she never really gave me a true apology for any of it. I dont know how to handle my anger and I'm not sure why all of this is only hitting me now, years later. Im not sure if i can still confront her about this, or if i should get over it.",05Sep2020,1

Anyways chile, I’m def not a Victoria secret model or anything but I’ve been told by a lot of my friends and peers that they used to find me intimidating before they got to know me. I have a very perfectionistic personality and that translates to my looks. I used to have an anxiety disorder and coped with it by channeling it into making myself look “perfect”. I used to spend hours everyday in high school finding outfits to wear to school because I was pretty emotionally unstable and was dealing with both an anxiety disorder and with bulimia at the same time. I would have panic attacks every day before being dropped off at school and the only thing steady I had in my life was knowing that I felt better in fashionable clothing. I’m really passionate about fashion design and art, and for some I might come off as too much. 

I think I made a lot of guys nervous around me, and would hear through gossip that a good amount of guys were interested in me. But in high school I was rarely approached by guys, and the ones who did were usually the popular senior guys with god complexes.

A time when I did garner a lot of attention from guys was during summer school when my life went to shit. My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer and was going through chemotherapy, and since I come from a single mother household I was her sole home care provider. I was only 17 and went into a super dark depression. I would be up until 3am in the morning worrying about her and taking care of her. It was a very traumatic time for me to see my mother basically transform into a skeleton and a shell of her past self. 

I still had summer school and would just show up in a denim jacket and yoga pants with only a little bit of makeup. I would have died from embarrassment if I showed up like that during the regular school year. But it was at this time when a lot of the guys I had in my classes would approach me and ask me out to movies and such. I couldn’t because i had to take care of my mom pretty much 24/7, but it was a super weird experience because every time I looked in the mirror I saw a gremlin who smelled like chemo vomit.


Now that I’m in college things are a lot better now. My mom has recovered, and I don’t really have a problem with meeting guys since people are more expressive about their individual personality in college.",05Sep2020,1

84,"So like the title says we came back to our place, and honestly I was already dreading this because he had to leave some things in it since we evacuated last minute. The smell was horrendous and can only be described as ""rancid busselsprout vomit."" So we cleaned out the entire thing. Threw everything inside away. Chipped away the slurry of bloody ice in the freezer. Bleached it. Lysol-ed the fuck out of it. I've had plates of baking soda sitting in it for two days now. Of course the bulk of the smell has gone with all the stuff inside, but now the underlying base smell still remains. And the worse part is this smell infects everything we put in there. I cant even drink a bottle of cold water without drinking the smell as well. My fridge as of now is unusable. I can't keep cold food at all in my apartment. So I basically have two things I need advice on...

1. Is there any way to get rid of this smell (honestly I assume there isn't. Im thinking the smell is in the walls at this point)

2. How do I deal with my landlord about this? She's generally an unpleasant person, unwilling to fix things for tenants. I've been to the front office to talk to her but she's apparently gone and the person fielding the complaints doesn't know when she's due back, and also our maintenance guy is supposedly out with covid. I just would like to know what to prepare to talk with this woman for when she comes back.

88,"Thanks for taking the time to read this. 

I moved from my small home town to go live 13 hours away from home to a city to start my dream job with my friends in music. I lived with one friend (and parent) for 2 whole years and we never had any problems.

The COVID numbers were really big in this city and I didn't want to get it. I'm healthy and in my 20s but my sibling has a disease and my parents have always been super safe about everything, that's just how I grew up.  I never touched the rails in a mall, always made sure we washed our hands properly and even kicked people out of our house for not washing their hands when told multiple times, and more and more. So I was very on edge about a global pandemic. So I told my friends I was going back home to see my family, they didn't seem to have any problem with it. I ended up staying here for awhile because the numbers got worse in the city, where as my home town had around 5 cases. I told them I would be staying here for a bit until the numbers dropped, rather be safe than sorry. They got really pissed off at me. Saying that I think they are dirty and unhealthy and whatnot. I never said anything even remotely similar to that. I told them I never said anything like that but that I was sorry they felt that way and I didn't intend for them to feel like that. They blew it off and time went on. Since then, they haven't tried keeping in contact with me very much yet I try to talk to them but it's been mentally challenging when I don't think they like me anymore. We are still working on music projects together yet they never keep me informed as to what is going on when I try and tell them everything I'm doing. Finally, one member texted me asking if I knew about anything going on and I told him that I haven't heard anything and he then proceeded to tell me about major parts that are being changed that heavy involve me. They are going all over the places eating and dining anywhere they can and sometimes not even wearing masks. My friend's (one I was living with) brother had to move back home from the military. I asked if I needed to come back and move my stuff out of the house so he can have a room all to himself, they said that it wasn't a big deal and not to worry about it. So I didn't, but now all of my friends are moving into that house because the parent is moving out and I have to move my stuff out of the way until the brother moves out. Which come to find out, has been sleeping in my room and has sprayed soda all over my posters and bed head shelf thing (forgot what they are called) and my lamp and other things. Then my friend randomly started packing all of my stuff without my permission and all of my stuff is scattered and on the floor and in random boxes. I only know this because my friend had to FaceTime me to ask what was mine and what was his brothers. I'm so confused as to why they can't just talk to me and I don't know what I have done to make them hate me. I don't want to move back to my home town, but I feel like they will never treat me the same and will always give me shit for, and I quote ""hiding in a cornfield"".",05Sep2020,1
89,"Tldr:  I've been accused of cheating bc of similar answers with a friend i had studied with. The professor wont allow video evidence of me taking my exam which proves I didnt cheat in any way, so idk how to prove my innocence. Help!

I'm a senior studying mechanical engineering. This is supposed to be my last year, but if the school decides I'm guilty I may not be able to graduate on time and will lose my scholarships. 

One of the hardest courses in the ME credit plan is Engineering Analysis 2, or differential equations 2. This course deals with very advanced mathematics and is incredibly difficult, most students have to retake the class once or twice. A friend and I decided to study together before an exam (this friend had failed the class twice before, and knew that the professor's lectures are never anything like the exams. The exams are always 100% harder than anything we ever practice) since he had more notes and resources. We used notes from many different professors and rehearsed practice problems to memorize steps in problems. We did this in case similar problems came up in the exam, we would at least be able to get partial credit. Well after practicing and memorizing all kinds of problems for days on end, we took the exam. 

Because of covid 19 we took the exams through zoom and had the cameras focused on us and the class and video cams were recorded. We were in different rooms, only had the allowed page of notes available, and we did. Not. Cheat. 

Here's the problem-- one of the problems in the exam was similar to a problem we had memorized. But, the problem we had practiced and memorized, we did it wrong. There usually are not solution manuals for these kinds of problems so we had no way of knowing we did it wrong. So we memorized the mistakes and all, and when we did the exams, we ended up making similar mistakes. The teacher accused us of cheating for this reason, even though I got a significantly higher grade all in all. My friend argued against the charge, but since his overall scores were so low, he wouldn't have passed the class even if he hadn't received a 0 for cheating. Me on the other hand, i would have been able to pass the course if i hadnt been given a 0 for suspected cheating.

I didnt cheat. But the professor wont allow the zoom video recording as proof, and even though i sent in all my notes they say its not enough. What can i do??",05Sep2020,1

91,"Hey guys. I'm a 19 year old guy who is currently doing nothing in life as I wait to start at a pretty good junior college in January. 

My parents died when I was 16, and that was really hard for me, but since then, and before then, I had never really felt any great emotional pain. I really don't have any mental illnesses or manicness or hard experiences that could give my life any meaning. I was kind of a shy, sentimental boy, and I kind of failed at school in tenth grade and I had to finish at 19. I've never had any interests or any real skills. My parents were very independent minded, and they kind of raised me to be like that without knowing it, so I never really had any interests or things that I was good at when I was young. I just had good grades at school and rode my bike everywhere and watched tv for like 6 hours a day until I replaced tv with computer when I was like 13. I've always been super independent and introverted though (like my parents), and I really like that about myself. I really have nothing paining me or making me full of desire right now. I just have a generally positive sense of myself, some bad memories from my parents getting divorced and then dying in the same year, an apartment that I take care of, and my super-relaxed aunt and uncle and grandmother who i see or phone like once a month. I wish I had the kind of family that kind of coaxed me to do things like Asians do, but we are just kind of friendly liberal Jews, and they really lowered the bar for me when I failed like every class the year after my parents died (not due to ""depression"" by the way, I kind of spent my first 15 years relying on my excellent memory and never really doing any homework, and that kind of came back to bite me). 

I just kind of browse the internet with my pathetic historical and political interests and occasionally play a baseball game on my phone. I also read a lot of cool non-romantic fiction. I used to be super ambitious and romantic, and I would make these kind of manic work plans, but after I got into junior college, I kind of just stopped with that because it was a kind of remanent of childhood. I've still got an ambitious streak though. I moved to like four school districts and some private schools in my childhood, and though that isn't more than the typical moving childhood, it's way more than the average experience here in America, where most kids go to school with the same group of people for 12 years. I've never really had any friends, and I'm a bit too overweight and Jewish-faced (i literally look like an obese version of Max from Aronofsky's ""Pi"") to be attractive to any women right now. I'm six foot four though, so I've decided I have some potential, so I work out now, and I've started taking regular showers and brushing my teeth and washing my face. This has really made a huge difference.

How can I make my life more exciting and worth living without explicitly doing that? Like do you also have a boring middle class life and literally nothing? I don't leave my apartment much, and I probably won't for a while because I live in America, where the lockdown isn't anywhere near over. I have some medical things I wanna save money which will really improve my confidence and sex life that I kind need, so I'm gonna get a job for that soon, but other than that, I'm just completely at a loss. I have nothing, and I'm not sad enough about it to change. I just kind of have fun reading an eating and sleeping and watching youtube and masturbating in my room. Any advice? Feel free to shit on me. I'd just like to have some interesting experiences and do something cool and difficult before I die. Thank you for reading!",05Sep2020,1
92,"Ok so I feel so stuck. this is a long story so I am 17 so I can’t get a job without my mom permission but she doesn’t let me have a job why because she says because. I have asked her a lot of times if I can get a job. But she always says no and when I ask for a reason I ALWAYS get in trouble:/ . She started cleaning around the house and started saying their bugs everywhere on the clothes. She showed me and it was Lint. I told her that But she said I was stupid and it’s tiny bugs and am I blind. So recently every shirt or anything that has lint she’s been throwing away. I am so upset because she threw away all my shirts, jeans, UNDERWEAR, and my new hoodies. Leaving me with only 4 beeping ugly shirts, 2 jeans, and 4 freaking underwears😭😭😭. Before she threw them away I tried stoping her but my she told me and I quote I am the “Adult” here and I know what I’m doing so stop disrespecting me. And you guessed it I got in trouble. She said she is going to buy me new clothes, but I know she can’t because all of our bills got raised(🥺😭😭just my luck) like our rent which instead of being  1149 it’s now a whoping 1457 which takes out a lot of money from my mom so I know I’m going to be stuck with those clothes for a long time. Especially since they cut back my moms hours cuz of COVID. (Next part is before our rent went higher and she threw away all my clothes)Since my mom didn’t let me get a job I made my own business sounds good right?!! The first day I opened after promoting it a ton I made 13 sales and I got 350!!$$ I was planning to use that to to expand my business and pay my dogs vet stuff and food. But literally a day later I get a note saying the rent is raising for next month 😭which doesn’t make sense because of COVID  and a lot of people’s hours of work got cut and they raise the rent 🙄. So I had to use the my 350 dollars for the rent not because my mom asked me but because i felt it was the smartest thing to do. Because if I don’t have a house I don’t have no business either way lol. So now after my 2 days of business I have no longer have a business 😭😭😭😭or money. I have asked my mom again to let me get a job so I could put some money into my business and help her out but she doesn’t let me. Then I asked her to maybe ask her boss for more work but then she told me that to stop telling her what to do and stop bossing her. That’s not what I wanted to do but now since they raised the rent all our money is going to be beyond tight. So I just want to help out but she won’t let me. I don’t know what to do

Sorry for the inbound wall of text,

Alright, so what I'm about to say needs some background knowledge beforehand. A little less than a year I sorta asked my crush out on a date to go to the movies but she had something on the day I wanted to go so it didn't happen. She didn't really reject me I guess but I can't really remember her response.

Fast forward to today and we both work at the same pool as lifeguards. I wasn't working today but my brother went to the pool to hang out with a few friends. From what he told me, he said that she went up and asked him if I had asked him if that was me asking her out. He said yes (Probably not only just that one word though) and then she left. I'm going to work tomorrow and she's gonna be there and Idk what to do. Do I ask her about it or just do what I've been doing and not say anything? Please I need your help guys

Today as I was getting the youngest one dressed and ready for her dad to pick her up we were trying to find her underwear. A and the other youngest one S are best friends and on their snack breaks and lunch like to dress up in Disney princess costumes and fling their clothes everywhere so it’s usually hard to find the outfits they arrived in that morning. 
I asked A where and what her underwear looked like and the other young girl (S) described them for me. This threw me off a little, why does her friend know what her underwear looked like? So I asked her. 
She proceeds to tell me that earlier while they were playing “doctor” she had decided to take off her friends undies and examine her. I wasn’t in the room when this happened and it really rang an alarm in my head. I immediately told S and A that this doctor game was not allowed and touching each other under our clothing isn’t okay. 
The reason is because earlier I had found A behind a door crying. When I went to approach her she began screaming and begging me not to touch her. This was after their game of doctor had happened. 
Reddit, I’m asking for help. I decided to text both the mothers and ask them to chat with me this weekend when they were free and we are meeting on a zoom call tomorrow. Where do I begin? I feel like this isn’t my place but as a future teacher and mandated reporter I obviously want both parents to know there is a situation here that honestly feels out of my control. 
I doubt there’s any serious harm. But I don’t ever want any child feeling unsafe around me or not feeling like they can’t come to me and tell me what happened. 
So if you could lend me some advice or even just encouragement, I feel like a fuck up for not realizing this sooner and worried that the parents might think I’m crossing boundaries?

I also feel like I always say the wrong thing and sometimes when telling stories end up lying or wanting to show off something I'm not. On top of this I always think they are conspiring against me like if I have something good they will hate me for it.

103,"My little sister dropped out of H.S. at 15 due to constant bullying, her father passing away due to alcoholism, and our mother being neglectful. From 15-18 she went through a bad depression, feeling stuck, lost, unsure of her future, and worried about the real world.

I couldn't be there every day to help her find herself and her vision, but I helped her in a way that I helped myself - I went to the bookstore and bought several self-help books related to her current mental, emotional, and financial situation. And as the months and years went by I saw her open up and be more comfortable and confident in herself.

At 19 I got her a job as a breakfast cook at the hotel I worked at. And at 20 I got her a job as a waitress/line cook/dishwasher at a donut shop I worked at.

So since last year she has been working towards her GED, and with the pandemic she lost her job at the donut shop and started to focus more on her GED, up to a few days ago when she earned it on her own.

So here's the dilemma, and where I need your advice, Redditors. I have been lucky enough to have found a job at an apartment complex since August of last year, so when the pandemic hit, my job wasn't on the line. In the past year I have saved up a large amount of money to move out to CA or NY when this pandemic is finally controlled to continue my pursuit of a creative career (B.F.A. - Fine Arts, December 2016). But with my sister earning her GED I need to help her continue moving forward, for my sake and hers. What would you say the most viable gift for her would be? A new-used car (she currently has a 2008 Ford Escape XLT w/120k miles), paid for classes towards a certificate of some kind (I can't pay for full tuition to university, but she is interested in interior design and I have found a certificate program for that), pay for 6months of rent for her, etc.?

I've always been able to be the best at what I do, and now because of my past lack of knowledge about what it takes to break into investment banking (ie getting a sophomore and then junior internship), he will hit a peak I will never be able to reach.

105,"I work in a fast casual style restaurant.  We hired this autistic guy who is maybe 19 about 2 months ago.  To be honest, most special needs people don't work out in our restaurant.  I always like to give people a chance though, so we tried working with him.  Most people that are special needs are trained on how to clean the dining room and to run orders to customers.  He struggles at doing both.

Since Covid, our cleanliness procedures have changed.  If you're doing the dining room, you have to stay out there constantly and jump on tables when people leave, as well as knowing which chemical to use.  He has a hard time staying on task.  We often would find him wandering around in the back and not taking care of the dining room.  He also couldn't understand the procedure to using the right chemicals to clean.  Also, we like our dining room people to talk to our customers.  Things like to see how their meal is, or if they need any condiments, etc.  He doesn't talk to people, and if he does, he comes off as rude.  I've had a few customers complain to me about him about how they asked for something and he just ignored them.  Looking at him, you wouldn't really notice that he is atypical.

We then tried getting him to learn how to run orders out.  A big part of that is hustle and accuracy.  You don't need to run, but you should have some sense of urgency.  He walks so slow, and we've all tried to get him to get some pep in his step. We also need the runners to confirm orders they are running out.  With more to-go orders than ever before, we need them to read off the receipt to make sure they are giving it to the correct person.  He doesn't do this, even after much reminding.  When he runs, I know there will be callbacks for wrong orders and missing items.  

As an employee, he's tough to handle.  He constantly wanders from his position, so we keep on having to get him on track.  He will go around and touch things he has no business touching.  Like I saw him play with the faucet on the coffee machine that hot water comes out of and almost burn himself.  Or he will go over to the dessert station and just press the hot fudge pump and make a mess.  It's a constant struggle, and I feel like we've done our best to meet him half way.  I've worked with employees who have special needs or accommodations.  For example we have the nicest older lady that works our dining room in the morning.  She can't lift trays or trashes, but she will stay out there the whole time cleaning, and talk to the customers.  I just don't know if I can ask everyone else to bend over backwards for this one employee.

I don't know what to do.  When he was hired, I talked to his dad.  He told me some of the things that might help, and some strategies they use for him.  A few weeks later we kept running into these problems, and I wanted to let him go.  I just didn't think our place is right for him.  The dad went on and told me how his son feels like he has dozens of new friends, and you can't take it away from him.  It honestly made me feel really bad about myself, so I kept him on the schedule.  He only really works one day a week for a few hours, and even then it's still very rough.  I'm also kind of worried on how our restaurant could get sued for discrimination or something if he was let go. 

Sorry for writing a book, but I wanted to be as detailed as possible.  Please let me know if you've been in a situation like this and what you did.  Thanks for reading!",05Sep2020,1
106,"I (22NB) *they/them pronouns only please* am in my fifth year of my interior design (ID) degree (and before y’all try and dismiss me, ID is more akin to interior architecture than anything else. No HGTV bs is involved). ID is a very technical career and at many colleges/universities is actually a bachelors in math and science but I’m going to an art and design school so I’m getting a BFA. We learn all the same stuff but we just focus a little more on the aesthetic side of things. **Also as a student unless you have an internship everything you do is theoretical so don’t worry about, I’m not working yet**

I love a lot about ID. I love that we do so much to improve the human experience of a space and can change so much with doing so little and open up a whole new world for people. I love making things look and function beautifully. But all that being said, I’m don’t think I’m cut out for this line of work. The hours are really long (sometimes 60+ hours including working on weekends and outside of work hours), everything you do is incredibly technical and if something goes wrong you can hurt someone or cost a business (big or small) thousands of dollars to fix the issue and even have legal actions filed against you in some cases. This scares the hell out of me, not just the thought of messing up or hurting people but having so much responsibility in a field I don’t even fully understand. In my case it feels more like a deep appreciation and surface level understanding than thorough knowledge.

My professors say I should be doing so much more but I always try my hardest, or as much as my depression will allow me to. They say they see potential in me but I just need to work on it but I don’t think I’ll ever get to the level of my peers. This is me speaking realistically, in no way am I trying to gain sympathy from y’all, I just know my skill level will never be high enough to be successful and useful in my field and do the complicated work that the job entails. So please don’t send me meaningless platitudes like “if you just put your mind to it anything is possible!!” I understand that urge but overly recycled lines you’d find on the walls of a Lulu Lemon store are not going to help me magically understand this degree more thoroughly.

In addition to this, I also feel extremely uncomfortable around my peers. They all remind me of the girls that bullied me all throughout my school career. I’m not only one of the very few queer designers/students but I’m nonbinary and that is quite literally unheard of for the most part. I don’t doubt that there are other designers like me but I’ve never met or seen one. And yes I know, I can’t assume that someone is not LGBTQIA+ and they’re just not out but I’m not really that out either and I’m still obviously not cis or straight and yet people choose to ignore that. Some of my peers don’t even know what nonbinary means. So relating to my future colleagues on a personal level is tough to say the least. Also because my interests are so different for the most part. I won’t get into it but think goth/grunge homebody versus stereotypical Sorority girls (and not in a look at me I’m ~different~ from everyone else way I just have to make it clear that we are polar opposites for the most part and my major is literally called the sorority of the school despite not having any Greek life)

Besides the fact that I’m two semesters away from the real world and a degree I’m probably not able to finish, my parents are helping me through college. We are not well off at all and are always barely skated by and their support for my sibling (20NB) and I through college and in our degrees means the world to me. I don’t want all this work I’ve done and money I’ve spent go to waste and disappoint them when they’ve done so much for me. I don’t want all of this debt that I’ve incurred on my end and theirs to all be for nothing but I really don’t think I’m going to be able to finish this degree and even if I did, be able to get a job in the field and be successful in anyway.

My other issue is, I have no idea what I would do in place of ID! I really don’t! I’ve thought of just about everything but most of it would involve going to more college for another degree, going to technical school, or working minimum wage job of some kind (which I physically wouldn’t be able to handle due to back issues). I’m not good at anything really besides cooking but I wouldn’t want to make a career out of that. I love art but I’m not an artist. I’m horrible at math and science. I can’t play instruments or sing. I’m horrible at video games and am not at all knowledgeable when it comes to technology. I juts don’t know!

I know this was a lot to read and I’m sorry for that and also for dumping my troubles onto others but I’ve been thinking about this a lot lately and needed to get this off my chest. I am just really lost and would appreciate some advice or guidance since I can’t really go to my parents about this until I figure something else out and I don’t have a really great support system other than my sibling but they can’t really help me either.",05Sep2020,1
107,"I should start this out by saying I have very bad anxiety. Every night, I have to tell my parents, boyfriend, and friends that I love them and it HAS to be the last thing I say, to the point of me saying it 4-5 times in a row so that it’ll be the last thing. If I don’t, I have anxiety attacks wondering if tonight would’ve the night they’d die and they wouldn’t know that I love them.

My dads been telling me that he wishes he’d never wake up again and that he wishes he would die for as long as I can remember. My earliest memory of it was when I was 9. My dads had a very rough life, and has a problem with alcohol. He currently takes antidepressants, but doesn’t see a therapist. My mom has talked to him about seeing one but he won’t.

108,"So, like, I go into my fridge, right? And it stinks like hot food. Flashback! My super awk roommate has been blatantly beating around her stupid hairy bush hinting that I stop finally stop eating the food she leaves in our shared fridge that we share, and for the longest time wouldn't come right out and just finally say it. Say: stop eating my food I leave in our shared fridge. She just kinda mumbles to herself or talks around it. Which to be fair is just obnoxious so I always thought if she's going to play headgames like talking in code than whatever, I'll just keep eating her stuff (which probably would go bad if I don't). But so anyway, finally I guess I had one too many peaches and she like practically loses it that there's just an empty bowl of peach fuzz. She's kinda pacing and acting like normal but tugging at her hair and I don't say anything because she just walked in and I've got one of her pepsi's behind my back. Anyway, so she like cried about whatever and we both agreed that neither of us would steal each other's food from that point on, and that we had boundaries (in a shared fridge? I kno, but anyway), and that we would trust each other. And so but then guess what? Like I said about the hot food stink in the fridge. She knows that I know that she knows I love chicken. Also, she never fucking finishes the chicken. She buys a box of fried chicken and it stays in the fridge for days if I don't eat it. I know because I was away for the long weekend and chicken was still there. Anyway so I smell it in the fridge and now I know there's chicken but it's like impossible to find. So what does that tell you? She finally comes out about the food and makes all these tearful trust promises and then hides her shit? Hides it on the bottom shelf in the back? (She's short AF but whatever) So anyway, now I""m just sitting here with my laptop going over it and over it in my head because I fully know what will happen. She'll be so pissed that I dug it out from behind her prop groceries (canned coconut milk??? barf) and ate it, that she'll be guilt tripping tomorrow and I'll forget completely how to explain how she broke my trust first, and how I never would have gone looking for chicken if she hadn't have so obviously hidden chicken right after our meeting. And that maybe if she actual trusted me and actually wanted to change the situation she shouldn't have gone ahead and hid chicken behind a castle of shit she clearly only bought to hide chicken and shit in the first place. Cans in the fridge??? Like sorry I broke your fucking tin can chicken FORTRESS but do friends even HAVE fortresses? Esp. friends trusting friends anew? Either she'll cry and I'll forget or otherwise she'll just silent treatment me again until I probably explode and make no sense or sound like the bad one. Either way i'm the bitch because I never buy groceries or smth. I don't know. Ew I hate roommates.  


Half of me honestly feels like getting dressed and going downstairs and buying a whole new box of chicken for her to leave in our fridge. Seriously.",05Sep2020,1

112,"I was taking a walk in my local park when all of the sudden I hear furious quacking. I look and see what appeared to be the exact same duck from the AFLAC commercial pacing back and forth.  As I go closer to him, he walks close to me continuing to quack in a distressed manner.  I suddenly become aware of a women walking over and shaking her head saying, ""That's too bad, I thought he would have gone into the lake by now.  Bewildered, I asked her, ""Do you know this duck?""  She told me that her son had brought two ducks, (one of which was eaten by their CAT) and that they decided to let this other duck go.  I tried my best to explain to her letting a domesticated duck (or any pet really) into the wild is a BAD, bad idea.  This concept seemed to be entirely new to her.  She sighed, opened up the wire fence (that I'm pretty sure she cut into) and beckoned the duck to follow her.  I watched as the duck padded along the pavement, following her home.  It's what she muttered as she left that worries me.  She stated, ""I think I will try again tomorrow in the daylight.""  Something tells me my words fell on deaf ears.  Does anyone know what next steps I should take? I'm thinking about trying to maybe contact the park's department and let them know.  I would really appreciate it.

115,"Hi, I’m new to this forum and decided to post something that’s been on my mind for a better half of a year.

I’m at University studying a bachelor of industrial design and I’m halfway through my studies. Design is something I really enjoyed in highschool and I didn’t know what I wanted to do when I graduated so I thought I’d try something I enjoyed and roll with it.

Throughout this course there have been periods where I have really enjoyed it. But lately (over a year) I’ve lost all passion and motivation. It’s just really boring to me now and I’m just thinking I don’t want to do this anymore as a career. So I don’t want to waste any more money on something I’ve lost all interest in.

The military is something I can clearly see a future, a career, family etc. So I definitely have a goal or next step per say.

Now the issue..
I know it sounds weak that I fear my parents will be disappointed in me for suggesting dropping out of uni.  I’m very close with my parents and they have sweat blood and tears to raise me. I respect them, which is why it’s hard to tell them.

I 100% want to pursue a different pathway, I know what I want to and I’m ready to get it. I just want to know how to lay it out to them and that’s where hopefully you guys can help out.

117,"This is going to be somewhat long because I only plan on doing this once. I don’t ask for help and I don’t especially want help but it’s either this or I end it. 

So for starters, I wasn’t always messed up. It took years and years of horrible times to get me to this point and I feel like it’s almost my destiny to go through horrible shit and somehow come out on the other side, more fucked up. 

When I was a kid, not knowing what it all meant, I watched as my dad had an affair with the babysitter. When I was five my parents divorced and it was ugly. Constant fighting, constant back and fourth between one house and the other, my parents constantly pulling my sister and I either direction hoping we would choose one or the other. They would say horrible things about each other and still do to this day. So once that finally settled out and it became normal going from one place to the other, my mother married a new guy named Mark. He taught me how to use a bow, he would let me drive his boat, he would take us on vacation (something my dad never did after the divorce) and he taught me what kind of a man I should look up to. He never talked about my dad, never said a word in bad taste about him and was someone I looked up to. When I was ten or eleven he got brain cancer. For two years I watched as he fell apart, day by day I watched the person I looked up to slowly die. And then one day he was gone. I still remember the funeral like it was yesterday. 

Fast forward two or so years and Marks best friend takes my mom under his wing so to speak and they start dating. Mike was like Mark but even more open to talk and help me out with my problems. He taught me to use a gun, took me on my first hunt and was with me when I got my first buck. He taught me the importance of being a good man. He was everything I looked up to in Mark doubled. We would go on vacations every year and he became more of a father to me than my own dad. Even as a kid I looked at my dad as a terrible person (before the divorce I watched my dad slam my mom into a wall by the throat and that’s always stuck with me). Mike was a huge sports fan (which my dad wasn’t) and we would watch football, he got me into the sport of wrestling (not the fake kind) and eventually I would become a varsity wrestler. He would come to all of my meets unlike my bio dad and he was just all around the kind of guy you hope for in a dad. Years pass and I’m grinding through school, I make it to my freshman year of high school, beginning of the year, and my real dad is accused of molesting one of my sisters friends. The whole school knows (I live in a town of 7k) and everyone’s talking about it. My friends would tell me they didn’t believe it and I shouldn’t worry about it because everyone saw my dad as a nice guy who was always super chill if friends were over. But I knew they weren’t the only ones with an opinion and I knew things were being said and I was being looked at as the kid with a pedo dad. 

Fast forward to my junior year. My step dad Mike is diagnosed with a brain tumor. My whole world is now more broken than ever. Having watched my first step dad die after two years of chemo I was horrified that I would lose the guy I looked up to more than anyone in the world. And sure enough. About two years later he died. He was able to make it to my senior prom although he couldn’t attend, he still got to see me and my date all dressed up. That was one of my last big moments with him. And now I’m tearing up because even years and years later I still miss him everyday. 

After that my family wasn’t really the same. My mom became angry about everything, My sister started having bi-polar issues and I closed myself off from the world for quite awhile. Eventually we would move from the house we lived in to a new house across town because my mom couldn’t bare staying. The funeral was hard. I remember staring in disbelief over his casket and resting my hand on his cold hand and wondering why this was happening all over again. Only two of my friends came to the funeral to support me but that was okay. I didn’t expect anyone. That night I got really sick and I couldn’t sleep for a few weeks after. Keep in mind while all this is going on, my dad has gone bankrupt after being fired from his job for the arrest over the molestation charges, so he had to move out into the country. But he had no money so he ended up getting a horrible unfinished Morton building and because I didn’t yet fully believe he was the horrible person he truly is, I would stay out there quite a bit. He allowed me to smoke cigarettes and throw parties and my mom was intent on me being perfect, through everything we’d been through, and would often tell me to go live somewhere else when we would fight about jobs and school. Eventually I would move to my dads. 

About a year after moving to my dads I get a call from my sister one day and she tells me that my childhood best friend Tyler was killed in a car accident. This was someone that I spent most of my summer days with. One of the funniest kids I knew and he helped me get through a lot of the shitty transitions I was going through. So this again, broke me down. I couldn’t believe he was gone. I had just seen him a week or two before hand and it’s something you’re never expecting. His family decided to bury him in another town with his grand parents and to this day I haven’t been to his grave. 

Fast forward to 2010. I move to another city with a friend about two hours from my home town. This new stage of life is a breath of fresh air. I’ve got a job, I’ve got a new girl, I’ve got some close new friends and the walking dead season 1 has just aired. Life is finally looking up. By that Christmas I had lost my new job, my girl had left me for someone else and I was broke. I couldn’t afford to keep paying rent so I had to ask my mom to help me and of course she wasn’t having any of it. So once the lease was up I moved back home. Later that next year my bio dad asks me if I wanted to go to Texas with him for a few months and do some construction work. He tells me that there’s good money to be made and he’d pay me well. So I go. A year later I leave after we barely made enough to get by. Luckily a cousin of mine had joined us and so it was usually my cousin and I stuck in a hotel room for months while my dad went out looking for jobs. 

A few months after I got home it was toward the end of summer. My dad had stayed in Texas for a job he found as a foreman on some construction sites. He invited my sister to come visit him for his last couple weeks in Texas and then they would drive home. Well.. they make it back and the next day my mom brings me into the living room and my sister is sitting there in tears, laughing. I’m completely confused and that’s when my mom tells me that my dad tried to molest my sister on the way home. I’m immediately boiling I’m so furious and to this day my hands shake just thinking about it. Not five or ten minutes later I get a call on my phone, it’s my dad, as we’re still sitting in the living room discussing this. I don’t answer. 
Cut to an hour later, no one can get ahold of my dad. At this point I don’t give a fuck anymore. But my mom and my sister are worried. Acouple hours later after still no word my aunt finds him at his house, ODd but not dead, in the bathtub. We meet them at the hospital and my dad is in tears saying he’s sorry but his words are mumbled because he’s so fucked up. Turns out he took a whole bottle of sleeping pills. He knew what he had done. After that day I felt so wrong for ignoring him I thought that I had almost killed him by not answering his call. 

Fast forward to 2015. I’m now living with him. I’m going from job to job putting up with terrible bosses over and over, getting in arguments with bosses and coworkers and walking from each and every one until finally I give up. And then another one of life’s bullets hits me. One of my very best high school friends that I truly looked up to as one of the last male figures in my life dies in a car accident, killing himself and three others. I’m ripped from what calm I had found in the dark of my room and thrown back into the fire. To make matters worse, I found out by another friend calling me, screaming, Ben is dead Ben is dead. I still hear it to this day. He was more than a friend. He was like a brother. 

For the last three years I’ve trapped myself in this dark room, windows covered with blankets and no real want to go on anymore. No money, no job, no friends, no family. My sister found her happiness and got married this year. She has her own home and she’s a nurse. I couldn’t be more happy that she found her peace. My mom never stopped fighting with me on needing to have a job (it seems that’s the only thing she cares about.. the only thing she’s ever cared about for me) and so she sits, in her house, working a factory job like she has for the last thirty years and comes home to an empty home, although nice, and sits alone. Which absolutely kills me to think about but I’ve tried my hardest to keep in touch and show her I care but she doesn’t want anything to do with me. If I didn’t talk to her, I’d never hear from her. And my dad, who works at a factory also, is now married to a Phillipino woman he’s met once. He runs an eBay store and sleeps in the living room. The house is filled with pointless stupid junk he’s collected over the last few years and it becoming a hoarding problem. And me, I’m still locked away in this room, chain smoking and wishing that everyday I wake up is my last. 
I’ve tried and tried to make things work but it feels like I’ve always been running in place. Constantly running from the things I can’t get away from. And all I want is to be dead already. But I can’t. I’m too much of a coward and I could never do that to my sister and my mother, no matter how little love she shows me. The worst thing is that I know I could of been something, I’ve got a good head on my shoulders, I’m not racist like my parents, I’ve tried to find the good side of life but I’m always dragged back down deeper and deeper. So I guess now I’m asking, what do I do? Where do I go? Why am I still here?",05Sep2020,1

119,"So, the whole thing is a long story so I'll try to sum it up. We caught a bite to eat together after working the closing shit once and had a lot of fun chatting. We decided it'd be fun to do it again sometime. Next we got together to walk his dog, because we found out that we live in the same neighborhood. Then we basically would just talk late at my car heading out of work after the closing shift, I'm a pretty chatty person, but I otherwise kinda ""ghosted"" per say, because I just didn't want to hang out away from work. I'm just kind of an anti-social person in general and didn't have much interest in new friendships. Well, at work he started getting pushy about wanting to hang out again. Me being already prone to feeling guilty for just kinda losing interest in acquaintances for no reason felt bad and hung out outside of work again. This time he sat on my couch and cried about how much he loved me and never loved anyone like me and he NEEDS me to love him back or he would be devastated. And it's just gone so downhill ever since. He calls us hanging out his ""'Lizzy' time"" (inserting fake name for myself) and declares that he needs it. I'm sooo creeped out. He also gives me gifts at work or leaves them on my doorstep. He gets mad at me at work anytime I'm having a bad day for whatever reason not related to him, because it takes my attention away from him (I'm not so chatty in a bad mood). Also, he brings his gun when he drops by my house unannounced. (I know rights to carry, but this isnt public its my home?? my home?? And he knows how I feel about them # shooting survivor). I have declared to him several times that I don't want to be friends, I don't want to talk to him, but everytime he just gets verbally aggressive at work. Overall, I'm so creeped out, and sick of it. I had a breakdown at work about it and my managers don't believe me. What should I do?

121,"A few months ago I found out through one of my other close friends that our friend is super depressed. Every couple of days he’ll start talking about offing himself and how he would prefer to do it, or he’ll mention that he just doesn’t feel wanted anymore. He had a pretty rough childhood (he was molested and one of his relatives was abusive toward him), so that probably has something to do with it.

No matter how many times we try to comfort him and explain to him that we’re there for him he still decides to push us away. But at the same time we’re afraid that if we give him space and stop bothering him his condition will get worse. He hates talking about it unless he has too, so that doesn’t help much either.

The only reason I’m writing about this now is in the last few days he’s been getting notably worse. He posted a picture of himself covered in bruises and cuts on his Snapchat story literally minutes before I started writing this. We don’t really have any other option and we’re just trying to help him, but we need other people’s opinions.

After graduating high school, I was not interested in anything and used my time to escape from all of it. I turned heavily toward video games to pass my time and really haven't made much of myself at all the past few years. Just before Covid hit, I quit my job of a little over a year due to how bad my mental state was while working there. I'm not going to get into that because that's another story but I felt extremely bad working so hard full time doing something I absolutely hated for such low pay and poor treatment. Fortunately,  I live with my parents who honestly don't even want me to leave so I am thankful I have that support. However, That's about the only thing I really value in my life right now. 

Spending so many years online has resulted in me building a lot of online relationships with a lot of different people. This isn't an issue to me because truthfully, my real life friends don't understand my true self because I'm never quite me around them. But online, I'm pretty transparent and I think that's true for a lot of people. Regardless, some drama went down and I ended up losing a lot of people in my life. Including most of those online friends I had. Over the years, I even had a few online dating type relationships and I'm not really afraid to admit to that considering this is a throwaway account. But I've actually became more comfortable being open about that considering I've kinda broke out of my shell and had real girls in my life as well since quitting my job. I don't want to ramble on too much but the point in talking about all of this is to explain where I'm at now. 

After losing a lot of friends to drama, having a falling out with this girl I've known online for years now and also the loss of a relationship I had in my real life, it has left me feeling like I pretty much lost everything I really cared about. Obviously, with the exception of my close family who is there for me. I even had plans very recently with one of the few online friends I have left about potentially being roommates together. It would've provided me a good opportunity to start fresh but unfortunately, some things came up and that seems unlikey. At least for the near future. I can go on and on and explain the mental struggles I have. But instead, I will just conclude it by saying that I basically live with anxiety every day. I feel worthless. I feel constant pressure to find a way to make something of myself and I feel rejected due to my failed relationships. Even though some of it was my own decision to end them.

So here's where this all ties together. I started thinking about joining the military recently. More specifically, the Air Force (because I heard it's one of the better branches to choose) as a way to put all of this behind me and actually make something of myself and be proud of who I am. I've been looking into it the past few days, browsing Reddit to hear people's thoughts about joining or the opinions of military members already. I have mixed feelings about it currently as the idea of being pinned down for 4 years when I potentially might not like it is scary to me. But on the other hand, the freedom to move out and be a part of something honorable seems like it would balance out any of the negatives joining might have. I won't miss my friends because truthfully, I rarely ever spent time with them anyways. I might miss my family a little bit but my biggest concern is really just not having any idea what to expect or perhaps maybe even a different branch of the military would be more suitable. Or even just a whole different direction in my life in general would be more fitting for me. I feel like a waste of space and I just want to find a path in life that is fulfilling and happy. Instead of the uncertain anxiety-filled path of self-hatred I'm on.

I'm honestly very ignorant still on what exactly the military would be like but from what I've sorta gathered, it seems like it has a lot of benefits that will help me find my place as long as I'm willing to put in the work. If anyone out there can point me towards some helpful information or give some thoughts based on their own experiences, I would greatly appreciate it

Finally, I just want to say, I'm a little embarrassed to post something like this because I pretty much am putting all of my deepest flaws and insecurities on display. I'm pretty much completely vulnerable in a public setting so it's a little scary but perhaps I can find the help I need. Thanks for your time, I greatly appreciate it.",05Sep2020,1

126,"I'm an 18-year-old boy so I'm an adult who can decide for myself but I need your help on what would be the right decision. I live with my dad and am also economically dependent on him.

So here is a ton of backstory:

My parents have fought for as long as I can remember and the fighting has always been more aggressive than what I have come to understand is normal. (Usually at least one wineglass worth of alcohol was involved at both ends). It was usually verbal and the screaming (from my mom) could easily be heard outside. To describe the screaming my dad absolutely had to call the police twice because of how overboard my mom went with the screaming and yelling. Sometimes the fights got physical as well but only from my mom’s part, I can't remember a time my dad would have touched my mom, but my dad did get may bruises when they were together. I've also got two younger sisters, 16 and 13. Back when they were young, I often went to comfort them because of how loud the yelling was and also because our parents sometimes involved us in the fights by asking which one of them was right.

My parents have now been divorced for 10 years even though they were never married. My dad hates my mother for fair reasons because she made my dad’s life like hell for two decades, including 5-10 years after they started living apart. The reason for that is that my mom tried to make my dad’s life difficult in as many ways as possible but always managed to do most of the harm to us kids which my dad understandably hated. My sisters chose to live with my mother and I chose to live with dad and that's how it's been for give or take the past 9 years.

Back when they lived together and fought my mother had at least one threatened my father that she would kill us kids. I know this is true because I have heard a recording from my dad that he captured when it happened. He played it for me 4 to 5 times on my birthday for a few consecutive years. On the recording my mom says roughly translated that: \*something\* “or you will have no kids in the morning.” …among other things.

I also read a paper I stumbled across when going through old stuff that was written by my mom and it said roughly and translated that “With the stress I have and with the people I live and have to deal with, I’m surprised that I haven’t killed anyone” and so on. It was an A4 paper full of text with font size 10 maybe.  


There was one incident when I was ten or so, I got angry at my mom for not letting me do something like watch tv or something so I went to the front door and took like 2 shoes and threw them to the kitchen at the kitchen table (but not on the table, I threw like at the chairs) which were 6 meters (20ft) away. I threw them as hard as a 10 year old can and my mom went ballistic and started chasing me. I ran around the house and out of the back door and to the front and came back in and my stupid self stopped running when I was back where I threw the shoes and received one of the worst beatings of my life… First I want to say I'm not asking for pity and yes when it comes to beatings I've had it easy compared to some, but still... what roughly happened was that she lifted me up from the hair and swung me back and forth a little and then slammed my head on the tiles and I guess at some point hit me because I got a few bruises on my arms after that.

Later there was an incident where my mom threatened my dad with an axe. He went into the guest room and my mom stood outside the door and waited and argued about something. She never used the axe.

My mother’s family (her parents and her 3 siblings) were also very rude and ignorant towards my father and my father’s parents who are btw one of the nicest people I know. There was for no apparent reason to be rude, they just were, except for the fourth sibling whom I will tell about now. To give an example of how they are: my mother and her siblings and their dad owned a company and when they sold it for a few years ago they kicked one of their siblings out of the family. Again, there was no apparent reason to kick him out but they did and now they have not seen each other for a roughly 5 years. This sibling too was one of the kindest people I've ever met. The point here is that my father hates the whole family except for the sibling that go kicked out.

After that my mother has changed for the better. She seems now mentally stable but I mean she has done all that. But then again, she is my mother. 

&amp;#x200B;

The latest incident happened last summer (July 2019) when I got my license and got to have it for one week. Then I crashed my dad’s (maybe relevant for reaction, or not 50k) car. I did not crash into another car but drive into the ditch and the hit was pretty hard, the car god totally destroyed and it was even on its roof when it stopped. I even went to court for it, when the government sued me for high speeding. I won the case but the insurance company never gave all the money they were supposed to, so my dad lost quite a sum because of my stupidity. Anyway, I also had my cousin from my mother’s side with me in the car when I crashed and we both incredibly survived without anything more but bruises from the seatbelt. My dad said that my mother almost laughed at the incident and was just happy that my dad lost money. I don't know where my dad got the idea that she laughed because personally I never saw my mom laugh at the thing but I guess she could have secretly been happy about the thing even though I could have died. To give an idea of the severity of the crash as said the car could not be fixed and had damage on all six sides (front, back, bottom, roof and sides). The car was so badly damaged that every expert who saw out asked if the people in it were dead or in a wheelchair/amputated... it just looked so bad. But that is another story for another time. Anyway, my dad did not like the fact that I crashed and especially that I had my cousin in the car while doing so plus was furious that my mom basically laughed at the thing.

I am absolutely sure that my mom has/have had mental issues because she was like a demon ten years back, I don't know if she has calmed down after dad left or if she is on some medication or both.

&amp;#x200B;

I do not see my mother much anyway, maybe once in 2-4 months but tomorrow I was planning on going there because I graduated high school and am celebrating it there with my mother’s side. My relation with that side of the family is decent but would probably never trust them with anything. 

My dad told me not to as I told him that I planned to stay there one night. (Last time I did was over a year ago). I want to go there and would like to go more often but I'm scared because of my dad. I get why my dad hates her but I would still want to see my mother a bit often which undoubtedly, she would enjoy. My dad seems to have nothing against my sisters living there but every time I inform him that I'm going he gets mad. She is my mother after all and I would still spend like 350-355 days of the year with my dad. I am never going to forgive my mother, BUT I’d like to see her more…  


My question for you is that after reading this, what should I say or do when my dad gets mad about me going there? My sisters live there after all and they are the dearest thing to me on this planet and I don't meet them much either even though them and I would like to. Should I listen to my dad on not going there like ever or what? and what can I say to him? (please remember that I’m economically dependent on him). Or should I even be in contact with my mom after these things? even though my sisters live there.

Thank you in advance!",05Sep2020,1
127,"So my boyfriend went through about a 3 months span of unemployment which has not been easy for him, or I. I’m not a very patient person as I am trying, some days it’s just not easy. So he recently, 2 weeks ago, got a job that he loves and seems to have high hopes for it which is great! But just Tuesday his mother had a major stroke and it has almost completely shut him down. Her brain surgery went well and she is very slowly coming back to normal. I know this is a very very difficult thing for him to deal with, and I’m trying to be as supportive as I can. He hasn’t been to work since her stroke Tuesday. Fast forward to today (Friday) his boss texted him and said if he didn’t make it to work Monday he would be fired. Now, to me, this is a given. I’d be at work Monday bc I can’t lose a job I basically waited 3 months to come across. The problem with him now is he will not give me an answer as to if he’s going back or not. He thinks he needs to stay home and just be at his father’s beck and call to make sure his parents kitchen remodel is completed before his mother comes home from the hospital/rehab. We financially cannot go any longer without him having any income. But he is only worried about assisting his father with getting their remodel finished bc his dad doesn’t trust any of the other family to do it. 

So am I being selfish trying make sure our household is taken care of over his parents kitchen remodel? Or do I need to just let him lose the job if he choses to.

Recently it clicked to maybe start a YouTube channel. We’re all home anyways so time wise it’s perfect. BUT my real issue is the worry of discrediting myself by making videos like these that undoubtedly make you more vulnerable for one reason or another. Or at the very least make you appear “silly”. Especially being a woman in STEM, idk. I feel like I have to be extra serious. The videos wouldn’t be anything inappropriate, just hopefully an interesting capsule of information on everything from games to books to cooking etc. I think of the literal doctors out there making tik toks but still the idea hold me back.

135,"Tl;dr: I can’t decide whether to stay in Japan, or go back to America and pursue a career.

I came to Japan about 1 year ago and took a job as an assistant language teacher. I had just graduated college, and it’s been a life goal of mine to live and work in Japan for at least one year. I was always open to the possibility of staying forever if I loved it. And while I do love Japan, I will be hitting 30 early next year. I’m hungry to start a career. I was recently offered an entry position in a well-known company, in my dream industry. The pay is what I make now, so that could be better, but the area is really nice, and it’s a foot in the door.

I have a big choice to either stay in Japan, which would include finding a new job/company (current one is lackluster), or take the offer and head back to America in a few months.

Ultimately only I can make this choice of course, but I’m not sure how to consider it. Pros and cons lists aren’t weighted, and what opinion I lean towards varies by day. I feel like Covid zapped a lot of the appeal out of Japan. Festivals are canceled, travel is difficult (I rather not), and my tolerance for teaching just isn’t what it used to be. It can be fun and I’m glad I did it because of the skills gained, but teaching for your 2-3rd year isn’t the same as first. Diminishing returns. America is doing worse with the virus, but at least there I can focus on my work and feel like I’m making progress. I don’t get that feeling in Japan.

I’m not learning new skills (aside from online certs I’ve been earning in my free time), I’m not growing, I’m not getting any closer to building a solid retirement, being able to afford a home, or working in my dream industry. I’m just doing a dead-end job and growing older. I believe changing jobs and moving to another region in Japan, one that’s fresh and new and exciting, would rekindle a lot of my lost feelings. I just don’t know if I want that because Covid and everything. I also don’t want to leave because there’s so much of Japan I haven’t seen. I’ve never been Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, etc. I’ve explored my region and the surrounding prefectures, but there’s so much more I want to see. Seeing the rest of Japan is much harder once you’re outside Japan.

It will sound weird but returning to America doesn’t hold the appeal of seeing family. I don’t really have family or friends back home. I would feel worse leaving friends and co-workers in Japan, but I would never sacrifice what I want out of life for that. It would be nice to speak the local language fluently, but I do ok in Japan for language stuff.

I'm so unsure about it all.",05Sep2020,1
136,"I realize that if I do any type of excercise I get this VERY messed up and annoying feeling of getting like weird prickles around my head, I usually thiught it was normal but later on I realized that this can’t be normal because it recently also syatyed to happen when I have ut too hot, ‘overheat’ but not literally.

I usually don’t care that much but it is a pain in the ass  and I just wanna make sure if it’s even something bad? I already have other doctor appointments so I don’t wanna go with another problem again unless it’s a real problem, is it normal?

I can’t describe the feeling but let’s say I walk outside and it’s hot like 30c, My face sweats which is normal but at times I have this extremely annoying prickling feeling around my head, sometimes on my forehead sometimes ontop of my head (so have to go between my hairs to prickle) sometimes behind my ear, or eyebrows, it’s just very random spots but on my head (and very very very rarely on my chest)

This also happens when I excercise, I stopped excercising for a full year (was active by walking daily) now i’m trying to get back in and doing like 10/15 pushups already made me have that feeling and it’s terrible.

138,"So for the last 2 and a half years now, I (18m) have been harassed in multiple forms by my ex (17f). When it was her just using a mutual acquaintance to get me to unblock her over 6 times I didn't really see it as anything except annoying. Since then it only got worse. As time went on she started making comments about my friends, mostly sexual related. One instance was offering my friend sex after speaking to him for a total of 5 minutes. It also recently occurred to me that I never introduced her to any of my friends, so she went out of her way to find them for no other reason other than to try and have some sort of link to me. After some time, we all told her we didn't want ANYTHING to do with her and we thought that was the end of it.

Around 3 months later one of my friends starts dating her, despite our warnings. Long story short, he dumps her, she blackmails him to try and get back with him, he tells her no and then she tries talking to me during class that he had a knife collection, one of which was bloody, and he tried to stab her. I told her one more time to leave us all alone. That was (I think) October last year.  Also worth mentioning after this I told the teacher of the only class I have with her (Which I'm pretty sure she only took because I'm there) that I'd like her to be kept away from me, and he thankfully listened and that was the end of it. Or so I thought until 2 months ago.

This time she used a mutual friend of ours' Snapchat account and SEARCHED for one of my closest friends and did the whole ""I'm not so bad if you get to know me"" gimmick and when I asked her what she didn't understand when I told her none of us wanted to talk to her she replied with ""I don't owe you sh\*t."" Longer story short, she ended up speaking to a different friend of mine, using his kind heart against him, manipulating him, forcing him to choose between my friend group and her + her friend (he thankfully chose my group) and then proceeded to get her friends' ""tough"" friends to literally park their bikes in front of us while we were out and threatened him and one of my other friends while his (now) ex-girlfriend began to insult us, tried to get us to turn on him by saying he spoke about us behind our backs and a few other things I couldn't be bothered listening to.

About 2 days after the bike incident he got a phone call from one of the guys who threatened us and said he wanted to fight us because we'd spoken about him behind his back. Bear in mind we'd never met him until then, laughed for about 5 minutes after walking away and never spoke of him again. After the call, I eventually lost my mind and after 2 and a half years of this, I finally spoke up and reported her to my college. But was it the right thing to do?

Now I'm worried that every time I leave my house, go to college, go to my friends, go to town or even by outside on my own that I'll suddenly be attacked by those guys because I reported her. Should I have kept quiet and let it keep happening or my last year of college or was it the right thing to do? But she is being warned and if it carries on police will be involved, so hopefully, it'll be resolved now. I just want to know whether it was the right idea and also any advice for how to take things from here in case she ignores the warning, gets her friends to be aggressive with me or just starts throwing around allegations at me.",05Sep2020,1
140,"During my senior year in high school, I fell into a prolonged depression that lasted towards the end of the school year. I thought that I would be a miserable failure in life and would be nothing more than a homeless person dancing for his meal. I refused to submit my college applications, simply because I thought that my fate was predestined and, furthermore, thought that since I wasn’t the best student in my class, I wouldn’t have a chance at any university. To keep in mind, I wasn’t a bad student, I was a slightly above average student. I never told anyone about my feelings or emotions during this period.

My parents, due to personal reasons, had to move to their country of origin, to be near and take care of my extended family. My father, whose dream was for me to become a doctor, wanted me to come with him, to “be there with him”, and to enroll in the country’s medical schools. I have always worshipped my father, and if there was one noticeable trait anybody could tell you about me, was that I would unquestionably obeyed him. I agreed with my father, but I was saturated with so much melancholy that I was not giving a truly conscious response. We, however, moved at the end of the school year. In this new country that I resided in, I enrolled in medical school. Due to a technicality, I had to have a gap year. During this time, I read books on different subjects and topics, including mathematics, history, physics, economics, and learned Latin in the meanwhile. 

As of right now, the gap year has ended, and I am a student at a very reputable medical college in the country. However, I am not interested in medicine at all, and it is a struggle going through the coursework, while simultaneously maintaining my happiness. Throughout the gap year, I learned that my passion was in mathematics and physics and wanted to concentrate my focus on these subjects. However, if that was the case, I would prefer to study these subjects in America rather than here. I do want to go back, but I don’t know what pathway to take. What would you do?",05Sep2020,1

142,"I have come across the most cruel cyberbullying I've ever encountered on YouTube. It is a person under the username of KYS who would look for innocent people. He would ""raid"" small accounts, usually belonging to kids and LGBT members, with death threats non-stop and mass report their content to the point they have to delete their channel, or even commit suicide. He does this with his so-called ""Homophobe Army"", a group of people who share his homophobic and racist views.

This person has already driven TWO, possibly four, teenagers to suicide and no attention has been given to it. He takes pride about the fact he cyberbullied someone to death by making fun of them in videos. Right now, he is cyberbullying a kid and drove him away from doing what he loves on YouTube. He hasn't been online for three weeks already, but KYS continues to spam his channel with hate speech.

This little boy is usernamed Poyo and KYS has been trying to encourage him to cut himself with a razor, even making an entire hate video about him.

I want something done to this person's channel. I've been reporting him many times, but nothing has been happening. I've already spread the news to friends, but I feared I risk leading him and his 'Homophobe Army' to them. I've reported it to the local police, anti-cyberbullying groups, just about every appropriate people and groups that know what they're doing. I am in no way attempting to start a witch hunt.

As I post this, he has found many new people to harass and has already driven many out of YouTube.

Am I a fool for taking action? Am I just meant to let this one go just because it isn't necessarily my problem? I just want to help a little kid and let him know a stranger is willing to stand up for him. None of the things I've been doing has worked in taking his channel down and none of my friends have done further action, am I supposed to just let it be, as well? KYS barely has 100 subscribers, too. Perhaps too small for YouTube to even notice. Although, this is fifth account, meaning he had previous accounts that were taken down as well.

I need advice on what I should do.

143,"I have been chosen to be a part of the official entries for our province-wide photo-essay competition. Official entries ones that are posted to get an online vote. The competition was led by a government youth organization. 

The criteria was:
25 points for creativity,
25 for content,
25 for grammar,
And for online vote;
25pts for top votes, 20pts for 2nd top vote, 15pts for 3rd top votes, and 10pts for the rest in online voting.

I won top vote and automatically had 25 points in my overall score.

What makes me overthink is that I never got in top 3 of the competition— only top 3 will be awarded. I literally am confident that I did great compared to others, that their grammar are even pain in the eyes. Others didn't even comply to the theme, that others didn't even make an essay hence made a story wherein fact it was said in the guidelines that it should be strictly an essay. Top 1 winner got 20pts in online vote, Top2&amp;3 garnered only ten points in online voting. Their shots weren't even proportioned and appealing. I mean, I might too full of myself, but the ""photo"" in photo-essay wasn't even given a full effort by the others. I know I sound bitter but please, help me ease what I am thinking.

If I have known I wont win at all even if I garnered the 25% automatically after getting the highest votes online then I wouldn't have asked for help and votes. Why did they even let me be part of the official entries if I wont actually have a chance at all?

I had assumed so much that I'd be part of the top 3. Maybe it was my fault that I didn't even humbled down.

I am thinking too much about losing realizing, did the judges actually based it on the criteria? Or partly it had some corruption going on? Since it was a government youth organization, I am not a member of that organization and my some of my opponents are.

Friends were telling me to cheer up and that they got my back, and I'm sooo thankful for that. Actually, at the back of my mind, we were expecting I wont be part of the top 3 and make jokes about it as if the Organization will cook and crisp the competition since their first post was deleted despite me being the highest likes at that time— reasoned out there was a system error, second thing we know, this happened.

The logic. I can't get it. So, I had no chance of winning at all even if getting the 25%? So, why did they put me in official entries? I don't know how to compensate with my feelings right now but let me just take in the result of the photo-essay competition.

I am sorry for ranting. I am sorry if I can't take in being not on top. I am sorry that I am feeling bitter. I know, I need to humble down, I know I need to practice and be better. I know. I just can't take these thoughts as of now. I'm really sorry that this makes me sad and ask why and how did this happened.

144,"Between rent, transportation, the cost of socializing/networking, food, other bills, student loans, and medical needs... how do people do it? Even working 40 hours a week, I can’t even get close to paying typical bills. Even with a degree and being “fluent” in technology and social media, the pay for most entry-level jobs isn’t great. I feel stressed all the time. It seems like the only way to be stable enough to function is to earn below the poverty-level wage and then get government benefits. This is kind of a sh*tty solution, but the cost of medical care even with private insurance is crazy expensive. Currently I have so much debt from hospitalizations that I could work the rest of my life and not get it paid off. What should I do?",05Sep2020,1

146,"My new crush and I have been talking for almost two weeks. We finally met this past Sunday and we want to get together again this weekend. However, I am not 100% sure if he like me that way yet. And plus, he is a recovering alcoholic and has trust issues and low-self esteem. For example, he said that his subconscious causes him to resent people who lole because he questions how somebody could enjoy being around him. Therefore, I am not sure if holding his hand might be overstepping boundaries or going too fast.

147," This probably isn't the average question posted here but I need advice. I dated my girlfriend for two and a half years and she was moving to go to university while I stay at home. I was in pieces the last month of our relationship because we had agreed to breakup when she had to go. Right before she left I changed her mind (due to lots of my persuasion) and we tried long distance. We did long distance for three days she got drunk at college two of the days after neither one of us drank throughout our entire relationship. I was crying moping all day long because I missed her and it just wasn't enjoyable. I constantly found myself jealous of her meeting all these new guys. Before she left I asked her to promise me that if she was going to cheat on me with anyone to please breakup with me and then go with them the next day (my father cheated on my mother several years ago and I found his nudes on the family computer so I have had problems being nervous about cheating even though its never happened to me before (she also knew about my father and what happened).). Long story short she got drunk and kissed a guy playing spin the bottle. Although they didn't have sex we never did either as she is waiting for college. I was already sad and miserable thinking about breaking up and this was just the icing on the cake. We still had feelings for each other and were happy in our relationship when she was back home but things just weren't working. I broke up with her. Fast forward two weeks I am not really missing her at all and I have found a few matches on tinder that I am interested in possibly going on a date with. Am I a terrible person if I go on a date so quickly after breaking up from a long relationship? Should I tell my ex that I am going on a date? Me and her still talk somewhat frequently just as friends. I don't want to tell her because I don't want to hurt her because she truly is a wonderful person, but I don't want her to hear about it somehow and have her even more hurt. I have tried looking online for advice but everything I look for online just talks about how they feel like they are getting over there ex too slow. I feel ready to go out but I don't know if I'm possibly just tricking myself or something. I keep telling myself that maybe I'm getting over it so fast because I knew it was coming but then I think that I'm telling myself this so I just don't have to tell myself I'm a terrible person. So yeah If anyone could answer my questions that would be appreciated.",05Sep2020,1

150,"I’ll try to keep this as short as possible because I know posts in this sub can get long. I’m a young adult woman in my 20s, from America. For 8 years or so now, I’ve been writing fanfiction. Pretty much every girl in my generation has written or at least read some before, so no big deal right? Well ...

For the last 4 years, I’ve been making money from writing fanfiction and original content about heavy gore, rape, and murder that have involved minors. Not actual minors, but ones in the fandom/lore of the fiction. I’ve actually gotten popular in the community, hence my wanting anonymity. 

Yes, all of the work is erotica. It’s depicted as sexual fiction despite the graphic content. I’m close to many people who are fans and who get off on it. I don’t get off on my own work, but I do others. And it’s been destroying me recently.

I feel like a bad person for fantasizing about the abuse of people, some minors like I said earlier. Is there something wrong with me? I know it’s not normal to be aroused by literal abuse and graphic rape and gore of others. What should I do?",05Sep2020,1

153,"My Grandmother is becoming more and more right wing as she ages. Boldly racist comments, selfish attitude and a complete unwillingness to listen to anyones differing opinion, even with facts.

I just cant dismiss it and say, oh its just a political difference. I feel its more indicative of a rising fundamental lack of compassion, empathy and self awareness.

If someone near her needs charity she will do anything to help, but make that person anonymous and its totally unnacceptable that anyone should need help all of a sudden.

She reads the Herald Sun, 60 minutes and reads an online Alt right publication.

154,"I have a friend who I've been friends with for 3 years now. He lives 30 minutes away from here, so it's mostly an online relationship. About a month after meeting him, one of the people in our group said something to him; he got so upset he left and blocked everyone in the group. He wouldn't speak to any of us for 2 weeks. Every 3/4 months or so someone in the group would say something that rubbed him the wrong way and he'd leave for days/weeks on end, blocking all of us and refusing to speak to any of us. When he'd come back he wouldn't let anyone talk about it (leave again or dances around answering the question). He also has a hard time talking about his feelings and never lets us talk about anything regarding our emotions or let us talk about our friendship.

This leaving and coming back cycle has persisted until this day with two major incidences. Last summer was the first time it really, *really* hit me. He had a really toxic girlfriend and I was trying to talk to him about it. We were in a call, I don't remember what I'd said to him before this, but this is what got him to leave and block me on everything, ""I don't like your girlfriend-"" then poof, he's gone. What I was going to say was, ""I don't like your girlfriend, but I don't dislike her,"" and go from there, but he was just blocked me and refused to talk to me for 3ish months. Me sending him a hand-written letter to his house is what got him to unblock me. When he left that time, I think because I was already so terrified that he was going to leave and finals were approaching is why I started to cut myself. It took my mind off of whatever I was thinking about and made me concentrate on not getting blood everywhere. It was a really awful way of coping, but it was the only way I could stop thinking about it. I've never told him, but his girlfriend knows.

It had been about a year since he left when he blocked me again. His girlfriend (new girlfriend, he broke up with his old one previous summer; this one is a god-sent) and I were talking about how well he'd been doing. Recently we'd been able to talk about our feelings more and we were talking about how long it had been since he left the group. Mid July we were in a call and he was jokingly telling me to do something. I wasn't having it that night, so I told him I was never going to do it just because he's telling me I should do it. He had told me something similar earlier, so I thought it'd be nice to give him a taste of his own medicine. It wasn't- it never is. This caused him to ghost me for about a week on Instagram and he stopped being active in our Discord group chat, which is very *very* unlike him. 

I finally asked him what was wrong and he gave me one worded answers until he finally just started to ignore me again. Because of all of his leaving and blocking us, I get really hurt if people don't respond to me/ ignore me for multiple days. I'm trying to get better about it, usually if someone tells me why they weren't responding to me, I'm fine. I knew that wasn't going to happen with him and I was really hurt by the previous stuff this guy had said and done, so I left the group chat. His girlfriend ended up telling him that he really hurt me and he should go talk to me. He sent me a message on Instagram telling me he was upset with some of my previous actions and he doesn't see a future with us together. I messaged him back telling him I appreciated him texting me and I didn't know he didn't like those thing I'd done. I also told him that I didn't want to end our friendship and we could work it out and evolve our relationship. He told me he'd sleep on what I said for a couple days and tell me his decision. I have yet to receive another message from him.

His girlfriend told me I'd been blocked by him on Instagram, he's removed all the pictures of me on his Instagram and he's said to her I don't deserve another chance. This fucking killed me. I just don't know what to do at this point anymore. I want to be his friend, I don't want to give up on him. I've seen him grow, he's come so far from when we first met and I want to see him keep on growing, I just don't know what to do. I've already apologized, I don't feel like I should have to apologize again, but I will if I need to. What do I do at this point?",05Sep2020,1

157,"Kind of a long story but I'll try to make it shorter. Also sorry for weird names I just used the first word I thought of really.

 I(15m) had a crush on this guy(16m we'll call him nom) for a while but he was dating my friend(17nb but I'm gonna use she pronouns because she's okay with it and we'll call her gem). They broke up a few weeks ago and I had invited nom to hang at my house just to get away from his mom and so that we could hang out (just as friends tho) while he was at my house things happened between us. He came over to my house again a week later but after that he started to become distant. Apparently he and gem had gotten back together but he didn't tell me. Now he's ignoring my texts and we don't have any classes together so I don't see him during school.

Now today, gem was extremely upset and wouldn't talk to me. I don't want to make things all about me but I'm kinda worried that nom told gem about what happened (and possibly twisted it so it seems like I came onto him, I didn't but him being my crush, I was happy about it happening) and that now gem is mad at me too. I don't want to loose both of them as friends. I chose not to tell gem about what happened for 2 reasons. 1 I don't want to loose her friendship, and 2 I don't want to possibly mess up their relationship. Of course I'm upset that he lied to me but I don't want to do that to either of them.

So now I don't know what to do. If she is upset about something else I'd like to be able to help her with it but if it's about me and nom what would be the best way to deal with it? And if it's not should I tell her or not?",05Sep2020,1

161,"TW: Suicide.

TL;DR at bottom.

Background: My best friend (bf) and I met when we were 10. Currently, we're 27 and live about 2 hrs apart from eachother. She's married, bought a house 2 months ago, and is secure in her career.

Bf asked about my mental health via zoom. I refused to tell her for three reasons:

 (1) In the past when I needed help she didn't help. Eight years ago we were living together. I told her my severe mental health problems, and she did nothing to help- didn't increase positive social interactions, didn't offer any physical assistance, or any other support.

 (2) I don't think she can separate her profession as a therapist from friendship. A different friend told bf about his depression + suicidal ideation. I watched that friend and bf interact, and told bf that she treated friend like a patient. She agreed.

(3) My mental health is terrible and I don't want her to intervene or feel guilty.

A few days later, she sent a care package. Then a letter arrived. She said she wants a deeper friendship, apologized for stuff, said that she feels that she has to be careful what she says to me, and implied that this friendship will end if we can't go deeper.

I don't know how to reply to that letter. I've written like 5 drafts but none of them are right I'm supposed to visit her tomorrow.

Bf is the most significant relationship in my life. I don't trust her, but I don't trust anyone. Out of all the people in my life, I am the most sure about her loving me for who I am, and I love her for who she is. I live with my brother(37)- he loves 15yo me and ideologically despises who I am now. I see my parents every weekend- they love 12yo me and I don't trust them enough to show them who I am now. I don't want to leave my relationship with bf in such a rocky state, but to repair it would mean delaying my current plans to leave. I'm no longer some little pre-teen who can just leave, damn the consequences. I'm an adult, and I don't want to leave a mess behind. 

What can I do to mend my relationship with bf enough so I can leave in good conscience?

Tl;DR Best friend has made it clear that our relationship has shallowed over the years. I'm trying to leave, and don't want her to be left behind feeling guilty. How can I spruce up this relationship without being 100% honest?",05Sep2020,1
162,"Hey so I have struggled with severe anxiety causing depression for a long time but I never told my doctors about it because I didn't want anything to get on my record because I want to join the military. Issue is, it's gotten worse as of recently and I am barely able to function.

Here's the thing, I have done xanax before and I know that it works for me. I was never addicted or anything I didn't do it recreationally per se, I took what a normal prescription amount would be and I had no issues and no issues stopping it after a while. Obviously I can't tell the doctor that because they will think I just want drugs. I don't want to do something like SSRIs or SNRIs because I don't want to gain weight, lose hair etc. as losing hair is a big trigger of my anxiety.

Recently I told my doctor that I had anxiety, I took a test, scored severe for anxiety and depression. But I really emphasized that I don't want any diagnoses because I don't want them on my record. I think that will definitely help in the aspect and emphasizing that I don't just want drugs. However, I am curious about what my next step should be? They chalked it up to adjustment disorder but I have been struggling with these issues for as long as I can remember. I also lied about feelings of suicide which I used to experience frequently and I still have from time to time but I feel like you kind of have to lie about that because I don't want to be fucking stuck in a mental hospital for an easily fixable problem.

Anyway, I set up an appointment for counseling at my university but I'm not sure if that is the route to go. On one hand, counseling can get me leveled up to psychiatry but it will take a while and I need immediate help. I only ate one meal this week because I am simply too afraid to leave my room and go get food. My grades are beginning to struggle and its only the second week of the semester. I need some immediate and effective solution not something that will take months to POSSIBLY work and might even fail to work at all. I legit have constant migraines now from all the stress that this has been causing me I had to go to the doctor and get prescribed pain medication for all the stress that my anxiety and depression are causing me from not being able to eat and the like.

Should I go the route of counseling and risk becoming malnourished from not eating and my grades plummeting from coping mechanisms no longer working? Or should I just schedule another appointment at my doctor and hope that it helps?",05Sep2020,1

[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/ilezgl/fell_head_over_heels_in_love_in_a_dream/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share) and the second one here.

They're kinda long posts so it's ok if you don't wanna read them. Basically, they say that I haven't seen this guy in 7 years and know absolutely nothing about his life other than the fact that he lives in another continent. In the dreams I fell in love with him but in a way I never had before irl. I was so completely ready to leave my life behind just to be with him and was absolutely ecstatic to do it. Next to my family is the purest kind of love I've ever felt. 

The reason I'm posting here is because the few people who read my dreams told me I should text him and see what happens but I honestly don't wanna do that. I mean, I kinda want to talk to him now and see how he's doing and get to know him but (?) I don't see how that could be beneficial in any way. And what would I even say? ""Hey I had a dream where you were my soulmate and now I wanna get to know you"" or ""hey, how have you been?"" Out of the blue after literally 5 years of never speaking and with no apparent reason. Where would that lead? What good would it do? There is no chance of anything happening between us. He has a whole life I know nothing about. I try to think what would I do if it was me but ??? It'd probably be cool to talk for a bit but nothing else is gonna happen so what's the point?

Maybe I'm just going crazy in quarantine. I guess I just want reassurance that texting him will make no difference and possibly start to let it go. Thank you if you've read this long.",05Sep2020,1

Should I attempt to preserve it or transfer it onto some digital media or even post it on the internet?

I have this online friend, and she told me her secret. She told me that she sexually assaulted someone younger than her (also a girl) a few years ago. I don’t think she knows if the person remembers, (they’re both under 14) she told me at the time she didn’t realize how bad it was. Anyways I have no idea what to do, what she did is terrible but I can tell she feels bad. I talked to her and she said she would never do it again and she’s considering killing her self because she said and I quote “I don’t know what got ahead of me but I can’t live with myself. The guilt, and the fact if she remembers this will scar her. The guilt is unbearable Y/N”

181,"I decided to enter rehab to adjust my psychiatric medication, as I was experiencing psychotic symptoms and wanted 24/7 supervision during the process. I entered treatment only to find out that nobody here wears masks. There are almost 40 patients, some of who live at home and lead regular lives outside of the program. There's about as many staff members who do the same. Many of them have other jobs, at restaurants etc., and some are taking vacations where they travel cross-country. Many of them talk about having their neighbors over, or live in large families. 

Their testing process seems flawed to enter residential treatment. They take an antibody test and a nasal swab. If your antibody test is clear, they place you in residential with no restrictions before your COVID test comes back, days later. 

There are signs up all over the building that masks are mandatory, but they're causally ignored. 

Workout equipment is shared during the day, meals are shared together, and the pass around multiple daily sign in sheets with the same pen. Cleaning is minimal. 

They haven't had any COVID cases so far, but I still feel uncomfortable. Outside of the program I am a strict mask-wearer and stay at home. I am considering anonymously reporting the program, but fear that they will retaliate by trying to figure out who did it. As I've stayed here longer, I've realized that many of them are vocally anti-maskers. They have a no-phone policy at first, and I just got my device back - so I know I could be suspect at this time if there was a sudden report. 

I'm in the middle of changing meds and can't afford to get kicked out of this program.

I'm currently a 36M working at walmart and I've lost all sense of hope for a better future. I've tried so many times at so many things and I've invested a lot of myself into things but nothing came of it.

I dont want to invest so much of myself into anything anymore only to keep being disappointed. I'm starting to believe there isnt a place in the world for someone like me. I'm not very competitive. I want to help people. I want to make some kind of contribution but I feel so lost.

185,"This story is about a past relationship between Me (M17) and my ex (F17). She will be referred to as ""K"" and I ask you to refer to me as ""J"" (for privacy reasons)

last year I was in grade 10 and had a small amount of short and insignificant relationships in the past. (as I would say the norm is for this age), but I wanted something that would last. it was around early April and I decided to try to slowly make a move on this really cute girl (10/10). I didn't know much about her but I knew K was shy and quiet and possibly bi (all of these are ok with me), through a friend of a friend I started sitting at the same table as K during lunch and over the span of a couple of weeks I started conversing with K, which led to us sitting with each other and talking during some classes we had together, which led to me walking her home everyday after school. On our daily walks I found out a lot about K as she was very open when she felt comfortable with someone, I also found out that I didn’t just find her physically attractive but I was attracted to K as a person too. One night we were texting before bed and I confessed to K that I had feelings for her... she didn’t really respond and kind of ended the conversation there, I thought I blew it and had trouble sleeping that night. the next day K asked if I could still walk her home, I felt really awkward, but I agreed because she was still my friend even if nothing came of it. On our walk we were at a crosswalk waiting for the light and K goes ""I talked to my sister about what you said last night (older sister late 20s), she said that I should tell you how I feel about it,"" in my mind I go ""oh boy here we go"" expected her to give me the ""we're just really good friends and I don’t want to mess that up"" spiel but she said the she actually felt the same way to which I literally jumped up and down in excitement, in public. we started dating a few days later and I fell in love, I thought I ""loved"" other girls in the past but this was different, I never felt this feeling towards anyone, it is indescribable which is why I’m here today, I cant get over her.

we dated for 10 months which is an eternity for high school relationships (especially the ones I have had). when I say 10 months, I mean we started dating 10 months before we broke up for the last time. May 28th, 2019 was the day I asked her out, sometime in mid to late November (before thanksgiving and our half anniversary) we had our first ""break"". K felt like I was spending too much time with another one of my friends who was a girl named P that I happen to have a mini crush on long before I talked to K, she felt like I still had a thing for P and said she needed sometime to herself. I was devastated not only did I not know the difference between a break and a break up but my relationship with my with P was strictly plutonic and I had no intentions of that changing ever, I wanted to be with K and just K until death did us part. I was heartbroken, I did nothing but cry for that day and the next even in front of my family and at school which is not normal for me because I rarely ever cried even when sad and/or hurt I ended up going on my annual road trip to New Hampshire with my dad for thanksgiving which helped distract me and the day I got back our break was over. everything was the back to normal after that, except I decided to stop talking to P I didn’t tell K and I refused to talk to P let alone tell her why, I feared if I did she would dislike or have a grudge against K. I CANT NOT STRESS ENOUGH THAT IT WAS MY DESCSION AND THAT K DID NOT TELL ME TO DO SO. maybe it was a stupid decision but it was mine to make and I thought it was best for me and my relationship with K if P wasn’t a part of my life anymore

Christmas came and went and sometime in January we started having silly fights over things I cant even remember because they were so stupid, one Saturday in late January, K had a depressive episode (she was diagnosed with depression and anxiety in July 2019 although knew she had both for a couple years) and cancelled plans she had with me that day because she wasn't feeling good I didn’t quite believe her and I thought she was mad at me for whatever reason but just wouldn’t tell me, later in the day she explained that her mom and godfather wanted to go out for dinner and bring me with the three of them I gladly agreed thinking this was just her way of saying ""I’m not mad anymore"" but in the car and at the restaurant she didn’t speak a word and barely even looked at me I was confused and upset, I didn’t know what I did for her to act like she didn’t want me around her. the next day I was at work on the closing shift (I work at a grocery store in the butcher's dept. to be exact), on closing its just me in my dept and I just have  to clean the machines and do the dishes so they are safe to use the next day when the butchers come in. closing on a Sunday is a very boring shift but lucky for me one of my friends who is called M was in deli and he is usually equally as bored as I. I’m sure its not a surprise but K and I were arguing over text about the day before and a bunch of other things and at one point I got fed up so I asked M what I should do, he knew K and I have been fighting for a bit and he told me that I shouldn’t put up with it anymore, he told me to break up with her. I thought about it for about an hour just standing in a semi-refrigerated room that smelt like bleach and I took his advice. I texted K and I said I wanted to break up, I started sobbing as I was typing the message, and I reluctantly sent it K just said ""ok."" and that was that.

a week later I texted P and apologized for what I did she surprisingly accepted my apology and we became friends again K and I still texted but just as friends. she would try to get back together but I had to resist I was scared that I would have to feel how I felt at work in January and how I felt in November but I eventually gave in. I was still in love with her and I couldn’t let that go so friends turned back into dating but I really wish I didn’t but idk if that would change how I feel right now it probably wouldn’t. we fought a lot again but now when we fought she told me that she couldn’t see me the same because at first I refused to get back wit her and that me doing that just proved I don’t actually love her or care about her, I did though, very much, so it really hurt when she said that. then quarantine happened and our parents would let us she each other and that was the last straw for her I guess, being on facetime all day wasn’t enough for her we got into one last fight and it ended when she said ""we're done"" the next day K apologized and said she regretted saying it and that she didn’t actually want to break up but even if she didn’t mean it, she said it and she was right, we were done, I was done I couldn’t take it anymore.

this was late march or early April. its weird because I went through 4 of the 5 stages of grief (excluding bargaining) but recently I have gone back into depression I really miss her and I regret not accepting her apology, maybe I’m just lonely or its just the idea of her I miss, but for some reason I cant shake the fact that I miss her and that I really want to be with her, I’m scared to though because I think she’s dating or at least talking to this guy that she was friends with I’m also scared that my friends and family are going to look down on me for crawling back to her after 5 months of being broken up. I just want to know why suddenly I miss her after 5 months of not wanting anything to do with her. maybe I just need to be with someone else, but I do not want to start a relationship if I still have feelings for K its not right to who I date. I have a feeling some of you will see her as toxic and trust me I do too, but this is just one side of the story. if you read this whole thing please give me your advice and/or what you think of the situation (like is this normal).

I was about 10 when it happened but I still remember the day it happened like it was yesterday because I woke up to my sister's screams. It was obviously a dark day.

I've never been able to talk to her about it, mostly out of fear of upsetting her if I bring it up. I clearly don't understand the struggles she's been through. I'll never understand loss on that magnitude. However, I want to let her know I still think about him after all these years. It doesn't happen often anymore, but I just had a crying session on my roof thinking about him. I want to let her know that I don't forget him and I will always love him but I don't know how. I don't know if I should. Would bringing him up just cause her pain even after almost 20 years?

197,"Warning: This is going to be long

So to be blunt, I (F19) have come to the realization over the past year that I have grown up in a not as healthy of an environment than I originally believed for the first 18 years of my life. The home I grew up in was for the most part pretty normal. My parents both had steady jobs, were never neglectful, and raised me and my brother to be good people. However, things were not without issues. My mom is an extremely caring and kind woman, but is also extremely controlling. My dad is a fun, goofy guy but can also be very moody and has very high expectations that can sometimes impossible to meet. Both of my parents are also ungodly stubborn people which lead to a lot of yelling in our house with not a lot of room for normal communication. Also neither of my parents were entirely emotionally supportive. Every time I’ve had anxiety attacks or been overwhelmed past the age of 13 my parents have told me to “get a grip”, “don’t be so sensitive”, and “you should be stronger”(most of this is from my dad but my mom is a silent bystander). 

And so my personal problems begin:
-I don’t feel like I’m good enough: This is something I’ve been working on for a long time and have gotten a lot better at. However, I feel like there was only a very few times my dad ever felt proud of me growing up and I felt like I could never live up to his expectations. I still feel like this today, that no matter what I do it’ll never be enough for him
-I’m extremely indecisive: Between my mom’s controlling behavior and my dad’s “my way or the high way” attitude and ever changing emotions I felt like I should always do what I’m told. Now I can’t make a simple decision like whether or not I want a table umbrella up or down. It’s also lead me to have very neutral responses when I’m asked for my opinion, which had gotten me in trouble with my dad
-I say “I’m sorry too much: I’m the kind of person who over apologizes for everything. I continue to apologize even when I’ve been told “It’s ok”. I apologize if I don’t learn something completely new to me right away. I say “I’m sorry” instead of “Excuse me” when passing someone in a tight space. This has to do a lot with the amount of yelling in my house growing up, my mom getting frustrated when I made mistakes, and my dad blowing up in my face over little things. 
-It’s hard for me to open up emotionally to other: I mentioned before that my parents are not the most emotionally supportive people which has made me feel that my problems and feelings are insignificant and should come second. 

Enter my wonderful boyfriend of almost a year who I want a future with:
He’s made me feel like I’m not a complete and utter screw up. He wants to hear my opinions and takes them into consideration when making decisions. He makes me feel like I’m heard and understood in a way no friend or family member ever has before. We started dating at a really low point in my life were I was having anxiety attacks at least 4 times a week. He never judged me for those emotions and wanted to help and support me through that. 

He opened my eyes to how people who love each other should act towards one another.  

And now I want to know how to solve my problems that have been caused by my relationship with my parents so I can continue to be in a healthy relationship with him. 

I know my problems, but I don’t know how to solve them. Therapy would be nice but it’s expensive and I still live at home and don’t want my parents asking questions on why I think I need therapy. And it’s not just the problems I want to solve, but how to break free of the feeling that my parents still have control over my life. 

I still love my parents very much, but I need to solve the problems I have with them in order to pursue the life and relationship I want. 

So Reddit, do you have advice on where to start solving my problems now that I know what they are?

204,"Hi everyone, I’m doing this throwaway account so I can ask how to deal with gore related trauma. I live in Europe, I’m a teen 17 and because if my dad’s work I spent two years in Angola (Africa), started two years ago. These two years taught me a lot just like every time I go living abroad (dad’s work) but one thing really kept me having nightmares and depression for a part of these two years while in Angola. 
My African classmates really have a different vision concerning justice. They think death can be easily given for even light crimes like stealing food or drink from a grocery store. So they have bunch videos on their phone and during lunch break, they have fun showing people getting killed, and what’s even worse is the way they kill people and laugh about it while watching and the person in the clip filming it.

WARNING: if you are easily sensitive to anything related to gore, I recommend you not to read this part. If so, skip the following paragraph.

The first time I saw this was when a guy from my class laughed and with a friend we came to see why he was laughing, and he then showed us a guy, hand tied, on the ground, in the night, and then someone with a machete hit him in the throat, several times. It hurts to have to think of it again but I need to tell you what I saw. On another video, there was a man, in the street, covered in blood, with both legs broken, and another man hitting his legs with a machete. A guy, naked, hand tied, wounded who gets his genitals eaten by dogs, a guy being held in tires and burned in the street, a guy jumping from a tall electric pole, from a building. A man, hand tied, kneeling, a bag on his head, being shot by a tank at close range.

I didn’t talk about this to anyone because I’m so scared about this, this is terrifying, each time I saw those videos, I was instantly sweating cold, and felt  losing balance. I met my gf in Angola the second year, and she pretty much made me forgot about it thanks to her awesomeness but I guess I need to talk to her about it, it’s been 11 months now we’re together so yeah. But I don’t feel like talking about it to my parents. Thanks for help.",05Sep2020,1
205,"So I’ve been engaged to my partner for about three months now., and I’m sure we will get married.  At the same time I want kids, and the more I’ve thought about it, the more I want my ex’s kid.  He was the only man I ever truly felt physically attracted to  we broke up because I knew I was more into women than men.  For some odd reason, when I think of having a kid, I want it to be his.  I don’t have unresolved feelings and I love my fiancée, and I mentioned it to her and she was the beautiful supportive person she always had been and was open to the idea of me having a kid of my ex’s.  The thing is me and my ex hardly talk, and he’s in a serious relationship of his own.  I don’t want to rustle things up, but it’s the same time the urge to have his kid wakes me up at night.  I think I’d feel better if I could talk to him about it, but I don’t have the slightest clue where to start.  Also please be kind, this whole set of feelings is beyond weird for me.  It’s taken quite a toll on me.",05Sep2020,1
206,"I have 2 friends I've known since 7th grade that I've always sit with at lunch. it used to be a group of 11 of us, but now its only us three since we changed high schools. we're starting to become very different. I've started grade 11. I've changed a lot since we first met. We used to be stereotypical nerd outcasts for a lack of a better term. They are both still pretty much the same, Ive completely changed and Im alot happier now. Since we moved schools I've made a ton of new acquaintances and they've made 2 or 3. most of my new acquaintances ( and a few guys I'd consider friends) sit together in a group of 13. My two old friends decided to sit all the way out in the field far from any other people. 

I had a choice today whether to sit with them or the group, and I chose to sit with my old friends. I didnt enjoy it. It was the same old us sitting quietly, having lackluster convos since they both have bad social skills. I don't joke with them Like I used to since I'm kinda maturing and I don't find their humor as funny anymore. I have so much fun with those new guys cause we're pretty similar. I finally fit in. People actually like me. I'm comfortable in my own skin. I want to finally enjoy not being an outcast weirdo like I was before I started working on myself. 

Still, I know what it was like in middle school when people didn't like me, and the only friends I could make were outcasts like I was. I don't want them to feel abandoned, and I can't and dont want to ghost them since we have history, and our old friend group still hangs out, I'm just a little closer with some of the  others in that old group. What do I do? there's no way  they would befriend the new group, they're too different. I try to make the best when I sit with them, but I still think about how I could be sitting with the new group. What should I do? I feel like such a bad friend thinking this way. I want to work on new friendships but I feel obligated to them. they are pretty boring too. I'm sorry if I'm an asshole. I want to do what's morally right, but I'm pretty lost.",05Sep2020,1

I know this is a really bad problem because everytime something might turn into an argument, I runaway or just apologize over and over because I can't stand fighting verbally with someone. Even when I know I must be right or have something to say, I just stand there dumbstruck and cry a lot afterwards. I don't know what to do to fix this or improve myself. Whenever I try to speak up, I find myself not being able to talk because my throat is stuck and tears are about to come.

In all honesty, I hate dresses. I hate makeup. I hate wearing dressy clothes and anything in that sort. I hate skirts but I can tolerate shorts. What I LOVE to wear: t shirts, boot cut jeans with regular shoes or boots (I live in the country). That’s literally my go-to outfit. Basically... I’m a tomboy. 
I do have long black/dark brown curly hair and it’s probably the only plus I have for me. I always get compliments on it so it makes me feel a little better and boosts up my confidence. 

I’m starting to open up more to the idea of wearing makeup. My mom always gives me shit because I decide to not wear it. But makeup can be a way to maybe make me look my age, if not a little older?

212,"A quick run down of what people didn't feel comfortable with was the part that said ""want to beat some cheeks? Want to get your cheeks beat?"".  Our club is about fighting games and the fighting game community often uses this type of humor light heartedly. In our community, this saying if course would pretty much mean ""want to get your ass kicked? Yadda yadda"" I wrote this to target my audience, but inevitably there were people who didn't understand and felt that it was uncomfortable and expressed toxic masculinity. 

We didn't find out about this issue until we saw a post from a person (we'll call them B) who was posting this drama all over their story. Without my knowledge my co-pres sent a message to B which made B even angrier, causing the pot to stir even more. After a day people were responding to B's stories and calling her out. The whole time, as the creator of said poster, have said nothing to avoid making something so small become even bigger. It's been two days since all this drama and now our school's newspaper is asking us questions about the situation. 

Some questions include: 
What was your intention with this poster?
How was it approved?
After people's reactions, what do you think now?
Do I regret making it? 
Do I have anything to say to the people who may have been offended?

Should I answer or should I just not respond? My biggest fear is what I say just makes things even worse. I just want to focus on my studies, but this one little act really fucked up my week.",05Sep2020,1

I feel incredibly blessed and humbled.

Before I became an engineer I worked with animals at minimum wage. I worked really hard, harder than anything I have done since.

Sometimes I feel really guilty when I think about my success. My family wanted to celebrate me and I just feel shy talking about it. I spent some time in the shower crying just from disbelief.

I am so happy and incredibly fortunate.
Why do I feel so guilty about it?

216,"The second things started opening back up my sister started hanging out with her friends without a mask and not even 6 feet apart. Whenever, I bring it up my mom says that things are opening back up and tells me to stop freaking out. Also she and my dad are healthcare workers so they are exposed, kind of. My mom answers phones however she is exposed to people who could be exposed. My dad works at a prison which is secure because the exposed individuals are isolated. Also, I was sick for over a week and my sister still had friends over. My mom said I didn’t have corona and diagnosed me with a sinusitis. But, even a doctor who can diagnose needs to run tests to be sure. And it’s not her decision if my sister’s friends where exposed and their parents didn’t know.

It’s hypocritical for her to be mad about my family members posting things about not social distancing and not wearing masks when she has up to ten people over every day. She says it’s fine because it’s the same circle of friends. But they can be exposed to other people.

This is also stressing me out because I have a lot of anxiety and having people over non stop is increasing it. Whenever I say this my mom says use coping skills. But coping skills aren’t a permanent solution you need breaks to breathe I’m having nonstop anxiety all fucking day and I can’t take it. It’s all just building up and then I explode in front of my sisters friends and get yelled at by my mom and her friends think I’m crazy.

My mom refuses to even talk about it. I’ve begged her for months to have a fucking break I got one day a few weeks ago. I thought I was finally going to get a break when school starts but I just heard today that my mom is going to get my sisters friends a desk here so that she can come over every day for school.

My mom doesn’t care how I feel. She claims she does but her actions are the same. Any time I bring it up she immediately shuts me down. I freaked out over text about it because on the one day she said I had was once two days which I wasn’t happy about because I really need time to recharge. After this one of my sisters friends came over and stayed for another day. They are constantly over 24/7. I’m literally thought I was having a heart attack because of chest pain from all the anxiety I have. Whenever I bring it up my mom invalidates my feelings and says I’m being ridiculous. 

I have OCD and am very freaked out about corona even though I know if I got it I’d probably live because I’m not at risk. But I’m really concerned that I could be infected and infect someone else and kill them and it really fucking bothers me. I also don’t like people seeing my compulsions. And my mom gets annoyed with me whenever I open and close things a million times which just makes everything a thousand times worse.

I get sensory overload and they are so fucking loud. When I get overstimulated I get really fucking anxious which has been my constant state for the past few weeks. I feel safe when I’m in my home with only my family members. And I need that feeling every once in a while.

My mom doesn’t understand why I’m anxious and because I can’t put it into words for her to understand she doesn’t change anything. When I try to explain to her she tells them to be quiet and then they are quiet for about 20 minutes then they freak out again. I can’t fucking take this any longer.

I don’t know what to do. I’ve begged her for months and she gave me a fucking day after months of pleading with her. She says I’m being selfish.

217,"Like the heading says, I feel like I am living a stagnate and empty life. It’s really been weighing heavily on me this evening. I feel like I have absolutely nothing in common with anyone I know. I have “friends” but feel like a true outcast. My emotions have changed so much over the last couple of years. Just last year, I loved going out and socializing, having drinks with friends, and traveling. Now I barely feel like doing any of these things. (This is not due to covid...this is a deep seeded issue). 

Earlier today, my friend got really exciting news and I didn’t even care. I acted like I did, but felt nothing. Tonight, I was hanging out with two of my friends. We have a lot in common, but I didn’t really feel anything. I faked that I was interested in the conversation. Internally, I felt very empty and distant. They were talking about being in love and I haven’t felt the emotions they were describing. I don’t feel a connection to most people in my life. I only talk to these people to fill the void of loneliness. I have always felt like a lone wolf. 

I constantly criticize my self. I always feel like a burden on my friends and people I know. This involves me apologizing to them over nothing. I still ask my best friends to make sure his parents are ok with me coming over (I am 23 years old). I ask because I always feel like a burden. I have never had sex because I feel so ashamed of myself. I have also never dated because I just feel like people like me don’t. 

Like stated earlier, I used to love to do certain things. Now, I have hardly any interest in leaving my house. The idea of having a few beers with friends seems so unappealing and tiresome. I used to love to travel, now I don’t want to go further than an hour. I just feel like my life has become so hollow, but I am putting up a facade that I am ok.",05Sep2020,1

219,"I’m moving to a different school and I’m not sure how I should confront my friends. There’s a person I’ve been friends with for a few years but they’ve recently started to become what I think is toxic behavior. They would be clingy towards me and a little obnoxious. They would be disruptive during class and talk about things that are past anyone’s comfort level. They also make the people around me uncomfortable or not in a good relationship with them. They have depression, anxiety, and ADHD but I’m unsure if it’s really related or not.

I have other “friends” but I’m not entirely close to them. I talk to them enough times that I’m alright to call them a friend and vice versa. I know them for a few years as well but I don’t really talk to them after school unless we’re in the same class or sit in the same table. Even then there isn’t much to talk about if the right person isn’t moving the conversation.

220,"Trigger warning.

I broke up with my boyfriend (we’ll call him A) 3 weeks ago. Still very attached and before the accident I was thinking of telling him I wanted to make it work. But I figured it’d be good if we both took some time for ourselves. He invited me to lunch for last Sunday, and I initially said yes but I was still so anxious so a changed my mind. He was understanding and said it would be good if we took time apart. 

Sunday came, the day we were supposed to hang out. He called me unexpectedly. He was sobbing. I’ve never heard so much agony in his voice. The kitten we had raised together got run over and he wanted to let me know. He was going to bury him right after the call. I was in shock. I asked him to come over or for me to go with him but he refused. He went on his own. After he hung up is when it hit me that our kitten died. 

After the call he turned his phone off and didn’t tell me where he was going. He had been saying some suicidal stuff and drinking heavily because of the breakup. so I was worried for him. I called his mom and asked if she knew where he went. She didn’t know, but told me to call her if he responded.

I asked her what happened to our kitty. And she told me all the details, and the image is haunting me. The kitty was only 16 weeks old so he was a tiny guy. He got out of the house and went across the street, and when the mom went to look for him he ran back towards the house as a car was coming. His little body was flattened. She described to me how his body looked. I won’t go into the details, but just hearing about it traumatized me a little. 

She went inside to grab a bag to pick him up and that’s when she told A what happened to the kitten. He was in shock at first, but then he took the bag and went to pick the kitten up himself. I can’t imagine how he felt in that moment and that’s what hurts me the most. His biggest fear has always been losing a pet. He had a kitten 3 years ago that passed away from poisoning and he had to watch as the kitten seized up and screamed. He had to put that kitten down and it took him a long time to heal. He also raised that one from the beginning and it was just a kitten when it died too. The last cat we got last may ran away, but we weren’t too attached to her. Now this happened. We were so so attached to this little guy, very committed to his care. We were looking forward to watching him grow up. He were so in love with him. 

He literally watched his biggest nightmare come true. He had to see the kitten. He had to bury him. And now that we’re broken up he’s going through it alone. I so badly wish I could be there for him.

He called me back once he finished burying the kitten. His mom told him I was worried so he wanted to let me know he’s fine. I told him I really wanted to be there for him, that I needed him, that I had been wanting to talk about getting back together and that I still cared about it. He didn’t want to hear it, it was too much for him at the moment. He was upset. He said if I wanted to talk I should have said something earlier, and that he needed space. He texted me afterwards saying he didn’t mean to be rude and he was going back home. I told him to be safe and he never responded. 

This happened this past Sunday. I keep imagining his reaction to what happened, the pain he felt, I imagine the kitten very often because of how his mom described it to me. I’m angry at myself for being so selfish to bring our relationship up after that happened. I can’t stop worrying about him. I feel like I can’t breathe. I want to text him, but I also want to respect his space. It’s just so hard I miss him so much and I’m so sad. I’m angry at the world. Angry that the kitten had to die, angry at myself for causing A pain in the first place. If I had gone to hang out with A this probably wouldn’t have happened. We would be happy. 

The only comfort I can give myself is that he’ll talk to me eventually. But what if he doesn’t? What if this time he realizes he doesn’t want anything to do with me anymore? My heart aches unbearably. 

I have a therapist I talk to. But I don’t see her until next Thursday, and at this point I’m struggling to keep going everyday. I lost my faith in god. I was never one to follow the church, but I always had hope that someone out there was controlling everything. There’s no way god did this to teach us a lesson. 

All I ask for is encouragement. Maybe someone can relate to losing a pet, or seeing a loved one in pain, or having second hand trauma, or feeling so sad you can’t breathe.

222,"I am, no exaggeration, constantly berating myself for sitting down and enjoying something. I'm 15 years old, and this is an age I've always feared, including 16 years old, because of all the negative things I heard of people my age. We're lazy, we think we know everything, etc etc. I'm not saying that's untrue, but, I'm trying my damn best to not fit into all that. I don't wanna be seen as lazy, I don't wanna live in my moms basement, so I just constantly be harsh with myself to get shit done. I can't be nice with myself or I'll slip out of place and go back to waking up at 3 pm and throwing a fit when asked to do chores. I force myself to wake up at 7 am, if I stay in bed for longer than 10 minutes after waking up, I force myself to do 20 push ups. If I take too long in the shower, I force myself to take a cold shower the next day. So on and so forth. Nowhere near me is hiring at 16 so I have to wait until I'm 18 to get a job. This, is an issue. Now I'll have to deal with the adults in my family talking down to me because I do not have a job yet (even though they have literally never done that). I rarely let myself rest with ease. Sure I get stuff done and play video games and listen to music for 5 hours, but I don't feel good about it. Nope, I feel guilty about it, frequently. I'm trying to force my body to go to sleep at 8 pm and wake up at 5 am, but it's not working. So I have to stay right here, and I'm so god damn disappointed in myself that I can't go past 7 am. I can't go to 6 am, my body rejects it. Whenever I'm asked to do a chore, and I feel even remotely annoyed, this is gonna sound bad, but I slap myself in the face and scream at myself in my head until I get the thing done.   


Here are some things I would like to say in addition to all of this. I am not a parentified child. I've been forcing myself to research psychology because I don't want to be a useless person and want to know at least one useful skill, and found out about parentification. I was never emotionally abused as a child, and this switch just happened at random. I can tell you this though, whenever a family member even remotely hints to me being lazy, I make it my goal to be extra hard on myself the next day to straighten myself out. How. Do. I. Fucking. Relax.",05Sep2020,1
223,"For more details: 
My niece is 7 years old. She is the very definition of a brat. She talks back, argues, continuously picks on my son &amp; her siblings, fake cries to get her way, lies to everyone, tries to get my son &amp; her siblings in trouble, lies &amp; pretends that my fiancé &amp; I are being “mean” to her for “no reason”, like she literally throws trash on the floor &amp; won’t pick it up, &amp; the list goes on. She lives with/is raised by her grandparents, as well as her siblings. My fiancé, son, &amp; I live with them as well. The house we are in is in my fiancé’s name, so we can’t really move out. I get that she is 7, but I feel that her behavior has very little to do with her age or all kids would act like this. Her siblings are wonderful. I never have these problems with them. It’s just her. Her brother and sister want nothing to do with her, my toddler son wants nothing to do with her &amp; even our 4 y.o. neighbor wants nothing to do with her. Her grandparents totally allow her to act like this &amp; then coddle her when anyone is over her antics. &amp; I hate to say it, but her grandpa plays favorites with her. For example, he gave an office chair to her brother &amp; he was so excited. She then notices and goes &amp; has a fit about it, so what did he do? Told her brother he couldn’t have it &amp; gave it to her. Another example, she went &amp; set a popsicle on her sister’s bed (mind you, her sister hadn’t been home in 2 days) &amp; her grandma found it half-way melted &amp; got mad at her, so she went &amp; told her grandpa that her sister had did it &amp; even though her grandma was trying to tell him it wasn’t her sister &amp; couldn’t have been, he believed the 7 year old &amp; was going to ground the sister when she got home, until his wife finally grew a pair &amp; told him he needs to stop taking her side when she’s wrong (even though she does it too). It’s an everyday, 20 times a day thing. Like with her siblings, they are good &amp; like all kids, have their bad days, but she is completely opposite &amp; is bad all day, everyday &amp; has her occasional good days, but they are far &amp; few. I have tried to talk to her grandparents &amp; they don’t believe it, even though they deal with it themselves. They get all mad &amp; defensive. If I try to tell her anything, she will go twist the story to them to make me sound like I’m just being a bitch to a child for no reason. Same with my fiancé. Her siblings can’t even tell on her without somehow being blamed. A lot of it is the grandparents’ fault; they are raising a monster &amp; say it’s because she’s 7 &amp; she will grow out of it. I don’t believe one day it’s magically going to stop. I’m over it &amp; at this point just avoid her at all costs. I’m nice still when she’s in a good mood or she asks me something, but I get away as fast as I can because she will act up at the drop of a hat. Then she wonders why no one wants anything to do with her or will play with her. I feel bad, but I also don’t because it’s pretty easy to see why. I refuse to take her to the store with me anymore because she will act like a fool in the store &amp; then will tell me I’m not her boss &amp; they’ve tried to make me feel guilty about that. I’m sad because I want the relationship with her, that I have with her siblings, but I give up. I’m going to continue to avoid her. Am I wrong simple because she’s 7?

It has now gotten to the point that there are nights I will cry until I sleep purely because these characters aren't real and I feel like I will never be able to love someone like I love them. I seek out new characters to fall in love with, revolve my life around imagining myself in that world, get extremely upset that they aren't real, and the cycle continues. This has been an extremely unhealthy coping mechanism, but I can't get out of it. I feel like I'm stuck with it and I don't know what to do. I have other issues I know I need to address but don't have the money or resources to see a therapist, and I feel lost. I would really appreciate any advice at all.

233,"Hello, I’ve only just made an account but have been reading posts here for a while and was hoping someone out there has dealt with something similar or had some advice for me,

My dads partner is my age. She was a family friend for years before this, and she has always been vocal about loving my dad. We all thought it was a bizarre joke and even he said it was harmless at the start. I didn’t like her but I was never nasty to her, I just didn’t feel comfortable around her and found her really annoying. When she was at high school she made something cool and got a lot of attention for it, it died down and my dad essentially thinks she is the worlds best entrepreneur and pays for her to live in their massive 2 million dollar house where she “works hard as an entrepreneur everyday”. She doesn’t do anything and my dad invested 50K in to a business that she has no formal qualifications to actually do for it. The business related to her project but I don’t want to mention what it was as it’s specific and someone may relate me to this post.

My dad has a lot of money but has always been very harsh on my sibling and I to work hard, no hand outs and build a life for yourself by earning your way. Seeing him essentially treat her the opposite makes me feel so let down.

We didn’t speak for 2 years (I am 24 and before that we were extremely close my whole life). He had promised he would never have that relationship as we had spoken a lot about it after she continuously followed us around, turned up everywhere we went and even moved to the city he lived in where she knew no one and didn’t have a job. She has issues that are family related and she’s tries to project a carefree hippie vibe but she actually is very self absorbed and materialistic. My dad cannot see any of the obvious when he is in relationships and unfortunately before this one let Simone horrific into our lives. He saw it 5 years too late so this current relationship is all the more difficult because it feels like his kids will never come first. When it first went down I said that if he let her move in to the house I wouldn’t speak to him, but I might be ok if there were baby steps. He chose for her to move in knowing we wouldn’t have a relationship. 

He messaged frequently over the years but never cared enough to actually change his actions.

I know I need to work on things because his happiness is important but it has been 2 years and I feel just as sick hearing about her as I did then. I won’t be in the same room as her because I feel so angry and upset and I don’t want to embarrass myself. He told my sibling and I he bought that big house so we could be a family again and I’ve been to it once. The new girlfriend lived there the week he bought it. 

My sister goes around sometimes and can do things with her around but she feels the same as me about her. I wish I could be more like her and just put her out of my head and go around there for my dad but it’s almost too far gone. It’s so hard seeing someone living in our family house saying it’s theirs when I’ve only been there once. Even worse when I work my ass of at my job everyday and my dad speaks about her as if she’s Obama but has never had a 9-5 job. 

Does anyone have any advice?",05Sep2020,1

I had to work for 7 hours today and I was pretty burned out at the end  (lawn mowing equipment isn't light). when I got home, I couldn't find my phone to watch youtube on while I played on my GameBoy so I was using my switch instead of my phone. I  was just chilling in my room playing link's awakening and my dad comes into my room and asks me to feed our dogs their dinner; I did so. I went back into my room and resumed what I was doing. A few minutes later, he comes in and grabs my switch off my bed and asks if he could use it. Normally I would say yes, but because I couldn't find my phone, I politely declined. he argues that I can watch Youtube on my phone and before I can say anything, he takes my headphones out and walks away. I said that I couldn't as I couldn't find my phone. He then says not my problem and throws on of my controllers at the wall when I tell him that he's had it for most of the summer ( i took it on a camping trip with some friends). I yell and inform him that those are $80 controllers (they have a special print on them that costs $20 to replace). he storms off and refused to return the switch until I go outside at 11:30 PM and pick up all the rubbish our dog dragged out. I said that I wouldn't because it was too dark and he said to take a flashlight. I then reminded him that I didn't have my phone and he said ""that sucks, deal with it"" I then reminded him that he's had MY switch almost all summer and said it was BS and I named all the time he's spent on it and now is refusing to return the switch.

a girl (16f, ""Glasses"") that had gotten close to me confessed to me that she got a guy (20m, ""Macaroni"") to cheat on his girlfriend/work friend of mine (21f, ""Bunny"") multiple times and, come to find out, everyone else we work with had heard about it as well but only Bunny believed it to be a rumor. i told Bunny the truth tonight at work and everything i knew about the situation, she was of course torn but i knew she deserved the truth that no one was giving her while Macaroni did not deserve the faith Bunny had in him.. she cried to me very hard and admitted that this wasn't the first time in the 2 years they'd been dating he'd cheated, one time being very recently with his ex, his claim being it was assault. Glasses is a very hard worker in the workplace so i know she is favored, this and she's not ashamed in her interest for older men so she flirts with every guy we know to work there. she will be sided with.

Glasses had been the only person i talked to outside of work and we see where that got me.. am i wrong for telling Bunny the truth? with it being spoken about all across our store, no one had talked to Bunny about it or told her the truth. she was the laughingstock. it was only me. she admitted that i was her favorite, as she was mine too, so that explains why she approached me. i originally had tried to protect myself and keep out of it, saying i had no idea what she was talking about but immediately after is when i opened up with the truth. she is grateful but i know i will get a bite from others about this.",05Sep2020,1

253,"I’m 28. It took me a couple years longer than normal to finish college due to switching my major around a couple times and having certain credits become useless. It took me a while to find my first real job out of college, but for the past year and a half I’ve been working at a standard entry level office job where I make $16 an hour. 

I’ve never lived on my own. My parents are divorced and I’ve been living with my dad since I was 6 or 7. One of my friends got married somewhat recently and I’ve started thinking about whether or not I should finally move out on my own, but I’m hesitant. I feel like I’m *supposed* to want to, but honestly I just don’t. 

I contribute to my dad’s bills so I’m not being a complete leech, although I’m a terrible cook so he does most of that. I have a social life - I’ve got a group of friends that I regularly hang out with, although recently we’ve temporarily shifted to online things due to COVID.

One of the primary reasons people give for moving out is having a dating life, but honestly I’m just not interested in the slightest. I’m not asexual, but I’ve never wanted any kind of relationship and although my parents keep insisting that will change, I know myself and I can say with confidence that I’ll be perfectly happy living my life without any kind of romantic relationship. It’s hard to get people to understand that, but I’m genuinely happy avoiding the dating scene. 

I know my dad would get lonely with me gone, and I’m not feeling any kind of lack of freedom that’s pushing me towards living in my own either. I’m just perfectly happy where I am right now, but I’m not sure exactly what I’m supposed to do. I think I’m *supposed* to feel like a loser and feel shamed into moving out on my own, but is that really a good enough reason? I do have a legitimate worry in that I haven’t learned how to do certain things on my own like being up keeping  an entire home or shopping for an apartment, and I know that I’ll still have to move out at some point regardless, but is *that* enough of a reason to move out soon? I’m saving money, my dad is saving money, and I believe we’re both happier with me here. But I can’t help feeling like I’m not supposed to be living this way.

I’ll give him food. But I wanted to keep messing with him. But he took it the wrong way thinking I’m flirting.

264,"I apologize for being broad in my request for advice on this subject. I have no experience nor the slightest idea when it comes to hooking up with others, so anything you could offer would help me greatly. Thank you for understanding.

I’m a young guy (over 18 though... of course), that’s been curious for a while about hooking up with someone online possibly, but I’ve been so scared. I’m gay, so I’ve peeked at Grindr in the past but haven’t gathered the guts yet to actively search on it yet. I’m a virgin, and was wanting to have atleast a bit more knowledge in the world of hooking up with someone before even attempting it.

Some questions I have are:

Is hooking up even...a thing right now with covid? Are you personally avoiding it altogether or if not, what are the precautions you’re taking?

When it comes to me using the term hooking up,  to go into more detail, I’m not sure if I’m ready for a relationship or anything of that sorts, I’m just curious and looking for a “one night stand” if you will. Is it really okay to express to a person that you aren’t looking for anything more than a hook up? What’s the best way of expressing this to the other person, or is just stating it outright okay to do?

What happens in terms of finding a location? There’s no possible way it could be at my house, so if the other person is unable to be at their house as well, are hotels the way to go?

I’m a very socially awkward person, so this is going to be a very weird question, but I’m dead serious when I ask this. When you do finally meet up, how does the before and after usually go? If anything has given me more fear and kept me from going any further, it’s this for sure.

Anything to look out for? Things I should avoid and be careful about? Anything else additional you wish you could go back in time and tell yourself the first time you attempted something like this?

Even if you’re only able to answer one of these, I’m so thankful nonetheless. Thank you :)",05Sep2020,1
265,"I have been working with an engineer on a new project for the last few months. I have been constantly frustrated with him on our assignments. He is constantly late to meetings, changes meetings and direction of assignments daily, doesn't follow through, and is extremely  arrogant.  He will take any situation to correct one if he see's fit. For example, if I were to say the sky is blue he would argue that it's green. I am sick how everyone puts him on a pedistool as I am catching him in lies and realizing he probably doesn't know as much as he believes. 

In casual conversation I asked him how he planned to run the team. He said he was going to approach the concept as throwing something on the wall and see what sticks. 

I am more about structure, organization, and being open with my team.  I can't say the same for him. 

This all leads to my situation from a few days ago. We were in a group meeting and I was the last to learn that 85% of the team was being moved to another department to help another task. Inside I was fuming as I was the last to know about this change. The engineer looked at me and asked about my assignment. I put my hands in the air and said what assignment at this point? Who is going to help with this assignment? The engineer pointed his  finger at me and giggled. Mind you this was infront of a room full of people. Another coworker of mine stood up and said the rest of the team will be dedicated to helping with your original assignment. I was fine with that outcome. But what upset me was how the engineer just pointed and laughed. He didn't bother to tell me of this change days prior and decided to wait till we were in our meeting. I had no idea this change was coming and the engineer had multiple opportunities to give me a heads up. 

After dealing with that situation, I was met with my program manager at the same table who asked if I was interested in travel. I  responded with a no and I am very embarrassed but my no came out with frustration and anger. The program manager was graceful, but I am sure he wasn't happy with my response. Hell, I am still embarrassed with the way I acted as I should have set the emotions a side and acted more professional. 

I realize I made the mistake of letting the engineer get to me. But I feel extremely conflicted. This isn't the first time this has happened. This is, however, the first time I reacted that way. A majority of the time I will try to stay calm and breath through it. I am feeling very disrepected by this engineer and am disgusted by his attitude. Honestly, I do not want to work on the team as I don't want to work with him. 

This team has kept me up at night thinking about my actions and how much I have embarrassed myself. I am frustrated in the fact that this engineer is keeping me from doing my job. He shows constant favoritism, he doesn't communicate, he has even gone so far to call a co-worker a moron, he will argue, and is lazy. But he still wants to be considered number one....

What would you do in this sitaution? Would you ask to be moved? Would you try to avoid him at all cost and find ways to do your job? Would you talk to your boss about it or your supervisor?

268,"I have a history of my exes cheating on me, so I feel as if I’m super sensitive to weird vibes and sometimes my thought get the better of me and lead me down unnecessary rabbit holes. I’m not sure if I’m just being paranoid or if I should pay attention.

I’ve never really had a reason to believe my current bf has ever cheated or blatantly lied to me. But today I came home from work and just got this really really strange vibe from him. He was napping, was around 5:30 or 6pm, and he very rarely naps during the day. He was acting really distant when he woke up (around 8pm) and barely ate the dinner I got him on the way home. He sat on his phone texting, while I turned on a show and tried to make convo. Out of nowhere, he says “hey I’m going bowling tonight, is that cool?” Of course I don’t care if he goes out with his friends, but I had gotten cut early from work - which rarely happens - I’m usually working until 10 or 11 pm. I thought maybe we could actually spend some time together tonight.

But I thought, oh well... he needs to go have fun with his guy friends. 

I didn’t think much of it until I got onto Snapchat and happened to look at the world view. I know that Snapchat isn’t 100% accurate on location, but it showed my bf pretty far down the street at someone else’s house at 4pm today, right before I got home. 

So I start getting a weird feeling and give him a call to just chat. It’s about 11:40pm, the bowling alley has been closed for at least 40 minutes. Right before I think it’s going to hit voicemail, he picks up. I don’t hear any bowling alley noises at all. Sounds like he’s outside. I ask him what he’s doing and he says he’s just now finishing up a game and about to head out.

Maybe he stepped outside to take my call? That’s what I’m thinking anyways. He says he’s going to a friends house after and that he’ll be home in about 45 minutes. 

It’s almost 1pm and he’s still not home. I went on Snapchat just a couple minutes ago - and now his location is completely turned off.

How can I constantly stop comparing myself to my boyfriends ex girlfriend?



I have this really toxic habit of ALWAYS comparing his past relationship with mine. Yes, he has told me he has never been crazy over anyone only with me. Yes, we met and connected and he wanted to marry me quite early. Yes, he confessed at the end he didn’t really felt anything for her it was just more of a habit. He’s told me he’s never treated anyone better than me and that she never fulfilled him. BUT, when my boyfriends ex girlfriend mom died, I assume he would sleep in her house the weekends he would come and they did spend a lot of time together. They dated for 5 years and he never wanted to get married, but someone did tell me that they did act like a married couple although they never actually “lived” together. I know she would always be up on his ass because I guess she never wanted to be alone, it just affects me at times when my bf is out with his friends or doing something without me I feel like she always got her way and even if I don’t really tell him I’ll go with him, it makes me feel weird. We already have been dating for 2 years and 3 months, we live together and have a 4 month old baby. But still, there’s days I think that he really did love her and it makes me sad.

272,"I have recently had a lot of thoughts about this. While it's not at an anxiety level of thoughts, it does really make me think sometimes and unsettles me a little. 

When I am driving or something I often just stop (not literally) and realize that this exact type of moment, where everything feels casual, normal, and fine, is when some people's lives are changed forever. 

Something like a violent car crash from someone just swerving out of their lane a little, killing you instantly or paralyzing you. Life instantly changes or ends and everything just seemed normal. Or those random killings where you are killed out of nowhere. These types of things just give me an eerie sort of feeling.

I'd rather bleed out slowly and look at something and be able to come to terms with the fact that I am dying. I want to be able to just feel nostalgic about times and accept my fate. Being suddenly torn into pieces during a car crash or something just feels so... off and scary. Just today someone was killed in   
 a car crash where I live. It was basically how I described it. Just a normal day,  just another intersection, and BOOM a semi truck runs a red light out of nowhere and you are dead. Or one of my old friends was killed in a dirt bike crash. He took a turn, took it too fast or something, and got pinned and suffocated underneath a car. Everything was so normal. And to think I almost ended up like him... I was riding a motorized bicycle I built and took a turn too fast, and a car was coming, and I almost slid underneath it. I mean it wasn't very close but had they not been paying attention, I could've just ended up like Dennis (my friend). It just hits me differently.

I try to distance myself from them from then on, but still was checking in to make sure theyre okay.  Im uneasy and afraid around them both.  After a month i break down in front of my parents and tell them how scared i am of them.  They both go over to talk to them, she refuses to leave their room.  Brother did too for a bit.  Parents call het mom up and say that she is no longer welcome in this house, and we would prefer it if brother remains here (They can continue the relationship but just allow these two adults to be themselves too).  Brother goes with her anyway, they can't be apart from each other.  The next day I'm cleaning up when i hear a beeping.  I find brothers cell phone in a couch.  My parents pay for it, its unlocked, and I'm worried so i look at it.  The girlfriend had been in control of it since about January, and really was using it around the time she came here (her phone im told by parents wasnt working at the time, and girlfriend's mom had mailed a new one to her at our home about a week ago.

277,"A little background: I (27f) work for a large company and am on a team of about 15 people. Only myself and one other coworker are the same position/ title. Which is the “lowest ranking” in our particular department. But decently ranking in company. This other coworker is (52F) we will call her Cathy. Not to sound cocky but i have outshined her times a thousand. It’s not my goal but she makes me look good with her lack of work ethic and she’s always late, and pretty lazy. Now last week i won team member of the month and was thrown a surprise party, including the president, VP, executives. It was pretty awesome. Because it was a surprise for me, she and the rest of my department were told beforehand so they could be there. Apparently she had to be coddled by another coworker as to how upset she was i won this and she didn’t get considered. This is out of a building of 2,000 employees by the way. Anyways, so i really really believe she said this to upset me, because she loves to make jabs at me and has mentioned to others that I’m favored over her. But it really pissed me off. She asked if i am pregnant.... i am not. (For context i am maybe about 20lbs overweight, she is considerably obese, with health and breathing issues from being overweight) And i straight up said uhmmm no; she mentioned i have a little tummy. This happened about 9 hours ago so I’ve been trying to simmer down and decide how i feel about this. It’s not even that she called me “fat” but that she thought it could even be her business to ask this. What if i was? It’s my right to announce when I’d want to. Or what if i have a past of a miscarriage? Or trying to get pregnant and i can’t? I’m really pissed off over her violating me. I’m thinking of writing an email to her about this.

278,"Hi. So, here’s just a bit of background 
I’m a 17 year old girl living in a white conservative family. My dad is a very cookie-cutter republican. Former officer, small business own, you name it, he probably qualifies. My mom used to consider herself democratic.. but recently it seems like her and my oldest sister are just.. going with whatever my dad says like some broken patriarchy system. 
My self, I believe Black Lives Matter, I’ve been extremely passionate about it since this movement began, I also believe in ACAB. 
Here’s the issue. I’m very outspoken. I enjoy civil discussions about different beliefs and perceptions because believe they can help further develop someone’s thought and feeling if they hear a conflicting opinion. But the issue is, in my family, I don’t ever get a civil discussion. I receive insults and yelling. 
Because they’re my parents, I obviously care about their approval. I want them to be proud of me, not to look down on me and call me ignorant. 
So because of this, I’m so extremely scared that I’m not right to believe BLM and ACAB, and I’m scared to be wrong. And even if I am wrong... I know I can’t change that belief. I’m just scared. I want everyone to have equal rights and opportunities, and I want to do all I can to help that cause. But when you hear you’re wrong everyday or hear your parents, people you used to look to for guidance, demonize the movement and say this is an “”attack on white people”” (I don’t believer that whatsoever) you start to second guess yourself. 
I guess what I’d like to know is,, am I valid for my beliefs? Or should I just. Listen to my parents ?",05Sep2020,1
279,"Throwaway account

So I’m a 19 year old girl who lives with an emotionally and mentally abusive mother (46f) part time and lives with my girlfriend (19f) and her family for the rest of the time. I’m tired of living like this, but I can’t just choose one over the other. I’m so torn. Recently my mom and I were talking because my gf is going back to school which means she’ll be gone from 5-11 pm. My mom says she needs me home to help with the house and cooking. She also basically gave me the option of either moving out or not going over to my gf’s anymore. 

The reason I started living part time between both places is because my girlfriend and I were forced to come out to her mom which traumatized the fuck out of us. And due to this happening, it caused a fight between my girlfriend and her own mom, which caused her to be hospitalized because of a panic attack. So ever since then, we’ve been spending as much time together as we can. I know it sounds like we’re very dependent on each other (which i know we are) but considering that we’re both very mentally ill and at this point in time are really the only reason neither of us have broke down severely, I think it’s okay.

The reason why I’m stuck is because after discussing with my girlfriend’s family and them giving me permission to let me move in, I’m regretting the entire decision. I don’t want to leave my home yet. I have 2 siblings and 2 cats that I’m not ready to not see everyday. My parents and I fight a lot, but I would miss at least my dad. We go to costco together and get food and watch tv together. We fight sometimes, but I’m more attached to him then my mom. Both very toxic people, but I’ve just dealt with my mom more than my dad. Plus if I move into my girlfriend’s house, that means all of my belongings will be going into a storage unit since we have no room in my gf’s room to put it all. That means all of my belongings besides for the stuff I need to survive will be packed away. My k-pop albums, my anime figurines, my stuffed animals, my posters, my vinyls, my collections of movie tickets and fortune cookie papers, my nail polish, everything. My room is my safe spot, so the thought of moving from there is absolutely terrifying.

So please, anybody, tell what the fuck I should do. How I should talk to my girlfriend, talk to my parents, really anything. I just need some guidance. That’s all I ask.",05Sep2020,1

So the week after it happened I did one tour and then they said that they didn’t need help with it anymore. How it had sounded in their text, i was under the impression that it was temporary because of that and the fact that they we’re supposedly revising how people volunteer.

Today the said girl who i was supposed to be watching told me about how they asked her to come back and were confused as to why her and my other friend hadn’t been volunteering there. She said that when she was there today that the owner told her that i wasn’t going to be volunteering there anymore. Now this really confused me because even earlier in the week the person in charge of volunteers asked me if she could talk to me about the program and the changes. 

I’m honestly just kinda confused about the whole thing. Why would the owner talk about me to other people but not talk to me herself, and why would the person in charge of volunteers ask me if she could talk to me about the changes.

I’m most definitely not as engaged in my classes as I was in the last school year. I was a straight A student! Now, i’m lucky if I can pull a C.

292,"All three of us are now high school juniors. My friend will go by Em, and the molester will go by De.  
I'm using an alternate account to conceal my identity, and hopefully neither of them will find this.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know De very well, all I know is that we went to the same school (not anymore, now the three of us go to different schools than each other.) Em has been my friend since middle school (7th grade/year.) De has been known for being sexual with several people, including another friend of mine. None of them have wanted it. He consistently touches them inappropriately. 

My first friend, Em, experienced this when De came over to ""hang out"" without any parental supervision. Em's mom is extremely ""cautious"". She does not believe in depression, and she believes I am inappropriate and will abuse her daughter. This isn't true, and we've been great friends for a long time. Em's mom believes De to be a good person, and encourages Em to hang out with De. Em has low self esteem and is unable to stand up for herself. She hates De, and has told him to ""fuck off"" several times (from what she's told me.) She's very caring and doesn't want anyone to get hurt. This is the problem.

  
After the first time, they continued to talk, and De apparently apologized at some point. They continued to hang out after school. I believe this led De to believe what he did was fine. According to Em, it wasn't.

The second time, was at a park. She told me this recently, and I have no information about it as she was forced to give her phone to her mom for the night. All the information I have is that they were at a park, and De had another ""slip up."" ""Similar situation, but in a park."" ""Maybe I gave him mixed signals? Pretty sure I was visually uncomfortable."" ""He's really trying to get into the things I like though, making room to be extra nice. so I think he knows I'm upset."" ""Maybe he's actually trying to be good. Maybe he literally doesn't know that he was in the wrong.""   


That's all I know. She's a very, very kind and caring person, along with being one of my three only friends.   


What can I do in this situation? Am I over reacting? I can't let this happen a third time. She moved fairly far recently, she's asked me to not disclose this with anyone. But I can't handle it not being solved. Is there a way I can bring it to authorities without getting her involved? Thank you in advance, I'm worried sick about her.",05Sep2020,1

296,"\[Warning: Long post\]

I, the cursed middle child (23F) and my younger sister (22F) who’s also the youngest sibling, have been sharing the room for the past 8 years or so. Being the eccentric middle child in an Asian family, I stood out as the “useless” one among my siblings because I’ve always hated studying and loved gaming since young (tbh I don’t think I’m useless anymore because I’ve just graduated with a bachelor’s degree and secured a full-time job during this pandemic). My sister on the other hand, is a model student with good grades, a perfect child that any Asian parent would be proud of. Our relationship has hit rock bottom and we barely communicate even though we stay in the same room, hence the reddit post to seek validation for the argument we had last night (which I would explain in the later part of the post).

Because of our different lifestyles, our sleep cycles clash. Given she is light sleeper, she said that she needs all lights to be turned off and zero noise. This means, I wouldn’t be able to play games if she wants to sleep. I admit, I was foolish when we were young. I wouldn’t care if she wanted to sleep and would continue gaming. But for the past few years after entering university, I’ve matured and learnt to read her actions. When she wants to sleep, she would turn off all the lights in the room and I’d wrap up my game within 10 to 20 minutes and make minimum noise when navigating the room in the dark. This is the respect that I’ve given her, but it wasn’t reciprocated when the roles were reversed, and I was the one trying to sleep early.

Me being the older sibling, I’ve always let her get her ways and kept quiet even though she was being mean to me. She has a very bossy character and would get pissed when things don’t go her way. She wasn’t especially nice when telling me to switch off my pc as well. And when I wasn’t able to switch off in 5 minutes, she’d get irritated and would just switch off my power plug or turn off the Wi-Fi. This has happened quite a few times and we would always get into a heated argument whenever she does that because I have feelings as well.

Sped up to early this year when she blew up because I wasn’t using headphones and she wanted her “peace” in the room. Mind you, that happened 2pm in the afternoon and I was playing bloody animal crossing at 10% volume on my monitor. She blamed me for causing her to be mentally unstable because I was gaming till late at night when we were young, and she wasn’t able to study properly. I know, depression should not be taken lightly, and I am very familiar with this topic myself. We made a verbal agreement with our mom as the middleman that I should switch off my pc at 11pm. Although, I wasn’t particularly happy with this agreement, I agreed because she threatened me with her mental health. This caused me to walk on eggshells whenever she’s in the room.

Because of the pandemic, she is now working from home on alternate weeks. During her work-from-home weeks, she’d stay up till 1-2am watching shows on her phone and that gave me the green light to game after 11pm. 

Then came the argument that happened last night (it was a Friday night and there’s no work tomorrow).

She was still using her phone on the bed and she did not turn off the lights. I felt hungry at 1am so I turned off my monitor (pc still running) and went to the kitchen to cook some noodles. As I was finishing up my noodles, she came out and asked if I was going to turn off the pc and that sound was leaking out of my headphones. Fine. I finished my noodles and went back to the room to switch off my pc when I find that the switch had already been turned off. This triggered me because I hate it when she does that. I confronted her about it and said that she was tired of waiting for me to turn off my pc when barely 5 minutes had passed.

I wrote a long message to her afterwards (warning, very bad English sorry) and she came up with an even longer message asking me to permanently move tf out of the house. Link to the messages here: (1) [https://ibb.co/FxtjR1B](https://ibb.co/FxtjR1B) (2) [https://ibb.co/0n9zZ1m](https://ibb.co/0n9zZ1m). I left my message to her in as well so you can judge if I was being the unreasonable one.

If I were truly addicted to gaming, I wouldn’t even have graduated from university or even get a full-time job. She’s always saying that I do not have rights to negotiate with her and I don’t understand why. During arguments, she never considers what I’m trying to say and ultimately thinks she’s always right.

I need advice on how to deal with her or if I should move out and avoid her. Am I getting the short end of the stick by compromising to all her wishes?

tl;dr – Me a gamer, she a bossy sister and expects me to listen to her all the time. Relationship at rock bottom. When I don’t turn off my pc within 5 minutes because she needs her quality sleep, she gets pissed and switches off the power/Wi-Fi herself. Makes me angry when she does that and we would always get into a heated argument. Arguments are always one-sided, and I would end up letting her get her ways because I’m the older sibling.",05Sep2020,1
297,"My brother and I share a room in my parents' house. We have an ensuite bathroom and my brother constantly smokes there. I hate the smell of it. 

This has been an ongoing issue in our house. My parents have always taken his side in all our arguments because he is susceptible to reckless behaviour/has underlying anger issues (that we're trying to resolve by ignoring it). Their argument is that, ""he is stubborn, you gotta adjust."" And if I don't budge they make it about me and how big of a burden I am to them. None of my achievements are celebrated for more than 5 seconds.

Since I never win an argument in this house, I'm prone to sulk until I get over the problem. I'm really trying not to but I feel neglected. Everyone in this house has been so mean to be and I've always tried to get over it.

300,"we started talking about before 6 months from now and got into a relationship 2 months before, first month of when we started dating was lovely and I enjoyed her company so much. I really really love her and really wanted a long term relationship with her but in the second month I started having feelings about my freedom being in danger, I started taking a lot of time to myself which she noticed and felt like I wasn't into her as much as she was. but thats really not what it is, I'm into her very much and I want to be with her but I'm not very capable of being there for her all the time. I initially thought it was only anxiety and that I'll be able to overcome it somehow so I tried to fight my feelings and not pay them much attention. but it has caused me more and more anxiety to the point where I'm always very stressed about everything and why I have to feel the way I do. I discussed about this with my psycho grad friend and they think it's commitment issues and therapy might help. I'm a student and so so broke and can't afford therapy rn. she lives in a different city and it's a mess so I tried to bring it up yesterday about how my commitment issues are getting into the way and that I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give her the attention that she needs and deserves. she tends to overthink a lot, needs constant validation and a lot of attention and I think that's okay however I'm not in the place rn where I can offer her any. I love her so much but I just can't continue to be in a relationship anymore. she thinks I'm lying and that I never really loved her and that it's a choice. she thinks if you want to be with a person you'll do anything to be with them I don't know how to make her understand that emotions and feelings don't always work in our favor and you can't just stop feeling something.

302,"What do I do if I know an animal is being neglected?

I am not sure if this is the right place for this scenario, so if it isn’t pls let me know. 

So I have a friend (A), who has a family member (B). I’ve only heard of B in passing from friend A. Today I learned that B has a dog that A looked after for about two months, as a favor to B. 
B was out of a home and couldn’t afford to feed the dog; they also seem to have an extensive drug problem that they spend most their money on. Because of this drug issue, the dog spends sometimes up to 24 hours in his crate at a time, since B will be too high to care or notice. A roommate of B noticed this and saw that the dog was basically living in his own waste, and called animal control to file a complaint. At least I think this is what happened, as I only heard second hand from A. I don’t think anything came of it, or maybe the roommate never called it in because B found out their plan to call and stopped them. Either way, the dogs living conditions were, and will most likely be again, horrible. 

When A first took the dog in he was severely underfed, covered in fleas, had a horrible rash all over and was terrified of his kennel/crate. The last two months, A has taught this dog basic commands and house breaking, and the dog is in much better health. 

The problem occurred when A had to give the dog back to B. When we spoke about it, A realized they should not have given the dog back and they messed up there. But as of right now, A has no plan to intervene. There is some bad history between the two and A only took the dog in because B was family. Not too sure of the issues between A and B, but all I know is that I can’t in good conscience do nothing about this. I keep thinking about the poor dog and what it is most likely going through again and I’m so upset and mad that I cried for a good thirty minutes over this while cuddling my own dog. 

What should I do? I don’t want to overstep boundaries since A and I aren’t that close to begin with. I don’t know where B lives, otherwise I would have seriously thought about just breaking in and stealing the dog. Totally illegal but I’m so upset I would probably do it. 
Would animal control even do anything about this? I don’t have any first hand proof, and I’m not sure A will want to throw B under the bus like that since they are family. A also has a history giving too much to B, whether it’s their time, money or even understanding. 

Like I said, I don’t really know who to ask help from, but I don’t think I will stop thinking about this dog until something is done about their situation. 
Any advice will be much appreciated.",05Sep2020,1

316,"Hi everyone, I have a job that has sort of strange hours (I get off at 11 pm most nights). Overall, I really enjoy the job and feel very lucky to have employment right now while so many are unemployed. It isn't perfect, my manager isn't the greatest, but it's something that I like doing and isn't too stressful. 

It took me a long time to find this position, partially due to being on a visa and most employers only hiring citizens, especially during covid. 

Anyway, today my boyfriend told me he wants to quit because the hours are an inconvenience to everyone around me. I do not have a car so he has to pick me up when he's home from work every other week (I can't drive his car as it's manual transmission). He goes to sleep early and 11pm is too late for him. We live in an area that isn't close to reliable public transport. When he's away, I have to either use his family's car which isn't always available, take Uber (expensive), or sometimes stay at work (I work on reception at a hotel and get very cheap rates). When he chose this apartment, it was before I moved in and he didn't account for being close to a train station. 

He doesn't understand how difficult it is for non citizens to find work in this town during covid. The alternative is to quit and have no money. I can start trying to find other jobs while employed but it puts me back to square 1 with transportation. I also fear I'll not enjoy another job as much as this one.

322," I feel really awful. But I honestly don't know how else I could have handled the situation. For some background, I'm currently staying with my parents because of quarantine. We have all been following social distancing guidelines and staying home except for work/groceries, especially because my father is in his eighties with a heart condition. I also have an anxiety disorder and the thought of getting sick during a pandemic terrifies me. New York has some of the highest covid cases in the country, so you can see avoiding the virus has been consuming my thoughts lately.

My aunt randomly called us recently to let us know she was travelling to our city for business purposes and was coming over to our house to visit with her three kids (they're 7, 5, and 3). I panicked when I heard this because, first of all, she had been travelling to multiple cities recently, and secondly, her kids don't wear masks or socially distance so who knows if they're carrying the virus.

I thought it would be rude of me to not let them come to our house when they'd be so tired, so I thought a good idea would be to compromise and let them come but under the condition that they all wear masks and socially distance (like we eat dinner and talk at opposite ends of the living room). I called my aunt and told her these conditions as politely as I could and she became absolutely furious with me. She took it really personally, saying there's no way she had the virus and that it was rude of me to even suggest that she had it. She then said she's not coming to our house anymore. After I hung up she called my mom and started yelling at her, asking how she raised me to be so rude. Some of my other family members got involved and are taking different sides, and now they're all fighting and it's my fault.

I just wanted to keep my family safe, but I messed up. How should I have approached this situation? And how can I fix it?",05Sep2020,1

324,Ok so my parents are divorced. My mom lives in Mexico and my dad in the US. I live with him currently and can’t leave since well COVID. I’ve seen emails from dating sites on his phone and he’s not computer smart so most of his sites are visible. He also is on Ashley Madison for some reason? He’s not married. Also his phone is always on silent so what’s that for? Please send help quick. I will be deleting this post in a matter of days in order of him not finding out of this post. Thx,05Sep2020,1
325,"Before I begin, please tell me if this is the wrong subreddit. Not too sure where to go to be honest. This also needs some context. Apologies if this is rambly, I'm just a bit lost right now. 


Context: A friend made some poor jokes (theoretically writing an erotic fanfic about a minor, specifically a video game character, but [she genuinely looks like a child](https://megamitensei.fandom.com/wiki/Nanako_Dojima)) and when we told him to stop he doubled downed. Instead of backing away and owning up to his actions, he kept darting away from the subject. During this time, I want to clarify he didn't actually write it, however, he *has* written...weird stuff before, so I was completely unsure if he was actually going to do it or not. And while the conversation started off jokingly, it turned serious and we repeatedly told him to stop. But when we confronted him about it, he said “this is a life lesson on how to deal with trolls” or something like that. Note: this was in a personal server. Everyone involved was in our friend group,and we’ve all known each other for years. We’re also teenagers. He’s 16 and I’m 17. I’ve known him since elementary school, and being familiar with his character, I honestly believe he doesn’t fully understand the situation. He doesn't realize the implications of his jokes and why they're wrong. I’m also worried about how when confronted, instead of apologizing he just made excuses. I’ve seen some of this behavior before, but never to this degree.


This really dampened his relationship to me and our other friends. A friend felt so sick she skipped lunch afterwards. I know reddit likes to give up on people but I’ve known him for so long, and we’re his closest friends. I want to help him before anything worse can happen. But I just don’t know how to go about it. I don’t want to force him on the defensive because that would just lead to more double-downing. I honestly think he just doesn’t realize why this shit is wrong. But I don't want to start an argument or anything, that would lead no where. I want him to actually realize the mistake and have some self-reflection. 


But I have no idea what to do. What makes things harder is that this is all over discord (he has strict parents, they don't let him call) so it's not the same thing as an in-person confrontation. I'll take any advice. Thank you if you actually read this wall of text, I appreciate it.",05Sep2020,1

When my grandfather came to live with us het could still mostly take care of himself. The past year he started to slowly stop being able to do things for himself and became entirely dependent on us. He can't dress or bathe himself, feed himself or control his bladder anymore. He wakes up every night at around 3am and refuses to go to bed until 5am. My mom works night-shift as a nurse and it's mainly our job to take care of him and make sure he gets bathed, dressed and fed. It's extremely hard work and tiring, especially since I have online college classes and my sister is still in school. My mom says she doesn't want to put him in a care facility because she feels like she's throwing him away. I don't want to push my mom to do it but my grandfather would be better taken care of in a care facility with professional people that knows how to take care of dementia patients.

334,"This is probably all going to sound really trivial but I just need some advice on getting a grip on my emotions.

My (31f) partner (30m) of 13 years broke up with me last night and, perhaps not surprisingly, I'm a wreck. I don't want to go into the details here but it wasn't a mutual decision, it came a little out of the blue but he'd been acting cold for a couple of weeks so I suspected something was up, although when I asked him previously he just basically put it down to lockdown cabin fever, but now I know there was more to it than that.

For context, I was a trainee teacher last year and our placements ended in March because of COVID, so as much as I've been trying to keep myself busy (I really have, doing online learning, volunteering) I have been home a lot. We were supposed to get married in June but had to postpone. I've got my first teaching job, which I really want to go well, and start teaching for the first time in nearly 6 months on Monday. I was bricking it before all this happened.

The problem I need advice on is, as someone who's always had a problem getting a handle on emotions (not being able to stop crying once I start has always been a massive issue for me since a child) I'm really worried about Monday and teaching my first classes. It has to go well, it will set the tone for the whole year, and I'm terrified that I'm going to fuck it up and burst into tears or something. I feel like by now I should be able to compartmentalise but the way I feel now is so overwhelming and I desperately need to shake it off by Monday and focus, and not come across as a nutcase to my students or my new colleagues.

Any ideas? Thank you in advance.",05Sep2020,1
335,"Im a freshman in college and all my classes were moved online. Im in a Calculus course with 300 students in it and everyone has been having trouble getting into the zoom meetings. Of course we have a discord for everyone in the course if anybody had questions. 

A random kid DMed asking for help to get in the zoom meeting and I went ahead and helped him. Long story short he just introduced himself and found out he lived on campus like I did. I told him that i struggle a bit in Calc and he said if I ever had a question to DM him. I thought it was a nice FRIENDLY gesture. 

We had an upcoming assignment due and he asked if I wanted to meet up. I was having trouble so I told him that it sounds good and told him we could meet at the library cause its a halfway meetup from his place and mine. He suddenly started acting sus and kept persisting to meet up in his dorm so we could hangout afterward to play some video games. I cancelled on him last minute cause I had some plans. 

Me being dumb, we reschedule to meet up the day the assignment was due right outside of his dorm, which I have no idea why I agreed to it. We meet and chat outside for a bit, but it was hot outside and i was carrying around my laptop hurting my back. I was stupid and a few minutes after chatting we decide to go into his dorm. 

Not gonna lie, he was nice and he was nerdy so I thought everything would be fine as long as some of his roomates were there just in case. We set up on his desk and start working on the assignment while chatting casually. 

Suddenly i started noticing some suspicious behavior from him. Everytime i would turn my computer to ask him about a question, he would scoot unnecessarily closer to me and i gave him a hint by obviously scooting away. I had a friendly tone in my voice but by the time I was almost done, i was being monotone and was slightly pissed off. 

I finally noticed at the end that the kid didnt even do his work. I finished up and he wasnt even halfway done. I was fucking praying in my head that I could get my last questions right so I could get the hell outta there. He had his arm around my chair and I made a noise of confusion as he stared at my screen. 

This man suddenly asks me ""does your boyfriend live off campus?"" AND ME BEING A DUMBASS said ""oh no, i dont have time for thay"" Instead of saying ""yeah he does"" and lie so this man could get off my back. I swear on my life he started leaning in as I finished my last question. 

I packed up and told him he didnt need to walk me out and speed walk outta that building. 

Ive been PRAYING this man forgets i exist and doesnt text me again but he's been asking about some hw questions on discord and he can clearly see I've been online. I just... This man pissed me off and I never want to see him again cause all i wanted to do was study. Should I tell him like ""hey im sorry but you made me uncomfortable and Id appreciate it if you stop texting me"" or should I ignore him, block him, make a new account? 

Im just confused and i still dont know shit about Calculus :(",05Sep2020,1

337,"I have a lot going in my head but I don't know if I'm making the right decision. If I quit I will be unemployed, however I am looking for new jobs proactively and returning would cause me to have severe anxiety due to how the company is handling coronavirus precautions. 

I work in retail and before March I had intended on pursuing a career in retail. I was very passionate about continuing to grow in the retail industry until March hit, and the coronavirus pandemic began. My store was closed for months but we had reopened once during the peak of the pandemic (around June). During this time the company and the district team was doing very little to support the safety of the staff. I'll provide some examples, because most stores are doing these things. Stores that I've seen reopen during the pandemic were performing employee symptom checks before shifts, setting a max occupancy and having someone watch the door to enforce masks. I would get major anxiety everyday during my shifts because our store would get so crowded and there would be 65+ people in the store. I had employees asking to leave to the back while they were shaking from how anxious they were. Many of us managers would have to step back from the sales floor because of how much anxiety we were facing. It was very bad and I would come home and just cry sometimes because it took so much out of me. 
It just doesn't even seem worth it to me to stay because I'd only stay for the money but I am financially able to quit my job and revaluate which career path I want to join (other than retail). I'm just not sure if I'm making the right move because I will not put in my two weeks (I will be returning from furlough and would not return). It also doesn't help that I live with at risk parents. 

Am I making the right move?",05Sep2020,1
338,"I live alone in a spacious one-bedroom apartment, and I have this fairly decent dining table in my open plan living room/kitchen area, closer to the kitchen. Fits anything you'd need on it.

BUT. Here's the kicker.

I am starting a part-time degree soon that will take me six years to complete, and since I do everything else at my desk (internet scroll, blog, watch YT, play video games, eating, general procrastination, etc), I am wondering if it's worth buying a purpose-built desk that's only for study?

I'm in the mindset of, if I have somewhere that's only for study, then my brain might go into study-mode when I sit there, and will also mean I don't have to put my study things away between sessions - keeping it 'in sight, and in my mind', but I don't know how reliable that theory is.

I can't decide. I definitely have two spaces in my whole apartment where I could fit one, but I worry it will just be a waste with this large dining table I have.

What would you do? Have you found benefits of having such a space, or do you find that you tend to ignore such spaces in favour of dining tables and such?",05Sep2020,1

340,"Long story short. This boy that I met irl decided to have this really weird online relationship. We live in different states that's why it's online.  He lied to me many times and broke multiple promises. One was he promised to video call me on my birthday. On the night of my birthday I asked what time to call. He replied with no ideal. I gave home some times. He opened the chat and never replied. I must admit this hurt alot because of covid-19 and graduating my birthday wasn't how it was supposed to be. The only thing I was looking forward to make my birthday better was his and I video call. I decided not to do anything until I came back from vacation because the next day we were going on vacation and I didn't want to deal with this while on vacation.

Fast forward to the next day while I'm on vacation. The entire time while I'm on vacation he is actively posting and putting stuff on his story. So I know he's active and he knows I'm active because I'm viewing his stories. This hurts more.vacation ends and I get home and I finally decide to message him asking him what happened. Here's a little side note his mother is very strict with him and he can't do much. He can barely leave the house without his mother controlling him. Things have gone much worse since covid-19.

So I'm at home and him and I are talking about why he didn't video call me on my birthday and ignored me. He says that he his parents are out of town so he decided to throw a party together. He said that something had happened and he made it seem like it was bad but he couldn't tell me about it and he was just stressed. eventually we got back to normal and things are fine. However he keeps referring back to my birthday in the event that had taken place and how he was stressed about it.

Side note. He has a best friend that I've also met in real life. The best friend was recently in a relationship that ended.

days later he confesses that on my birthday the night he was supposed to video chat me he got drunk and made out with his best friend's ex-girlfriend. Things escalated from there. He goes on to tell me that he's always had feelings for this girl. that the reason why hes best friend is even with the girl was because he wanted to be with her but felt like he wasn't good enough and that she was a nice girl. So he thought it was smart to hook her up with his best friend. He proceeds to tell me that throughout their relationship he had to distance himself because his feelings kept coming back up for her. He says he knows he has feelings for her because ""they flirted""and he felt like the flirting was"" love"". He has me promised him not to tell his best friend anything that he was going to tell him. My theory is that he thought the girl and him we're going to have a relationship.weeks go by I message him and ask him if he had told his best friend what had happened. His best friend and I message frequently mostly sending memes.he replies with no because it doesn't even matter cuz him in the girl weren't going to date.

My problem with this situation is he started the best friend and the girl relationship on a lie and rocky foundation.And the days after my birthday while he's actively talking to the girl and saying he loves her he's also telling me he loves me and wanted me to carry his child.I asked him why he thought he loved this girl but turned around and said things to me. His reply was he knew it would turn me on. This infuriates me. Unfortunately I can't say anything to his best friend because I promised him I wouldn't. And the reason why I won't break the promise is because I actually value my word.

Fast forward to now I'm in college and I found out the girls Instagram and she now follows me and I follow her. I told my best friend's roommate about everything. I recently took screenshots of his in our messages when the whole situation went down. It was on Snapchat so he knows I had the screenshots. My best friend roommates thinks I should just send the screenshots to the girl out of the blue just straight-up send them to her. This is because I wouldn't be necessarily breaking the promise I had made between him. But my problem is I really don't want to start all this despite the anger I hold towards him. I also think it's kind of petty to tell her this months after. I'm also not looking to start a war. But then again if I was in their situation I would want to know this.   My advice I need is should I send her the screenshots. Should I even tell her what's going on or leave it alone. Because like I said if I were them I would want to know, but should I ?",05Sep2020,1
341,"Okay where do I start. First of all sorry if my grammar isn’t right. English isn’t my first language. 

I’m studying Computer Science Engineering. 

Now getting to the life, I’ve made many many wrong decisions. Let’s start from choosing the college. After I graduated, I put no efforts in where I wanted to study and what I wanted to study. I was dumb. I just went with the flow and end up going to the college that my grandparents thought was good only because they knew some people from that college. I thought it’s okay I can do this. But guess what, not choosing your favourite subjects for college was the worst decision I made in my life. Nothing has been good ever since. I lost my interest in studies. I failed 1 subject in sem 1, then failed 2 subjects in sem 2 and this went on. Even on the 2nd attempt I couldn’t clear those exams. Now I’m in 7th sem and I’m not fully passed in any of 1-6 arms. I have at least 1 subject in each of them which I haven’t passed. And I have absolutely 0 interest in my subjects which is making it harder for me to concentrate. 
And I haven’t even told my mom and grandparents that I’m failing. They think I’m doing good. 


I wanna drop out so badly but I don’t have courage to tell my mom that. I know my mom will understand all this. But my grandparents won’t. My grandparents are very controlling. They have full control over everything. I can’t even go out and buy myself a pack of chips without them knowing what I’m doing. 
Now I can’t tel them that I wanna drop out because they will be crazy that I made them pay my college fee for 3 years and now I’m letting it go down in drain. They’re very backward minded. They’ll think I wasted my years and money and what not. 
When I got to know that I failed an exam in 1st sem, I wanted to drop out then. But I thought it’s just 1 exam I’ll clear it. And now here I am buried under multiple failed subjects which I’m not interested in and it makes it harder for me to study them. 

Besides this, there’s one of my relatives who works in the same university and he’s been trying to call me and message me. But I hate that guy and how he’s pushing himself into my life. I know he’s trying to help but I just don’t want him to. Everytime I see his name on my phone it ruins my whole day no matter I happy I was earlier. 

All this because I didn’t choose the university where I actually wanted to go. I just went with the flow. I loved the subject Math and I still didn’t pick that one as my major. You f I had I probably would have been happy right now. Much much happier than I am right now.",05Sep2020,1

349," 

recently, I got a new job and then was fired 3 days into it  
my supervisor was supposed to train me

was running late because of a medical appt, was supposed to meet him at a specfic time in the early afternoon  
at one point, he texted me to say that he had arrived home and that he would be calling me and that he would be working with me shortly, i had to wait another 30-40 minutes before he called me  
basically, he called me 1 hour 45 minutes AFTER we were supposed to meet over the phone  
later i brought this up with the higher-up director maybe they weren't happy i was going above him

according to his public profile on google, he has been working for this company for 8 years  
HR called me , and told me that I basically wasn't picking up training quickly enough at the speed they expected me to pick things up  
i've never been explicitly so outrageously terminated in this manner before  
i mean there was a time where i got let off on the 1st day of a previous tutoring job but that was for a more valid reason- I didn't know the material as well as I thought I did  
but this is the first time ever that I've been terminated on outrageous terms  
three months ago, he retweeted a gay porn video on his publically viewable twitter page , also he just comes across as unprofessional, I mean hell to god, why would a company want someone like this to represent them?  
i'm livid  
and thinking of sending to the HR staff who fired me and the director a screenshot of his pornographic retweet  
I might even cc the supervisor himself  
Would this backfire on me, resulting in them suing me? I mean, it's not slander or anything like that, because he actually did retweet that and the screenshot is proof of that, right?

one thing in the back of my mind that i fear is that this supervisor would then try to harm me physically or threaten me with something  
and since the company has my personal info (for example, I had to give to HR my personal documentation i.e. social insurance number for them to verify that I was eligible for employment in the first place),  
would them leaking that to the public even be a potential scenario?",05Sep2020,1
350,"So basically I had made a friend in Minecraft, we used to play together, we used to talk on Hangout and everything was good, but one day I did a suicide joke to her, I had never done something like this before and it was my first time doing this (and it was not really a joke, it was an experiment. I just wanted to see if she cares for me or not?). So I send her some messages on Hangout and pretending that I am doing suicide, and didn't talk to her for 24 hours.

Then after 24 hours, I said I was kidding. She was just mad at me and I can understand that. After that day, she was not the same as before, she was changed. She was asking me why I did that joke to her? I said come to Minecraft with your old acc and I will tell you there (she had created a new acc and I wanted her to meet me in Minecraft with her old acc). She said she will not use her old acc again because she had met a lot of creeps, had bad friendships and was done with that acc. She also said that she had forgot the password of her old acc, but I thought it was just an excuse and I was keep pushing her to use your old acc one last time. I wanted to make things right, but I was only making things worse instead. In the end, she didn't meet me in Minecraft and what she did was unexpected, she created a group in Hangout in which she added her boyfriend and me (she actually wanted her boyfriend to talk to me and tell me to leave her), and then her boyfriend started trash talking and saying toxic things to me, and she was also there reading the chat. They were both making me feel very uncomfortable, never in my life I had feel so defenseless and helpless before. And the worse thing is just listening to them and not saying anything in return, and that's what I was doing.

I was saying sorry to her many times, but it was no use, she was not listening to a single word I say. And the way she was talking, it looked like she had probably made up her mind about breaking up the friendship with me and never talk to me again. Bottom line, her boyfriend told me to leave her, never message her again or they will call the cops. I messaged her one last time ""Bye, take care"" and decided I won't talk to her again.

All those trash talking and toxic things they said to me, it made me go into depression for couple of days. And ever since then this has been such a burden in my mind. Every single day, whenever I go to sleep, I just think about how we used to be friends, how we used to play together, and that have I really caused her that much pain that she had to do all this. So after couple of months, I finally decided to text her again on Hangout, apologize to her again. I wanted to make it up to her but she had blocked me on Hangout so I didn't got the chance.

Now what should I do? Should I still try to find some another way to contact her? Or should I just forget her and move on? Don't you guys think she should give me a second chance and become my friend again? I just don't want her to see me as her enemy and leave me like this. Any other advices, suggestions or opinions, I will be happy to hear. Iam open for discussion. Thank you :)

352,"Should I apologize for causing drama with my father and stepmother during the last few months of my grandpas life? I think about this a lot and it still takes a toll on our relationship today. I’m 21 now and was between 10-17 when this started unfolding. 

So I had a bad relationship with my father and stepmother growing up. I moved out of my moms because my stepfather was abusive when I was around 9 years old. I moved to my dads and things were fine at first, and then it got really bad. 
My stepmother was insanely controlling, strict, and just overall awful. My father always took her side and it caused me to lash out, because my mom was the same way, and I felt like all of my parents were against me. After a while my stepmom became physically and emotionally abusive, they would make fun of my makeup, scream and throw things at me for not giving my little sister a hug before I went to school, I was tackled to the ground for not throwing out the lint from the dryer and wearing a push-up bra when I was like 12, I was homeschooled for 2 years after they had their second child together basically to be a babysitter, and stuff like that. 

We found out my grandpa had cancer around 2015 and we were taking care of him for a couple years, he died Christmas of 2017, which was a few months after the big blowout happened.

Anyways, the night before our big drama causing fight, I found out I was cheated on by my boyfriend. I went on a drive and was out a little later than I should have been, and they were blowing up my phone telling me to come home and shower(because they felt the need to have a schedule set for when I could and couldn’t shower), so I went home and told them I wasn’t showering that night because I wanted to in the morning so I could do my hair a certain way. I was SCREAMED at all night. 

I finally got to go to bed and woke up in the morning to my father pounding on walls, screaming across the house for me to wake up- 3 hours before I normally woke up, and throwing rubber balls at me to wake me up. I was pissed, obviously, and it turned into a huge screaming match and he asked me why I’m this way, and I told him I’ve been dying inside but he doesn’t pay attention to me so he wouldn’t notice, stuff like that. He took my car keys(the car that I bought and paid every bill for), and told me to walk to school. I called a friend to come pick me up because I lived 5 miles from the school, and he got pissed. He told me I wasn’t going to school anymore, called my mother and told her I said I was going to kill myself, called the cops on me, and it was just the worst morning of my life. 
The cops ended up taking me to school, and talked to my school counselor to try and get me some help. I have never lived with them again since that day, and I lived in a group home for a few months before I could move into my friends house. I threatened to press charges for stealing my car that I pay for, they had excuses and it pissed them off. My father and stepmother tried the whole time to force me to move back in, but our state and members of the group house deemed it unsafe. 

My stepmother has been telling me since then that I caused my dad way too much stress during the time his father was dying, and I should’ve just listened and it all could’ve been avoided. She says it’s still something that bothers them to this day and they wish I would just own up to my mistakes and apologize. I however think it was bound to happen, and refuse to apologize. Should I apologize for not listening and adding another thing on to my fathers plate during an already difficult time?",05Sep2020,1

354,"For context, I recently got a good opportunity for my own small hobby where I can sell my stuff and make money. Aka at a craft fair. 

I was congratulated by my friends and family, but I told my friends via a group chat. One friend’s boyfriend then decides to rain on my parade and bring awkwardness into the chat by saying it’s a bad idea to participate and when I explained why I am doing it and how I have already been exposed to Covid, he said it’s backwards ass logic and that I “don’t have to be there because it’s not a necessity”. 

I then replied saying I do need the extra money right now and that it is a necessity and he just didn’t reply back. I wish he had so I could further explain why I’m right and how his comment was irrelevant but whatever. 

No one else really said anything to defend him or stood up for me. I’ve just been super upset about that comment because this is a great opportunity for me and he just has to bring his unwanted negativity into it.

355,"Hello fellow redditors, I got a small problem and I’m looking to get some advice. To give you some context, I have a female friend who I had stopped talking to several years ago due to a falling out we had (my fault). I recently messaged her on Instagram apologizing hoping to clear the air and possibly rekindle the friendship but I haven’t gotten a response. I was wondering, she doesn’t follow me on Instagram nor do I follow her and both of our accounts are set to private so is it possible that she hasn’t seen my DM yet because of the whole message request system? She has over 300 followers so I’d imagine she gets DMs on a regular basis. Would following her perhaps be a better way to reach out rather than a DM request that might get buried underneath spam and scams?

Thanks.",05Sep2020,1
356,"**SUMMARY:**  
So I \[14M\] am a musician who wants to collaborate with another musician \[15F\] but she has an agency (Vivid Management.) How can I get this to happen?

**MORE DETAILS**

So I am a 14 year old musician. I've been playing piano and singing for 10 years. I've also been producing music for about 2 years now. A couple of months ago, I came across this TikToker. She seems pretty cool, but then on her Instagram I saw that she does music as well, which is a quick way to get my respect. She also plays piano and sings, but I can tell (no shade) I do have some more experience (she's mostly self taught but I've always had professional guidance. Her agency mainly reps her for her looks), BUT I really wanna help out a bit because I absolutely love seeing other people my age really into music. Anyway, here's the thing I'm kind of nervous about. She has 280K followers on TikTok and about 250K on Instagram. On the other hand, I have 517 Instagram followers. What they care about how big my following is even though I do have a lot to offer?

We live pretty close to each other too, I live in Houston and she's in San Antonio. Not the closest, but it's close enough. She travels to LA somewhat often too. The age difference is 13 months, which isn't much, especially for this. Based on some quick research, it does seem like her agency takes pride in other things their clients do. I was going to collaborate with this other TikToker and her agency wanted her to strictly do Instagram and TikTok videos (you know, those just normal pics) even though she's really good at guitar. At least I know this agency seems to take pride in their client's other talents.

But anyway, any advice on how to write this email? I know the agency probably reads these emails so it has to be REALLY good. What information should I put in, should I put some videos and links to music I've produced so they know I'm not just talking? I do sort of know one of her friends she talks to, but we've only talked like once or twice. She does know I do music and she likes it, I sang happy birthday for one of her friends on her story because I was bored. But any advice so I can get the best outcome? I think we can both grow from this",05Sep2020,1

358,"I’m 23 years old, and since quarantine started, I started a small art business that’s been doing pretty well so far, I started going to therapy, and I am also taking a 6 month online bootcamp to try to improve my skillset, just in case I lose my job during quarantine, and also because I’m planning on changing my career field. This is on top of my 8-6 remote job.

Basically, I want to use as much time as I can while I’m at home to build my self-growth, find new opportunities (I actually really don’t like my 9-5 job). I don’t think I’ll ever have this opportunity again when I have to go back to work, so I’m really trying to make the most that I can from this time being at home. 

Also, I live so far from my family and I won’t be able to see them at all this entire year, so I’m trying to focus on doing these things to occupy myself. 

However, because of this, I’m usually up at 8am and in bed by 2-3 am daily, constantly working, in class, or studying. 

It’s been really hard to balance out my time, and I really haven’t had the time to go out and actually ~enjoy~ life like what all of my friends are doing right now. This weekend, everyone went out to enjoy the holiday, but I’m currently stressing out because there’s so much I have to do for school.

I also live with my boyfriend and after work, he really doesn’t have anything to do, so he sleeps a lot, so I really don’t have anyone to talk to or relate to. 

I’ve just been feeling super lonely lately. I’m terrified that all of my work and sacrifices aren’t going to be worth it at all, especially since all my friends who are my age are enjoying this time off much more than I am. 

Don’t get me wrong, I love my little art business and I love the bootcamp because it’s in a field I want to be in, but it is a LOT of work &amp; sometimes I don’t know if all of this effort will be worth it in the end.

I guess I’m just looking for any advice for anyone who’s been in my shoes, or words of wisdom.

Thank you!",05Sep2020,1
359,"So I have had some sexual encounters and a few nights ago I had one that didn't go so well. I was with this guy I've been just making out for a few weeks and that night we finally wanted to have sex.

Fast forward a few minutes we are really making out and getting it on and he starts to finger me really hard with no passion whatsoever. So I tell him he should slow down a bit and be more gentle so he does it. Then after he thinks I'm wet enough he bends me over(most guys wanna do that cause they say I have a big ass but idk it's a bit weird) and starts to bang me really hard and starts to slap my ass, pull my hair and choke me a bit and I like that don't get me wrong but I had to go away from him for a few seconds cause it was very unexpected and I didn't tell him that I liked that.

I feel like a girl who isn't into that would be really scared when a guy started doing this out of nothing without even checking with me first if that's okay. This happened a few times already and most of my girl friends have had similiar experiences.

Is there any reason to why this happened or am I just overreacting a bit?

No one has said anything, I'm not doing it for the money unlike my co workers I'm only doing it to help my boss out.  My coworkers actually worker slower now in order to try and drag the overtime on as long as possible.

so I met this person online several months ago we instantly hit it off and became really good friends really quickly. without going into major detail when I say we are good friends I mean we are very close and extremely good friends. basically I love this person so much and I wouldn't want to do anything to ruin our friendship but I don't know if confessing that I have feelings for them would make it awkward or even ruin what we already have. idk I'm just feeling so confused and I want to be closer with them but I feel like such an idiot like I should't say anything but would it just make things worse to just shut down how I feel.

Here's the thing this Gastro won't do much and they forget everything ordering labs, appointments and much more i been on the same medicine for months and nothing i have bad things popping up in my blood results that should not be there and signals signs for certain diesease i need to be tested for these certain diesease such as leukemia and lymphoma or gastric cancer, my gastro claims they're working on it but then they closed and not opening up and my Dr's office just wants to put everything on them and won't run any test because my current dr thinks thats not his job and im being paranoid but he's not the one who has been sick for a year and needs to get back into work and their life back on track. My previous drs before didn't and would not do anything so i switched to this guy and same treatment i been to hospitals and all they do is push me to family dr and specialist and 3 years ago i got sick and it was horrible but i got better but this time i am not getting better and im around people who will not help me correctly in this CITY. So i have 5,000 dollars and my lease is up soon.

363,"My best friend has been messing with this guy for 3 months now. They’ve never even slept together, went on one real date, never even hooked up, hung out maybe 3-4 times and have done nothing but argue and do toxic shit ever since. I’ve given her advice multiple times and she hasn’t once taken it so things between them just keep getting worse. It’s clear he’s not the guy he pretended to be at first and I know her low self-worth is the reason she’s chasing him and allowing him to treat her like dirt (i’ve been there, i get it). But at this point i’m getting tired of hearing the same shit and her not listening to my advice when i’ve literally been through this. she’s crying all the time because of him and it’s becoming triggering for me to see her continue to do the same stupid shit i’ve done before when I didn’t love myself.

It’s getting harder for me to be patient and kind when she tells me things about him. I’m just like HE ISNT INTO YOU and chasing him just to argue is only making it worse. A small example of how unhealthy it is: he literally blocked her number so she snap chatted him and he denied blocking her then said he’d call her and never did (yet again). I’m so sick of listening to it. Am I a bad friend if I ask her to stop telling me things like that when she refuses to do better for herself? I’m starting to feel guilty about how real i’ve been getting with her like I explained that the reason she’s allowing this behavior is due to low self esteem and she’s looking for his validation and approval to justify her worth and it’s toxic. even if she “gets him” she won’t be happy because he’s just not a good person as he’s proven so wtf.

TL;DR: am i wrong to ask my best friend to stop telling me her drama with a boy that’s getting more toxic as she continues to completely disregard my advice and make things worse on herself?",05Sep2020,1

365," 

Please forgive me for any spelling errors im not a english native speaker im going to try to summarize this as best as I can. So basically I have never had my dad around and my mom understandably chose the role of the provider in my life. So I have never had any sort of guidance whatsoever I was never thought how to socialize  how to talk to people put some confidence in me  or nothing. I always spent countless hours home alone since sixth grade because my mom worked all the time and we moved away from any family so  was alone all the time for the past six years no sibling if you couldn’t guess. I was never thought how to have a work ethic although I saw how hard my mother worked to provide so I always knew the importance of hard work in ones life but it was never enforced.  It doesn’t help that I was actually a pretty smart so when school catched up to my speed I had an still have no idea how to apply to my studies. Im 17 now so im sure in a normal parent son relashionship there would be some teaching about sex and stuff but nope never got it likely never will. These missing fundamentals in my life have made me lack experiences like having friends or girlfriends also made me lack confidence an extreme lack in confidence and all of the terrible things i am going thru mentally right  now. 

That is basically telling you how my childhood went but from what ive told you, you might imagine the inmense preasure my mom is putting on me to go to college and I wanna go and want to study  but since I have never been thought anything about life I fell like id be fighting an impossible battle by going. I want to seek out some professional help to help me learn everything I shouldve been thought for the past 17 years. Im definetly not going to want to learn it from my mom I am not comfortable talking to her about it and I know she wont understand she is just going to go on an incoherent rage about how I need to go now somehow like somehow there is no time id rather talk to a trained professional a therapist or phsycologist ill definetly make it happen.  But i want to have face to face sessions not thru the phone witch is how its being done now this will change when covid ends basicaly when i finish the grade i am in not taking into account how much all of therapy is going to take until i am comfortable to moving onto college.  basically its going to take more time that i already have.

Now I want to make clear that im not going to be useless during this time im going to be getting a job while I do all of this and definetly do the best I can to provide for myself. But even if I tell her this she is definetly not gonna agree with me. Even if I have everything planned out.

Please I desperately need advice am I doing the right thing how should I go about this.  

Also if anybody could tell me if I should focus on my grades exclusively and taking the college board once im done with all of this if its an option it would mean the world to me to receive any advice. 

Thank you all.",05Sep2020,1
366,"My (19f) friends (19f) and I grew up in towns near eachother and have ended up at the same university after connecting over a mutual sport. I love them so much, we get along well and have alot of fun together, but I've had continuing issues with them as they don't realise their privilege. 

Our sport is very elitist, you either have to be a legacy kid or really talented to do well. While there is growing efforts to give back and break down these barriers, alot of people in the community forget where they came from as they tend to stick to eachother. 

I come from a lower middle class family. I am not in any way disadvantaged, but I was one of the kids who had to work hard to even be considered in the sport. I went to lower level public schools, and it was really hard to excel without the opportunities that private school connections get you. Also I had to support my family emotionally as my mum had cancer while I was in high school. She's recovered now, but being the rock of my family for so long meant that I didn't get to be a teenager in my last year of high school, and I also tend to be dismissive of my own feelings.

My friends also weren't legacy kids, but they went to private schools that have established training programmes, coaches, facilities, and relationships with selectors. This meant that they were on the national team in our last year of high school. I wasn't considered for selection because I didn't get recognized in the sport until my last year after picks were made. I know that I'm roughly their ability level because we have been picked for the same teams at university, and we were on regional teams together in high school. 

Because it was so hard for me to make it, I'm really passionate about giving kids who faced actual hardship free coaching so they can compete with the legacy kids. But because my friends and I come from the same region we have been doing it together. Little comments like ""oh we can't train then because most kids will travel overseas during the holidays"" just break my heart. That may have been their experience but it's definitely not what these kids will be doing, or anything I experienced. When I draw this to their attention they usually respond with ""my family isn't rich"". But their parents will pay their tournament fees and they've never worried about not being able to afford a tournament in their lives. 

It's really starting to get to me. They don't see the extra hours I have to work to afford tournaments, the stress I face when trialing for a team, or how it's not an option for me to ask my family for money. They've become very dismissive of me because I feel like I have to justify why I can't do things, they make me feel so insecure because I fall short all the time simply because I never got the same opportunities they did. It's definitely not intentional, they're not bad people. 

How do I have a conversation with them about how I feel? They don't realise how different my life is to theirs and make me feel like I'm playing the victim card whenever I bring up how different we are. It's making me so insecure. I'm starting to invalidate my own hardship and beat myself up when my performance isn't at their level. I want to be life long friends but they just don't understand right now.",05Sep2020,1

i am very lonely, because my class is only girls, and they arent the types i wanna even talk to. 
not to be disrespectful, but they never listen to the teacher so yes, they are kinda bitchy.. and drug deal

However, theres another class next to us (were basically split in half) and that classroom is so much better. Theres also 2 other guys in there, and we became friends yesterday.

This might be awkward to talk about, but theres also a girl in that classroom next to us, who hugged me when i visited their classroom and she was smiling a lot at me. 

So we ended up talking, and when i told her my home country, she is also from THERE!! Just a different dialect but its not like its impossible to understand each others, cause we can

so 6 days went by since Monday now. (that was when i met her in that class) and i already have a crush on her

**MY QUESTION**: Should i randomly add her instagram? Cause i found it just by searching her name.. i was just curious.

371,"For context I’m 17 and still in school. my parents own a property out in the middle of the desert that’s fully off the grid that they have planned on moving out to for quite some time now. Today they dropped the bomb that they put in our 30 day notice and that they would be out of here by October. 

I really dislike where we would be moving. It’s been my dads passion to move out there most of his life but for me there’s truly almost nothing, the town has a population of close to 8 thousand that’s all dispersed across a large amount of desert. There’s only a gas station, a farm supply store and a small grocery outlet. 

There’s a huge lack of opportunity out there for me compared to where I am now but I’m not sure if I’m ready to be thrown into adult life when I haven’t even graduated high school. 

I’ve told them how I feel and they are ok with me moving out and understand why I feel the way I do. 

I have a fantastic job here at a restaurant that I would hate to leave behind, I believe that moving would be a major setback in my life but I’m not sure I can afford to move out on my own quite yet. It’s all too much, I’m really not sure what to do.",05Sep2020,1
372,"I have a best friend we were very close precovid. He's very strict In his social distancing and I respected that. We talked quit a bit at first the. Something changed I talked about possibly wanting to go back to school for my masters at the beginning of covid since finding a good job is challenging in California covid lockdown times. He told me not to because I'm already 27 and I just need to find a good steady job. Which I want a good steady job but California is still closed. I've been sending out resumes like crazy and nothing so I'm stuck with minimum wage for now while I keep looking. A few months later he said I was a bad friend. He said he was an empath and I never took him into account when we talked. Which I personally disagree when we talk I don't vent to him about my problems unless asked or told it's okay. I always make sure to ask how things are going on his end too. I always congratulate him on good news and ask him about his personal life and how his family is. I don't like to give unsolicited advice so maybe he thought me just letting him vent wasn't enough. When we talked again last week I didn't get any more details about how I was a bad friend.

I did apologize to him incase he felt I listened but never really heard him because that was never my intention. He said he can forgive me and we can start over from scratch but now I'm unsure if I want to even keep this friendship. Every time I talk to him now I'm scared to say anything whether it's positive or negative. I don't share good news I'm scared he'll think I'm rubbing it in his face or something. I don't want to share any bad news because I don't want to give him a reason to think I'm taking advantage of him because he's an empath. So essentially all I do now is listen to him and what's going on his life. I'm just wondering am I crazy for feeling like the friendship has gotten toxic? I know he's allowed to have the feeling about the friendship too but I feel so belittled and I drained after talking to him now. I constantly feel like I'm walking on broken glass. I want to improve my faults for future friendships and this one if it continues so constructive criticism is welcome. Thank you for your time and advice.",05Sep2020,1

375,"My friend and I flirted nonstop for about 2 months, and she always hinted, and pressured me into asking her out. So I did, and she said yes. 27 fucking hours later we called it off because we had both gotten out of relationships rather recently, and it was way too soon. I was confused because she had been pressuring me into asking her out (don’t worry, I wanted to, I was just shy at the time) and then she suddenly changed her mind. She told me that if her feelings for me did indeed change again and she did start to like me again, she would let me know, so I know I still have a slight chance if I can improve things. We still see each other at school, and formal events that our school holds. I asked her what the reason we broke up for was, and she has given like 5 or so different explanations:

1. Feelings for her ex

2. Too soon for another relationship

3. No emotional connection

4. I’m too shy

5. She always has to start conversations

We are still rather good friends, and we’ve even hung out one on one since we broke up. Now, here’s my problem: she told me a week after we last hung out that she didn’t have fun because she felt like she had to start every conversation. This was because I was in a very tough place mentally after the breakup, and now that I’m back to almost 100% as far as my mental health goes, I’m not shy or nervous whatsoever. Recently she told me that she is still physically attracted to me, so at least I know there’s still some sort of attraction.

The closest I’ve felt to getting her back came two nights ago. Our school held a Dinner Dance for all year 11s (did I mention we’re both seventeen?) anyway, our friend group was on the dance floor, and it was just her, one other friend, and I sitting at our table. She got up, and from her seat and came and sat next to me. I told her I loved her dress, and I could tell it meant a lot to her. She complemented my shirt, and it meant a lot to me. Back and forth like this for a few minutes. I felt like we really connected. During the one class we have together the next day we laughed more than usual, and I felt a connection yet again. But my only issue is that we still don’t talk too much over text, and I’m confused by this. I asked her to hang out sometime soon, and she said ‘do you mind if we don’t it some other time, I’m still a little bit sick’ (which is perfectly understandable, she had the flu) but now I don’t know when to ask her to hang out again, but I feel like when we do, if I show her how I can indeed start conversations instead of just letting her do all the talking, I can get her to fall back in love with me.

Since this girl lost feelings for me, I have been searching for a way to get her to fall back in love with me. I know for a fact that she did indeed love me, and I just need some way to get her back. If you’re going to just tell me to move on, please just don’t reply to this, I’ve heard it before, I’m looking for genuine advice only.

Until we hang out one on one outside of school next, I’m looking for things I can do during school, or over text outside of school hours, to try and change this girl’s feelings for me? I know some smart-ass is going to tell me just to move on, so pease refrain, but I’m just looking for any techniques, or advice in general on how I can get her back

Thank you in advance 🙏 I’m sorry this is such a long and confusing post, I’m just terrible at summarising.",05Sep2020,1
376,"TL;DR: I cannot decide on a major despite spending the past 2.5 semesters ‘exploring’ and I’m running out of time. Doing what’s ‘most practical’ hasn’t worked out for me, but I still don’t know what I ‘truly like’. I feel lost and unsure, and I’m running out of time. 

Hello. I’m a sophomore in college and am enrolled in a liberal arts programme. I’ve taken courses in Economics, Psychology, Political Science, Social Work, Global Studies and Japanese Studies in the time I’ve been here. 

The problem: I’ve been disillusioned by some of the courses I’ve taken. Last semester, I’d declared Economics as my major, but I did not fare too well in my stats class and literally had a nervous breakdown every time I had to work on my Microeconomics assignments. 

My dumb ass decided it’d be a good idea to just suck it up and pursue a minor in Economics instead. After all, I only have to take three more courses to fulfil the minor requirements. Oh boy.

I’ve realised that I thoroughly dislike the Economics modules I am taking this semester. My options now are:

A. Stick through it and work towards a minor in Economics, but potentially harm my GPA and mental health this semester as I struggle through the courses I don’t like
B. Request to drop the Economics courses I’m taking, and trade them in for Linguistics and Political Science courses. The chances that I’ll be allowed into the courses are very slim considering it’s been 5 weeks into the semester.
C. Drop out lol (jk)

The more long-term problem is that I’m also unsure as to whether I will enjoy the major options I have in mind enough to keep at it for the next 3+ years. I believe this is a ‘grass is greener’ situation, compounded by a paradox of choice. I literally wake up every morning thinking of pursuing another major. But I don’t have the luxury of time and it’s hard to really gauge what courses in another major are like through only my peers’ experiences and looking through course materials.

How should I proceed?

For some background - Biology, Linguistics and Social Studies (a mish-mash of History, Politics and Geography) were my favourite subjects in middle and high school. I am currently interning at an PR company in the entertainment field. I’m interested in pursuing entertainment-related PR/marketing, but I really enjoy travelling the world and am open to working in an intergovernmental organisation or think tank.

TIA and have an amazing day ahead. 🥺",05Sep2020,1
377,"Hello, I’m not really sure how to start this, but basically I just need advice on how I can be a better sister and fix the mistakes I’ve made in the past.

I’m 16 and I have a younger brother who’s 9. I consider us to be fairly close, we always have been. We never really used to fight much until maybe sometime late last year/early this year. That’s when we began to fight a lot.

And it’s completely my fault. I used to get mad at him because he would purposefully annoy me or do dumb things to make me upset. I had a hard time controlling my anger (if I’m being completely honest, I didn’t even try) and I would yell at him. Sometimes scream which is terrible. I didn’t realize at the time how damaging this could be to him, but when I did realize, it hit me really hard. 

It finally hit me after this one specific time we fought. I yelled at him for some stupid thing and he got mad at me and said he wants to die because of me and he’s the reason he hates himself. I don’t know if he truly meant that or if it was just something he said because he was angry but it doesn’t matter because it was painful to hear no matter what. This happened back in may I believe. 

I hugged him after that and I apologized for yelling at him. He cried on my shoulder while I comforted him. I cried about it too in my room later that day. I don’t think we’ve fought like that since.

He used to say things like “I want to die” a lot when he was upset and it breaks my heart thinking it could be because of me. What the fuck. I’m his older sister I’m supposed to be taking care of him not hurting him. I seriously wish I could go and take back everything I ever did to hurt him.

I don’t think he hates me or anything like that. I always say goodnight to him every night and give him a hug and tell him I love him and he does the same. He always says he loves me at random times and gives me hugs and all that. 

I just want to be better. We haven’t fought like that in months but it still breaks my heart and I’m so worried that I’ve permanently hurt him or something. I’m scared he’s gonna be depressed growing up because of me. I will never be able to forgive myself if something happens to him because of me or he has problems because of me. I’ve told him that I’m always here for him and he can talk to me whenever he has a problem but he doesn’t really open up to me like that, or to anyone really. He’s not upset often but when he is, he doesn’t like to talk about it.

I think I’m kind of rambling now, but basically I just want advice on how I can be better. I need to be better. I never want to hurt him again. I want him to see me as a good big sister who he can trust and find comfort in. If anyone has any advice for me, I’d greatly appreciate it. Thank you in advance ❤️",05Sep2020,1
378,"i’ve been dealing with this nauseous feeling on and off from as far back as july, i’ve seen GP who prescribed me omeprazole and before that i was trying paracetamol/peptobismol. i finished the omeprazole by mid end of july and the feeling was subsiding as i was getting blood tests at hospital to try and narrow down where it was coming from. the tests all came back fine, blood pressure was low, i came to realisation on own that the nausea may be more due to anxiety. i’ve tried meditation and GP actually suggested starting antidepressants (citalopram) which i’m on day fifth of now, and that nausea has come back to point i can’t look at food without gagging. i was just wondering if anyone has some tips on how to make sure the food stays down or ways to stop feeling it? i used to know a few tricks when i’ve dealt with travel sickness before, though this nausea just isn’t shifting and it makes it hard to sleep.",05Sep2020,1
379,"I was high as fuck at the time and had like 2-3 grams of really good hash on me. my friend and i went to a store to buy some drinks, but on the way in we saw these 3-4 dudes on their motorcycles, they looked at us while we were on our way in. On our way out one one of them said ""yo can i talk to you"" i walked in the same direction but slowed down to hear what he had to say, we went aroud the corner and he said that he could buy the hash i had for 50 bucks. Im not a seller but i got the dumbest idea like alright that sounds good, he wanted to smell the stuff and i gave it to him and that is legit the dumbest thing i ever have done in my entire life i think, so he said alright imma buy it looks good then he put it in his pocket and started walking to his gang. I walked after just realizing what a dumbass i am but i thought hey i know this guy he wont rip me off, and then suddenly he just said wait here and hopped on a motorcycle and went away with his friends. Me just realizing what had happened followed after the direction they went and after like 10 minutes i found them, shouted """"hey where is my money man!"""" he just looked away and hoped on the motorcycle and hit the road, my friend didnt intervene since he doesnt want to fight anyone but i tried looking for them but didnt find them. I know who the guys are they are 2 years older than me, so here is the question, what should i do? I could go talk to him but that wont work since i added him on snapchat and told him to give me my money or my stuff back but he just laughed, another option is i go and fight him which im gonna likely loose since he is bigger and stronger than me snd im not gonna just sit like a bitch and act like nothing happened. But the thing is there is a chance that i could get jumped by him and his friends afterwards or right there and then, i know 2-3 grams isnt much but its not about the money or the hash, i just feel really embarrased, another option is that i rob him back with one or two of my friends but he is never alone. Btw these guys are known to be rats and they have a lot of friends that are alike, so i dont really wanna die or get a knife scar just because of some hash but i really dont know thats why im asking you reddit. Btw he knew that i had the hash since one of his friends tried my stuff a day earlier, and he said he would pay me back and my bestfriend told me that i can trust him but now i know i cant, one of the reasons why i was so dumb and handed it over.",05Sep2020,1

For two years we've gotten along well, with occasional bumps that I just buried when my sister-in-law would get very bossy. I realize that that friction is not just her controlling nature, but my ego, so I would usually shove those emotions down and ignore it.

A couple weeks ago, she did something small but similar.

She took offense, and instead of understanding my feelings, gave me a reason for each rule she had for me. All of which had reasons, and all of which I understand is my duty to acquiesce to, since it's not my house.

I decided she wasn't going to understand what I was trying to say and I just dropped it after that. Things still haven't been the same since. I don't joke around or interact with her like I used to.

And just this morning, it happened again. I walk past my niece, who is working on schoolwork upstairs. She says hello, so I say hello back, but I leave it at that since I know she's not to be disturbed when she's doing schoolwork. On my way down, I hear my sister-in-law law yelling up to me that I shouldn't be talking to her. That she's doing schoolwork. I told her I was just answering her hello. My sister-in-law answers with ""I know.""

I haven't brought it up again. I don't think she understands how this ubiquitous, unnecessary bossing is grating. She just sees it as being right. But it's micromanaging, and shows a lack of trust and respect for my personal agency and judgement.

396,"Here is the pre history:

My mother (20) and my father (24) have married. My mother didn't want to marry my father at that time since she wanted to build her career but my father wanted to marry her and his parents promised to buy a house if she marries him. Well, surprise suprise my mother married into family of goldiggers that raised my father to be an alcoholic so he can do the bidding for my grandmother and my aunt.

They married before the iron curtain has fallen so there wasn't a prenuptial agreement.

I don't know why my mother stayed with him and didn't divorce him. Maybe she believed that he was serious about creating family and he could change. In anyway she put up with it for 10 more years and then I was born. 

When I was little I didn't understand  why my father sometimes come home acting weird and my mother screaming at him. At first I pitied him when my mother kicked him out and I worried about his safety and why my mother hates his family. Now I've became more numb to it.

Although I remember getting a long with my cousins from my father's when we were little but now when we grew up we just distanced from each other and now we just feel awkward being in the same room. 

Some days he would act as the the breadwinner of the family and not drink. But when he drinks the he goes all out ending getting his money stolen or spending his whole paycheck, losing expensive phone, sleeping outside who knows where, getting arrested by the police.

When I was 15 years old my mother decided to divorce him, but it's was hard to divorce him since my mother owns properties and my father is automatically is entitled to half of her assets. Luckily some of her assets where in my grandmother's name. They both got lawyers and well had intense discussions. Also since my grandmother from father side is greedy she  didn't register him in any of her  property and that makes him basically homeless and automatically entitled to my mother's assets no matter what. I preferred that my parents would divorce and didn't care if I would have to struggle financially after that and I didn't care if my father becomes a homeless person (like I said I've just became numb to that) but at least my mother would be happier. But they didn't divorce in the end since my father saw how he is useless to us and his relatives promised to change.

But you know he went to the clinic to get 'vaccine from alcoholism' ( idk how to call this in English lol and it's just easier to call it that way) that can make you sick or even die if you drink alcohol and  that vaccine expires 2 years. So he started again and then got vaccinated again.

Meanwhile my mother was a breadwinner at first but dealing with this marriage took a toll in her health and so she has to rely on my father. Her sleeping artery is 4 times smaller than normal and she would have to avoid air conditioners (she is cashier and ever supermarket has air conditioner) she is entitled to get payment for that disability but even though our Healthcare is free but doctors are corrupted by the government and doctors refuse to write her a true diagnosis ( one doctor just told her about diagnosis and said what to avoid but didn't write her true diagnosis). Right my mother 'works' in the shell company where is own my the foreigners and requires citizens to work there. She doesn't have to work but the owners of the company pay for her pension so that way when my mother retire she can get a retirement pay.

My mother not only had to deal with my father but she took care of me when I had to go through surgeries as a child she also made sure that I didn't lack anything. That is why respect my mother more than my father. 

Now I'm 21F as college student I just worried about my mother's health while my father just like recklessly drink once in a while. I'm just afraid that I would my mother first than my father and I would have to deal with battle of inheritance and I'm simply feeling anxious and sometimes even hopeless.

399," I feel like I just turned 25, but shortly I’ll be turning 26. It’s a crazy feeling. I barely had time to accept the idea of turning 25. I feel like I was JUST in high school.  Each year seems to fly by quicker. 

I know time is really a constant and age is just a number, but I can’t help but classify my life by ages and what I did that year. That’s how I remember life events. My whole early life was jam packed with sports events/accomplishments, seeing friends regularly and awesome trips so I guess it’s a stage of life thing (a lot of my friends moved away and obviously sports are over).

I’m doing all the things I wanted to be doing at this age. I’m very grateful and happy with my life. I was very content with this year, but looking back I think, what did I even do this year?

402,So a group of friends decided they wanted to go on a lil get away trip this weekend since it’s labor day on Monday and a long weekend... I decided to go with them since it sounded like a good idea at first when they talked about camping...but somehow i ended up being asked to book a hotel for us to stay in and well i tried looking for a spot but being that it was last minute I found a spot that ended up being $400+ I tried to convince them into us camping but they prefer a hotel.... and didn’t seem to mind the price but again no one spoke about how we were going to pay for it and I felt dumb asking them. anyways now it’s booked with a first night cancellation fee if we decide to cancel and idk how to go about how we should split it I don’t have much money to spend like that and it’s too late to back out... Helpppp shoud I just wait until we get there and see what they say or should i bring it up on the ride up? How should i bring it up ?

If i feel something i just brush it off a few times and then one day i just feel like not talking to them ever, i have broken a few friendships in the past and i feel like it’s very easy for me to break friendships even though i don’t have many friends.

408,"Hey guys, this is probably my first reddit post - the responses I’ve read to a few posts are very encouraging and genuine.

I’m 27F and who is very awkward and shy, neurotic... needs alcohol to gain confidence. I will try my absolute best for those I love and care for.

I was in my first relationship at 18 y/o until 25 years old. She left me for a colleague who she cheated on me with. It’s been a tough two years.

I (end of 2019) became very close with my work colleague. We had our regular day per week where we would have dinner and drinks and go back to my house and have a make out session. We definitely have a strong connection. Mentally and definitely physically. I fell for her, hard. This lasted for 5-6 months which ended in March due to having to work from home. This individual had a fiancé who she was with for about a year. I had become “that” person who ruins relationships. I’d be breaking someone’s heart just like how mine was. I’ve met him, and he’s been so lovely to me, even asked me to start staying over. She told me she loved me. I became hopeful. She constantly sent me erotic images of herself, especially on Valentine’s Day. The most we’ve gone is kissing. Doesn’t make it any less better, I know. Since working from home, she does not communicate with me anymore, unless for work purposes as we have mutual clients.

I’m left here feeling angry, sad, angry at myself, regret, depressed, anxious, and because I have severe attachment issues and ocd, I obsess, and ruminate over negative thoughts that I create in my head.

I would appreciate any advice to help me cope with having my heart broken for the second time now - and just how to go about getting by each and every day. I’m obsessing over her and why things ended. I’m confused but I’m not. Confused because she didn’t say a word about “no more communication outside of work” or let even me know. Not confused because she has regret and guilt and is focusing on her own relationship.

I’m rambling - just had a joint so I’m starting to take it real easy. Any advice and tips please. I’m not perfect, we all make mistakes. The connection between us was super real and intense. She’s told me things that not even her fiancé knows. The attraction is both mentally and definitely physically. I’m just lost and don’t know what to do.

Appreciate it,

Cheers!",05Sep2020,1

And how it would make me feel later down the line . ) And the reason why she cheated on her with me is because her girlfriend at the time was cheating, lying on her. And a week or two went by and she broke up with her . So I was feeling very very intituled like ima treat her right like all of this nonsense so fast forward to a couple months I would say about 6 months and we were doing will I would say very good we never had an argument we related on so many things it i could go on forever I definitely thought that we were soulmates we just really vibes with each other and didn't care about any insecuritys we spoke are mind we were mad funny it just amazing then she started to act weird not answer my text messages till like 7 plus hours later and then I would see shes on social media and I would cry ball my eyes out was littlery on the floor crying because she had such an impact on me because even though we vibes I had a lot going on when I met her me an dmy mother was homeless and my mom was making these dumb financle discussions I was severely deppresed she really helped me with everything going on I really laid it all out on the table for her and when ever she had a problem I would do the same for her didn't care what the problem was I was always going to help. But back to what I was saying like 3 days went on I was like what going on something happening and she would say no and then she just said she "" wanted to do her own thing "" boyyy let me tell you I cried for a week then I texted her like I miss you so on and she responded saying she was sorry how things left off and we would talk  for a bit then she would just like ghost me... for months until I texted back and that would continue for like another year and though out this year this had me with more depression wanting to end it wanted to change my body maybe if I just have s\*x with her she will just like me more? Like I was all over the place and recently I would say about 3 months ago I texted her again literally typed out 10 long-as\* essays about my feelings and what the break up did to me ... and she apologized and everything we talked more then we did the other times and I  wrote her a  letter bought her 40$ worth of stuff food clothes all the above.. and then she ghosted me again... And it wasn't like she was a jackass about it like she seemed like she really cared and stuff.

411,"Hi everyone, first time posting something so please be easy on me. Sorry for my english in advance. 

It takes a while to get to the main point, but stay with me. I'm still a student, and there's this paper which my school hands out every beginning of every school year to collect contact information from all parents. Both parents have to sign the paper to make sure their signatures are really theirs when it's needed. My father is on a business trip and he can't return before deadline, so my mother asked me to give her his signature so she could fake it (I know its wrong, fyi she didn't do it). While we (me and my mom) were hesitating (for known reasons), she realized I put ""tailor"" in her career's blank instead of ""lawyer"". After that was a disaster. She was crying, call me ungrateful and I had to go back to my room.

At first I didn't think I was wrong. My mom has a license which allows her to works as a lawyer, but in the recent years tailor is how she has made a living. So tailor is fine, right? After that, my father called, explained that career and your current job is different, she spent many years studying law but due to personal circumstances she couldn't stay long in the industry. Meanwhile, my mother busted into my room, called me stupid because I didn't know the protection that job title may have on my sister since she was mistreated sometimes  (which I thought was totally unrelated to my situation). My dad ended the call by telling I'm wrong and I should talk to her.

I admit I am wrong. However, I don't think I deserve the blaming and rage. Can you give me some insights to my problems and recommend what I should do?",05Sep2020,1

413,"Sorry for formatting and grammar.

Recently some of my friends and I watched this one anime together. This anime has a character in it that my best friend is obsessed with with currently. While watching the anime a character that I really enjoyed was killed by the character they like. I was a little bit hurt over this not going to lie, I shed a tear. My best friend decides that instead of comforting me or just being quiet they’re going to talk about how great their character is. I wasn’t too mad at this just a little bit annoyed and if it stopped at that I would be okay.

Mind you making fun of the deaths of characters people like is not something we normally do, especially right after it happens.

After we finished the anime, they sent memes of the character dying not even a day after. I expressed that I was actually a little bit sad about the character dying and would prefer if they didn’t do that. They didn’t stop. They sent me more and when I told them to stop they acted like they never sent them. 

Now about this anime character they like, I would make fun of this character just to joke around with my friends. I asked my best friend if they were okay with it many times and they never had an issue. So that was kind of our dynamic, mind you this character doesn’t die. 

I’m in the group chat with some friends and my best friend send a picture of the character and I thumbs down it as a joke. They then proceeded to kick me out of the group chat. I thought it was a joke at first but then I DMed asking about it because they didn’t add me back. They told me that they wanted to be able to talk about the character without getting reactions like that. I told them they could just ignore since I’m the one looking at the character and they disagreed and were not joking. I then told them about what they did to me and how I had voiced that I didn’t like it, but they still continued. They apologized which I accepted, but it just feels like they get more and more attached to this character. I can’t even joke about it anymore with them. I did something I always do and I just wasn’t expecting such a reaction. I respected their decision and have stopped talking about the character. It’s just weird to me that they couldn’t do the same when I voiced discomfort.

I’m probably being dramatic, but it truly feels like this situation has drifted us apart and I have no idea what to do about it. I don’t want to lose them because they’re my best friend. Is there something I could do to ease the tension? Am I in the wrong?",05Sep2020,1

do i wait until he matches w me on coffee meets bagel but i have a feeling that may never happen maybe bc of the app’s algorithm? 

should i follow &amp; slide into his dm’s? if so, what the hell do i even say? (bc keep in mind i saw him from coffee meets bagel and his name isn’t shown so how i found him can definitely come across as creepy af)

The party is in London and I had a lot of fun last time - I also get the added bonus that I get to see my boyfriend for a couple of days, but he works during the week so I won't have anything to do after Sunday and will probably head home after that unless I'm willing to wait until he has his day off on Wednesday. The party is at one of my uni flatmates next year's big ass family house, and the other people attending would be my friends from uni and other mutual friends we have. I'm currently in my uni city and am waiting for everyone to move in properly in the next few weeks.

My main concern is that the cost of the train tickets into London, my transport around London and the money I'd spend on drinks and eating out will outweigh the enjoyment I get from it. There's also the added problem of feeling pretty shit after a night out (not sleeping until 6:30am) and having a hangover which comes with these sort of events.

427,"Hey Reddit, I need some help with something going on in my social life. TL;DR at the bottom.

I have a pretty close friend, let’s call him (B). A while ago, (B) met a guy and long story short they got together. Let’s call him (V). I want to keep this short so I’m going to get right to it, (V) is turning (B) into an incel without the whole “Blackpill, I hate women, genetic defeatism” part, rather just the whole alt-right part. It’d be easier just to say (V) is making (B) alt-right, but there’s a bit more and a bit less to it than that.

(V) is toxic people who think of themselves as enlightened because he just makes everyone's day worse. Like someone from /b/ on 4chan except he's actually just a bad person, not a shitposter. I have issues with him as a person but that's not what this is about. The issue is what he's doing to (B). You see, (V) is an extremely toxic and awful person, but he's also very very alt-right politically charged, and slowly but surely, (B) is resembling that too.

(B) has started to be alt-right ish too, posting things/memes against blacks and LGBT (specifically trans) rights. Funny how (V) does the same thing. In his server, (B) made a /pol/ (politically incorrect) channel and uses it to post the aforementioned alt-right bs. He used to be so great and nice n' stuff and was always level headed and now he's turning into this thing, this awful persona which his toxic bf molded him into, and it kills me inside to watch and do nothing because everything that anyone has tried to do in the past has only resulted in (B) moving closer to (V) and just becoming worse and worse.

(V) is a bad person, as I've said before, and the advice I've gotten before is to cut off (B), but I just can't do that. (B) is close to me, well kinda not so much anymore as all the racism and transphobia has kinda distanced me, but I just can't let go and never have been able to. All of this is (V) fault, not that (B) would ever listen, and that's not me pointing fingers, this is actually him. It really kills me to see (B) become this monster and not being able to do anything about it because if I do he just won't listen and maybe he'll cut me off; it’d only make things worse. Honestly, I think whether I do something or not, things are only going to get worse. I need advice.

This happened yesterday. I was taking a bus to somewhere far away. It was a long journey (more than 1h), so I got a seat near the back door. The seat is just a normal seat, not a priority/reserved seat. 

During the journey, I was zoning out and listening to music, minding my own business. At a particular bus stop, a lot of people boarded the bus. An elderly woman sat down beside me. I thought nothing of it and continued the journey. Meanwhile, she was talking to her daughter who was standing beside her but I did not take notice of what they were talking about, but I did notice that they were talking louder and louder. 

After about 20 minutes, they alighted. I was preparing to alight so I turned off my music for a while, just in time to see her pointing at me and calling me a handicap and someone without conscience for taking up the seat. The both of them kept gesturing at me from outside the bus, and the daughter even took a photo of me. I had no idea what was going on up till that moment, and I realised that they might have been scolding me for the past 20 minutes on the bus. Immediately felt horrified and very ashamed. 

I have no idea what to do now. What should I do if my photo or a video appears online? Even if nothing turns up online, I still felt very shamed and embarrassed. How do I cope with this feeling?

434,"I’m writing this on a throwaway for personal reasons. Sorry for any mistakes in grammar. 

 I’m a 16 F and even though I’m young I’ve had my fair share of hard heartbreaks. I gave all of myself to my ex and now I can’t even get him to text me back. We would often go months without talking to each other and I would get over it just for him to come back and hurt me again. Guess he only wanted one thing. eventually I got over it. I was broken for awhile and it gave me some horrible trust issues and killed my self worth. Somewhere in my mind I started settling for less because I felt like it was all I could get. I became more desperate for attention and some thing that I could hold onto that was meaningful. I felt like there was something wrong with me and not him. I felt bad for making him want to leave me even though it wasn’t my fault. We officially stop talking now but the state that he left me in didn’t change.

Now the person that I was talking to as of late i’m debating cutting off for good. This left me thinking that something is wrong with me as a person. I felt like it was my fault again.  even though we haven’t been talking for long I have a habit of catching feelings and not being able to let go. Nonetheless I woke up today and he was on the phone with this girl. I got kinda jealous and we started talking about it. He called me just a friend and he basically admitted that if things didn’t work out between us he was just gonna go with her. Basically had plans of being with her already. I think he was doing the same stuff with her that he was with me. So much for thinking that I was special. 

Even though it wasn’t the longest time that we spent together I really did think that we had something. I gave him my time, my effort, my attention, I let him know personal things about me, sent him and did whatever he asked for, told him about my past and my feelings. I was completely open and honest. Now for the record he doesn’t live in the same state as me and I was even willing to except the distance even though it kind of hurt he was so far. I know it sounds dumb but I was falling so hard. we spent hours on the phone together Almost every day (7 to 10h at a time), he told me he loved me and genuinely cared about me and I believed him. I felt the same way.

We had talked about being in an actual committed relationship with each other but something didn’t feel right. maybe it was my gut feeling talking but some part of me felt like he was a stranger. We had that topic of conversation a few times but every time I would say I wanted to get to know him more or not yet. At the end of every conversation I thought we had a mutual agreement that we would both wait. The title would come soon enough right? We basically were in a relationship but just didn’t have the title. I never thought that it would be such a big deal. We basically were damn near dating. I thought his feelings were genuine but now I feel used and stupid all over again. Like a clown. 

He told me that if things don’t work out between us he would go with her anyway. They had already been talking for a little bit by that point. I asked if they did anything together and he said not yet but it would probably happen. Even though he offered to leave her it was kind of too late. Part of me never wants to talk to him again but I still really do care about him. I just thought our feelings were mutual And they obviously weren’t. 

So far I told him that I just want complete space and I hope that he was happy with her. His exact words were “thank you ig”. Now i’m alone again and I feel like a absolute loser and kind of a failure. I feel betrayed, lost, sad, angry in a sense. All I wanted to do was make him happy but now I’m left feeling like I couldn’t even do that right. I feel kind of worthless. I’m tired of getting attached to someone and then being completely dropped off the planet. 

It’s hard seeing the few friends that I have all in long happy relationships but I can’t seem to keep anyone’s attention. I’m always left feeling like I didn’t communicate right or I didn’t do something. It always ends up being my fault and they just move on like I didn’t exist or matter. Now I’m broken, Emotionally spent and left to start over picking up what little feelings I have left. 

At this point any help or advice would be appreciated. I don’t really know what else to say but if you made it this far thank you for listening.",05Sep2020,1

437," I am a 17yr old male in high school. And every since freshman year when my parents found out I was gay they have not mentioned anything relating me being gay, any girlfriend references, girls, dating, or anything relating to ""that side of me"".

Now you might be asking how did they find out? Did you not tell them? No, I did not. The whole thing was a stupid high school freshman who got caught doing something really dumb, and as a repercussions, my parents went through my entire phone. At the time(2017) I was very adventurous and just exploring this community so I was very into gay community related topics, big deal (ex. makeup and fashion oriented.) I also got very aquatent to  a highschool senior who was on the same team as me. As we became very good friends we talked more about ourself and found out we had very similar situations. Both our parents were  very religious and against same-sex anything, and we both were gay. And one thing led to another. We hooked up once, with no intention to do it again. 

So before my parents found this all on my phone, I told them I was gay. And then they went though my phone. I understand their world went from black &amp; white to 4K HDR content - from a perfect son to a stupid high school gay kid who acted on it. I get it, must felt like going from 0 to 1 million/mph. But I don't feel their response to any of this is anyway justifiable.

After my punishment (6 months of no phone in room, dad doing daily phone searches, no technology in room, no friends, never leaving the house other than school and community service) for my stupid thing ended, so did anything mention of me being gay.

Move forward to 2020, my mom told my aunt and I told my cousin, so that side of the family knows and doesn't give two shits. Anyway, she (my aunt) told me that she doesn't like the way my mom handled this situation. And offered me a place to stay if thing get to rough at my house -- it was very rough during those 6 months of punishments... Almost got sent to military school. Anyway, my sister (23 college grad) feels I need to talk to them. Which I feel like I've said what needed to be said,"" I am gay."" But, she feel I need to reach out, but:
A) I do not have the courage to do that right now
B) I would not jeopardkze my final year of school, and college fund if I make any waves in this calm sea 
C) I really don't feel like it's my responsibility to have to do anything. As a parent, you make that vow of, no matter who my kid turns out to be I will him/her regardless. Hard to feel loved when they don't even know the real you.

With all this said. I am growing very tired of this constant part of myself that I have closed down / shutdown because it would only bring disruption, pain, and chaos. But I also don't want to jeopardize my living situation and freedoms.

Any help is greatly appreciated. I am so tired of this and don't know how much longer I can do this.",05Sep2020,1
438,"My family(we're indian) (mom(F40), dad(M40), brother(M15)) and I (F18) are moving away from our joint family home (dad's mom(F70), dad's brother(M45), dad's brother's wife(F45), dad's brother's sons(M21) and(M17)) to a farmhouse and live on our own.

My mom is full time working + full time housewife, my dad is full time working. My brother is in school, I have distance learning college. Aunt is full time housewife, uncle is full time working, 2 cousins are regular college go-ers. Most of grandma's responsibility falls on my mom's shoulders because aunt doesn't do it and my mom won't not do it.

My mom has never been appreciated by my dad's family much. My aunt is a conniving leech. She finds opportunities to get her way even if it means others would have to go out of their ways to please her. My mom is the opposite. She is a very religious, very non - confrontational person, she goes out of her way to please others even if it means discomfort to herself and even her immediate family -- something she knows very well. But that's how it works in Indian culture, the youngers must listen to their elders and give them utmost respect(my parents are 5 years younger than my aunt and uncle).

Mom has never liked having animals inside your house. Specially dogs. In our culture, dogs are considered dirty. I have always wanted a dog all my life and due to my mother's dislike, this never happened. About 8 months ago, my aunt got a little puppy. My mom wasn't happy about it but never showed so to my aunt, but aunt knew. I fell in love with the dog at first sight. Over the past few months, I've been his main trainer. I've potty trained him, taught him basic and advanced tricks. He's a pretty good dog.My aunt or her immediate family, even though brought the dog, haven't since shown much attention to it. They hit him, don't play with him, with so much pent up energy - he gets a little nippy, again he is yelled at and hit by aunt and my cousins, don't take him out on walks and hit him when he pees inside. 

Recently, I've noticed that my aunt has completely stopped giving attention to him. She goes out and leaves him with me (unpaid dog keeper here, because that's respect). My mom doesn't like this. She knows that my aunt is dropping her responsibilities on me. I'm the one who feeds him. I'm the one who takes him on walks, everything.Now, I love this dog. I've always loved him. He's a really good boy. I love doing these things for him, not for the fact that I'm helping aunt but because I love him so much. 

The issue is my immediate family and I are moving away soon. I'm scared about him. I'm scared about leaving him with these people. I'm scared for his health, for the lack of love he'll receive. It's like leaving behind a piece of me. He's like a son to me. I'm extremely attached to him. How do I cope knowing that he won't be treated right and would probably be thrown into the streets after I leave? It burns my heart to know that I won't be able to stop it. My father recommend to me that I should try to distance myself from him so that he wouldn't be so hurt when I leave. It hurts me so much when he barks at my door to let him in and I choose not to. How do I cope?

440,"So recently due to Corona my (24F) older brother (29M) has lost his job due to Corona and moved back to my parents house.

Growing up in a poor immigrant family, him being the oldest always meant he got all the pressure of succeeding from my parents. It had always been difficult at home, which happened to also be a restaurant he and me both had to start working in from a young age (12). Our mother was abusive towards us, physically and mentally, though especially to my brother, because they had all hopes set on him. I took pity on him from a young age, because I was always able to do well in school which made his failures seem worse. That's why I kinda became a counselor to the both of them whenever they had a fight (which was almost daily), putting me in a sort of parent role.

During our younger years there was a short period of time where he molested me. He was around 15 and me 10. It was definitely inappropriate but looking backwards on it, and with having had a ton of therapy, I see that it really was because he needed to feel safe somewhat. He had never felt safe because of how my mother treated him. Because of this, as soon as I left the house for my studies, I broke off all contact with him and made sure I would never have to return. I can see him as a 'brother' from far away, but as soon as I get near him I don't feel safe at all. This is after he had admitted and apologized for what happened, which I kinda accepted at face value but not in my heart. The last thing I told him was that the best thing for him to do was to move out of the house and the toxic environment. He did after a while, but haven't spoken with him since (which is like 7 years already).

So now in 2020 I'm living the good life with my BF. Then I hear from my mom he is back home again with my parents and, even though my mother has changed for the better because they sold the restaurant and she isn't miserable anymore, I hear from her that they might be falling into their unhealthy habits again. Now I feel bad for my brother that he is pretty much in his self-defeating spiral again and I somewhere feel guilty that I don't want to help him and that my grudge that I still hold towards him may also be part of his inability to have confidence/self-love and make something of his life. But also I never want to see his face again for what he did to me, even though he apologized.

I do feel bad for my parents that they now have him back even though they are 55 and 67. I really don't look forward to when one of my parents bites the dust, because I would have to probably see him on their funeral. It's just insane that he is still being such a burden on them...

I just wish we weren't family at all.",05Sep2020,1
441,"I have recently been having deep thoughts thinking about future but I've always been thinking about it differently. I don't want to have a job that I sell myself for 40 years to just to find that when I retire I can't do the thing I always wanted to.

I always see my dad as what I don't want to end up being in the future. Selling his life to a company to make money that he won't be able to use because of complications of age. He's stuck in a financial situation were he can't change job but hates every second of it just waiting for the time to pass, always tired but can't do anything to stop it.

There were always teacher who came in and said don't go to University and do this instead. I always thought it was a dumb that they were telling us not to go to University, as university gets you the good jobs. Even though I still don't agree with them, as they usually just proposed other ways to get further education, it still made me think, why should I want a job for 40 years, doing the same thing, watching the years flash by.

It's always a common saying ""time speeds up as you grow older"" but time never speeds up. It's just that you're never doing anything new. Not fulfilling the dreams but just living for the sake of living. I want to live with purpose, to help future generations, to be remembered. But the system is so against this that if you want to break the mold you risk losing shelter and other basic survival needs.

I'm 14 and all this makes me feel pretty concerned for my future, as I want to have a job with time off to enjoy life and do everything that I want to do, or want to see. I'm at the stage were I feel it's not to late to plan things differently, break the mold and still be happy with what I have. Is there any way I can survive with a job but still be able to do other things, so I can be happy.

I’m 23 and currently hired as an intern at an oil and gas company. I’m paid a lot compared to other interns and doing good with my work. However, having zero domain knowledge on oil and gas and coming from purely Mathematical background i just feel like I don’t belong to the company.  I’m being introduced to other people in the organisation and was initially assigned with menial task but later I got assigned with much more meaningful projects. 

I don’t know what are the chances of me getting hired or do i want to be hired as i feel like I’m being excluded sometimes during social meetings(ie lunch or meetings). I’ve applied for masters for next year jan and my internship overlaps with my admission (should i tell my manager abt this asap?). The company that i currently intern pays well for permanent position and it’s everyone’s dream to get employed. However i feel overwhelmed with my manager.
I don’t want to throw away this opportunity away. There’s another intern but he will be doing his phd and does not seek for employment. 

There’s an open position for a research contract position next year February(after my internship) at my university that I’m going to do masters which pays a lot better than my internship but theres chances i might not get employed as i have a “history” with the PI (principal investigator).

My question is, should I seek for employment and do part time masters or should I pursue my masters full time and apply for the research contract?

When covid hit I was temporarily laid off, and when I came back was told it would be made worth my while to come back, yet I’m making less now than I was before... I ended up having a major breakdown earlier this week because of it all, and with the advice and support of my girlfriend we decided I should leave.

So he has this friend who’s gf likes to kiss other girls, and he said he didn’t like that and basically set a boundary and I kissed his friends gf on Valentine’s Day, we were at a rave and I jjst did it and he was upset, then I kissed another girl at a concert, I came home and told him what I had done and was full of remorse. I felt bad for what I did and he was very heartbroken but we moved on as a couple. Mind you he is my first relationship and he’s literally the closest thing to perfect. Then as the months went on, whenver I felt insecure about something (after he came back from a weekend trip to a cabin with a bunch of people, or after meeting up with a female coworker) I would express that I felt off or weird and he would tell me “I’m not the one who does things on my outings” or “she’s fat and ugly why would you even think I want to be with her” so I let it go he was going out often and not texting me back. I would bring it up and explain to him that it hurts my feelings and I’d appreciate if he would get better at checking in especially after going to the bars. It never changed. He would make plans and wouldn’t tell me about them until the day of, and then his friend got him a ticket to a show and told me about it and I asked him if he was going to the show and he was like no probably not, and then I said well he friend told me he got you a ticket and then he got mad at me for trying to play mind games and said he will always fail mind games. He ended up going to the show. WHICH is fine ! I’ve NEVER ever made him feel like he couldn’t go anywhere or do anything so there’s no need to hide it from me. And I would ask him, do I make it seem like I’d get upset ? He would tell me know and that he doesn’t know why he doesn’t tell me these things. It was sooooo often but I always forgave him because he’s my bf and he really is this sweet guy to me. Then a year into our relationship i started to feel off. He went out one night and said he was staying at a friends house cause he was drinking and I said alright no worries. He didn’t text me I till the next morning and came over. And I FELT SO OFF. I had a panic attack and asked him if he was doing anything he shouldnt be doing and he said no baby I’m right here just me and you. Later that night I went through him phone and I caught him talking to a few girls and had a saved picture from the coworker. I flipped out and asked him about it, I kicked him out of my house and when he comes over the next day he confessed to hanging out with some girl 3 times, another girl the night before and saved the picture but doesn’t know why . I asked WHY why did he do this ?? and he said because of what I did he neeeded validation. &amp; I’m not going to say I was a perfect girlfriend, but I was so patient with him and so checked into our relationship always making sure he felt so loved by me, I validated him in every way possible. Whatver, we try to move on and I literally cannot move on from this I tried but my trust was completely broken. We tried to make it work but I couldn’t get over it and he called for a break.

My question to you is, did I make him this way? I don’t want to think he’s a bad person because he really was so sweeet to me and I know he loved me but this is all so much for me to take in.

455,"I got into a breakup a few months ago and that has been dragging me down. I haven’t talked to anyone for months. Yesterday, I decided to text an old friend, I had apologized about my disappearance for months. She asked if something was wrong and I decided to just tell her about losing my best friend/SO, she was very nice to me about it and I appreciate her for that. I ended up falling asleep and this morning I wake up to a text from her saying that her dad died a few days ago. I couldn’t imagine what she would be going through. She described her dad and he reminded me of my own dad. Except now I sit in silence trying to figure out what to say to her. I’ve never lost someone to death that was that close to me.

458,"I only work drive-thru and not in the front counter. I work overnights, and our store is closed for in-person ordering from 10pm - 6am. Hence, our drive-thru is the only part of the store open. The morning manager despises myself and favorites the old ladies that work during her shift in the morning. I was told by the overnight manager that the old ladies working front counter had 20$ missing in the till (which was put after I left at 6am and in-person customers started coming!!!!) and the morning manager accused ME of stealing it. The overnight manager told her that I only work drive-thru and leave right when we open for in-person orderings. She messaged my overnight manager demanding that I sign a form indicating that I acknowledge ""the theft"". I was very pissed and am very frustrated. No review of camera footage, nothing! I told the overnight manager to tell the morning manager (who comes at 7am, 1 hr after I leave my shift every shift) that I will be contacting the store manager and HR for a false accusation. The morning manager knew she got caught trying to make a kid look like a thief to save her favorite morning lady from getting penalized for missing money in the till. I know she is tryna paint me as the culprit, thinking I am stupid and won't notice that it is her favorite crew who did it, who she is trying to protect by blaming someone else.

459,"Hi. I feel like I'm a bad person. There are so many things I need to change about myself but I don't know where to start. 

I (17F) feel like a burden to be frank. I have issues with practically every aspect of my life and it's making me feel overwhelmed and just lost. Firstly, I've completely lost motivation to do well in school. It's my final year and no matter how much I try to get myself to do work, I always find myself saying ""screw it."" I finish in about 3 months but it doesn't seem to stick in my head that I need to do well, I need to fix my attitude. And that motivation pretty much is because I have no idea what I want to do. I feel like I'm just watching life pass me by. I don't feel like I'm on earth and sometimes I wish I didn't exist because it's so frustrating for me to feel like this. I hate uncertainty and I hate that I don't know. I feel like I'm just drifting away and becoming numb. This lack of motivation just makes me lazy and leaving things till the last minute. And I can't speak to my parents or friends about this. I have in the past but it's just a repetitive thing and I feel like they shouldn't have to deal with it. Also I feel like I can't be vulnerable with my parents which discourages me from talking to them about dreams or emotions. They're great but just personally, I can't open up to them. I wish I could so bad because they haven't done anything, they've always been there for me. I know it sounds selfish, I don't mean to be, but sometimes, most of the time, I just wished I had no one. I wished no one knew me, I just wished I wasn't in their lives so I could just stand there and just not think. I don't know, I'm really bad at explaining things, I apologise if you've read this far. What my friends and family think of me is really important to me and it becomes a problem because I just want to make sure they're okay with me; that they aren't mad at me or something similar. I don't want them to be disappointed or offended by me and my actions, I want to make sure everyone's happy with what I'm doing. I'm not too sure what I'm saying. I don't know. I don't want to lose them because they're important to me but I guess I just feel overwhelmed by expectations and all.

And then, I don't think I know myself. I'm constantly fed up with myself and I just wish I could be different. And I know I can be, I'm just finding it hard to change. I think too much about others opinions, I can't stand up for myself, I always manage to upset one person with my decisions, I'm awful at communicating, just everything. I wish I was better. I feel like there's so much happening but I'm just not there. I have a job, I'm in my final year of school, I have amazing friends and an amazing family, a beautiful and understanding girlfriend, I have it but I just feel like I'm on the sidelines of my own life. I feel like I'm just waiting for it all to end. I don't know. **Does anyone have any advice?** I know it's jumpy, what I've said, but I don't know how else to say it.",05Sep2020,1

Im at a loss here. The father of my child and I had a bad split when our son was a few months old due to internal and external reasons (no domestic violence or child endangerment). We had been separated for the better part of a year before I asked to stay with him agian due to unforeseen circumstances. He said yes and we moved in. I told him I'm not ready to try agian and he agreed so we decided to live together but not get back in a relationship which was fine. Were at a point where I can tell he wants to be with me agian but I just don't feel the connection anymore. We've had several talks and he says he's not going to pressure me into anything which is great. But now I'm feeling guilty for putting him through this. I'm sure it's hard to live with someone you love knowing they don't see you that way. I have the opportunity to leave now, but is it the right thing? Idk. He makes good points of the positives of us living together. Our son having both parents under the same roof. It's great, I love having that for him but I myself am just not happy, I don't see myself with him (the father of my child) in the future, which agian I've told him to im not trying to lead him on or anything. Would I be selfish to leave and take that away from our son? Or am I being selfish to my own happiness and dads by staying in this awkward friendship thing we have going on. He says he will do it for our child but I don't want this to be at the expense of our own individual happiness/future that we could have (separately).

461,"So I (F16) want to move out, preferably ASAP but I also want to make sure it's safe enough of an option before doing so.  My current living situation isn't manageable, and is making it difficult to live my life.

Although I don't currently have a job (again, because of where I live) I do however start college near the end of this month, and get just over 800 a month for living expenses from the college.  Best case scenario would be I find a cheap enough small apartment near the college for me to move into, and then get a parttime job along with my continued fulltime education.  
Problem is, that IS the best case scenario.

463,"This happens in our school class's chat group. We graduated from that school but we still talk to each other regularly. The friend has exhibited mental problems before, such as poor anger management and self-hatred. He's barely gotten through school as he just can't finish the homework and miss a lot of deadlines. So during that school year we tried to talk to him that we always cared about him and we can help you with this and that. We have also talked to each other and to the teacher before, basically wrote a huge essay convincing her to get him the therapy and treatments that we think he needs. Despite all that the situation hasn't been improved.

As to elaborate what I've described in the title, he has been consuming a lot of pornography these recent days. How do I know? He sent the name and even some screenshot of the porn he'd watched (he only captured the part when they all have clothed on). Furthermore he also shared hentai loli or something (idk much about anime stuff) but the characters in those are definitely underage. Thats when he called himself a pedo and describes how the more disgusting he is, the more gratification he feels. And man he curses A LOT.

Even to the extent of my own mother - she had cheated and used my father (adoptive father) ever since I was born just in her own benefit.

For example, they'll screw someone over and lead them on while going after some frat kids who have no good intention with them, while then complaining that they can't find love or they're getting drugged at parties. I see women use ""nicer"" men as backup plans and lie to the backup plans about their promiscuity and I personally just can't get over those things. I just see these values in every woman I meet.

465,"My dad never wears a shirt in the house. The first few times, we can forgive him, but after that, it just makes everyone mad. He has a bulging potbelly, large breasts, and really gross armpit hair. His chest is super hairy, and it's so disgusting to look at him. He has shirts, but he just never bothers to put one on, because he thinks it's too hot to put a shirt on. When he goes out to do the yardwork or get the mail or something, he goes around shirtless. It's so disgusting when he does that.

And then, my dad wears really weird boxer shorts. They cover the knees, and they are really baggy. They have a weird pattern, and really long tightening cords. He wears them all the time, and they make him look extremely ugly. He needs to put on some actual clothes. Going around shirtless while wearing a pair of boxer shorts is not acceptable.

The worst part is that my dad is pestering my younger brother, who is 13, to start going around shirtless as well. My dad thinks that shirtless equals cool. It's not cool to have a giant potbelly and a weird chest, thinking that it's attractive. He seriously needs to get plastic surgery, My brother says no every time my dad asks to go shirtless. 

The other weird thing is that my dad sweats a lot. He drips non-stop, and the sweat gets everywhere. On the kitchen table, on the piano, on the couch, in the car, you name it. It's so gross when he does that. He doesn't even bother to wipe his sweat. He is a terrible person.",05Sep2020,1
466,"On a night out around 2 months ago I was assaulted after allegedly calling a girl a name - now I’m not one to cause trouble and if I did do this I’d like to think it was not without reason, but I was drunk at the time and have little recollection of the evening apart from some parts. 

Anyway, I was outside a pub and got punched in the face by what I thought was “Dave” (not real name), I then stumble down the road and Dave follows me down punching me again - there is video proof of this whole engagement although it is unclear on the video who throws the first punch out of the blue, however the following down the road is more clear that it is Dave. An additional point is that I certainly showed no signs of aggression (other than arguing with the girl) and was punched full force out of literally nowhere.

I remember seeing daves face and since the night I remembered it as being him who was the first puncher and then followed me down the road and punched me again, so I reported that in my statement. 
However since the night about 7 weeks later I saw a reliable friend who said it was definitely 2 other people who threw the first punch at me and then Dave followed me and punched me after - my friend had already messaged me this but I disregarded it and said I thought he was wrong, however after speaking to my friend face to face it seems clear his version is more accurate and what I reported is likely false.

I’m pretty sure it was the first punch that did most of the damage, you can even tell by the sound on the video and people’s voice reactions, I suffered a broken jaw and think the original blows were what would have done this.

Do I contact the police and change my statement, even though I reported it exactly as I remembered, even if it isn’t the true story? I don’t want to look like a lier. 

This may get Dave off the hook as his defense could be that it was not his strike that broke my jaw, but I might be wrong here. Also the fact I change my statement surely won’t do my credibility any favours? 

Do I ask the police to drop the case all together as maybe I caused this whole thing by calling the girl a name in the first place?

Finally it was nearly 2 months since the incident and I’m really fed up of it being on my mind and need closure one way or another. The confirmation by my friend that it was likely multiple individuals who assaulted me has definitely made it worse as I don’t know who to blame. 

Feel free to ask questions any advice would be greatly appreciated.",05Sep2020,1
467,"In a nutshell, one of my wife's friends saw the profile, screen shotted it, and sent it to her along with another of her close friends. I have not, nor will I ever make a Grindr to cheat on my wife. I have never downloaded the app. She woke me up immediately when she got the messages, as I was asleep after working a night shift. I know Google has a history of apps downloaded to your phone, which I showed her. No Grindr on there. But apparently that's not proof of anything because I could have just deleted the evidence. That's fair, but I was dead asleep when she came in the bedroom, I didn't have any sort of opportunity to do that, and I pointed it out then too. But there's still the suspicion, and her friends are saying, understandably so, that I'm lying, that the evidence is right there. I don't know what else to do to show I don't have a Grindr and never have. She downloaded the app herself in an attempt to find the profile and she can't find it. So the only evidence of this are two screenshots pretty much. 

I'm sorry this is rambling but shit I'm pretty upset and probably going to lose my family over someone catfishing with my pictures and stuff. Are there any other ways to show I've never used the app?

Using a throwaway just to make sure he doesn’t find this for now. 

My ex boyfriend and I broke up 2 weeks ago. We had a long distance relationship for 2 years and he called me and broke up with me because he didn’t feel I was making changes he wanted to see in my life. 

I’m having a really difficult time trying to process our relationship. He is my second long term partner but he treated me very well. He bought me the nicest gifts, would send me money for food if I had a bad day, he tried really hard to make me feel special. He was always there to make me feel better when I had a shitty day. He always knew what to do to make me laugh and any problem I ever had he wanted to fix. He always said how much he loved helping me and fixing things for me. 

On the other hand, as I’m looking back at our time together, I’m starting to notice things that weren’t normal. I asked him for help in making my wardrobe look better 2 years ago when we started dating. This turned into him picking out almost everything I would buy. I couldn’t get chunky jewelry or leather jackets because he thought they were trashy. He would constantly tell me to speak more slowly, think before I speak, slow down, relax, think more clearly, etc. Nearly every phone call there was something to this nature involved. He became controlling in ways I thought were normal in a relationship. He was condescending and made me feel small and dumb all the time. I was always wrong and always needed to look at my facts. He would ask me to tell him how I feel and when I would he would ask me in depth, long, psychological questions that would just make me feel wrong and stupid. He is by far one of the smartest people I know, but I felt like I walked on eggshells with him. He got mad or argued with me over things I never understood even if he explained it. It would always confuse me. He wouldn’t talk to me for hours and would usually result in me taking the blame for everything. Even when we broke up, I had to sit and explain why I was to blame for the downfall of our relationship. 

Now I’m trying to understand everything. I told people in my life (friends, family, support team) and they all seem to think I was in an emotionally abusive relationship. But I really did love this man, I still do. We planned a whole future together and he threw it away so quickly. Within 12-16 hours we went from talking about marriage and our next trip to breaking up. It’s hard for me to wrap my head around all of it.I really did not see this coming. 

I did notice when we broke up, right after I felt a sense of peace. I didn’t cry right away or yell. I just sat on my friends couch with a glass of wine and talked about it. I’ve had my sad and lonely moments over the past 2 weeks but overall I have found this sense of strength I didn’t know I had. I feel a lot more like myself. I mean granted I’ve been drinking a lot more than usual but I feel good. I’m starting therapy on Friday to help me sort this out. 

I just don’t know what to conclude on this. He is not doing well, has reached out to my friends to check on me and then proceed to tell them how badly I’ve hurt him by not “taking his advice and changing myself” and how “I required deep and intense emotional support all the time and offered nothing” even when i would attempt to help him when he felt shitty he would tell me I was going it wrong. I was never right. I felt like I just had to do anything to please him. He contacted me the other day, and i kept it very short. I’m pretty sure at this point he wants to talk and figure it out, get back together and try again. Even when we broke up he just said “I’m not saying I’ll never date you again but if we do we need a new fresh slate. I feel like the person I fell in love with didn’t exist.” Then told me he would be back from deployment in a year and I have things I need to work on by myself. He didn’t give me any closure. 

I really did love this man, and I really thought we were going to get married. I still have a place for him in my heart but I don’t know what to think or do. Any advice is welcomed. Thank you!",05Sep2020,1

480,"First time posting. I hope it's the right sub for this.

My  husband (28 yo.), while not diagnosed, shows a lot of symptoms compatible with depression/anxiety and is also on medication. He was raised by  narcissistic parents and, sadly, we still live under their roof until we  have enough funds to find a place. They're not physically violent, but  they're manipulative/emotionally abusive in a passive manner and they enjoy micro-managing every single thing about their son. Thankfully, he is aware of this and a lot of the tactics they use, but  he's still dealing with wounds from being treated this way since childhood, it's not easy to heal, I was raised by horrible people too and I understand how it feels.

However,  he and I are different. When I am feeling unwell, I speak up, look for people to talk to or vent in a journal, that usually helps. He, on the other hand, withdraws  from everyone and starts beating himself up over everything. It's heartbreaking, because he's a good guy and recently landed a decent job with a person that chose him to form and help him become a professional...  yet he can not see his accomplisments (claims that his professor/boss chose him out of pity, for example). During these episodes, he says a lot of  horrible things about himself, praises his abusive parents... it's like  self-harm, but in an emotional manner. And there's no way to talk him  out of it. Everything I try to say, he counters with something  negative... even lashes out at me at times wth a hurtful sentence or two  (which I learned not to take to heart because it's mostly his demons speaking). He wants to be left alone to boil in his own venom and has told me that me staying there does not actually help, but makes it  worse.

During his free time, we  used to play games and chill. Now he does not feel like doing anything  because he considers the weekend as ""dead time before work"". He overthinks about work, becoming successful and ""achieving results"" (something his manager of a father used to say, that ""I don't care about how you do things, I only want to see results""). He compares himself with his teacher and other people, beats himself up over mistakes at the job (he's learning, you're  meant to make mistakes in programming, even his senior of a professor messes up) and is lately unable to relax.

I  don't know what to do to help him, as he rejects my attempts. I am  concerned about his wellbeing and I am also under a lot of anxiety myself. I do have a bad trait of unconsciously absorbing all the stress  of the home like a sponge... and it's exhausting.

482,"I (M56) am pretty close with my son (M24) as far as parent-child relationships go. We usually share most everything notable with each other and he hasn’t been one to feel uncomfortable to come to me with difficult topics in the past. But over the past couple of years my son has put on a lot of weight. When he began his masters program, I had seen him the summer prior and I know he was around 150lbs then as that’s what he’d always weighed as an adult. I didn’t see him in person again until the holidays that year, but had seen some tagged photos on Facebook as the semester went on and he started becoming hard to find in group photos because he started to look so different. I figured he was just really maturing, but when he came home that December for Christmas, I’d say he had to be at least 225lbs, a huge difference from just the prior summer visit. I figured this was just due to stress and this new chapter in his life. He reassured me everything was okay (in general - I didn’t pry about his weight specifically). I asked if he was getting enough exercise and he said he’s getting used to working with it on a new schedule but was figuring it out. All seemed like I didn’t have to be too worried yet, although it did seem like a pretty big change in a short amount of time. 

But since then, I’ve finally seen my son again for the first time since before coronavirus began, and I’d say he’s easily over 250lbs now if not more and he’s not even in his masters program anymore so I’m worried that his adjustment period for keeping up with his health has long expired. I’m starting to get worried for him, just because of the rate of weight gain. I don’t want to sound like I’m fat shaming him or being critical of his appearance. I worry that if a weight gain like this continues at his age, he will start to experience some extreme side effects. I’ve finally had one chat with him this week about my concerns and mentioned his weight and health from the POV of genuine concern. He acted quite ambivalent, even oblivious as to there being any kind of problem. “Everyone gains weight as they age and their metabolism slows, I’ll hit the gym again and be back in shape, this is just a little extra weight” - but come on, he’s very obviously put on at least 100 pounds. 

I should mention he’s currently staying with me for a few weeks which is why I’d like to be able to talk to him or figure this out while we have some rare face time.
This is also a little bit sneaky, and I didn’t mean to come across this a few moments ago, but I have one of those personal scales that logs your weigh-ins. I was just getting ready for bed and stepped on and the last measured weight was 262 pounds, so now I know that that’s how big he is now. That’s a crazy difference from 150 ish 2 years ago. What could cause something that drastic?  Anything I should look out for while he’s staying with me?

Is this out of my control?  Is it wrong of me to push my concern?  How can I talk with him? I just want to make sure my son stays healthy.  After he had initially gained the weight during his masters program, I at least convinced him to get a physical and some tests when he was home to just make sure everything was okay. Nothing underlying and his numbers were all fine. Which makes me think that he’s living a lifestyle with a really bad diet or something with health effects that haven’t caught up to him yet. He already has this giant beer belly that’s bigger than I’ve ever been and I’m almost 60 and he’s not even 25. I’m just worried about him. What can I do?",05Sep2020,1
483,"I’m sure a lot of you have heard situations like this, but it’s been eating away at me lately so I’m just looking for some advice. 

I (19 M) think I’m in love with my best friend. We’ve been extremely close over the past year or so, before Covid we basically did everything together. After we were all sent home from school because of Covid, we spent almost every day talking over text or FaceTime. We’re basically each others’ emotional rocks, always venting to each other and telling each other about everything. Talking to her makes me so happy, and I’d like to think she has fun when we’re together too; we’re always laughing and smiling the whole time. She has the type of smile that makes the whole room glow. 

She’s definitely a little out of my league. She’s the type of person that has everyone around looking at her and wanting to talk to her. She could go to a party and have a whole circle of guys around her. I’m a pretty average looking guy, but I’ve got a decent enough personality I’d like to think. 

Now, after about six months apart we’re back living in our college town and finally reunited after not seeing each other in person all quarantine. Of course, we hugged for a while, caught each other up on our moves to town, and spent a ton of time together. The first two times we hung out I thought I was getting some signals from her: biting her lips while looking at me, looking down at my lips, some flirting, and just generally being touchy. I didn’t make a move at all because I’m petrified that I might just be misreading things, so I wanted to spend some more time with her to make sure. 

Then, last night I invited her over to my apartment. The night started out pretty normal, she was hanging out with me and my roommates and still seemed potentially interested. Then one of my roommates started flirting with her, and she was flirting back with him. I spent the whole night watching them do that (I still had some good conversations with her, and we were in a group the whole time, but they were doing a lot of flirting) until he finally ended up going to bed. It’s not really his fault, I told him we were just friends a while ago because everyone thinks we look like a couple, but it still hurt like hell to watch. It was too late for her to walk home (like 3:30 AM) so I told her she could sleep here. She was going to sleep on the couch, but I told her she could just sleep on my bed and I would just crash on the floor. 

Now here I am laying on the floor with no lumbar support and no direction. My head is spinning, and I don’t know what to do. I’m so angry with myself for not having the balls to make a move earlier, but at the same time I understand the reason why I didn’t. Making that leap is terrifying; if I misread her signals and do something then I could ruin the friendship. Likewise, if I tell her I have feelings for her and she doesn’t feel the same way it’ll make our relationship weird forever. She’s such an important part of my life, so the idea of ruining our friendship in any way is terrifying. All we’ve been doing is talking about how this year we’re basically going to be living in each other’s apartments. But on the other side of the coin, I want more than anything to be more than friends. If I have to see her with another guy, especially someone living with me, it might be the death of me. I know I don’t deserve anything from her of course, but I’m just so into her that it would be heartbreaking. 

All of this is eating me up inside. More than anything I crave resolution. Every day I spend not knowing how she feels is killing me. One day she seems super interested, the next she’s flirting with someone else right in front of me. I don’t know.  

Anyway, just wondering if any of you kind folks have some advice. Should I talk to her about it and risk making everything super weird? Should I just do nothing and wait and risk her hooking up with someone who’s actually confident enough to make a move? Any advice at all is appreciated, thank you!",05Sep2020,1
484,"Hi, I'm (20m) am currently deciding on whether to drop a subject or not. I am likely suffering from social anxiety and have been looking for therapy options in order to actually be able to live my life. The problem is one of my University subjects has a presentation soon, and not only is it graded quite high (10% of final subject mark), I am very afraid to present.

Essentially, the problem is there isn't enough time to fix my problems before this presentation and dropping it would mean that I would be considered a ""part-time"" student, losing some benefits such as government allowances and delaying my degree (which I don't mind as much since I already delayed it before). Would it be wise to drop the subject and pick it up later or is there another solution to this? (Please don't suggest ""sucking it up"" because if I could do that, I wouldn't have made this post).

Another problem I currently have is whether I should stop working or not. As of right now, I don't have any personal financial problems so I can 'afford' to not work and still live with my parents. I have saved quite a lot and only spend on food so I feel money isn't a high priority. I work part-time at a restaurant as a waiter but I feel like I dread going every time and with COVID about, I really don't want to be interacting too much with customers. I pretty much only keep the job because it's customer service experience for the resume and also how it's currently hard to find a job with COVID.

I apologise if my post is unclear or unorganised since I don't post a lot but basically, my questions are

\- Should I drop my subject until conditions are better (COVID, stress and social anxiety) or do something else?

\- Is keeping my job something that will help me in terms of experience, as money isn't a high priority?

\- Is it unwise to drop the subject and quit my job since I pretty much lose all income (Government allowance + wages)?

\- Any other general life advice would also be appreciated.

Thanks for reading.",05Sep2020,1

Hi Reddit, I fucked up. I (16M) decided to shave my hair this afternoon. I had done this before but the clippers I had used that time must have really sucked because even with the 3mm protector I still had about 2 cm of hair left. (this is what I had wanted, but the 2mm setting was terrible so I worked m way down until I was happy. I, however, had made the STUPID mistake of chalking this up to the quality of my hair wich is very curly. this is why, after having bought new clippers and trying to shave my hair, I put on the 3mm protector. I now have a band of fucking snail skin running from the top of my head to the middle of my forehead. I don't know what to do. I have school on Monday and honestly, I wish I could just sink into the floor and stop existing. please, please help me and let me know if I could/should post this anywhere else.",05Sep2020,1
489,"Almost true, I have given smaller meaningful gifts before but nothing that I had actively invested in for someone else. I won't buy somebody something super pricey or anything like that, because I wanted to save my money for other things. Oh and on top of that, I am notorious for asking for shit that my parents can't even give me so that they will ask relatives to get them for them. I don't know if that is normal or not, and I have tried before to keep my lists concise and small but I feel its been futile. It has gotten to the point before that I have not looked forward to my birthday or Christmas because I felt like a complete scumbag asking for things and giving nothing to any of my family members because I didn't have the money. Me not giving gifts doesn't have to do with my relationship with them at all, I love all my family, which is why I feel so bad not giving any of them anything to show my love them back. Now, I just got a job as a Lifeguard and am making $8.50 an hour working over 50 hours a week (this is my first job and come next season I want a raise because this was kind of a horseshit deal, but that's not what this post is about). Now that I have more money than I've ever had before, I am buying even more shit and have more economic freedom because I got a card to make purchases with. 

Now the issue for me is, do I buy gifts for my relatives now or not? I am starting to feel a bit of distaste every Christmas whenever I give a singular inexpensive gift to one person out of the ten other family members. I know COVID will fuck Christmas a bit, but that wont stop any gift exchanging. I don't know what I should buy for everyone or if I should buy anything at all, I just don't want to feel like a dickhead for being a gift goblin and never showing my appreciation for my relationship with my family.",05Sep2020,1
490,"I’m 21 and in college, but unfortunately doing classes online due to everything being remote. My parents have been looking to move to Florida and they are closing on a house very soon. The current house that I live in will probably be sold eventually, but here’s the problem: I don’t want to move as I hate Florida (it’s too hot, I don’t like the idea of living near a beach and by the water), but I really don’t have enough money to move out and support myself. So I’m at a lost of what to do. Because I have to respect my parents needs and desires but at the same time, moving to Florida is honestly something that I dread.

497,"So, I live in a 6-person house with 5 roommates. I started this lease only knowing two of them well. The other 3 were friends of friends. As this last month has gone on, it's become apparent that some of us have different views on acceptable risks to take during the pandemic, and it's gotten to a point where I don't feel comfortable hanging around some of my roommates.

I live in a college town in one of the worst states that COVID-19 has hit, and my five roommates all belong to a local church that has a lot of college students. Every Sunday after church, they get together as a large group with church friends and go out to eat. They frequently invite people over to our house (usually just 1 or 2, but almost always different people). They go to other people's houses for game nights. They also want to hold bible study and worship at our house. Notably, when they do all of this, none of them wear masks (except when they're forced to, like at church).

One of the roommates who I know pretty well and I have tried to reduce some risks, like voicing concerns about having large groups over, skipping going out to eat, and requiring everyone to wear masks if a big group ever comes over. They listen, but some of them voice dissent and their demeanor implies they think we're overreacting.

Fast forward to this week. One roommate's girlfriend tests positive for COVID-19, and everyone in the house has had multiple long-term close contacts with her over the last few days. We go into quarantine mode, with everyone masked up and staying at home. We all get tested the next day, and we all get negatives back after waiting two days. At this point, about half of the roommates are convinced we're all fine. They still wear their masks at home, but go to the movies the same night. All throughout this I'm worried, because we got tested so early, and symptoms usually don't even show up until an average of 5 days after infection.

I'm still trying to be cautious, staying isolated and not leaving the house. However, I'm worried that if none of us get sick, they're going to resume their activities just like before. It bothers me, because no matter what I do, for every risk they take, my risk of getting sick increases too. I don't want to constantly be calling them out or criticizing them, but if they take as many risks as they have this last month, I won't feel comfortable being around them.

I want to know how I can get them to take this pandemic more seriously, or at least not bring risks into our house without always being the negative one or the villain, because I'm going to be living with them for the next year, and I don't want to be going through COVID scares (or actually catch it) every few weeks.",05Sep2020,1

She keeps telling me that she needs to get help and she needs to start talking to her therapist and start taking meds again, but everytime her appointment comes up she will just miss it and then not reschedule it again until things start getting really bad again. 

We just moved into an apartment on September 2, and yesterday she told me that she had to go home for a few days because she thinks she spends too much time with me and she's too far away from home.

My step mom kept going on about my wife staying home full time again and how not going back to work would be a good idea. This was really starting to annoy my wife.

Even though my wife is working from home at the moment she has been taking it easy, given the fact she's due in 7 weeks, The plan is when the baby was 3 months old she would go back to working at home part time, and some where down the line she would return to the studio to work part time there to. This is something we both agreed on.

I would never ask my wife to leave her job considering that up until 18 months ago was the first time she started working again, She spent 7 years being a stay at home mom and when I our youngest was old enough to go to day care my wife decided to go back to work, She found a job where she could work hours around when the kids weren't at home, and the place she works at has 40-50 people who also work around their children's schedule to. I know she loves working there and has made a great group of friends, So asking her to quit is not an option.

My step mom kept arguing and my wife made a comment of my step mom paying someone to look after me and my siblings when we were kids, My step mom got pissed off and reached across the table to slap her, I had to grab her arm to stop her, My step mom started arguing with me to let her go, while I told her not to slap my wife,My other kids were pretty much hysterical at this point and My father just sat there and when I told him to control his wife he told me go f myself,, So at this point I am done and grab then both and have to push them out of my house, My dad kept threatening me but I just ignored him.

The very next day they both sending me a bunch of text's about how rude I am and how me and my wife were ""ignoring the kids"" and making ""wrong choices"", how we weren't ""good parents"". In the end I told them both don't contact me because they were now going NC they threatened to call CPS and cutting me off from my inheritance, I told them I din't care. They even have been telling a lot of friends and family and some people agree with them.

I tried talking to my dad so he see's reason but he believes his wife was in the right, and I asked him at which point. slapping my wife for saying the truth was okay. He never answered me back.

I no longer care, He can cut me off from my inheritance or do what ever I don't care.

514,"My (24f) sister (18f) lives with me, she moved in nearly a year ago. Since she’s moved in she hasn’t had a job due to not being able to drive yet and me not having time to take her to and from work and other complications. We have very minimal assistance from our family in any aspect. This leaves me paying for everything myself which I can afford but it’s tight and very stressful. I know at this moment her getting a job isn’t on the table until we can get her license and I’ve accepted that but with me carrying all of the financial burden I expect her to do half the house work at the very least. This isn’t happening and I’m starting to resent her for it. For the most part the only time she cleans is when I ask her repeatedly to do a specific task, she almost never does it the first time I ask or takes initiative. We both have pretty severe depression and other issues from a traumatic upbringing so she finds it hard to motivate herself, especially after basically being trapped in the house for so long. I try to be sympathetic towards her but it’s getting harder and harder because I have my own issues. I just don’t have the option of letting my issues take over since I’m responsible for providing for us both and our pets and if I don’t we’ll be homeless. Anytime we try to discuss our issues with each other it always leads to a HUGE argument. She’s suggested going to therapy but she will only go to the counselor that she goes to which I’m slightly uncomfortable with since they’re so close, I’m worried she won’t be able to be completely non-biased. I expressed my discomfort but agreed to go but she’s now refusing since I don’t “want” to go. I’m not sure what to do or how to even begin finding a solution to this mess. I just know something has to change because it’s affecting both of our mental health. Any and all advice is appreciated!",05Sep2020,1

Its not just the money aspect, they give him false hope and by saying stuff like 'you will meet someone to share  your life with soon' it shapes his whole life. This is just an example. Many of the things he tries to make self fulfilling prophecies.

517,So recently one of my friends lost someone and I feel terrifically sorry for them and their family. We are not as close as we've been in the past but they are very important to me. I've been researching a lot about how to help someone who is grieving and it talks a lot about showing support and being there for them. However one of their relatives told us to leave them alone and to not bother right now. Should I try to text them and show my support or should I be quiet?,05Sep2020,1
518,"I [F21] went on a trip with my short term best friend [F25] and a long term friend of hers [F24] but it didnt end up they way we wanted. 

We went on a trip from Amsterdam, The Netherlands to Hamburg, Germany. We went there because the long term friend [F24] was getting her first tattoo. Both me and my best friend already have a bunch of tattoos so she asked us with her for support and most of all just a fun girl trip. We arrived at our hotel on Friday 12am but couldnt get in our room til 3pm, so the hotel staff told us the best thing to do was leave our bags in a secured room at just explorer the city. Both girls were too tired and said I should go on my own. So I went on a 2 hour walk in de neighbourhood surrounding the hotel and it was great! 

Once I got back we were able to get into our room and we were supossed to go see the city center after they both changed. But they ended up changing into some PJ's and wanted to sleep. I told them I found it quite boring to just stay in our hotel, mostly because I paid for my plane tickets and all to see the city, not to sleep in the hotel. They said well go on your own then, we'll see you when we are having diner later today. So I did! I went on a hour long walk towards the center and it was beautiful, but after 45 minutes I got a text saying they talked about it with eachother and they both hated the hotel because it was too far from the city for them to come to the center and that they didnt felt safe in the neighbourhood. 

I was kinda shocked because I thought they would be asleep, thats why I left, but I most of all didnt understanded it. We had booked it together and we already paid for it, so its too late now tbh. And its only 15 minutes with public transport. 

So I sended a text back saying those things and explained that I dont have the money to book another, fancier hotel.. 

Long story short; they said that the tattoo was more important then the girls trip and eventhough they found it quite sad to do, they left. They left me on my own in the hotel in a 'strange' country in a hotel where they didnt felt safe. 

I havent spoken to them since they left the hotel and they both unfollowed me on IG and deleted me out of groupchats. 

My question is: should I text them saying how I feel and how sad I am about this whole situation or should I just look for new friends because they clearly suck..",05Sep2020,1

524,"I know; this is a stupid situation, but hear me out:

My diet is predominantly meat. I am borderline addicted to it. But I also love animals to the extent of not even wanting to harm insects (despite being afraid of them), think fishing for fun is bad and am currently awaiting a hedgehog house to arrive in the mail because I welcome the little fellas into our garden.

This isn't about health reasons nor really about how the land is effected as supply struggles to meet demand (though admittedly that is also worrying) This is about how much I hate myself for being the cause of these creature's demise.

Reasoning for being a meat eater seems flimsy to me: ""the animal is already dead"", yet they wouldn't be if there was demand for it. ""Some animals are only bred to be eaten and thus would be extinct"" yet we could just breed and not eat them; we breed panda to prevent extinction, not to eat. ""It's the food chain; other animals eat each other in the wild"" ignoring the fact that we are vastly superior to animals and unlike them, have other options available.

My mother has been vegetarian for over 20 years for similar reasoning that i'm debating with myself now. She doesn't like people eating meat, but believes it is my right to choose to do so. She also agrees that I specifically could never give up meat entirely; it is most of my diet and the previously mentioned craving.

I'm trying to make improvements: eat LESS meat and have introduced quorn/vegi meats into my diet (I quite like vegi-sausages over pork ones for example) and the instant lab grown meat becomes available to purchase, I will buy that and only that till the day I die. But I don't think I can eliminate meat from my diet entirely and thus animals will die and the blood will be on my...lips.

Does anyone have any advice?",05Sep2020,1
525,"Hi y’all. I (19f) want to move out of my parents house for reasons I don’t need to get into. The problem is my anxiety gives me mental breakdowns occasionally where I dye my hair (currently green) so that already takes out a ton of job options. My last job had horrible management, where no matter how hard I worked I’d get yelled at daily, so I can’t go back there for the sake of my mental health. 
     The biggest issue right now is I don’t have my full drivers license. My parents are always too busy to take me out driving, I don’t even know how to drive stick and that’s the only car we own that don’t have something that disqualifies it for the driving test. Basically what I’m saying is I’m limited in job options because I have to walk, even in winter, even in blizzards. (My town doesn’t have public transportation)
   Back on the topic of work I’ve applied to every place I can within a mile radius. Everywhere I actually want to work isn’t hiring, and there’s no way I can walk more than a mile in -20 F degrees and snowing.

527,"I’ll start by saying I suffer myself from, anxiety, depression and OCD. I wasn’t in a fit state mentally before any of this anyway.

My boyfriend has depression and stopped taking his meds about four weeks ago. He’s been slowly getting worse since then. He kept saying he was going to go back to the doctors but didn’t. The last few days he has been pretty much ignoring me. I sent him a message saying night and that I love him and he just puts night he won’t say I love you back and it’s killing me. 

Apart form doing streaks on Snapchat he’s not talking to me at all. He lives with his grandparents so when I got up this morning I messaged his gran and explained the situation. She said she didn’t realise he wasn’t taking his meds and thanked me so much for letting her know. They booked him an emergency doctors appointment and he went this morning I presume. I kinda feel guilty though like I went behind his back. His gran said she wouldn’t mention the message to him.

At this point I don’t know what to do. His grandparents said he’s been off with them too and I know he was funny with his sister when I was around the other day. I bumped into his mum yesterday and even she said he is in one of his “grumps”. Still keep thinking I’ve done something wrong and some how this is all my fault. I did ask him if I upset him and he said no. He’s still coming on Facebook a lot so he obviously isn’t ignoring everyone. He’s talking to someone and he’s playing video games and posting on his story about stuff he’s doing so seems happy enough so my head goes to it just being me he doesn’t want to talk to. I don’t know how much longer I can cope with this though. I can’t sleep, can’t eat. I’m starving and exhausted but just feel sick to my stomach. Just keep switching from feeling numb and crying my eyes out. I didn’t even bother and message him to see how he was today because it hurts so much to be ignored.

530,"I’ve applied to a UK university and accepted an offer of accommodation at it. £6500 a year for it in three installments. I thought that the maintainance loan would cover it or at least most of it. So I applied as a migrant worker child and have now been asked for evidence, being 21, on how to prove I am dependent on my dad. There is no way I can prove that. I don’t pay rent at his place and he covers food expenses mostly as well. I don’t think this will make it acceptable for me to be eligible.
Second option was for my mom to help out with at least the first installment and then with the me working (hopefully) we’ll figure it out. I am 100% going to work but now with COVID, the chances have certainly diminished a bit in finding one. But this has also floated since my mom has gone hysterical with dad because of money. She said she would support me yet now is saying I should not sell my old clothes as I will have to give them to my sister because she is “poor”. She was the one who convinced she would pay if all else fails. Now I have no idea what she’ll say.
I am going to call my uni as well to ask if they can terminate the contract of my accommodation and I can commute or if I will have to drop out this year so that I will not be charged. It does say in the contract if I drop out the uni will terminate my contract(at least I understood it that way) and maybe I will have to just pay the deposit/a fee.
Obviously I will talk to all parties involved and things may solve themselves.  But to be honest I am just really really scared that I have fucked up completely and will be in debt or have to work 3 jobs with no social life. 
The one reason I applied for accommodation was to get that full university experience and well it might turn out I’ll just get more work experience than uni experience :)
Is there anything else I can do? I am thinking of taking a free overdraft at least to cover a part of the first installment, but don’t know how much the bank will give me.

So I asked them why it didn’t work for them, and never got a answer from them. That tells me they didn’t know what they did wrong, and they probably did the same thing twice.

550,"So I am 28 years old and an attorney currently living in Philly.  I was recently laid off due to COVID.  I began searching for jobs and was offered a good job in Miami, Florida.  The reason I applied to Florida jobs is because I have traditionally been interested in Maritime Law (what can I say, I like boats) and this is the best area of the country for such work.  I wanted to do this type of law in Philly but there are no jobs.

I have lived in Pennsylvania my entire life.  I own a nice home in Philly, in a good neighborhood that I really love.  I have friends and a network here.  I am happy here.  Up until a few days ago I had a girlfriend who I really liked (known her for many years always had a crush, finally dated for ~4months and broke up bc of impending move.)

I accepted the Miami job a few weeks ago.  Initially I was exited about the new job and exited about the new city.  However, recently I have began to question WHY I want to move.  Like I said I have great things here that many people search for, I have comfort and stability.  Surely my GF ending things did not help one bit and I really thought we had a future (so did she, just couldn’t do distance with her in Med school &amp; residencies etc.).  The thought of at least having her support made things seem doable.

Reddit I am at a loss.  I have already put down a deposit on an apartment (I’m fine with taking a loss and swallowing my pride if I know I’ll be happy).  I don’t know what to do.  Part of me would feel such an overwhelming sense of relief if I found out my new job revoked my offer.  Additionally, the anxiety and fear of moving to a new city (couple with a breakup) has been so paralyzing that I haven’t hardly been able to do anything the past few days (I need to pack, need to figure out how to rent this place, etc.).

In theory the thought of moving to a new city, and achieving growth, getting outside of your comfort zone, etc. seems great but I am starting to question WHY??  I acknowledge that probably my GF is gone either way bc she’s obviouslu gone if I’m in Florida and obviously gone if I show this emotional weakness and back out now.  I’ve accepted this.  

If I stay in Philly I also acknowledge the I have to give up on any Florida aspirations and just accept the life I’ve made for myself here, which isn’t that bad at all.  Reddit, help me, any advice is appreciated.

i went back to my room for a sec to grab something and i decided to plug in the box fan because our AC is being stupid and we gotta fix it. i turned on the fan and set it right in front of the door so you would have to step over it because thats the only way to circulate the cold air from the AC in the living at the moment until ours gets sorted. well tell me while im typing this out, THE MOTHERFUCKER HAD TURNED TO THE SIDE AS IF IT WAS LETTING SOMEONE ENTER. 

im a huge believer in spiritual life so maybe im
bias. but i think there is a ghost at my grandparents house. does anyone have any input about what the noises could possibly be? or why the fan moved? im always looking for different possibilities first before just jumping to a conclusion but this was just a very odd event. any kind of suggestion is highly appreciated!",05Sep2020,1
552,"A month ago, I was given hope. I've been struggling with employment after leaving college for about 3 years due to being unlucky and not having the right connections. I was then met with unfortunate news that the opportunity didn't continue for anyone interested in the position. A week after that, a young family friend died to cancer and the environment was down, and then after a friend (of a friend) gave me some money and after that treat me like they owned me. Our mutual friend immediately took their side despite being friends with us longer and we departed. I am almost friendless due to good reasons, mostly being in the wrong crowd(s) and because the people I hung around with were generally assholes.

I do a lot of stuff online considering the internet or my computer is my only hobby, and I commented on a thread which I later got called at for, being called negative stuff which I won't detail over but I noticed I was getting more and more negative and angry. Usually I brushed off that type of feedback and joked around with it, but now that I think about it I've been very mopey and upset about everything.

I feel like I am almost at my breaking point and at the last minute I've only just started to realize. I would go to help at a local clinic but time and time again the clinic has often disappointed me, never actually listening to what I'm saying and even giving me terrible medication more times than not.

Can anyone advise anything?

I have heard getting exercise can help the state of mind and have been wanting to go to the gym for years, but had no one to go with and wanted it to be a social bond too. Knowing Corona kicked off, I've finally decided to invest in an exercise bike. Hoping for it to come soon but not sure if it will help me mentally. If not, I plan to use it anyway due to medical problems.",05Sep2020,1

555,"my boyfriends brother is in his 20s, we’re late teens (not 18) *im being vague incase this is ever found* but I consider his brother one of my bestfriends. We genuinely get along and he’s super nice to me. I’m very happy both of them are in my life. However recently my bf is getting jealous over us. I hate it so much since I want to enjoy both of their companies since they’re both my closest friends. It seems whenever we even sit and talk together he gets uncomfortable. I can’t laugh at his jokes or compliment him without a comment. I can’t wear swimsuits in the pool if anyone is home and I’m just.... stuck with this at the minute. I love them both so much and I hate that I’m causing issues but I don’t know what to do about it. Any advice?

557,"Im 16 and i just now started volleyball. I have volleyball 2 times a week for about 1hour and 30 min. I've only played like 4 times now. Our coaches are older players who play in the team we are supposed to get into when we learn all the techniques and all that. So far everything is going well and we know how to do the basic stuff the beginners learn like serving, receiving, finger passing and much more that i don't know the names of in english (sorry for that) I was asked by a player from the upper team if i am new to volleyball and they were surprised to learn that i was. I got told that i was really good and i thought they she was just trying to be nice by saying that to give me confidence but she started talking to me about it more and she was pretty searius and said i have talent by what she has seen when we were playing on the court. Now i was wondering how much practice do you actually need to get better and better more faster. I do practice at home and with my friend outside when the weather is nice and all. But how many hours a week do you need to spend on training volleyball to get it going. I have this big dream about playing in the olympics and it sounds kinda wild cuz i just started but im so passionate about it! I have been doing sports before but it was swimming, i've been a swimmer for 11 years but i hated it. We used to train 4 times a week for about 2 hours but u rarely see any results i know swimming and volleyball are far far from each other but to become a professional how much time do i need to put into volleyball some advice would be good too.",05Sep2020,1

560,"This will be a long one, but I really need some help. 

Let's name him 'Joe' (21m). Joe and I (21f) have been really close friends for the past couple of years. Purely platonic on both ends, but sometimes he'll take on that ""best girl friend"" role, we'll talk about my guy issues, he'll tell me about his girl issues, self esteem, family problems, school, work .. you name it. 

I started smoking weed with him during the friendship and in a way it also brought us even closer and he's opened up to me a lot and I to him. And something that might be important to note is that he suffers from severe depression and anxiety. Is heavily medicated, has suffered a few seizures (not epileptic), doesn't find family as a strong source to lean on and he has heavy self esteem issues. Throughout all of this I have tried to be his rock and was often his go-to person.

But I'll be honest, as time went on I found myself to be taking on the 'therapist' role, it was sometimes mentally draining, and felt as though his life was revolving around weed. And I'm the no-bs type friend so I've told him in the past if I  felt like his smoking was getting a little out of hand, (and look, I'm all for a bit of thc, but not if you can't spend a couple of hours in the day being sober without feeling like you have to reach for the bong, not if you also grow a dependence on vaping/ecigs, not if it's literally the only thing that your life revolves around). One time during the school year I broke down over my frustration towards his lack of care towards himself and I told him 'If you're going to smoke at least do something with the high, don't just sit there and watch TV, do your work, clean something up - enjoy the high and use it to your advantage."" And this bit resonated with him because he really did start picking himself up when it came to schoolwork. 

 And he knows that it's an issue for him / he has some sort of dependence on it but he's also been convincing himself that it's what he need to help him get past his depression and anxiety. But I mean after years of being close to him, smoking with him, hearing the good and bad going through his brain - I, and our entire friend group, can confidently say that the weed isn't helping him one bit. I think it's just a way he can pass time in a different state of mind so he doesn't have to listen to his mind in this dark place that it can get. And it doesn't stop at weed, recently he's been trying acid a couple of times, he's done shrooms a couple of times, when he drinks he drinks a lot - and again, I'm all for experimenting and moderation but he's also had bad trips of these things most of the time yet still goes back to it. And it worries me because he's had these seizures, is still taking anxiety and depression meds - his body really needs a break.

This is where the advice bit comes in - when quarantine started and school went online in the spring, we each went to our respective homes. My home has its own entire set of issues and I found myself in a deep depression. He was also extremely depressed at home but I never felt like I could talk about my own shit because he had his own to deal with. And whenever I did bring anything up he'd find ways to relate to me by talking about himself. Once or twice I got a little frustrated and told him that I just need him to listen to me, or to ask me how I'm doing instead of straight jumping into his own shit, and he tried to be better to an extent but it'd be things like, ""joe i only have a couple of mins to talk,' he'd spend ten mins telling me about his day or issues and then at the very end be like 'ok wait lets talk about you now whats going on with you' and sometimes *in my mind* I'd develop the attitude of ""I love you but can we for once in one phone call not talk about your shit at all""

Then my mom found out that I smoked weed and she is extremely against it, made me feel like utter shit, and I just can't bother with the stuff anymore while I'm under her roof. 

Now he's back at his apartment near my hometown/school and he's happier than he was at home. But is doing 20x more than what he could do at home. Even at home he was smoking every day, going on walks to escape for a bit, but now he's high all day in addition to every day; consistently has people over and is smoking with them too. And when I went to go visit a couple of times, I just felt so so out of place because I couldn't smoke like I used to - can't risk it at home. It's hard to find a moment alone with him because he tries to have people over so he's not 'alone'. 

We've had a bit of distance between the two of us over this time, and now I'm at a point where I'm just beyond drained from the friendship. And I want that closeness, I want to be able to open up to him, but even the past couple of times when I did call he was either with other people and baked, or alone and baked. And I just miss my joe, for five minutes I don't want stoner joe, just joe. 

And if I tell him I know he'll get defensive, he'll break down and say that his depression and anxiety is overtaking him, the conversation will shift to him and I'll leave feeling guilty. Sometimes it feels like a toxic relationship, but I wouldn't have stuck around for so long if I knew that aside for all of this he has such a kind heart and is why I'm friends with him to begin with. But now that he's spiraling a bit and smoking is all he's doing I just have no idea how to approach him. It's been almost two weeks since we've spoken and I know by now he's definitely mad that I haven't made a single effort to reach out. Last I saw him was at a small get together he had and I felt awkward beyond belief and couldn't stick around for too long in his room so that my clothes wouldn't smell (he knew all of this). But honestly I just haven't known how to reach out. 

I know it's extremely long but I felt like I had to give all the details in order for you guys to be able to paint an accurate mental picture bc he's in a fragile state right now and I want to approach this in the best and most sensitive way possible.",05Sep2020,1

573,"This happend a few weeks ago and came to me as quite a shock after knowing the guy for over 20 years.
Everything was up in the air at the time until he got released from the police station. He was  telling us that he got hacked on Facebook or something like that and they was using his phone to download images of kids or teens
What was ropey excuse but after knownhim for long we gave him the benefit of doubt.
It wasn't till my mum went to her mates prob to talk about the whole situation and get drunk. But this gave my stepdad a chance to be alone and not face the anger from my mum when he sent her 2 part txt, saying that he never got hacked and he was searching Facebook for random people when random foreign people were adding him and sending him WhatsApp group links what he joined, found that were sending cp what he amited pleasing him self to and goes in to more saying how it was a one time thing and a mistake.

This point me and my sister who has two small kids was trying to convince my mum to leave him and its OK we can help her out were needed etc
While my Nan was doing the opposite saying it wasn't that bad if its just some photos of teens, (she's quite old school) 

As time goes on my sister contacted the agent who is in charge of the case and told him what my step dad was saying and sent the txt msg to the agent
The agent let my sis know what was found on his phone, class A videos and photos of toddlers and kids what he was also sharing and trading on a facebook/ WhatsApp pedo ring with his real profile.

The only reason he got caught was due to them changing Internet provider.
Also taught karate in 1st schools and held groups for all ages

After a week or so after thinking my mum was leaving him and moving out my sister found out she's actually planning on staying with him what came to a shock to both me and my sis as we both said to our mum that if she stayed with him we couldn't see her or be near that pedophile or take gifts that she buys with his money but she just says he's innocent and it was all a mistake

I work at a daycare a a with several other people. They’ve been their longer than me and knows the owner. One of my mangers is best friends with the owner &amp; I feel like is out to get me (my therapist also agrees). As someone who suffers from anxiety this makes me super damn anxious. She had gotten me written up twice already, once was because I had a child on my shoulders (which isn’t against state regulations and wasn’t in the handbook so therefore I shouldn’t have been written up). I also got written up for sleeping, which I was not. The manager came in and made a ‘psst’ noise which I didn’t hear bc we have two fans and an AC going in the room I am in. So she then lowly said my name and I jumped because she spooked me. She wrote me up also because of that. Whereas she started playing WAP (the explicit version) and continuously does little things that are wrong, rude and disgusting.

Well my dad has taking loans that now adds up to 1 million sek (about 120k dollars?) which is just crazy amounts. He has not even spent it on anything, my mom suppose he's gambled it in hopes of winning but he won't tell us why. 

Why this upsets me SO MUCH is because my mom was diagnosed with a really aggresive breast cancer a 2nd time, and we don't know if it's gone. If it is gone, she might be able to get money and do lots of fun stuff in life but if not, there's not a lot more time for her. I know I shouldn't be thinking that way but it is the reality. 

About a week before she found out what dad had been doing I started chasing my dreams of becoming a game/web developer. Now this dream has more became a must for me so I can do something with my mom. She's basically depressed and seeing her so hurt makes me feel bad.

Now if for the worst part, why my mom is sad (part is that she might not be able to experience all she want in life). My mom is mostly sad because her dad was about to inherit  750,000 sek (80,000 DOLLARS!). A insane amount she had been preparing all things we could've done with that money. What makes her sad is that she keeps thinking about what we could've done with that money. Is there any way I can change her mindset? Is there anything I can do?

576,"So here’s the story. This guy I briefly dated a few years back then quickly realized there was no chemistry or interest on my end and cut it short. He’s a civil rights advocate and works for human rights organizations and claims to be a feminist.
earlier this summer I went to a small get together at a friend’s house and he was there. I knew he was still interested and he has made moves in the past that I subtly declined so I tried to avoid him the entire night. I felt that I was in a safe space and I might have drank a little too much and I fell asleep in the garden where we were all sitting. Later, he wakes me up because everyone went home except us and the house owner’s girlfriend who happens to be one of my best girl friends. I tell him I am going home and he insists on me being too drunk to drive and to come lay down inside because it’s cold. He tucks me in a bed in a room and tells me he will sleep in the bed next to it, but instead he gets on top of me and starts kissing me, but I was barely conscious of what was happening and my body wasn’t responding, so I couldn’t even stop him. I didn’t kiss him back or participate either. My friend walked in on us so it gave me a window to say I was gonna leave and I thanked her. He later told her she ruined all the fun and called her a cockblock. He kept messaging me all summer to hang out or reply to stories and send hearts and flirt but I never responded. He texted me yesterday so I confronted him, thinking that he genuinely didn’t realize it wasn’t consensual since he is a human rights advocate and also a little socially awkward, that he would apologize or feel bad and learn from it in the future. Instead he laughed and gaslighted me asking if I was even serious, and said he had nothing to add or comment (I’m assuming he didn’t want to verbally confirm nor deny my allegations). I got really angry and frustrated and started debating whether I should post his screenshots on social media and tell on him. I am a woman’s activist myself and I feel it would be hypocritical for me to push for women to speak up if I’m too afraid to do so myself. I’ve been abused many times, and all of my abusers walk free, and I feel like this could be a great way to show that even nice guys can do it and anyone can be a rapist. My friends think I should just let it go, and it might escalate and turn against me. I come from a very conservative country, even though I don’t care too much about tradition and what people think of me, and I don’t know how I’d feel about a conversation about my intimate sexual details and being too drunk being reposted for the whole country to see. I was going to post in on my instagram story, as I have a pretty good follower base of people that are liberal and know him, but I don’t want it to be shared on Facebook groups to be called a whore in the comments. What do you guys think? I don’t know what to do

This is so weird and now I’m so paranoid. Who is this person? Why did they say that?

582,"I am a 14 male and i am going through some very rough time... So i am here...

I am going to lose my control of my emotion it literally just riding a roller coaster in my little mind... I can go from very dark and scary to kind and bubbly in very short time but nobody know because i hide it with being quiet...

I also being toxic to myself all the time. I can randomly just talk to myself about not to be happy because i don't deserve it and force myself to be happy because other need my emotional support. And even i don't do it, it will happen itself without me knowing it. So i always have self aware about what i am doing...but sometime it slip and like last time i was doimg math and i was so stress and i just talk to myself in the public in front of my friend...

I am also having like intense flashback with the mistake i make in the past like having a big fight with my friend and ending up with kicking one of my friend out the school and manipulate the whole class  to bully the other friend and also beating my bully so hard that he cry in front of eveyone. I can't imagine the hard they been through it must had been much more than me because the bully kinda have a bad relationship with his dad and his mom had left them. The one friend that been kicked out the school must suffer because he is social awkward and he had ti start over again in other school, i mean friends, teacher, new home and more.... And the last the worst one that been through my dirty, ugly, dark hand... I watch him getting bullied and his grade falling... like it is too horrible(｡•́︿•̀｡) 
I am just so sorry....

And since i feel like i had this weird feeling when i switching to dark personality i feel like being release and trap in the same time. I know that i will become my true form since that time and knowing that i will continue it over and over again till i am dead... So i always force myself to be the bubbly and happier personality..

And i also have more problem but i am tired of typing (/ω＼)
Next time i maybe will talk more about it ...",05Sep2020,1

584,"I joined TikTok a few months ago and became interested quickly with the content being uploaded. I felt that, although I’ve never had an interest in being a content creator, I was very tempted to upload. 

I soon thought of an idea that didn’t involve my face and started posting satirical videos. My account has been steadily growing ever since my first video and I have now entered the Creators Fund in which I can get paid for uploads. 

One issue with this is that I’m failing to think of new ideas for videos that don’t include my face but are still comedic. 

I have been insecure about my face ever since the beginning of high school when I was insulted for my appearance, more specifically my acne. This has gotten to the point where I don’t upload pictures without a filter, make up and most of the time  photoshop. I am also a very shy person with bad social anxiety which stunts my confidence a lot. 

Is there anyway I can work around this insecurity?",05Sep2020,1

586,"So this pandemic hit hard and I had to move in with my remaining parent, my mother. My dad passed away 4 years ago and he was a single parent. My mother was never around at all. She was out doing drugs, scamming people, and prostituting herself for rent money. Now she’s 60+ and still doing it but I’ve had no choice but to stay in her section 8 housing townhouse. I’m also going through a break up with a girl that I dated for 3 months and was falling for fast. She ended things kind of without a reason other than I was catching feelings. 

I’m feeling utter despair and am afraid of myself and my thoughts. I have a doctor appointment Tuesday but I really don’t know if I can make it that long. I’m terrified. And my mother makes everything 100x worse. Even her voice sends me into a disgusted, depressed, and anxious state. 

Honestly I’m just looking for a place to go or a place to live. I’m a 32 year old M so other than homeless shelters there aren’t really many places for men to seek help like this or maybe I just don’t know of any? Any advice is definitely appreciated.",05Sep2020,1

I am a mess for sure but I've been trying to keep it together these past few days until today when he attacked me for being vegan. I tried ending the conversation a couple of times and even put on headphones to get him to stop talking and I explicitly told him I don't want to talk about anything but he kept going and called me immature and implied that I am stupid. I started crying. I don't think he saw that, but it got me thinking if I should cut ties with him after leaving this place.

He has attacked me for almost everything in my life: my interests, how I am, my friends, my life choices.

591,"Hi, so when I was about 11/12 and I first started to masturbate, I started out thinking about girls like celebrity crushes or something, but as time passed, I had this guilty pleasure of thinking about guys too. 

There was this weird phase in my high school where guys would dry hump each other for a joke and would eventually end up in fights. Similar to what dogs do 😂. But I never wanted to engage in any dry humping as I thought it was weird. 

I used to watch lesbian porn, and I imagined what it must be like for them, then I thought about if I was to make out and have sex with another guy, then I started to think about the gay kids at school and masturbate. But once I was finished I would have regretted it. 

As I got older, I started to get more and more bi-curious. At the age of 14 I watched gay porn for the first time out of curiosity and liked it. But regretted it once I had done it. When I was about 15, I fantasied of what a penis would taste and feel like in my mouth and when I was 16, I started watching bi-sexual porn so I wouldn’t feel as guilty for watching it if there was a girl involved. And I would start fingering myself and become more and more attractive to guy’s bodies and penises. But I would never want to try and have sex or have a relationship with a man, it’s just a fantasy that I couldn’t seem to shake. This is what it has been like for years, one time a guy did ask me out, but I told him I was straight and left. 

I once put my tinder profile to men only, but it made me feel uncomfortable. I started watching transgender porn, as I prefer the look of a woman, but I can get turned on by dick sometimes. But I still feel guilty after I’m finished. 

People have told me that I’m more open minded rather than bisexual. I just thought this might be a good place to find out what more people think.",05Sep2020,1

593,"Hello I am a 21y/o person who just came out as nonbinary. I have a wee bit of a situation that requires some explaining. 

**Background:** I am in the Air Force and right now we are limited to one hour from base due to COVID-19. My parents and siblings are in Georgia.

My mom is being very... indecisive of my new identity. After I changed my name publicly, she went on a rant about who her daughter is and kept using my old name like ""I know who MY \_\_\_\_\_ is. She is strong, courageous, focus driven, creative and beautiful. I am incredibly proud of My \_\_\_\_\_."" This conversation on social media was very... embarrassing and honestly disrespectful in my opinion. 

I ended up calling her and my dad individually and my dad was very supportive, calling me by my new name. He said I will call you Tigger if you want, doesn't change a thing. My grandparents were the same way and are being financially supportive with my college. But my mom called herself a failure as a mom and said sorry I'm stubborn like you but you'll always be my daughter. So I have mixed feelings about her but she said she really misses me. I am pretty homesick right now. I miss my siblings and my dad.

**So skip to last week**: my great grandpa passed away. This is someone who I spent a few summers with and who genuinely believed in my future as an artist. So this tore me up and I knew I wanted to go visit. He didn't want a funeral or a memorial. He was a family man who often did summer barbeques and burger burns in his backyard. I get word from my mom and grandma that his kids are going to have a burger burn in his backyard in a week or two.

My grandpa (son of great grandpa) recently lost his older brother and now his father and isn't doing so good. He lives up in Washington State with my uncle and brother. They are having the burger burn Sept 12 in Michigan. My command team has allowed me to leave for the weekend after risk assessment forms and getting the travel waived. I heard that my grandma and uncle will not be going to the burn and that my mother will. 

I am almost drawn to go visit my grandparents in Washington. But then I know my mom will be petty about me not going home to see her and the kids. This is my first encounter with death besides my dog (Rip Luke). I don't know what to do or who to go see. I am struggling to juggle all of these feelings and I want to use the time I am lucky to have, with my loved ones. Thank you in advance.",05Sep2020,1

So we are a family of 5. Father, mother, eldest brother, older sister, and me (16F) My sister has a strong personality (she got it from our dad) and she doesn’t get along with everyone else but me. 

So fast forward to when she got her first and current boyfriend. She’s very fond of him and let’s just say at first our (asian) parents weren’t so happy about it because she didn’t introduce him to the family right away... 

So anyways, it isn’t really a healthy relationship. Sometimes they (accidentally?) physically hurt each other and they can’t seem to fight maturely. She would hurt herself or even break things when as she cannot control her emotions. She’s also been having suicidal thoughts and my dad would send her text messages saying that she doesn’t need to be depressed and stuff like that. 

Tonight, a stranger messaged me asking about my sister. He was worried about her and messaged me because he saw me comment on her post. Apparently she was chatting with random strangers (from her university batch, but she doesn’t actually know them) to open up to them. 

Right now she is staying at a friend. She is in a very bad state rn as her boyfriend broke up with her for the second time (because of her mental health?) 

I am just really worried because she’s been hinting that she might do something bad as of tomorrow or so. What can I do? 

How do I help her?

In the meantime while I work on my mental health I want to get a part time job somewhere to help pay the bills and get out of the house.

This is where it sounds bad... I don’t want them checking my references. My references are good, but they will be very confused and I don’t know what that will do for my reputation and career.

Even when she showed me, I noticed they agressively begging for more after they ate. Same story when I went to feed them the next day, they went absolutely crazy over the food and then begged like crazy for more after. 

So I looked it up, and it seems like all the kitten feeding advice online says have food for them *all the time* because they're growing so quick, and there's way more risk of them being malnourished than overeating, and their bodies are good at regulating food intake, so if they're begging it's because they really need it.

613,"Just last friday, I saw my mom, her boyfriend and my younger sister for the last time at the airport before they flew out to start again in a new country. 
They’ve sold the house, packed up and figured everything out in 2 months after making the decision. 

I had a rocky relationship with my mom’s boyfriend, and still don’t like the guy, but that led to me moving out of my house at 16. I’m a very independent person, and never lived too far from my mom but I handled everything I needed to. This also led to many infrequent visits. 
I now live with my girlfriend and our cat, and have a stable job in the city, and still visited fairly rarely. So since I’m removed from my hometown, the fact that my family has moved out doesn’t make much of a direct impact on how I live my life. 

But, my girlfriend and I grew up in the same hometown so we come back for dinners with her family quite a lot. (My family wasn’t big on hosting casual family dinners.) and we just arrived this morning, stopped at her moms before going to her dads later. All of a sudden, knowing that my family is gone and my childhood home is no longer a place I can go to and see anyone and how different things are for me here, I got pretty upset. It hut much harder than I ever thought it would. I’m typing this out while my girlfriend goes and gets her hair done, and trying to figure out what I should do. I’m very upset, and don’t feel like going to the dinner because i’m afraid I might get a little more upset due to seeing family interact and be cheery while not only not having that sort of relationship with my own family, but also knowing now I can’t have dinner with them even if I wanted to. I’m afraid I might sort of dampen the mood, but I also don’t like to socialize when I’m not genuinely in a good mood. 

After having a long talk with my SO about how I’m feeling and how I think I should just go back home and distance myself from our hometown for a bit she keeps saying how her family loves and cares about me (which I know, and I love and care for them too) and I’m really having trouble with drawing the line for my own self care and just going for the sake of going to the dinner and not upsetting anyone as we just found out a few others have already cancelled. 

I normally deal with things on my own as I don’t like to socialize, and while I may have a good time at the dinner, being back resurfaced feelings that I didn’t think I’d have. My SO says her family would understand if I didn’t want to go but I’m not sure if I’m just being silly and that a dinner is gonna be fine or if my feelings are valid and while not showing up to dinner might be rude or disappointing, I should still do what I feel like I need.",05Sep2020,1
614,"Ok so before you get upset,  here me out first, context matters.

The owner is a complete loser who doesn’t give a fuck about his dog, he pets him once a day but that’s it, leaves him roasting in the sun. The guy is up until 5 am every night drinking like crazy and smoking. My friend has been the one taking care of him ever since they moved in. There’s times where he doesn’t have any water or food and my friend has to give him some. In his words “it’s basically like my dog.” Basically they share the same backyard, and they just got a big house cut in half and both each own a side. I was helping my friend move yesterday when I met him, he’s seriously one of the cutest dogs I’ve ever seen, he reminds me A LOT of my old dog before he passed away. I was playing with him for like an hour and when I had to leave he kept screaming and crying for me to come back and I kept coming back 5 times because I felt so bad but after an extra 30 mins I really had to go. My friend said that’s the fastest he’s ever seen that dog warm up to someone. 

So the plan was,  maybe in a month we go really late and just open the cage take him out and put him in my car. I just hope he isn’t microchipped.

615,"Please forgive me if it seems a bit rushed or not written that well. I just really need some advice. 

So we are a family of 5. Father, mother, eldest brother, older sister, and me (16F) My sister has a strong personality (she got it from our dad) and she doesn’t get along with everyone else but me. 

So fast forward to when she got her first and current boyfriend. She’s very fond of him and let’s just say at first our (asian) parents weren’t so happy about it because she didn’t introduce him to the family right away... 

So anyways, it isn’t really a healthy relationship. Sometimes they (accidentally?) physically hurt each other and they can’t seem to fight maturely. She would hurt herself or even break things when as she cannot control her emotions. She’s also been having suicidal thoughts and my dad would send her text messages saying that she doesn’t need to be depressed and stuff like that. 

Tonight, a stranger messaged me asking about my sister. He was worried about her and messaged me because he saw me comment on her post. Apparently she was chatting with random strangers (from her university batch, but she doesn’t actually know them) to open up to them. 

Right now she is staying at a friend. She is in a very bad state rn as her boyfriend broke up with her for the second time (because of her mental health?) 

Some of our relatives also called me to ask about how she’s doing. 

I am just really worried because she’s been hinting that she might do something bad as of tomorrow or so. What can I do? 

How do I help her?

What happens is my brother points out a thing they like and they get it. I did that once and got told ""cool"". 

Another thing is my dad didnt let me get a job until recently, so I dont have money yet. But since I will soon it feels like bringing this up would make me an ahole.",05Sep2020,1

I said okay and said his address. I didn’t think it was weird cuz he told me where he lived tho. He kept saying no when I kept insisting but I thought he was joking. Joking was a big thing we did. 
But ig it came off as creepy and he started being rude to me. We’ve been friends for a year. And he has been rude to me before but this shocked me. He started making me look like the bad guy. And he said he does this all the time. Then he said whatever ima gts. He was never this disrespectful to me. I feel
Like there’s something more going on then just him getting mad about he making a joke and coming off as creepy. We been friends for a long time. He kept saying good night and then I asked why is he so bothered and he told me “cause I got better things to worry about.” Clearly he doesn’t tho cuz he’s getting all mad. And he kept telling me he’s going to sleep and he’s trying to sleep. 

I do realize I’m in the wrong but he went too far. I apologized the next day and confronted him about his toxic past behavior and he just left me on read. And when he does that he will never reply again.

619,"Earlier this year I (23,f) got assigned a new flatmate who I feel is extremely rude at times.
She seems nice enough to talk to today, tomorrow she doesn’t even answer when I say hello.
Or only steps out of her room after days of not saying a thing to each other to berate me for not taking off my shoes right at the door.
With her Chinese visitors she’s always super bright and bubbly, then drops her facial expressions to say something courteously to me or quickly close her door when I enter the living spaces.
I know she left her former flat for quarrels with the other flatmates of whose lack or hygiene she said she got annoyed.
As a germophobe myself I think she can’t have issues with me with that. I can’t say that she’s so oderly, oftentimes I swipe the kitchen after her cause she doesn’t do it after cooking.
Of course we don’t know each other so well yet, so is this maybe a curtural misunderstanding or is she just a nasty individual?
My attempts at taking an interest in her and making some conversation also remained fruitless. Because unless I make a great effort, nothing gets said and even then I’m always at the random risk of suddenly get rebuffed.

620,"My friend K (24) has a crappy life. She cannot hold down a job for longer than a few months and she's been out of work for a while now. She'll get interviews but never get called back. She has some problems that she should really see a therapist for. She is a hypochondriac for one, she has a slight learning disability that she's been struggling with her whole life, her parents spoiled her her entire life and now that she's older they are trying to kick her out and force her to be an adult (she cannot handle it). Oh, and she is in an emotionally abusive relationship. 

Her boyfriend is 33 and still lives at home. He's had a steady job with benefits for 10 years now but for some reason claims that he cannot afford to live by himself. He has never tried to get a roomate and move out, he's never really looked, and it seems like he has no intentions to. K, hates living with her parents and really wants to move out but she wants to with her boyfriend. Everytime K asks him about this, he gets very angry with her and makes excuses. Excuses such as, ""I can't save money, I have a bachelor's party to plan and I have no idea how much that's going to cost."" ""I don't think we are on the same page about this moving out thing."" ""If you would hurry up and get a job maybe we could do that."" He is always very angry at her and asking her why it's taking her so long to get a job and her driver's license. He has continuously blamed her for the reason he is always broke. The real reason he is always broke is because he spends all his money on weed and video games. Oh and the weed thing. Every single time K needs him to be there for her, he can't be because he his high. For example, she had a job interview and she needed him to drive her. He knew about it for weeks and decided to get high the day he needed to take her. Then he got upset at her again for not just having her drivers license already. 

K is emotionally dependent on him. She cannot spend a day away from him or she cries. She does not trust him and always thinks hes out cheating (which I think he is too but whatever). They ""broke up"" the other day because she had to beg him to come pick her up from her parent's house so she could be with him. They went and got food first and he was so angry that he threw all the food out of the window, called her a cunt, and told her that he is falling out of love with her, and that people ask him all the time why he puts up with her shit. They ""broke up"" for the second time in their relationship. She called me crying and admitting that he is emotionally abusive and then got back together with him.

I am at a loss. She has not talked to me since, probably because she knows I'm upset with her. I know I can't do anything for her but this is very frustrating.",05Sep2020,1

All in all there’s not a lot of real drama and it’s a solid group, but last night, i met up with them at a friends house and one of the guys in our group started mocking me by imitating my voice (typical middle school copy cat shit) and criticizing my voice and how it sounds.  Now normally that would be whatever, but it got to a point where it would be every other thing i said, like over 5 times so i calmly told him to stop in front of everybody, i did tell him i would slap the shit out of him if he didn’t as well so i’m sure that inflamed it.  after that he did it multiple times anyway, and between those times i sat him down alone and said “i don’t like that, don’t do that anymore” pretty seriously.  it went on until the end of the night.  i’ve always been the type to stand up for myself but i don’t know what to do because he hasn’t listened at all and i can’t scream at him or hit him or walk away even because we’re so close.  i don’t know if i’m over reacting or what.  we’ve always had teasing back and forth but this strikes me as over the top because i’ve expressed that it makes me uncomfortable and annoyed and he hasn’t listened at all even in front of other people. any insight from an outside perspective? i know there could be something i’m missing",05Sep2020,1

I (F19) started talking an old friend (M21) that I haven’t seen for a few years. He had mentioned something about paperwork a few times, and how he wanted to talk about it with me. I always found it sus, as he never shared what it was even about. 

He finally told me he wasn’t a citizen, and that’s what he wanted to discuss with me. I had met up with him and he mentioned his situation &amp; how is work permit expired and he doesn’t have many options to stay. (He’s with DACA). He finally told me he wanted a marriage in order to stay in the US. 

I, obviously very taken back didn’t really know what to say because I was just shook. He mentioned how he would pay me, take me on trips and essentially just provide me with whatever i wanted, for however long I wanted. He also said we’d have to take pictures and do things together to actually look like a married couple. And also go to interviews discussing the things we do together. 

He explained that we’d sit down with his dad and we’d go over all of this information, but did mention how the “marriage” would only be 8 months (I guess he’s not getting his full residency). But i had done some research &amp; I found nothing about 8 months being an option.

630,"Hello guys,

So I'm having a dilemma and I wanted some outside perspective. A good friend of mine and her partner are hosting a rave. They will have 2 dj friends, and everyone they have invited are close friends that ive been told have social distanced and i have met in person. They have said around 15-30 people. The party is outside in a tunnel (public property) and it is masked themed so everyone is required to wear one.

Now where I am things are lightening up, but we still have laws for masks and social distancing. Because I work with these friends, and I see them practically everyday, I am comfortable being at this party. Although some people I don't know, they'll wear masks.

Here is my dilemma: I have a younger foster brother (16 months) who is immune compromised. He has a lew of medical issues (feeding tube, seizures, just discovered hole in his heart) that are unfortunately a serious concern. 

Now note: I do not live with him or my mom. I live 100 miles away (about a 2 hour drive) and do not interact. However, in the US, the labor day weekend has kicked off and my mom wants to meet up with me this weekend with the baby.

I'd love to see them, but i also would love to have a care free night with friends. But I don't want to risk my brothers health. I'm a bit torn, i haven't had a free night like this in months. And the party goers are wearing masks plus large venue.

634,"I just got my first tattoo today after months, if not years, of contemplating designs, sizes, areas, and most importantly, whether I really want it or not, given the permanence aspect of it. Today I finally got the courage to go ahead with it and get it done cause I had grown tired of constantly thinking but doing nothing about it.

The issue comes here. My parents are super narrow minded, especially about tattoos. My dad thinks tattooed people are trash, and the way he speaks about them is worse than how he speaks about criminals. I told them on some occasions that I might get a tattoo some time, but I think they didn't take me seriously and probably thought I was messing with them  to see how they will react (which to some extent I was).

I haven't told them anything at all about me booking an appointment today, let alone that I actually got it done. I did tell my sister who is usually super supportive of whatever I do and is amazed of all the new 'brave' things I do. However, she was never super approving of this tattoo, because of my parents' mentality. She thought I should wait until I move out. 

I didn't agree. I don't think my parent's or anyone else's opinions and thoughts about how I live my life should affect me in the slightest, given that my actions and behaviors are not truly causing some form of damage. The only damage being done here is challenging a backwards (and I might say ignorant) mentality which my parents never worked on themselves to level up from. So I feel it is their fault for sticking to old ways of thinking and never caring to challenge their thoughts. They are close minded on all sorts of things. My father is equally despicable when it comes to homosexuality. So I feel like his ideas would have been super damaging to me had I not gained a level of self-awareness and self-love, to realize that other people's beliefs have nothing to do with me. It sucks that such beliefs have to come from such important people in my life, but I guess that's how it is.

The advice I'm looking for is whether I'm in the right for thinking the way I do, or am I acting too privileged/entitled to not care about how me satisfying my desires will affect the family dynamics. I have to tell them some time or other because I don't wanna be secretive about it in the long run. I just haven't done it yet and don't know how I should do it.

Also, I don't like how I'm worrying my sister. She thinks I should avoid telling them about it if I can. To some extent I agree, but I'd rather get it over with. My father will probably be disgusting in his reaction and I'm a very impatient person but I do recognize that me getting a tattoo feels like I'm challenging them so I will respect the way they will process things and accept it, even though it might result in some extra (emotional) pain, over and above that I felt in getting it done :)

Please, any sort of advice will be very much appreciated.",05Sep2020,1
635,"Living in Canada, I enjoy smoking pot before a long bike ride or after a long day of work. No shame.

I called back again and the automated system kept telling me to unplug my cable box but I said no and it just hung up. The last time I called I was on hold for 30 minutes and when the person answered they sounded very nonchalant and like they didn’t want to be there. I don’t know why but that made me furious but I still kept calm. 

I calmly said that my bill went up $50 and they needed to fix it immediately or I was canceling my service. The lady said “okay one moment” without any explanation on what she was doing. I waited 2 minutes before I said “Hello? what are you doing?” and she says “One moment, i’m just reviewing this months bill and your previous bill”  I responded, “okay well you should’ve said that.” she didn’t respond. 

A couple minutes goes by and she tries to explain why the bill went up but I didn’t care. I just wanted her to fix the issue. So I said “Listen, I don’t care. Can you just lower the bill.” She responds, “I was just trying to explain what happened so it doesn’t happen next year when your promotion rolls off but okay” with the snarkiest attitude. I went off. I told her that she should lose her job for being so rude and that she was stupid for taking a job where she needed to help people and then not being willing to help with at least a positive attitude. 

In the middle of my rant, she placed me on hold. About 5 minutes later she comes back and i could tell she had been crying which made me laugh because she was rude to me but decided to be a victim. She ended up lowering the bill back to where I wanted and I made sure to give her a bad survey.

648,"I know the title sounds crazy but I’m really worried. My brother is 8 and I’m 20. 
I’m really concerned my brother might be a psychopath, so can someone give me a little insight? 

I know children can be manipulative (I think) but my brother has adult level manipulation skills. 
I was homeschooling him and some days he wouldn’t wanna do the full lesson so I would let him only do some things and then skip others and when this started becoming too regular and started saying no, he’d say stuff like “if you love me, you’d let me skip” “if you want me to love you, I don’t wanna do this work” “you’re a terrible sister for making me do this” “I’ll hate you if I have to” and I’ll admit. I’d cave because he’s the only one in my family I’m somewhat close to. 
The other day we had a heart to heart and I told him I’d love him no matter what, no matter who he loves or who he is and he came out to me and said he thinks he likes boys and I was like it’s okay. I’ll support you no matter what. And then I was on the phone with someone very important to me and he started being listening to my conversation and being rude to me, interrupting me and calling me a cow and stuff. I told him to stop it and behave and I turned back to my conversation and said I really thought he’d be different after our talk when he actually sneered at me “about that shit of me being gay” and laughed in my face. And I was so taken aback because he actually cried during our talk. 
Fast forward to that night he tells my parents and sister about my call and what was said and I was mad at him and told him I didn’t wanna talk to him. He basically tells me to get over myself, I’m cow that has no friends and it’s pathetic I feel like it even matters. 
Fast forward to today, I’m catching up with a girl from high school and he’s listening to my conversation and repeating me and mocking me and then he’s telling me “are you scared? Ohh the little baby is scared. Good. You better be” he’s telling me how pathetic and useless I am. How no one could love me. How he’ll never respect me. (I’m trying to ignore him and keep talking to my friend and I told her I was concerned about this and she thought this behavior isn’t normal) 

He’s read my journal constantly tries to read my messages and listen to my calls (we share a room so I have no privacy) and he threaten to stab me before. He often hits or smacks me. Or threatens to kick me in the face. Or will randomly look at me and say “it’d be so easy to kick your face in Rn” he’s aggressive and often shoves me or tries pinning me to the wall when he’s not getting is way. He constantly threatens to break my stuff (my laptop and phone) or take my stuff. (He does often go through my stuff and takes it) 

He doesn’t listen to me at all and I’ve had to resort to turning to my parents when it’s getting too much but they don’t do anything but tell him to stop. He switches moods or personalities so easily. One minute he’s being aggressive and pushing me around and the next he’s loving and asking for movie nights. He’s mastered crying on demand and then he’ll be smiling. He’s also hit my dogs and often shoved them if they don’t wanna play with him. 

Is this normal kid behavior? Am I reading too much into this? Advice?",05Sep2020,1
649,"So there’s a backstory to this. I met my friends a few years ago, in school, and we were all in the same class. The next year they changed the classes and I was in a class with one of my friends and the other two were in the other class. It was great at first but then the girl in my class had to go to another school and since then when I’m hanging out with my other two friends they leave me out. When we’re sitting in a row, for example, I’m always on one of the ends and the one in the middle will turn to talk to the one at the other end. When we have lunch they will ask each other wether they’re finished so they can leave and I always have to rush to join them. It’s just stuff like that. I don’t want to tell them because if I do then if they stop leaving me out it’ll be forced and I don’t want that. I kinda want to get some new friends because when I hang out with other people they don’t leave me out which is weird considering the other two are my own friends but I don’t want to leave my friend group.

651,"Hello reddit, I have a problem:

I have a 9 year old tabby who I let outside because I live in a very safe neighborhood. Recently I’m realizing that she is going to a particular house a lot. I always bring her in at 3:00 PM, but when I do, she smells like someone else’s house and BBQ. My biggest problem is that she’s starting to turn into a Chunk even though I’m not over feeding her. 

One day when I was trying to bring her back home I noticed a water bowl outside of the house she likes to visit. I started to think that maybe she was getting fed. I didn’t want to make a big deal of anything yet (because I wasn’t sure), so I knocked on the door to ask if I could get my cat out of their yard. They said “of course we love her, I pet her all the time.”

Hearing that raised questions. My cat hates everyone except me, so why in the world would she let strangers pet her. 

I just thanked them and left with my cat, but as time passed, I noticed that she’s becoming more and more chunky. I put her on a diet, but It’s not doing much. 

She’s now begging to go outside early to go back to that house.

I don’t know for sure, that’s why I’m not doing anything, but I’m not a fan of the idea that I’m being replaced.

And, I can’t keep her inside because not only will she complain, she will pee everywhere in retaliation (even though her litter box is clean and reachable).

Should I confront them even though I’m not positive? Really don’t know what to do.",05Sep2020,1

654,"I don't know if this belongs here but I don't know where else I should post this. I apologize in advance because English is not my first language, I'm on mobile and this is kinda long so I really hope it makes sense.

So basically I have to start really early in my life. My bio mom left after I was born, so no contact. My dad and I broke off contact a couple of years ago as well. So I've been living with my grandmother since I was a baby, even calling her mom (which I will be in this post) since I grew up with her. My mom has 3 children. My aunt, who moved away long ago and is in almost no contact with any of us, my dad and my uncle who visits quite often. Ever since I can remember my mom has been really controlling over me, I guess because I did have a hard life as a baby and she doesn't have a partner so it's always just been us two. I could never do anything on my own, I couldn't go out with friends which ended in me not having any friends at all. I could never participate in clubs or whatever, which could be because money has been tight as well. I don't know, I've never gotten any explanation from her. I grew up with being alone and so I just lived with it.
But now I've met a guy I really like and he lives kinda far away from me (we met when I was away working) and I really wanted to go see him. So I've asked her if I could go and she was already really pissed for literally no reason and said I should do whatever I want but leave her alone and don't count on her anymore. So I did want to go since she said I should do what I want and she stopped speaking to me and beeing really weird to the point of me saying I will not go. It's just so frustrating because it's not just this situation. Literally whenever I wanna do something on my own she starts to be really passive aggressive and guilt trip me into doing what she wants. Whenever I wanna talk to her about her behavior, she cuts me off saying if I feel like this I should leave and live my own life and never talk to her anymore. The thing is I can't. I just can't move out because she is old, having some minor medical issues and I'm basically the only one she has. I just feel responsible for her which I know Im not but I just can't leave her alone. She doesn't have a lot of money because most of our income is from my job. I give her almost 80% of my money for our apartment and food and everything so if I go, she couldn't afford a proper place to stay. So idk if this whole thing makes sense to anyone but honestly, I need advice on how to cope with this. I love her with all my heart but I simply can't live like this anymore. I feel like I can't live my own life without her beeing mad at every choice I make, no matter how small it is. She's basically controlling every single aspect of my life, what clothes I wear, how I spent my free time, what people I meet (which I don't do anymore because like I said above, I literally don't have friends anymore).
So if anyone has an advice they can give me, I'd really appreciate it.

Before lockdown, my Friday and Saturday nights were without fail, spent at my mates' house getting stoned. Now, I only see them once every 2 weeks(ish).

I have needed to hit the right mindset to start improving myself for a long time now and I think distance from these friends has probably been what I needed (as much as the psychological pain of wondering why things haven't just gone back to normal is a detriment). My issue is that I am getting SO bored on my Fridays/Saturday/Sundays now. 

I love to listen to music but I need to be doing something whilst I do that and browsing reddit for hours on hours is not cutting it. There's only so much photography I can look at on instagram. There's only so much I can actually go out and indulge in my photography. I have no desire to get stuck into video games anymore - my personality is too addictive for that.

658,"Hi there, the title is a bit misleading at first but Mochi is a cat/kitten to start off.

So there's this friend (in the loosest of terms, I actually can't stand the guy) who asked me back in July if I could watch his new kitten for a few days while he moved out (he was under the presumption that a) it would be easy to find housing during this pandemic and b) I, and two other friends would be moving in with him). Of course I said yes because who wouldn't want to take care of a 10 week old kitten for a few days? So this guy (let's name him Matt) and I go and pick the kitten (Mochi) up from the previous owner and we go and by a few things for the him (cat food, litter, a collar, a harness, and a few toys). Well a few days of me watching Mochi have now turned into a few months. Mochi is like a vacuum and goes through so much food and litter, so Matt bought another bag of food and litter (almost two months ago), since then I have been buying everything. 

So it is now September and I haven't heard from Matt in a month and a half (which you would think that if someone is taking care of your pet you would check in more regularly and want to see them??) So I decided to go ahead and text Matt asking if he still wanted Mochi/checking in on things. Matt got super defensive saying 'of course he still wanted Mochi, that it was his cat and that yes just been too busy to come by and see him.....(or to text and make sure he's okay)' (then proceeded to come to my house that night, pick up my roommate and go get food with him, still without asking to see Mochi) 

When i texted Matt I told him that I would love to keep Mochi if he no longer wanted him, that Mochi was my baby (after all I literally have been raising him since the moment mochi left his mom) and that I would reimburse Matt for the money that he has spent so far on the cat. Of course Matt got defensive again. Then I proceeded to say Mochi needs neutered because he's starting to spray and ruining some of my things and that can't keep happening. I'm reluctant to ask for the money to replace those things, Matt already owes me almost $100 for cat food and litter. A few of the people I have talked to about this situation have said that I need to be charging him for ""boarding"" his cat. Of course I wouldn't charge as much as an actual cat boarding place but this is getting ridiculous at this point. 

I would really appreciate a third party opinion on this. I love this cat and desperately want to keep him, but at the end of the day it technically still is Matt's cat I guess. And what should I do about the money situation?

660,"As my title says, he is a great guy, but he just has absolutely no idea what’s going on around him. Examples:

• At the store he will stand in the middle of the aisle as I’m picking something out even as someone is coming down the aisle with a cart and cannot get through. He won’t recognize he’s doing it unless I pull him out of the way.

• He will walk next to me on the sidewalk even if someone else is coming down the walkway and will not switch to single file to let them pass, even if it means they have to walk off the sidewalk, won’t even realize there was someone there or why that’s rude.

• He won’t open the door for other people, like the other day we were headed into our building and someone was leaving, a normal person would open the door, let them out, and then go in, she was expecting this, and he just opened it and almost ran right into her walking past. Didn’t even realize how rude that was.

• Our puppy gets into a lot of stuff. He was working on his laptop TWO FEET from her as she ate her own poop. I recognized she was doing this from the other side of the apartment and had to stop it. He never realized she was doing it.

Now, the stuff he does to other people is rude, and I wish he would have enough awareness to stop, but with the last one I’m honestly starting to get concerned that if we have kids I will never be able to leave the kid alone.

I’m an early childhood teacher and I know the sort of attention children need. With the lack of awareness in his surroundings I seriously worry a toddler would kill themselves and he wouldn’t even know. At least our puppy is pretty self sufficient, a toddler will climb on shit and not realize falling might seriously hurt them, and they can be so quiet he would never even know. 

I’m getting really worried about his lack of awareness and it is seriously not normal. He doesn’t realize how people around him feel so put off by his inability to be aware of them as well as himself.

670,Hi. So im 16 and I have 2 little brothers. One is 4 years younger than me and the other is 10 years younger. So my 12 year old brother is going through puberty and I want to be a supportive brother. What concerns me is that maybe his friends are a bad influence for him. I know when I was at his age bad friends really hurt me emotionally. This concern started when I was using WhatsApp desktop to move a file from my pc to my phone(couldn't be asked to move it through usb) and it was linked to his phone. So from curiosity I checked his messages to his friends and it was kinda a toxic place there. They called each other names and mostly were aggressive towards each other.  Now if they were close friends I wouldn't care because I did all of these with my friends all the time and I know it's not that uncommon. What worries me is that they are very distant friends and by that I mean they are friends of his friends if you get what I mean. So i don't know how to react to this.

How do you reply to an open invitation to hangout at someone’s home? I (F25) live in an apartment complex and my neighbor (F57) and I have gotten to know each other a little bit over the last few months. She has a view of the parking lot and can tell when I’m home. I really value my time alone on the weekends and with the pandemic going on there’s no where to leave my apartment to go to. She’s nice enough, but I hate the sentiment that if I’m home then I’m free. 

Setting boundaries is not something I do well. Historically I let people walk all over me and have a hard time saying no because I don’t want them to feel bad. But spontaneous meet ups really stress me out. I prefer to know when and how long I have to be social beforehand. How do I keep my sanity without hurting her feelings? 

\-

Some additional info from my overthinking: 

She has an ongoing feud with her downstairs neighbor and constantly complains about the noise. This neighbor has always been nice to me. She hates them and has never been able to move past it or work it out. She's even threatened violence. I don't want to be dragged into the middle of it. Especially if the downstairs neighbor is being loud when I'm at her place. 

I’m about the same age as her 2 kids and as far as I know they don’t visit and rarely call. I get the feeling she’s lonely. To be honest I’m not sure if she sees me as another adult/neighbor or as a substitute for them.",05Sep2020,1
675,"To keep it short, my ( F 28) neighbor (M 30) asked me out almost 2 months ago. His live-in GF ( F 21) found out, there was some drama, yadda yadda, things ended badly, and I told them to leave me alone, don't come into the store I work at while I'm working, and don't talk to my mother (yes, he was talking to my mother about asking me out, among other things). He has me blocked on Facebook, and I have both of her accounts blocked.

While my boss was definitely supportive of me telling them not to come in while, I was working, legally we couldn't deny service, and they can't ban them unless they do something worth banning over. Which is fine, I don't want them banned, I just want them to stay away from me, to keep me out of their many problems and not to start anything with me in the store.

Problem is, since my neighbor started messaging me, the GF has started coming into the store more often, specifically during my shifts. Before, she left their house so infrequently, I had never even seen her, despite being neighbors, and my co-workers could barely describe what she looks like. If it wasn't for a tattoo and the fact she was pregnant, we wouldn't have been able identify her, after describing an incident where a customer (her) lingered in the store for a long time, watching me.

And, it's gotten progressively worse. She now only comes in at all when I am working, every day that I am working, sometimes at least twice a night and more. My co-workers and I have been keeping track, so it's not just me being paranoid. I can't do anything to stop her, as what she's doing doesn't legally count as harassment, and my boss has made it clear she has to do something or say something to me that's threatening or so to be banned.

So far, I'm doing is:
   1) Keeping track of when they both come in. Co-workers are also doing this to provide proof she's only coming in if I am working.
   2) I get another co-worker to check them out if either one comes in. If I am by myself, I am not to say anything.
   3) I have my car parked directly in front of my house, so I can just cut through the front, instead of having to walk out onto the deck and front steps  down to my garage, which she'd be able to see if she was watching from a window at the back of her house.
   4) Avoiding my back yard on days I work, so she can't watch and see if I'm headed in to leave for work.

I don't know what else I am able to do, and I'm dreading the day I am in the store by myself and she comes in (which could possibly be today, as I am working the closing shift, and our deli isn't open on weekend afternions). Any advice or other precautions I could take would be greatly appreciated.",05Sep2020,1

My breasts impede almost everything in my life. I can’t wear things like tank tops, button ups, bathing suits, dresses, etc. I actually just had an incident in public a few days ago where all the buttons on my shirt popped off, thankfully I was wearing a bra. And I’ve even gained a little bit of weight because it’s next to impossible to workout. And don’t even get me started on the catcalling...

I’m getting really sick of these, especially since it was the summer and I refused to go out in thin clothing or a bathing suit. I’m forced to wear oversized, baggy clothing to hide my body, mostly by my mother, who doesn’t want me going out really exposed.

I know my breasts are no where near done growing (my sister has the same problem, hers are much much bigger than mine and everyone knows I’m just gonna be following in her footsteps). I’ve always had breast reduction surgery on my mind, but I’ve always been told that my body is still growing and changing and getting any kind of cosmetic surgery would mess me up.

677,"I forced myself to quit porn completely as I wanted to stop myself from seeking anything more serious like using chat sites, I managed for about two months but messed up last night. 

Just for context, I'm (21 M) in a good relationship at the moment and have been for a few years now. I've always tried to improve as a boyfriend and I always try to be supportive. I do love her very much. 

My issue is, I exposed myself to adult chat rooms and cam sites at quite a young age and I've struggled with urges about fantasies in the past - I do think I'm oversexualised because of this and I've tried to sort myself out.

On a few occasions, usually when I'm drunk, I've gone onto an anonymous chat site and spoke to strangers sexually, it always gives me a buzz but I feel absolutely awful about myself after. 

I dont share anything identifiable. I always pick myself up and resolve to never do it again but once in a while I'll find myself doing it. I just want to be a decent person for her.

I do feel that although this is a grey area cheating wise, that its deceiving and might as well be. Just want some advice on what I should do please? Should I explain the situation to her?

TL;DR occasionally use chat sites sexually, I feel like I've cheated, want to know what I should do please and if I should tell her.",05Sep2020,1

I’m someone who hates working. Its all about money to me. I couldn’t care less about being passionate about my jobs I just need a cash flow. 

I started college this year and I’m already positive this isn’t for me. It’s reminding me why I hate high school. Stressing about tests and exams. Studying. Juggling six classes at a time...

I’m from a fairly well off family. I really only need a job that’s around 20,000 grand a year. I was considering hairdressing but I have no desire to get into that. I’m also looking to only work part time until I have to get a full time job...

I’m honestly looking into dental assisting. I know I’ll have to study but it’s one class and and it’s a year instead of 4+ years and then finding out my degrees useless. I’d rather get a job out of school.

684,"Hi,

So I graduated in May with a history diploma. My plans were to go to law school but due to the pandemic, and my fam's financial problems, I had to postpone my dreams of becoming a lawyer. When I was thinking about it though, it might have been for the better. Becoming a lawyer is a long and a difficult path that may not suit me well at the end.

Anyways, I quickly applied to a Master's in GIS(Geographic Information Science) program at a decent school. But then, I realized, that something that I like the most about it, making maps, is not actually something that GIS professionals do that often. 

I also got accepted to a Master's in Big Data Science program. Data is really interesting, and the job in data is pretty cool. I like analyzing things. I'm afraid though, that I might lack technical skills, such as programming, for the employers, and that they might look for people who have a strong background in finance, computer science etc. And that it won't be easy to find a job. 

Two other paths that I could take are Master's in Management or taking a gap year and studying for the LSAT and trying to make it in law. 

What should I do? It may be funny for you guys, but I'm currently enrolled in three different programs, law(JD), GIS and data science at three different schools in three different states. 

School starts pretty soon and I'm really confused. I need help or an advice. My ex gf broke up with me and it made me lost and depressed in life.

I'm currently leaning towards Data Science diploma as it is something I find quite fun, and there is plenty of good paying jobs out there.",05Sep2020,1

Hey all,

* this account is a throw away as we are dealing with a weird situation\*

A week ago we were shaken down over an interview, and we were asked to ""donate"" to an indie journalist as they ""like to give favorable reviews. "" This was after we gave them media preview keys.

When we declined they released a negative article about us, and again asked us to interview, for a second article and possibly a revisit of the first article. They allude to something bad would happen if we didnt go along. They also reminded us about the Patreon again. We told them to go away and revoked their keys

Within hours our social media posts emails and store pages were getting bombed/ false flagged. We reported to Steam and they did nothing.

We did a background check on the company and they don't exist, their phone number leads to 30 other websites. We brought his to Steams attention. They did nothing

A few days later they posted a negative review on our page and flamed us for revoking the keys, told were we were based out of and started calling us liars ( we reported this to Steam and to Steam moderators, Steam did nothing. They went so far as to advertise on every one of their reviews about their magazine/ online review in not only our review but every review they did. This is clearly a violation of Steam Rules

After 1 week there was still no action except now Steam has deleted our store page as there were too many user ""flag"" of review rigging.

We didn't rig any reviews at all. we only really had 13 most of the reviews from indie journalist/ streamers. 1 negative review from this extortionist.

We asked for any reference and Steam wont reply. We asked what accounts are in question, and we can't get any input.

This is crazy as we are a start up with 25 employees working remote. No one did a false review, and if there was an issue we can't even do an internal investigation as Steam wont give us feedback

We got zero warning, zero feedback, and zero response on the report of us being extorted and bombed/ false flagged.

I am sort of beside myself trying to figure out what to do as we are trying to do a second raise from investors and this could put us out of business.

If we had an employee break the rules we would act on it right away, but we can't get any information.

I'd love if anyone had any insight",05Sep2020,1

But if you're missing a day of lecture or just sitting in your office to celebrate a special day I think thats pretty acceptable. 

I do think that some people could still go to school and work and celebrate their birthday if their schedule allows. Such as if you work an early morning job and get off in the afternoon.

696,"I've known this person for 9 months. Me and them are best friends and have been there for eachother through a giant amount of shit. Like mountains.

We,for the longest time,talked every day for a long time and both had great fun. Than about a month and a half ago they went on a break from social media and friends. Now I'm very introverted and I can't spend too long around lots of people,I become extremely exhausted and mentally drained. Usually this comes after a couple of hours and I need a bit in a chill 1 on 1 party to recharge. 

After they came back from her break we spent 3 days straight not hanging out in parties alone together and spending 10+ hours with our mutual friend group each day. I expressed to them how I understand they're extroverted and obviously need to be around lots of people but I can't do that and I would appreciate if we could hang out more. She had clearly stated that she really enjoys chilling with me and had stated dozens of times in the past that she had no problem hanging out with me.

They understood and promised they would make more time,as they missed hanging out too. This did last for a day or two..but it began going downhill quickly. Every week I've had a discussion about this after they stopped reaching out for a day or two or became extremely cold to me for extended periods of time. It gets better for a day or two and then goes back to normal. I've been straight up ditched twice and forgotten completely about for multiple days. They spend most of their day hanging out with 2 other mutual friends and I feel like I've been replaced. I feel like a used toy.

They've told me consistently that they like hanging out with me,don't mind hanging out 1 on 1,etc. Yet every week I have the same bloody discussion after they stop reaching out or asking to talk. Than most of the times I bring it up they insult me or snap at me. I feel like I'm going insane.

I'm not over exaggerating our closeness either as we talked almost every day for 7-8 months for hours. I helped them through a bunch and they've told me secrets and talked to me about things that not many other people have heard. I talked them up before their proposal for godsake and have kept secrets for them. I've jeopardized me mental health just to make sure theirs was okay and they have quite literally said they owe me their life. I don't expect to be paid back but I just thought I had a friend who really cared for me.

It doesn't feel like it. I hope things get better. We haven't talked in a day now and I don't want to go through the process of trying to fix this for the 8th bloody time as they would happily sit back for 3 days without talking to me. But they continually say they adore talking to me and see me as a son and that things will get better.

I understand things are hard in their life. I understand they have a lot of shit on their plate at times. But I just can't do this anymore. I'm not abandoning them. I really love them like my own family and they say they see me as family too.

I found a lot of screenshots that made me wanna throw up. When her abuse got so bad that I wanted to kill myself I finally told dad about everything I found out. He just shrugged it off and said its normal for married couples to do this. But he also said that he wasn't aware of it and he just doesn't care.

There were 2 other guys in the car and they were going to grab some snacks. So they were heading to the grocery store too.

Anyways, with that being said, throughout the past few months I have gotten into some arguments via social media/text with some family members about everything that is going on right now (BLM, protesting, rioting, etc.). It’s disheartening to read some of the stuff they say/post and I recently have been at my wits end. The ones who claim that they care about “all lives” but fail to support BLM. Not only that, but they truly believe they aren’t racist &amp; they are. I have many examples I could write but trying to keep this as concise as I possibly can. I had one family member tell me “If black people are so oppressed they should go visit their relatives in South Africa and they’ll come back kissing the ground.” That message was a lot to un-pack with the blatant racism, lack of intelligence, furthermore, but it’s hard to argue with an idiot. 
These past few months, I have felt very down on myself because of the impact this has had on me. These people tell me I lack education and need to do my homework on this country’s history. I just want to say, I don’t claim to be the smartest person, far from it, but I do my best to educate myself &amp; I did graduate with a bachelors degree. Not that college = intelligence, but it seems they don’t like actual facts so they go with “I’m not educated” and “I come from a generation who eats tide pods so I don’t have any brains”.

Im just bored and uninterested in everything, I used to be alot more creative when I was younger but that hope left once I realised I didnt want a 9 to 5 job and wanted to work on my own projects. Its not too bad. Im just stuck and lost and confused and miserable. I'm just waiting it out, its not too bad but I cant get rid of feeling hopeless and miserable like this 24/7",05Sep2020,1

Today I had 2 positive pregnancy tests and I haven’t told anybody yet, not even my best friend. I know I’m not ready to be a parent and this is not how I pictured bringing my children into the world, this isn’t what I want. I am almost certain I won’t be going through with the pregnancy.

716,"
Bit of background... I’m 18 working for a government organisation. 

So I was a victim of a sexual assault a few months back and was given someone to help with my welfare as I was really affected by what had happened previously and it had ultimately made me suicidal. This person sort of acted as a mentor to me. He is a 37 year old engaged man. There is a big power imbalance in our positions, in my workplace it is a big NO NO to fraternise with trainees. He has spent longer working for this organisation then I’ve been alive so he does know the rules inside and out. This person texted me everyday after being my designated welfare person. Nothing got that personal whilst I was working there, just informal friendly messages. This person gained my trust, after what I’d been through I was left very isolated so having communications with this person was the only thing keeping me going as I wouldn’t speak to anyone. After I left this workplace and moved on he started to sexualise the messages, I went a long with it as I really trusted this person. I did think it was a bit weird though. 

After maybe a week if leaving the workplace he hinted at staying in a hotel with him. I changed the subject this time. Anyway a month down the line things had escalated and I did stay in a hotel with him and did enjoy it. However after he got what he wanted things just died down. He would barely message and it just put me in a cycle and my mental health was really impacted. I felt ashamed and embarrassed. I really trusted this person and liked him a lot but my friends just talk about how it was grooming. I have looked into it and all of the stages do match to grooming but it is hard to admit. Is it really grooming if I really liked this guy? I should mention the guy never made any threats or was never threatening, I feel like this goes against grooming a bit.

I should mention. After I started to realise things I confronted him and he insisted a fresh start, going back to being a mentor figure again. I stupidly accepted this but then blocked him as my mates told me it was the right thing.

As I mentioned this is highly wrong to have this kind of relationship with the position difference in my organisation. Word got out and my bosses want me to file a complaint and disciplinary action will take place to this individual. I really need advice on everything? 

One minute I see this person to be the vilest human ever and the next I see his innocence. What do I do? 

Did this guy see me as a target and take advantage of a previous victim of sexual assault, knew I was isolated and had these intentions the whole time? Or do you think he truly cared. I know you don’t know the full details and only I do but what does it look like.

Is this still grooming if I really liked the guy at the time?",05Sep2020,1

Yesterday, in a dressing room at a store, I started crying. I hate dressing rooms. The mirrors, the stress, the lighting. My mom was in the dressing room next to mine. She told me to shut up. I finally just broke down, and for the first time, I admitted I have an eating disorder. She started screaming at me about how I just create problems for myself, and she yelled that she didn’t want to hear about it again. I stopped crying.

724,"I (18M) dated a man (31M) about six months ago for a period of a few months. 

It was a little rocky; my anxiety and OCD is pretty bad and his lack of understanding did not help. Our first date was very nice. We walked around the city and went back to his apartment. I wasn’t planning on spending the night, but I did.

As you might’ve guessed, I usually go for older men. Lately though, I have been more wary of older men because many of the ones I have dated have been so jaded and miserable, which I understand to an extent (I am not stereotyping by any means, this is just my personal experience). This leads me to my point, which is that he tells me that most men have just used him for sex, didn’t care about his feelings, etc.

So, before spending the night with him, he told me that he didn’t want to do anything sexual and wanted to take things slowly. Well, eventually, we were cuddling, and we both became aroused. He grabbed my dick a few times without asking, talking about how hard I was and etc.

This bothers me. I have had a weird relationship with sex in the past, because my first time doing anything sexual was a shitty hookup at 17 ; my next time was with a man I was dating, who forced me to touch him without asking first.

He did later ask me that night if I wanted to have oral, and I consented. It has been months and we are no longer dating, but we are still friends. We are semi-close. There is a mutual care that is there.

I called him for about an hour the other day, and for some reason, how he touched me without asking was on my mind. I told one of my friends about it, and he said that if it’s on my mind, I should talk to him. I don’t want to open a whole can of worms though about something that I’m clearly overthinking...

Maybe he thought I was teasing him or that i was grinding against him or something when we were cuddling. I don’t know. It’s been so long ago, but it’s still on my mind... Maybe it’s because of my sexual trauma that I’m interpreting this way?

I once had a man tell me that it’s “normal” in the gay community for men not to ask; but normalcy doesn’t make something right, you know? I feel like I’m just overthinking it though, because I don’t think he would have intentionally done something that I was uncomfortable with.

So... yeah... sorry if this is a pointless post... at least I’m able to vent if it is, but I would appreciate advice... Thank you.",05Sep2020,1

         I’m going to try to state this situation as unbiased as possible. Beware it’s a bit long. 

         I (F) am about to turn 21 and am planning my birthday party. I live in a small college town and my hometown (a bigger city) is about two hours south. I have been planning on having a weekend getaway at my dad’s newly remodeled home that’s a 10 minute walk from the downtown area. My dad is even going to go out of town for the weekend so we have the house to ourselves and he would buy us groceries and leave money for going out. A tad more info I’m a little bit of a person who enjoys being extra and going all out for things so I do not want to do something small for my bday.
         I texted 5 girlfriends about my plans asking if they would be able to make it, three responded yes while the other 2 asked why I wasn’t doing it in our small town. I responded that: 1. I want to see my family 2. My dad has a pool 3. It’s what I want to do for my birthday. I let them know I was having a small group of close friends over the day before I drive down to my dad’s house, and told them they could just go to that, they said yes to that. Am I justified in being upset that 2 of my best friends won’t come with for my birthday?

732,"I (24f) live in a dry cabin in Alaska with my partner (20F) and back in March our Toyo stove broke ( heating system). We told the landlord and he didn't really do anything about it all summer , which is fine since it was hot outside. 

August rolled around and it started to get colder at night. We kept texting him about fixing it and he asked if we would move into an apartment he has that is more than double our rent. We declined and finally he told us he would fix it by the end of the month. He gave us a little electric heater, but it doesn't work very well and only heats the loft. It's also making our electric bill crazy high.

Finally on September 1 he brought in another Toyo stove. But it's broken and he needs to fix it. He told us on Tuesday he would come back Friday and never did. I texted him about and he said he got into another project and would stop by Tuesday Sep 8th.

I'm really worried because the electric heater barely works and this weekend is supposed to drop into the 30's. We also can't keep it on all night because of fire hazard so we have been sleeping with lots of blankets.

733,"I'm posting this although probably no one would comment, but I just might as well take this chance.

I don't understand how I look. Like, I do know what is my physical appearance and what are my physical traits, but I'm just not able to process this information like I do about other people.

This started when I was a child. I was chubby, very different from everyone and not in the ""cool"" section. I didn't care back then about the way I looked, and when I started to care I just figured out I'm not that good looking, and sub-consciously decided to repress the way I myself. I think I figured that if I don't have the looks, at least I'll do things the best way I can, and so I did. 

Puberty changes me, yet I completely ignored it as I repressed anything appearance related. I didn't try to dress nice, didn't try to make my body look good. I just tried to act as the best me I can.

However, for the last year or so this became an issue. My amazing gf compliments me a lot, and I understood at some point that because I repress the way I look, because I refuse to process it, her compliments only make me confused, and their meaning is lost. 

It's not that I'm not good looking. I'm tall, I have wide shoulders, I'm pretty muscular (but not too much) and I know these traits, for the most part, make a person relatively good looking. If I saw someone with a mostly similar body to mine, I'll probably think he's good looking. However, I just can't apply this to myself. For me, my body is just irrelevant, how I look and dress and my physical traits shouldn't mean anything, all that matters is what I do.

But this is bad for me. It hurts my relationship, it stops me from fully accepting myself, from being aware of myself (I often forget that I'm a pretty big person, and constantly I bump into things, mostly walls), and I want to change it. I have tried to do so for a long time now, but I just don't feel like anything have changed. I know the physical facts about myself, but I still don't feel anything about my own body. My body can't be good because it's not on this kind of scale, yet everybody else's is. 

I don't know if there's anything to do, but if anyone has any advice for me - I'd be grateful.",05Sep2020,1

i do dress well tho forsure... i mean, i can do way better but just cant seem to find items i like...

i dont really talk to anyone. have literally 0 social media presence. and i always look angry as ppl tell me.

well, i can be the literal opposite of that too, a jokestar, loud asf (i havent been like that in a while) and what not. but it def isnt the type girls would find romantically atttactive, immature asf...

but, mainly, girls that like me... i havnt even talked to them, so its not personality as well..

i like playing sports for fun, but never been known for it.. like again, not bragging, but im talented asf in lots of things (sports are def one of them, i just lack practice) but i literally dont have a thing im known for... like a talent or whatever.. 

the main reason why im known is that... being popular among girls..

738,"I love her, she loves me, but i don’t know if i can be with here anymore. she’s depressed so i’m scared to leave

Alright so this is gonna be my first ever post and this is gonna be a very very fucking long story but i really need help cus i can’t do it anymore.

So this is the deal, i’m in a long distance relationship with my girl, i’m 17, shes 18, we’ve been dating for over 7 months and known each other for a year now (we were basically best friends throughout that whole time). i really do love her and i know she loves me so much but i don’t know if i can continue to be here cus it really hurts.

for simplicity let’s call my previous girl bestfriend: jessica
girl best friend no.2 : amy

Alright so it all started nearly a year ago when we met by chance and we basically instantly clicked. At the time i had DEEP feelings for this girl and it was the first person i ever was in love with (this girl was also my bestfriend of about 7 months at this point) - but she didn’t love me back and i would always talk to my girlfriend about this jessica and my girl at this point in time was in a committed relationship with another man. by the way, jessica was also overseas in another country but i had flown out to see her a few months before i ever even new of my girlfriends existence. Meanwhile, while this was happening, i was also best friends with amy and me, jessica and amy were like a bestfriend trio kinda thing (amy was also abroad).

During this period of me having feelings for jessica my girlfriend was being abused by her boyfriend at the time and went into the mental institution for help and she was on the verge of suicide, while i was still simping over jessica (at this point i told jessica i was in love, she said no due to the distance) and as mean as it sounds and there’s no excuse for it but i was always comparing jessica and my girlfriend. Meanwhile me and amy were still just really close friends and that’s it.

a few weeks after that i lose my feelings for Jessica and i tell her and she’s fine with it and i was really close friends with both amy and jessica and i was really happy. 2 months after this, my girlfriends abusive boyfriend breaks up with her for the third time and i tell her to leave and she does after long convincing. A few days later we fall for each other and we start going out. and this is where it all goes south—

So since jessica was my closest friend for the longest time ever and i literally spent so much just to see her and honestly it was probably the best day of my life just to hug her. My girlfriend wasn’t okay with us being friends anymore and since i was so hung up on keeping her in my life that we argued about it, and in the end i ended up telling her that we can’t be friends anymore and then the same happened with amy and i had to cut them off, and then whenever i went out with a friend, she’s ignore me for hours and when i got back home she’d yell at me and cry and get angry and then i just got scared to do anything. 

And then something came up from before our relationship where i kinda kink she’s her to jessica (i have those kinks now) and i truly am sorry for what i did and i don’t even remember doing it and i genuinely am sorry cus i was an ass person but yeah we nearly broke up over that and then a few months later jessica randomly called my phone and asked for help because she was suicidal and really wanted to kill herself and i had to listen to her cus she’s still my bestfriend in my heart but i had to tell her that i can’t help her and it killed me, i was genuinely crying for days and then i had to tell my girlfriend cus i didn’t want to keep it and we nearly broke up over that. 

And she’s always telling me how disgusting i am when she thinks about that stuff and how she hates me and wishes we never met and doesn’t even know why she’s with me, and i never make her feel loved cus telling her i love her isn’t anything to her, she wants me to buy her stuff and deliver flowers and do everything for her when i am a broke 17 yr old studying trying to get into university and don’t get me wrong i have bought stuff but it’s just not enough for her, she says.

And i can’t have any thought of my own with her, whenever i try and explain why i’m sad she says i’m making excuses, even when she’s definitely in the wrong i get on my knees and i’m the villain. like i can’t stand it, she got mad at me cus she thought i was a trump supporter even though 1. i live in the Uk 2. i’m not political at all, but she nearly broke up with me for that and she’s broke up with me before keep in mind, twice actually, and i took her back after it in a heart beat both times. She constantly tells me how she. hates me and then a few hours later she tells me she’s sorry and that she loves me and i know that all the negative stuff she says is from her heart but she denies it. Yesterday i told her about how i know she doesn’t love me as much and she says it’s because of her depression, and i don’t want to be mean but i don’t know if i can take care of her depression on my own, with no friends - cus she made me cut them all off, while trying to get into university. but don’t get me wrong i really do love her and i want to help her but i was happier when she was just my friend.

The other day she nearly left me because i said i didn’t want to make an instagram post on my page because i want my page to be about me - and keep in mind we’ve never met in person so it’s not a pic of us two, it’s just her... before i posted her on my page i was posting her on my insta story like 2 a week and the post before that was a slide of my face and a pic of her on the second slide and she got mad that she wasn’t first and i’m so sick of it. Yk sometimes i catch myself wishing that jessica would’ve just said yes and then i take it back and no i don’t have feelings for jessica 😑 i just miss my bestfriend and i’ve lost everyone and now everyone i know irl makes fun of my cus of her being so obsessive and ik i was really mean to her but i don’t know if i’m even happy anymore cus looking back on it jessica made me happy and even amy made me pretty fucking happy and i wish i could just talk to my bestfriend again cus it hurts so much and i cry a lot and im so dead inside and she’s also depressed right now and if i go then she’s probably gonna die and i don’t know what to do.

and i’m not saying i’m in the right here i know i fucked up so bad but idk...

i don’t even use reddit but i just need someone to talk to cus everyone i have is now gone, please someone help me.",05Sep2020,1
739,"I'm 20 and about to start my second year in Pedagogy. I had severe mental health issues during first year and often didnt attend lectures because of social anxiety. I also disliked the major in general.. Somehow I managed to get through.. After lots of thinking, now I am sure that.. It's just not my thing. I have never been interested in teaching. I don't know why i picked it.. 

The problem is, I already dropped out of another uni before that, was major Economics (actually my mother forced me to enter it) i ended up attending that one 10 days and gave up.

 Said to myself okay this time  I will just pursue what I want and not listen to what others have to say. But I guess I was wrong and made a huge mistake. Now I am afraid to drop out for the second time. I feel like a failure. On top of that, my parents are paying for my semester.. I am an awful person, they will be so disappointed.. What do i do? I'm so scared of my parents' reactions.. They might even get a heart attack.. Sorry for the bad english, its not my first language.",05Sep2020,1

I just couldn’t stop myself from falling in love with her ! I started to like her so much ! And we were stared talking like we are best friends ❤️ relatives were shocked but didn’t said anything 😂 ! then when she was about to leave the city she just wrote in paper 143 😅 and after few days i just called her told her i love her a lot from that day and she said i loved you from the day one ! So we had a long distance relationship for like 3 months but then i saw she started ignoring me a lot and in her fb she had a lot of male friends ! She used talk to them a lot ! I stared to hear rumours and I couldn’t do anything! And I can’t even talk to her whenever i want or chat because her mom doesn’t allow her phone ! And doesn’t like to see talk to me a lot thats what she said but she lied  probably! 
Whatever i was so broken and  i told her about all that she didn’t even care after that i broke up with her ! Many days passed then she came to me and said sorry i ignore you a lot i was in lot of problem actually my mom tortures  me a lot ! We will never work out !

Another problem is he has and can randomly show up to mine and another one of the group house because we are in walking distance and he tries to input himself into whatever we’re doing.

I (18M) recently started college and am starting to realize how lonely I am. Only other time I even attempted to start a relationship was asking someone out (wrote a letter like a fool) and ended up getting rejected even though I knew she probably didn’t feel the same. Recently started snapping a girl (added me because her mom asked my mom for my info [both go to same college and have interest in music, and with everything going on parents are thinking it’ll be hard to make friends]). She also added me on Instagram (didn’t realize until today) as well. Been snapping since Tuesday, and not really sure what to do. She seems nice, and would probably get along great since similar interests. Most snaps are on delivered for a few hours unless she reads them, then we have a convo for  5 mins then it’s back to delivered. From what I can tell after seeing her insta today (no posts) she doesn’t use social media that often. What I’m asking is how do I start getting to know her better, and possibly find out if she’d be interested when it comes time to figure that out. Not the best looking so I’ve only sent face shots, and am planning on working on myself soon.

But it's just that I panic so much when I see them the only solution I can think of is killing them right away, I know it's bad but they make me panic. I know it might sound exaggerated but I genuinely ended up trying to pray to say sorry to them and I ended up tearing up because I feel bad about having done it. In the past few months, I was still just as scared but I tried the most possible to capture them and release them outside to let them alive instead but these last days it seems I have just gave up because of how many I find in my house, it's overwhelming and so I chose the easy solution-vacuuming them all, I'm deceived in myself because I feel like I just gave up on my morals.

one day something happened that ended our friendship. basically he kicked me out of the meetup that he invited me to because i didn’t like someone that was there (he knew i didn’t like them and the day before he told me he wouldn’t be there) and i got mad about it. we argued and we stopped speaking. i reached out to him a month after that but he said he didn’t want do deal with my arguments anymore. i requested to follow him on instagram a few weeks later but he declined. 

that happend almost a year ago, i haven’t texted him since then. ever since he left i’ve always felt like something was missing and i though about texting him a lot but i couldn’t because i didn’t want to deal with the embarrassment of being left on read. he’s always been on the back of my mind and some days were worse than others but i’ve never missed him enough that it affected my ability to go through the day, until now.

the last few days i’ve missed him more than i used to. the other day i saw a dream about him where i time traveled back in time to when we were friends, then in the dream i kissed him and told him that i loved him. i felt weird when i woke up because i’ve never felt like that towards him and i’ve never had a dream where i told someone i loved them, let alone kissed them. is this a sign from the universe that i should text him? 

i miss him more than ever and i’ve realized how toxic i used to be a year ago. i’m not toxic anymore and i never will be as toxic as i used to be. honestly if i was in his place, i would have stopped being friends with me too. i want to at least apologize for how badly i treated him when we were friends and if he’s willing to give me a second chance but i don’t want him to leave me on read or show the texts and make fun of me with his friends. his friend circle has changed a lot (also most of them hate me) and i’ve heard that he’s become a really bad person compared to who he used to be.

To give some background, I work a part-time job a few days a week making $9/hour. He does not work and never has had a job. I don’t know his personal financial status but his parents pay for _everything_. His family is pretty affluent to say the least.

We pretty much do our grocery purchases separately, but when it comes to mutual items or something we want to share, we either split the cost or trade times paying for it outright. A lot of the time, he seems very hesitant to pay and will usually try to pass it on to me to pay for. Additionally, he will pick things up and act like I want to share it so he doesn’t have to pay for it all and we’d split it instead. I usually say “No” to that though.

It just seems weird that he wants me to split the cost or pay for things a lot, especially since he’s not personally paying for it. I obviously don’t want to exploit his parents either but they work full-time and most certainly are in a better position financially than me.

Firstly how do I explain this to my girlfriend I love her more then life itself. just we haven't been in the best of places because of me not being myself I don't know how to be myself if I can't think and I just honestly really don't like myself anymore. this new me or this old me. I'm stuck really badly.   
I wanna be me again. but how do I do that if I hate myself so much and have so many family issues regarding my identity and who I am I think I'm trying too hard to please everyone. She got angry at me because I got a haircut (were both females) because it looks like my ex-best friend's haircut who kinda used to like me and she really hates her.

780,"I’m [16F] moving back to my hometown... and although it may sound great to some, i’m afraid that my old days will come back. I moved to Oregon to live with my sister last summer, and i’ve improved a lot. I did well in my classes and managed to get some of my missing credits back. Yet now that i’ve been announced that i’m going to school here again... it saddens me. I’ve lived here for 6 years maybe longer, and throughout those years, i have been hanging around bad influences and got myself into trouble.

My plan was to go back to school and mind my own business, as in not talking to anyone for a while to see how i do but the thing is... i don’t know how that’ll go.. what if they start assuming things? begin rumors? I was one of the friendliest of the group, the loud and joyful one.. seeing me like that would draw in anyone’s suspicions.

I get messages from her asking a couple of times a week asking how I’m doing, if I want to hang out, expressing concern for my well being or just links to videos/articles. I’m getting really sick of it, but I don’t want to be blunt because I don’t think she is stable.",05Sep2020,1

788,"Okay, so on account of the lockdowns/tyranny/uprising/2020 being 2020 I gained the Lockdown 15, and by that I mean Lockdown 30. I am now officially a big fat ass, and I now have high blood pressure on account of it, something that never happened to me before in my life. I need to fix the problem, and *fast,* before I gain so much weight and my health spirals so far out of control that the situation becomes unmanageable. I'm 185 fucking pounds, man. I am a fat piece of shit. Make all the fat jokes you want; the millions of fat cells now inhabiting my abdomen will laugh right alongside with you.

For reference, I was approved for work from home which I should be starting in the next couple of weeks. I make enough to live off of and have a comfortable life, and I'm one of the few in the world who is in a good position right now so for that I am grateful. The problem with this is that I would essentially be sedentary which is what caused the problem in the first place. To lose the weight, I need to not be sedentary, which is going to be kind of tricky working from home but I have several options. I am willing to spend a few hundred dollars to get the equipment I need to solve the problem.

Dietary changes will be enacted regardless of what path I take and consist of cutting down on starch and sugary foods including soda, eating a goddamn salad once a day for once in my life, and reducing the amount of beef I consume and replacing half of it with turkey and seafood. 

I have several courses of action that meet my needs and my situation from which to choose, and I can't pick between them, so I ask you all to cast your vote and elect the best plan. :P 

PLAN A:  Buy a bike and ride my bike for the rest of the day after work. This would net me 3-4 hours of bike riding a day where I could burn 927 calories every day I do this. If I ride a bike 4 days a week that would equal 3,708 calories a week which is pretty substantial for less work. I'd estimate it'd be about $200-$250 for a decent bike. Not very much in the way of calorie burning but I'd have the advantage of having an excuse to go outside plus I could get a basket and ride to the grocery store and back and stuff, aiding my life outside of just not prepping to play Jabba The Hut in my Star Wars roleplay group anymore. Not as ideal as plan B but there are some substantial benefits, though I am a bit worried about riding on the road and getting run over by a car. 

PLAN B: Buy a foldable treadmill and a very tall desk I can put my work equipment on. This would allow me to just walk while I work, on average 6-8 hours a day depending on my schedule. Counting breaks, I would burn on average about 1360 to 1731 calories every day I did this, in a way that is a lot less stressful on my body, and considering I walked and hitch-hiked across the country a couple of years ago, would be a lot more appealing to me. The problem is that it'd cost $300 for a foldable treadmill and another $300 for a standing desk. That's like half a stimulus check. Ideal but \*extremely\* expensive. 

PLAN C: Buy weights, exercise ball and a pullup/dip station and work out during/after shifts. I could sit on the exercise ball while I work -- actually this is what most people in my line of work do anyhow -- and lift hand weights or use resistance bands or something in between assignments. I could lift weights for realsies after shifts and work my way to doing a pull-up, which would be really cool. It'd cost about $180 for the dip station and between $30 and $50 depending on what kind of weightlifting equipment I get, which would run me about $210 - $230 total. The cheapest option but not ideal, because if I resort to that I might as well just save the money and do push-ups while I work at home or something which would only cost me like, $20 for a good mat and $20 for a sit-up bar. Buying actual weights and lifting them after work would burn me like 1510 calories if I managed to do it for two hours, and calisthenics would only burn about 873 for 3 hours of work. Kind of inefficient, but doing this would allow me to build muscle which I feel would be a more permanent solution, though it would be a lot harder to be able to work out during shifts and would require me to spend time outside of work stuck in my room lifting weights instead of being able to go outside, though I guess I could just work out in the driveway or at a park or something.

So, those are the best plans I've come up with, please respond with which plan you feel is best and your reasoning. I have some Reddit coins; I'll give a couple of the answers I like best a Cool Summer award or something.",05Sep2020,1
789,"I'm an assistant preschool teacher for a School Readiness Program housed in a public school. I need advice on how to handle a situation with my boss who is sneaky.

My boss didn't reach out to us all summer about our program opening up. There was speculation that we weren't going to get funding. I reached out to a teacher who was in the loop. She told me they have to let two staff members go. I was potentially one of them because I was a newer hire. 

We have a virtual meeting three weeks ago. My boss tells us that two people will be terminated because of budget. This got people very nervous and 4 teachers found jobs and submitted their resignation (two weeks before school). This left me without a head teacher. My boss calls me up and asks me if I'm going to resign. I told her to be honest I've been looking because I didn't know if I was going to lose my job. I'm expecting her to tell me that she was letting me go. But she said that there are two head teacher positions available and I have my pick at which school I want it at. I'm extremely shocked and caught off guard. 

One program is all year round and the other is school day/school year and is in the classroom I'm currently working in. I tell her no right away to the head teacher position because I had a hard time with my mental health during distant teaching and I didn't want to have all that responsibility. She said if I changed my mind then to contact her. I said ok. After talking with my husband I decided to go for it. I've never been a head teacher before but I've substituted and took on the lead role when the head teacher was out. Plus I have the credentials and experience. 

We have another virtual meeting and my boss tells us that for the people who are qualified for the head teacher positions should consider it because that would potentially save people from being let go. Now I felt like I'm making a good decision because if I didn't take this job I or someone else could lose their job. At that point all she would have to do is shuffle people around to make sure all the classrooms (4) are covered. I speak with her after the meeting and tell her I'll accept the position. I ask her whose going to help me set up the classroom since my assistant is on maternity leave (1 head teacher 2 assistants per classroom for school day/school year. Full day/full year program has two am teachers and two pm teachers with overlapping hours). 

My boss had no answers for me. It was I don't knows and I can't tell ya because so many things are changing. My boss says our supervisor would be able to help from time to time but they've gotta hire floaters or get someone from the sub pool to help me for when school starts. So this could be someone who has never worked on a preschool level before.

The job posting comes out and she emails me telling me to apply. I do and she says she's putting my name forward. I haven't heard from her or HR this week as I get my room ready by myself. I move tables off of each other, push around shelves with blocks on them, clean toys, organize, attend the virtual pd, scrub the classroom walls, redo 4 bulletin boards in my room, label, redo the schedule, print and laminate and social distance everything and make sure the room is ready to give parents a sneak peek at what the classroom will look like to ensure their safety with a video tour. And then spend my Saturday sending out welcome letter emails and other attachments.

I have been doing the job of three people by myself while the other classrooms have two to three teachers in a room helping each other. Not once did I complain to my boss or supervisor. And not once did they check up on me. My boss did call me on Thursday for a different issue and told me to stick with it and to have a nice weekend. Again I told her I haven't heard from HR about my contract. I've been assuming my position since Monday. She tells me she's not HR and that they are backed up. So I call HR and leave a vm and emailed them. I finally get my contract yesterday after I got home.

My contract salary is less than what the job post salary was listed at. Starting salary is $30,000 (there was no range) in the job posting but they are offering me $29, 334.06....she did not call or email me to inform me of the new salary. I know I'm fairly new (hired 4/2019) but I'm not naive. I think she thinks that I would take the salary as is. But considering I've busted my ass all by myself setting up the room and making deadlines that I deserve the salary that was listed. And on top of that I had to purchase my own PPE! 

What do I say? I've been running scenarios in my head on what to email her but I don't want to sound like entitled but I know she's trying to take advantage of me. She's done this to other staff members with various things. 

We dont have enough staff to open the rest of the classrooms at the full day full year program. She can't risk to lose me but she'll use me as a floater. School starts on Wed Sept 9th.",05Sep2020,1
790,"This is a relatively new revelation of mine and therefore I'm trying to maintain the hope that I'm mistaken.

As I write this he is sitting across the room from me, both hands cupped around his phone in an obvious attempt to hide its contents. I used to think that the childish grin he pulls was a thing of innocence. Of softness and care. I see now that its source is somewhere else. A place of malice and deceit. I don't know. 

His efforts at secrecy have not been flawless however. Just minutes ago I was in the kitchen pouring myself a drink and upon re-entering, I caught a glimpse of his screen. I know exactly what site he was on. Not that I use it myself obviously. I know of it through past friends and the like, people who don't value decency and respect I suppose. The sight of it made me sick. Even now I am shaking, my mind gripping the hypothetical driftwood of this ungodly storm. How could he do this to us? To a family that loves and cherishes his company. A unit that is bound in blood and tears. 

My mother will no doubt be distraught, as any moral person would be. She dedicated so much to him. Loved him dearly. Loves. And knowing how soft her heart is, it would not surprise me if she forgave him. She is a beacon of light, my mother. Our gift from God himself. I would hate to see her hurt. The wings of an angel stained with the inky sin of man. No, I will not allow him to do this.

The other piece of evidence that supports my claim is the letters. Seven of them. All of them so perfect, so conveniently placed. As if he knew what they said before even turning them over. And then the way he reads them, his cunning smile pinned proudly across his cheeks. He knows exactly what his actions mean but not what damage they cause. How could a person be so full of spite?

So what do I do? Do I speak to him, call him out on his wrongdoings? Do I talk instead to my mother? Or do I do neither? This game cannot continue, I have no doubt of that. Its end is near.

My mother just spelt out what seems to be her penultimate word.

LOYALTY. How appropriate. Nine points, but the Y sits on a triple. That makes twenty-one.

But it won't be enough. It never will be.

His trickery will grant him the win.

Truth will be crushed and deception will prevail.

799,"I (M56) am pretty close with my son (M24) as far as parent-child relationships go. We usually share most everything notable with each other and he hasn’t been one to feel uncomfortable to come to me with difficult topics in the past. But over the past couple of years my son has put on a lot of weight. When he began his masters program, I had seen him the summer prior and I know he was around 150lbs then as that’s what he’d always weighed as an adult. I didn’t see him in person again until the holidays that year, but had seen some tagged photos on Facebook as the semester went on and he started becoming hard to find in group photos because he started to look so different. I figured he was just really maturing, but when he came home that December for Christmas, I’d say he had to be at least 225lbs, a huge difference from just the prior summer visit. I figured this was just due to stress and this new chapter in his life. He reassured me everything was okay (in general - I didn’t pry about his weight specifically). I asked if he was getting enough exercise and he said he’s getting used to working with it on a new schedule but was figuring it out. All seemed like I didn’t have to be too worried yet, although it did seem like a pretty big change in a short amount of time. 

But since then, I’ve finally seen my son again for the first time since before coronavirus began, and I’d say he’s easily over 250lbs now if not more and he’s not even in his masters program anymore so I’m worried that his adjustment period for keeping up with his health has long expired. I’m starting to get worried for him, just because of the rate of weight gain. I don’t want to sound like I’m fat shaming him or being critical of his appearance. I worry that if a weight gain like this continues at his age, he will start to experience some extreme side effects. I’ve finally had one chat with him this week about my concerns and mentioned his weight and health from the POV of genuine concern. He acted quite ambivalent, even oblivious as to there being any kind of problem. “Everyone gains weight as they age and their metabolism slows, I’ll hit the gym again and be back in shape, this is just a little extra weight” - but come on, he’s very obviously put on at least 100 pounds. 

I should mention he’s currently staying with me for a few weeks which is why I’d like to be able to talk to him or figure this out while we have some rare face time.
This is also a little bit sneaky, and I didn’t mean to come across this a few moments ago, but I have one of those personal scales that logs your weigh-ins. I was just getting ready for bed and stepped on and the last measured weight was 262 pounds, so now I know that that’s how big he is now. That’s a crazy difference from 150 ish 2 years ago. What could cause something that drastic?  Anything I should look out for while he’s staying with me?

Is this out of my control?  Is it wrong of me to push my concern?  How can I talk with him? I just want to make sure my son stays healthy.  After he had initially gained the weight during his masters program, I at least convinced him to get a physical and some tests when he was home to just make sure everything was okay. Nothing underlying and his numbers were all fine. Which makes me think that he’s living a lifestyle with a really bad diet or something with health effects that haven’t caught up to him yet. He already has this giant beer belly that’s bigger than I’ve ever been and I’m almost 60 and he’s not even 25. I’m just worried about him. What can I do?",05Sep2020,1

 So i am really scared that is gonna happen to me to.  But it hurts bcs i cant come out and be who i am.  

I once said while watching a show that the girl was cute.  My dad hit me in my face and said ""shut up. Are you a f * cking gay or somthing."" So i am scared he / other family are gonna hurt me if i come out.  Or set me out of my family.  

Does anyone have an idea what i can do?",05Sep2020,1
806,"I'm  in my early 20s, in the US, and I live in a high cost of living area in  the Northeast. I don't come from a trust fund family or old money or  any of that. I'm interested in/good at the performing arts (i.e. acting,  singing, dancing, a little piano), fashion, writing, speaking, customer  service, library work, and mental health. I've been told that I should  pursue those fields professionally, but obviously for the first fields,  it's extremely difficult to unrealistic, and for mental health, if I  want to make actual money, I have to get at the very least a master's  degree and even then, the salary may just be $60K.

I  have a lot of experience working in libraries, including supervisory  experience. The trouble is that it not only paid pretty much minimum  wage, but it was also mind-numbingy boring. To become a librarian, it  requires a master's degree, and even then, the salary is just $50K. I  know many people who literally live paycheck to paycheck who are in  supervisory librarian positions because the salary barely grows. I'm  currently pursuing psychology as an undergraduate, but I'm curious if I  should switch to something else. I know that I can't do manual labor  (i.e. construction, plumbing, electricity, factory work, etc.),  accounting, finance, science, nor mathematics, because I'm terrible in  all of those fields and find them all to be exceedingly boring. And I'm  against joining the military. What exactly can I do with my interests  and strengths?",05Sep2020,1

So she let him deposit it in her MOMS ACCOUNT. Yes this was with her moms debit card, well he took out $500 because that’s all the bank allowed, she gave him her number so they can meet up tomorrow and she can give him his money..

He takes days to respond on snapchat but uses Snapchat several times a day. Yesterday I saw he was online on my favorite game and when I asked him if he wanted to play both him and our other friend who he was playing with ignored me and went offline after their match. I texted him about it today and got left on read, this pretty much confirmed my suspicions and even when I've tried to talk to him about it a couple of times a few weeks ago he still ignores the question. So both him and my other close friend (the one he was playing with) have been ghosting me and really only talking to me when they need something. They aren't the only ones, one of my friends tried to steal the girl he knew I was dating even after I told him to back off. There are several other relatively close friends who've been distant too. Besides them I really only have like 3 other friends who are busy a lot too. I'm trying to stay on my grind and my purpose but it just gets so lonely losing so many close people. I try to reach out to people who I'm friends with but don't really talk to often and they make excuses and such to ever make plans, and when we do make plans they back out last second. I had planned a get together with some friends last week, about 4 or 5 people and every single one of them backed out last minute when they said they'd go.

He also sniffs my genitalia, especially when I'm menstruating. It's so uncomfortable and I physically jump away from him whenever he does it. He also steps on my bare feet with his big ones and it hurts.

i can admit i'm the jealous type but i never have a problem with him hanging out with his buddies but i guess today i thought different.

suddenly, he gets a message, mind that it's pretty late both there and here. i even encouraged him to go and he decided that he will after he had texted his mother. i got a bit sad that he's leaving and then gradually more upset as he left.

he said he will be back in 2 hours. but then suddenly i go into this thinking of how i should go sleep before he comes back so he feels shitty.

and ok, i'm petty and i'm a chick, chicks do that sometimes i guess.

now, i have a pretty colourful past with self-harm and i there's a thought that pops out that i should just do one cut on my wrist, but deeper than i usually would so it looks serious. i guess my own scars trigger me.

after a second u registered this thought as the peak of pettiness my mind can go to.

i know it's a shitty thing but it's like one half is telling me to do it and i know that i will enjoy it but the other is just the voice that helps me figure what's right and wrong, and although sometimes wrong, usually it's better to go with it. i know it will hurt him.

I’m taking two classes for Christ’s sake (a third class will be added around October)and I just. Can’t do anything.

816,"(Sorry if there are mistakes, not English) I have never posted anything on reddit before, might remove it later, but i don't know what to do after what happened today.

I have always been very friendly with everyone in my uncle's family, I stay at their house for sleeping many times and so does my younger cousin. 

(I got 3 cousins 2 males and one female, one male is 15, the other male is 18 and the female is 21 and i am 16 male)

But I never really liked the older male, because he is a really rude person that only knows how to smoke and go out in secret.

Tonight when I was asleep there, the air conditioner in the youngest cousin's room wasn't working, so both of us slept in the older male's room, we took our sheets and pillows next to his bed, the older male cousin was on his bed, i was next to him on the ground while my younger cousin was next to me on the other side.

But then when i was asleep i felt my older cousin next to me and he tried to force me and possibly rape, (that gay fu**er, im still mad at him), but luckily I am much stronger than him because he never works out, then because of my scream and his voice when beating him up, his parents came into the room, i told my uncle everything while my gay cousin was in his room with his mother trying to look innocent and clueless, but even after telling my uncle everything, he decided to believe in his gay son.

Then i got extremely pissed off, shouted at my gay cousin and his mother and told them to get out of the room while i started packing my things up, my younger cousin was very helpful and he told me that he would not let this ruin our friendship.

I called my mother and put the speaker on so even if they tried to stop me, my mother could hear everything, I told her to come pick me up and threatened my gay rapist cousin that I would destroy his life whenever I wanted to, but ever since returning home, i have been thinking about what to do, because I know that anyone would believe in their son, so I dont know what to do now.

I guess this is more of a vent, since I doubt anyone will have much advice, because I understand it is difficult to give advice on such a situation. 

First of all I want to say that I have a lot of hobbies, I have friends, I'm confident in myself and happy with myself, so please don't suggest to work on hobbies and friendships etc.

Lately I've been feeling so romantically lonely, like I'll go to pretty places and be like oh I wish I could take someone on a date here, or just wish I had someone to talk about stupid shit with everyday, or to cook a nice meal for, or video call while watching a movie or something.

I mostly used to rely on my friends to feel less lonely, but most of my friends are in relationships now, and even if they aren't they're so occupied with other things (which is completely normal) so I just don't feel comfortable texting them everyday and hanging out with them that much, since I feel almost like a bother/distraction for them. 

I've been going through a lot lately, and it's been overwhelming, so it sucks not having someone to just be there for me, and remind me it's gonna be okay, and shit just give me a hug.

I don't want to get into a relationship just because I'm lonely because I don't think it's a good idea, and it might cloud my judgement, but I don't know how to deal with the loneliness either.

My brother is a man who loves other hairy fat men...but to the point where he's creepy and touchy with men with those characteristics, he doesn't even care if the man is straight, he would make creepy comments about their belly, belly button and chest/belly hair (hairy round bellies are a huge fetish of him) , he also touches other men beards without consent too...i'm really worried about him...he doesn't understand boundaries and i'm worried he might r\*\*\* some man.

Not only that...seems like he has a thing for our uncle, that is a bear as well, and that's where imo it becomes extremelly creepy.

He would always comment on his uncle's weight, and always compliment his stomach in creepy ways, he also encourages his uncle to drink beer and do fart contests with him, while the challenge is that my brother has to sniff uncle's farts while he's drinking multiple bottles of beer  (uncle refused since it was weird, but he tried multiple times to convince him, and failed), he's such a disgusting pevert and harasser i'm ashamed to having him as a brother and i hate feeling like this...and this isn't even the worst he has done!

One day, i arrived earlier from work since the gym was closed for some reason, i saw my uncle streched in the sofa and clearly sleeping, while my brother was touching his belly, ches hair and nips and i think he ""fingered"" his belly button a bunch of times wtf, , i ask him wtf he was doing and he flips out for a second and tells me: i'm giving him a massage! it was false since uncle was clearly sleeping (my uncle was drunk and fell asleep and it's very hard to wake him up from his sleep) and completely unaware, basically i saw my brother sexually assaulting my uncle, it was really damn scary.  
He also has recorded my uncle's belly while he was sleeping in the sofa in various angles with weird names like "" daddy giant pov"", ""daddy chest hair pov"" ""daddy belly button pov"" and it creeped the fuck out of me.

822,"So today I went to my moms house to mount some monitors for her. It was the first time I've been to her house in a few months and it kind of scared me. She has always been a hoarder. It started when my parents started having issues. My dad kept it in check sort of, it was generally mitigated to my garage. Towards the end of of their relationship it flooded into their bedroom. I was 11 at the time and never really understood but I believe now it was a huge factor in their seperation. When my parents split we got a house that was much smaller than my childhood home and my mom moved everything into that house. We didnt have a living room because it was packed full of boxes. As we moved house to house it just kind of got worst and worst. We'd  pack everything up and move and things wouldnt end up getting unpacked so we would end up buying a new one of whatever. When I was 16ish I moved in with my father in another state. My mom and I had a falling out and i didnt really speak with her until i was about 21. By that point i had moved back to my home state but was dealling with my own addiction issues. My mom moved to another state and was only able to take about a truck load of her stuff. She ended up getting 3 storage units before she moved (which she has been paying for for over 8y now.) for the rest. By the time I hit 23 I sobered up and moved to the same state as her. I stayed with her for a year, we rented a place together while I got on my feet. Her hording habits had persisted, but I kind of kept them in check to an extent. She slept on a couch in our living room because her actual bedroom was packed to the ceiling with stuff. I moved out and ended up buying a house. Fast forward 4 years and it brings us today. When I went over today it was the worst that I've ever seen it. There is only a 3 foot path to walk through her house. The only space she has is about 4'x6' area that is her kitchen. Her living room which she uses as her bedroom is packed with a path leading to another 6'x6' space with her bed, desk, and TV. My little brother just turned 18 and his room looked similiar. It's not like the stuff is trash(atleast the majority) and the clear space is clean. It's just accumulated stuff, like stuff she doesnt need. She buys furniture for the house she hopes to buy, she buys trinkets and stuff, and stuff like the monitor arms I installed today but usually never even opens it. I dont know how I can help her, it is definately not healthy and she isnt happy. If I bring it up she gets offended and angry. She says she plans to go through everything and get rid of stuff but it never happens. If she does try I feel like its so much stuff at this point she is overwhelmed and gives up. Not only am does it make me sad to see her living like this but my little brother is also picking up the same habits. I am a very clean person, clutter gives me unbearable anxiety but I don't know yo help her. I've offered to help her go through stuff but she always refuses.

823,"Hi. I've never posted anything on r/advice before, so I hope that it makes sense. 

But, me (F27) and my boyfriend (M30) of four and a half years are currently going through a difficult stage. Of those four and a half, we have lived together for four.  

Since college, I've struggled with anxiety and insomnia. With the relationship being rocky, I've been struggling with both of these even more than usual lately. 

He and I are working on things right now, but while this was all going on, I moved in with my parents. My confidence was seriously shaken during this entire ordeal. I've been feeling like I'm failing at functioning as an adult.  

I've only ever lived by myself once, and it was only for 6 months when I was 22. My boyfriend often works out of state, so I have in some ways lived alone before while he's away for work, but lately I feel like I've forgotten how to be alone.   


My parents have been wonderful, and supportive and encouraging. They decided to take a weekend away, and they asked me if I would stay and dog sit. I am finding that I'm having a difficult time with all of the quiet. So far, while all of this has been going on, I have surrounded myself with friends and family pretty much at all times, or I've kept very busy. But now, I'm feeling a lot of anxiety around the quiet. This feels like such a failure, because it feels like I shouldn't be feeling this way at 27 years old, but I am.

827,"Due to covid, my husband lost 2 jobs, our almost finalized mortgage application got denied, and our landlord decided to not renew our lease (for the house we were buying). We went from having a monthly income of around $4,500 to an income of $2,000 (my job and husband's unemployment). We were on the absolute brink of homelessness with a immunocompromised child.  

A friend of a friend was selling a trailer in a trailer park a few towns away.  We had no other options, so we used our saved up down payment to buy it in full.  We went from a ~$150,000 house to a trailer that needs some work, plus a 40 minute drive for me to get to work. But cut our expenses (between new utility projections and lot rent) by about $1000 a month. It'll still be a struggle due to income changes but  we'll survive.


We moved in 2 weeks ago. Our son made a friend who lives a few trailers away.  He's 12 and a nice kid, but his family fits the stereotype of trailer park people. The boy is severely underweight and free roams all day. He walks into our place without knocking, which is dangerous for us because we own 3 very expensive exotic birds. We've resorted to having to keep doors locked at all times to prevent him just walking in. When we do let him in, he starts playing with our gaming devices without asking, raids our fridge, goes in whatever room he wants... It's a bit disturbing.
I've met his mom and she is very odd. I hate to be ""that"" kind of person, but she seems unfit. She seems to be very mentally ill and appears to have a drug problem

Since the day we moved in, he shows up at or just before dinner time every single day. He makes comments about how he's hungry and asks if he can eat.  I feel horrible for him because I do not want to see kids hungry and he's clearly underfed at home.  But we can't afford to feed him everyday. I know it's just one extra portion but with all of our savings gone due to the move, we are now literally living pay check to pay check. Leftovers from dinner are the next days lunch for my husband who now is the stay at home parent and is homeschooling our son. We don't qualify for any state assistance, so all food/bills/expenses are paid by us in addition to insurances and student loan payments.

830,"I am (m 20). I guess to start out, I should say I am currently in the process of getting support from the mental health department of my local health provider. They've been so backlogged however, that I won't be able to see a therapist until the end of this month, nor attend the coping class I signed up for. I've received mental help in the past, but because of relationship issues I stopped receiving help. This isn't the point of this post of course, rather just so everybody knows I'm going to be receiving help and that I am okay. 

There was something I've been deeply wanting to speak about, especially since my online college classes have started up for me. I've spoken about this with people close to me, but when I ask for advice, they kind shrug their shoulders and say people are just mean sometimes, but I really don't want advice on understanding others, I want advice on how to handle myself as a person, and how to regain some normal amount of confidence for school. In the fall semester of 2019, I had taken a ""Law and Society"" class because apparently the subject was fairly generic and we would have some discussions about our society and the issues we face in it. I attempted to be fairly quiet in that class, I really enjoy listening to other people speak because I tend not to be as articulate as I wish to be. Only after two weeks of the class starting, I had caused myself some trouble with the people in the class because my reaction to many things, including uncomfortable things, tends to be chuckles or stifled laughter; I also made a major mistakes when it came to recognizing symbolism. The instructor, brought up a story about a judge (If I remember correctly was from New York/ could very well be wrong) who on a personal website of their's, posted an image of a MAGA poster and above it a noose. This was strange to me and like I have always done, I had uncertain reaction and chuckled and said, ""What?"" This had offended a middle-aged black student who sat in the front of the class. The man was kind and polite for the whole two weeks until that point, and just to characterize him a bit further before I continue, he was very talkative, not rudely so, just very self-confident I presume. This man had turned around in his seat and started pointing his finger at me, jabbing it back and forth, and  all I can distinctly remember before it becomes a stressful blur is, ""People like you are awful, and you laughing at a noose, is racist, you are a racist..."" he continued on. I apologize for not being specific at this point, because I really just started panicking; I didn't know how to react. As he continues I can see people start shifting in their seats looking at me, and then some others start throwing in some remarks and raised voices at my expense, a group farthest from me even started mocking me about some personal info I had given to the class during our introductory week. Then my next mistake, in my panic I asked a question that in my panic, thought would calm down the class, give the student sometime to explain to me what it mean't to him; I asked, ""I'm sorry, what about it is racist?"" I tried being sincere, but I think trying to control the shakey-ness of my voice caused him to think it was a challenge rather than my poor attempt to deescalate. So he continued on very angrily, and this is when he mentioned the word lynching. I've got to admit, I've never really connected the symbolism of a noose with that crime. I always just imagined the angry mob, torches, and pitchforks I guess. My brain just failed to make a connection where it really would've helped had it did. This all happened within the last 10 minutes of class and it just was the most humiliating, shameful, awful experience I have ever had in my life, the instructor just stood there and watched. There were a few students who sat next to me, who we're very kind and tried talking to me while all this yelling was going on, they tried to clarify what I mean't and I felt I was able to explain myself and that I had made a mistake and that I was not intending anything racist, but it didn't stop all those people from just berating me. I know I made mistakes, but I'm just such a sensitive person that this effected me in a very deep way. I was too scared to show my face in class or even on campus the next day, so I dropped out of college entirely. I remember even in the hallways as I scurried away from that class one girl was still mocking me. I just wanted out. I still think about it and can't help but start crying.

So, here is where I needed your advice, I returned in the Spring of 2020 with just online courses, but I've been struggling deeply with student interaction, every critique of my work, or even slightly negative response to my answers by another student gives me shock waves of embarrassment of anxiety. The other day, I had read a reply to an answer I had written for a prompt about the generic Trolley Problem (sacrifice 1 to save 5, or let 1 live and sacrifice 5  I'm not giving it justice), the responded rejected my notions and said that his conclusion was more wise and ethical, when I read it, I had just taken it as pure fact and just ruined myself mentally for a few days before I even was able to think critically about the whole thing. What do I do? Sometimes I feel like I'm not fit for college, and that I'm going to fail and I know I will, if I don't fix such a glaring problem. Any advice at all would be helpful. Again, as a final note, I am on the path to be receiving mental help, I've just wanted to air this out and get some genuine advice. I want to be a good student and a good person, thank you.

835,"hey ya'll

I started to interact with someone, let's call them A, through reddit. We eventually moved from reddit to snap, and started talking every day for a few weeks. the beginning we were just chatting, starting to get to know each other. then A started being super flattery and flirty and I reciprocated.

However, A is religious and dating is against their culture. We're from the same culture, but my family isn't as strict. A said that they had told someone else (let's call them B) a few months ago, they were interested. A felt that it was wrong, and broke it off with B. A remained friends with B but they went through a very rough patch which ended up in a really bad argument. Even though I've known A for just a few weeks, they told me the entire story and trusted me to give them advice. I did find it a little weird that A didn't tell his other friends, which made me think that he potentially didn't have any, which is a little bit of a red flag. I talked a lot about my friends but they didn't really have any stories about theirs. A prefaced the convo with ""I just need someone to rant to"" 

I told A of a similar situation and how I handled it, and gave A really good advice which they took. I mentioned to A that I had been in relationships before, then they started to act different. A wasn't as flattery, they weren't replying or reciprocating. I asked A if theyre okay, and they said they were busy. I would normally be okay with this, except that A had been equally busy on other days as well. But now A is being really dry, cold, and stand-offish. I understand that dating is against their religion, but it feels a bit unfair that they led me on for several weeks, only to end up like this.

I'd like to distance myself from A. I'm a very busy individual, and I don't have time for inconsistency, or for people who don't know what they want.

hi. so uh during my freshman year in college, i had a really toxic friend. i considered her my best friend, since i never really had a close friend before. a few examples of her toxic behavior include lying a ton, victimizing herself, not being there for me when i always tried to be there for her, not contacting her over break, even though she could’ve easily done the same, etc.. basically, it was draining to be her friend. now, it’s about 3 years later and i’m a senior, and honestly i’m still affected by that friendship. it’s harder to trust friends, and i still get a burst of anxiety when i see her around campus. of course, i’m talking about when we were actually there, since we haven’t been in school for a few months. i lucked out by not having any classes with her since then, but this year, i do. it’s on zoom but even seeing her name, makes my heart race and i can’t focus. i’d really just like some advice on how to stop feeling so nervous when i see her or when someone even mentions her name. anything but talking to her because that rlly wouldn’t work out. i’m just tired of it. it’s like she still has this power over me, and i can’t let her stop me from doing well in class. if you’ve made it to the end, thank you for reading this ❤️",05Sep2020,1

Slowly this dream faded as the courses were so expensive and self funded and also so competitive to get onto. I was always getting a rejection email from even the most basic high street firms. 

So I then did some work experience at schools and thought. Maybe I need to try my hand at something else, even subconsciously I always used to volunteer with children and never thought much of it. 

I then decided that I would apply to become a teacher, and I’m now enrolled on a PGCE. Only thing is, I’m scared, because this was a back up and my heart always wanted to do law but I just faced so many rejections I knew it wasn’t for me

840,"I finally took the leap to go to therapy for what was almost instantly told to be OCD. I suspected this anyway but was nice to be told by a professional. 

My initial consultation went well. There was no note taking, a tiny bit of getting to know the therapist and a lot of my giving an overview of my problem, past experiences with things, relationships with friends and family alongside childhood and school life. 

What I didn't expect, was how much I'd be talking to how much the therapist spoke. Usually, I'm incredibly reserved and super in my element when people are talking at/to me. I kinda had this idea the therapist would be asking me way more questions than they did, but maybe this is because it was just my first ever session.

I'm posting here to ask people in therapy/who have been, what to expect from here onwards. As far as I understood, we're going to be using a mixture of CBT and Psychodynamic approaches to attempt to resolve or manage my issue. Is it going to become more of a two way conversation, or should I expect myself to be talking the most every time?

So since the new partner has been here my ex and I who apparently are still "" best friends "" have barely seen or spoken with each other despite my best efforts.

My ex tells me everything I want to hear and asks me afterwards to keep covering for them.
I called my ex out on this fake bs but they deny they are doing this, however they only message me to say nice things followed by they hope I'm still covering for them.

I'm also forbidden from going to a lot of places now incase their parents see me and ask where they are.

As a little bonus.. I hadnt heard from them for a few days only to be called up at midnight to pick them up as they were kicked out of their unit after only 2 days. They stayed with me 4 days and in which time they broke my fridge, caused an ant infestation, spilled beer everywhere, had such a large domestic every night I've been given a warning.

 However at the same time I want to know if it’s possible to establish boundaries such as the line between ‘employees’, ‘colleagues’, ‘friends’. As  in to be friendly but in a professional manner but know when it is too far. Also to be stern when needed and how to earn respect from your team and show respect in a professional way.

I’m fine with the idea of when I die there just being nothing
I’m also fine with there being some kind of heaven 
Personally I think the Bible is what it is (a book written a couple thousand years ago) that may or may not be a rough translation of (whoever god is)’s word with  some stuff added from the time period it was written in
Steven hawking said that god was a fairy story for people scared of the dark but I am not afraid of death any more
I have gotten over the fear of there being nothing.

If my existence is just a freaky coincidence that some place in the massive universe managed to create intelligent life, what point is it to keep trying to be a good person.

867,"Maybe I’m just profoundly lazy. I have absolutely zero desire to do anything in life that most people would consider “fun.” If the “fun” activity involves any level of work, it feels like a draining chore to me. This includes 99% of “fun” activities one would be “lucky” to be given the opportunity to do, such as, skiing, going to the beach, having a picnic, attending a party, going out to eat, meeting up with family, going to a theme park, stargazing at a fancy observatory, traveling to Paris, etc. Additionally, if the activity involves traveling or having to be with other people to any degree, that takes it to the level of being absolutely repulsive to me; a total hassle. Honestly, sex even feels like a chore... generally the orgasm is not worth the work of getting there. I do it mostly out of obligation to my husband because I want to make him feel good. 

And yes, I’d say I have depression, I’m sure that contributes. However, on days when I’m relatively happy, the types of things I’m motivated to engage in include a VERY limited array of mostly solitary activities. I could essentially narrow it down to reading, writing, painting, making music, making coffee, going on a walk around my neighborhood with my husband, and watching a good movie. Even movies often bore me. My job is in the arts, so thank Jesus I can still “work” at home by engaging in one of my very limited areas of interest. Maybe I’m a workaholic and that’s why I don’t enjoy doing anything outside of my focus areas? This is also why depression doesn’t seem to be a proper answer to my extent of problems... how often do you hear of a severely depressed person that can’t even motivate themselves to make a sandwich or leave the house, yet they feel happy and motivated to write superfluous poetry and create just to create? Doesn’t seem logical. 

And of course, as you’d likely expect, I loathe anything that’s a literal chore. It’s a huge bear for me to even force myself to cook a simple meal or clean the house. I truly despise it. I wait until I’m eating peanut butter on a spoon to go to the grocery store (and even then, I’m ordering grocery pick-up, it’s not even a real exertion). My necessary adult obligations get put off for as long as possible, even when doing them would directly benefit me and my life. It’s pathetic and unfair to my husband. 

So, what the hell is wrong with me and what can I do? Am I supremely lazy? Narcissistic? A spoiled child at heart? Maybe I’m normal but I’m just a super boring, unpleasant person? I’ve been like this for years and I do still very much enjoy my limited palette of personal activities, but it wouldn’t be much of an exaggeration to say I feel like death warmed over when I have to do anything else. Especially when it comes to things most people would make major sacrifices in order to have the chance to do. 

What can I do to make life more pleasant when most of it just seems like a chore? Thank you!",05Sep2020,1
868,"so i just started year 12 and one of my a levels is psychology. i’m so excited to do it as it is really interesting to me and i would like to have a career in it in the future. i turned up to my first lesson to see we have a seating plan and i’m sitting next to my ex friend. we used to be best friends, would do everything together, i felt part of her family etc. then we started to argue a lot because she got jealous that i got a boyf and started to be with him a lot.she would do horrible things to me, belittle me, hit me and would embarrass me in front of our friends. we started to argue because i felt left out when we sat together in school and one day while i was at my boyfriends for the weekend she asked if i wanted to come to the beach, i said i was busy but i would have loved to. she then got really annoyed saying how i always feel left out but don’t come out (this was the first time i hadn’t gone out, and i had a legit reason) i asked my friend what to do because she was having problems with her as well. my best friend found out and excused me of bitching about her behind her back and loads of other stuff that wasn’t true. that was jan 2019 and we haven’t spoken since. i tried to reconnect like a month or so later but she ignored it. i wanted to be civil as we would still be in school togther and didn’t want it to be awkward. anyway so i go into psychology and sit down and say hi. then the teacher is like assign each other with a or b and then throughout the lesson he would be like “a talk to b about this” she would just say idk and then turn around and talk to someone else or listen in on another persons convo instead if talking to me about it. i tried to talk to her a bit but she was just blunt and cold. the teacher said that if we have any problems we can move but i fear it will be more awkward. it just bugs me so much that it’s been well over a year and a half and she’s still bitter. i don’t care that much about what happened anymore, just want to be civil. what should i do?",05Sep2020,1

I can have a good laugh with them, but I’m nowhere near letting my guard down or even integrating myself. They’re a little younger than me so I’d feel weird buying in totally. Also, between you and me I do t have an interest in integrating too hard with this crowd.

Last night Dwight, Jim and I hit the town u til pretty late and had a good time. Morning comes however and I’ve been added by Dwight to the friends group chat, which I really don’t feel a part of enough to be included.

How do I leave this chat without looking like a dick? I’m thinking of saying like “what’s this button do?” And then leaving, or some joke like that so that it’s clear there aren’t any hostilities.

872,"I was too young to decide to leave or switch schools when I was in a horrible traumatic situation back then. I was trapped in a hell, or so it felt like. So now I'm scared to remain trapped again. Unable to escape a horrible situation. So I quickly leave new jobs, trainings, studies and so on. Usually either with a mental breakdown into average BPD symptoms (I suffer from it since I'm 15. I'm stable now (26) unless the outside pressure overwhelms me). I feel like I have to be on the run and be super careful and sensitive and analyze everything, to possible become aware of a new hell and to quickly escape this time. I feel like I can not survive getting trapped again. I feel like I'm unable to be aware of being trapped. I become hyper-sensitive. I did not help myself back then when the trauma happened. This time it's a difficult job-training again. I will have to put in a lot of effort. Like never before. And without the effort it already was hell!!! My sister persuaded me to accept the job-offering when she visited and put me down. She compared me to people who abuse the system and are just lazy. I believed her. The state wanted to put me to long-term sick/free money every month (enough to survive)/little work is still possible to at least live okay-ish. Every country will have different names for a system like that. Pension. Disability. That stuff.

874,"I am a 26 y/o gay human, child of immigrants in the US and need advice from unbiased humans. 

I went to school abroad High School and College, but had to drop out of college because I came out to my parents as gay and they basically disowned me. (This was 5 years ago and the country I was in did not provide financial support for independent students, I was also in the most expensive university in that country.)

I used my savings and spent the summer volunteering in Europe and then moved back to the US. Luckily I had some event planning and non profit experience already, so I have managed to survive for the past 5 years. I don't like life in the US, hardly have any ""friends"" and have not really adapted well to the way of life here. I've spent my time mostly depressed and unmotivated because I don't look forward to anything... I also listened to some bad advice and got into new car debt (which is finally coming to an end) and then some credit card debt due to living/health situations. (Because even if you have Medical Insurance in the USA, you will be hit with huge medical bills if you use it.)

With that being said, my dream/goal has always been to live in Western Europe and hopefully finish a degree that can give me access to a good life and a positive lgbtqia+ environment. 

Here are my options:

\- Finish my AA degree at community college and transfer to an American University abroad (Aprox. 80k loans)

\- Finish my undergraduate in the US and then get a masters in Europe (Aprox. 50k loan just for undergrad, then an additional 80k for masters)

\- Attend Ecole Hôtelière de Lausanne (200+k in loans, but almost guaranteed to make 85k a year after graduation to start off, and I get to study in my favorite country - and hopefully stay)

\- Learn German and get into school in Germany + a job (Virtually debt free, but not sure if I'd get admitted or would be able to sustain my cost of living for the full 4 years as a student)

I currently have no savings, but have made huge progress at becoming debt free and should have aprox. 20k saved up within a year. 

I feel lost because I can't really ask anyone close to me for advice. Everyone either has not followed their dreams, does not understand my dreams or wants me to join a cult and live in poverty (yes, for real... lol). These past 5 years have been mostly miserable for me, I've even considered ending my life, etc. Thankfully I am in a somewhat good mental state as of now and realized I have been stopping myself from pursuing my dreams. 

I am not scared of debt if it is my path towards a more fulfilled and peaceful life, I have pretty good working ethic, am entrepreneurial minded and am used to taking risks and moving to new places. I've also thought about saving and starting my own company but after attempting this with 20k of my own money, I realized I need waaaay more money, network and skills. 

I am scared however, of being stuck in toxic environments and with hostile people. Suffered from child abuse and other things that I have gone to therapy for and am in the process of healing. I also have ADHD and am pretty curious, which makes a traditional education a bit hard to process. Though I usually excel in hands on, liberal arts, socratic dialogue kind of settings...

I've gone back and forth to Europe for work/pleasure and I've never felt so much at home. I have some family and friends in Europe and they seem to live a very good life. Plus, they are also the people that have accepted me for who I am and have pushed me to pursue my dreams. 

All this to say, I am ready to move forward with life, work hard/smart and prosper. I'm very inclined to either go to Ecole Hôtelière de Lausanne because I like management + hospitality and it's also number one in the world, or to finish my degree in International Relations and hopefully find a job in Geneva or frontline in a place of need. 

I understand that there are cheaper options and I could probably live in my car and eat cheap ramen for the next 4 years in order to make something work without loans... but I want to invest in the best that I can possibly have. I only have 50+ years to live and usually choose quality over quantity any day. 

What do you recommend? Any other options I have not thought of?",05Sep2020,1
875,"So, there’s a lot of things that have contributed to me forming this opinion. The recent situation involves the fact that I (16F) have been dating a guy (17M) for a few months now. My father has always been kind of controlling and sometimes makes vaguely inappropriate comments considering the situation. Him and my mom are no longer together for a couple reasons, but from my limited memory of their divorce (I was young) he was very angry and took the whole thing poorly. Since then, there have been a few incidents of him becoming extremely mad and yelling/swearing, slamming doors, kicking my brother out, grabbing him, etc. dating back to when I was in elementary school. My father reads my text messages without my permission, opens my phone to look in it if i ever leave it lying around ( i change the password all the time, not sure how he knows it) and generally is very invasive of my privacy. In regards to the recent situation, he makes a ton of comments about me and the guy i’m dating (who is perfectly nice, well liked by my friends who he knows, and has never done anything to elicit this kind of reaction). He strongly dislikes him without having ever met him, and does not want to meet him. He constantly talks about how i’m definitely  having sex with him (I’m not), comments about him seeing me naked, calling me a ‘cam girl’ for him, saying that i’m going to end up being his housewife (my grades are excellent and I have strong interest in the medical field, so this simply is inaccurate for my situation), saying that if he ever meets my boyfriend he’s going to say, “You’re the guy who sees my daughter naked every night!”, which is also untrue, and often makes jokes like this around my friends, who are obviously uncomfortable when he says these things and do not laugh. He makes jokes to my friends about how i have an OnlyFans with my bf as the only subscriber (I obviously do not) or about how i’m going to get pregnant. He’s also made comments about my friend’s bodies to me before (ex. asking if so and so is on a diet, asking if i’m jealous of so and so’s ass) Overall, I find it to be creepy and offensive, and although i’ve said before that it’s all untrue and have cried twice in his presence because of his monologues calling me a whore, he has not stopped.

I am starting year 12, and thus my A-Levels (I am doing Biology, Business, Chemsitry and Maths). My actual lessons start on Tuesday and I have just been looking into Anki. For my GCSEs, I used flashcards to memorise everything, however it took me ages to make the flashcards and I often found that I had less time to review the actual flashcards because of this.

I will only use Anki for Chemistry and Biology. Maybe sometimes for business and maths to learn equations.

Would you reccomend me using Anki as I can type a lot faster than I write? I will review flashcards everyday as I know I need to memorise everything for the long term as my exams are in 2 years.

887,"So I work for a small residential group home with patients with medical needs. In mid August we had a resident who was in respiratory distress and had to go to the ER, they (unsurprisingly) tested positive for covid a second time (had covid earlier in spring, was never retested to make sure it was gone). Our work (My coworkers and I are assuming) doesn’t want to pay us hazard pay, and wants to make money off of this resident going to therapy, so they have consulted with doctors within the company who said that the resident is fine to come out of isolation and that they tested positive due to “viral shedding” and that the virus is only active because it’s trying to leave the host, but we shouldn’t worry because it’s “not contagious”. We were never given data or information regarding this phenomenon and are expected to believe this as true, and we are no longer being provided new PPE, Hazard pay, or n95s for when we work with this resident. Additionally, the resident isn’t required to quarentine in their room anymore, putting our other residents at risk. They were tested last Friday, and still tested positive but our director came up with this answer from doctors that he is fine and no longer contagious.

I’ve been looking for a new job since July due to a toxic work environment and being unhappy with the job itself. I am waiting on a job offer from two companies, have two additional interviews set up this following week, and am almost certain within a week I will have an offer.  The psychological stress of the lying and being unprotected around a covid positive resident has been getting to me and I don’t know how much longer I can stay. Four people have quit or put in their notice within the past week and since I have a leadership position I am expected to pick up their shifts or any extra tasks that need to be done. This week alone I have worked 64 hours (my status hours are 40). My supervisor quit and the new supervisor isn’t even trained yet so I have to help her get up to speed and pick up what everyone else is bailing on. Additionally I’m expected to go along with the whole “the resident isn’t contagious and is no longer positive” lie with a happy face so others below me don’t get stressed out. It’s an ethical shit show... 

On top of this all my mom has been severely sick the past few months with what is looking like either memory loss or severe mental illness and isn’t safe to be at home alone. My aunt (70 years old) has been staying with her, but only because she was staying at my parents house anyways because she doesn’t like staying with her daughter. My aunt was recently diagnosed with lymphatic cancer and has started chemotherapy. She is still staying at my parents house, which is why I can no longer see my mom as I could spread covid to my aunt, let alone my parents. 

I don’t know how much longer I can sacrifice my families needs for a job I hate and want to quit anyways. I know ethically that I will not be able to stay at this company due to my own values and how wrong it is for them to jeopardize the health of their other residents and staff, all in the name of making more money.  
I’m pretty tight on money and just barely getting by with the job, but I don’t know how much of my sanity and well being their is left to sacrifice by not putting in my two weeks now.  I know I would be able to at least make next months rent and bills if I were to quit but I feel an immense amount of pressure to not put my two weeks in yet due to not having a job lined up.  

My mom needs my help and support, I need to not be working in an unethical money hungry covid cesspool, and I don’t know what to do.

890,"Hi. I'm a F(20) from an southern american country who've been raised by abusive parents and were molested as a child by a relative. Because of my personal background I never wished for biological children, and honestly I still don't. The thing is, I always saw the world as this fucked up place, and it enrages/sadden me a lot to see so many children discarded by its parents and the government as if they are nothing.

 When I was younger I always dreamed that someday I would be able to help children who've been through all sorts of situations a child should never been exposed to. So that maybe I could at least minimize their pain. I kind of forgot about this dream of mine in the last few years, but recently, as I am struggling with mental health issues, having trouble to find a purpose for my life and dealing with all of the trauma, this thought came back to me. 

I'm terrified though that I might be a bad parent such as mine were, or that this dream of mine is just a narcissistic one. I don't want to put this kind of burden in any children, and in any circumstances I wish to place my hope in the world on their backs. But I wish I could do something to help even if just a little some of this children. 

It's not that I intend to do adopt within the next 5 years, I'm fishing med school and there is a lot of work for me to do so I can possibly provide a child with a healthy environment (including resolving my personal trauma).

900,"I moved home from college at the start of the pandemic in March and found that it was helpful for me. I had a great routine, company (family and pets), and better habits. In general, I felt happier and that my quality of life was better. I left a little over a month ago to go back to my college town but I’m noticing I’m missing my home life more and more and starting to show my signs of depression. The only two things I missed while I was home were 1) my friends and 2) my independence. 

I can’t (safely) see my friends that often right now, maybe once every two weeks. My roommate is gone 3/5 weekdays and when she’s home, she’s in her room. This makes me feel very isolated and my apartment feels like a cage. I used to love living in my apartment but that was before I was forced to stay home all day. All of my classes are online so I’m not tied down to that town and could return home whenever I want to. However, my roommate guilt tripped me a lot for going home for months last time and has joked about it happening again. 

I moved back so I could start feeling like an independent, self-sufficient person again like I had before Covid hit. Now I’m stuck trying to decide if I should give up and return home where I know I’ll most likely be happier and healthier, or stick it out and try to make the most of living away from home. Is there a way to be more independent while still living at home?

Some important notes: 
- This is my last year of school and I’ll be moving halfway across the country from my family and friends after graduation. 

- My roommate and I are really good friends and roommates of 3 years. I know I’m gonna miss living with her so it’s hard for me to choose to give up some of the relatively little time I have left with her.

She had very tiny tears in its wings and couldn't fly properly. I guess is she got hit by a car and survived, but she got stunned which is why she cant fly. I've let her live at my house and shes  been slowly recovering. The tears dont seem to affect her flying too much. She can fly pretty well now but she still crashes when she tries to land and has a really hard lifting herself off the ground. I was originally planning on releasing her tomorrow, depending on her condition, but I was just talking to my grandparents, and my grandpa said he didnt know if she would survive if I let her go, because monarchs are migrating to Mexico around this time, and it might get too cold before my butterfly gets there.

Then, whenever my depression turns to dark despair, anguish and suicidal ideas I often resort to some form of quick relieve. I have not found better skills for this issue yet. I used to self-harm to break out of depression and now I use psychedelic drugs like weed, mushrooms or LSD. Then the gates open up and I process.

The moment we sat down she seemed more interested in my roommate, but otherwise it was a normal dinner. We paid our checks and parted. Me and the girl gradually stopped talking but unbeknownst to me, she was still talking to my roommate.

Last Saturday, he invited her on a date and at the end of it, invited her up. I assumed he would keep to the bro code but instead, they noisily had sex all night. I could hear it all.

The next morning he apologized to me and said it was just a one-night stand, but every night since then she’s been sleeping over and once again, I can hear the gritty details. She doesn’t even acknowledge me; she regards me as one would regard a cockroach or a housefly. I feel insurmountable rage and loneliness, and I’m upset at my roommate too.

This is a prime example, a funny one, but a prime one.
We were talking about the attitude of simping (I know right). She proceeds to say that I exert some simp-like attitudes due to my compliments toward her, me buying the occasional gift, and writing her letters since we’re long distance at the moment.
I then say: “Haha I don’t think that would count. Doing the bare minimum of what’s the required in relationships isn’t considered simping.”
She then shuts down completely because I said the words “bare minimum” in implication to my actions. Her brain then perceived this as me saying that I do the bare minimum in her and I’d relationship and she is still messed up about it to this day.

So yesterday some things happened and I realized I really needed therapy so I contacted my college therapist and made an appointment. 

I was so nervous I added a wrong date, it ended up being September 21st at 9:00 am instead of September 11th at 9:00 am ( I face palm myself really hard when I noticed) and I don’t feel comfortable telling them I got a mistake I don’t want them to hate me. 

 I’m feeling so guilty it’s making me sick I feel like I don’t deserve therapy like I’m an attention seeker or something worst. 

I don’t know what to do, the feeling is too great I want to cry, to be honest I tried therapy when I started my first semester of college but I felt bad for my therapist like my problems were too much for him and I just left, I didn’t wanted to bother him (I don’t know why I thought that)

919,"so, this is really hard for me to talk about but i’m gonna give it my best shot.
so i’ve been in love with the same guy since i was 15 (23 now). for a while, we had to do everything long distance because he moved to a different state shortly after we met. we had been on and off for 7 years, the last time ended in march. this is where i need to elaborate.
after getting cheated on by someone i had really liked (May 2018), i thought all hope was lost. i went on for a while just sticking with my good friends and trying my best to keep my head up. around march 2019,  i found out that the guy i’ve been in love with 7 years had moved back into my area and was single. i contacted him, we met up shortly after and reignited the flame that’s been in us for so long. i felt like i was on top of the world when we dated, he was my everything and all my dreams were fulfilled. it didn’t matter that i was working minimum wage and would barely making ends meet....i had the love of my life and that’s all that mattered. after waiting for so long, we had moved in together and i felt like my future was set.

then inevitably, we started having problems. i was too wrapped up in my head with my issues, so wrapped up that my reality was far different than what it actually was. i was deep in addictions, not feeling good enough, wishing i could be better for the man i held on such a high pedestal...i failed him. we had been together for a year this time around...on march 1st this year, he packed up his stuff and left me while i was at work one night. gone.  he ended up saying he’d try to work things out with me, and started dating someone else i think 2 weeks later. maybe less. it changed my life, and for the worst. 
i have been a shell of a human since and i wish i could convey to you how i feel without using words, because words can’t describe it enough.

because i went back to this guy, i lost all of my friends. my best friends, actually. even people that i wasn’t close to..all said i was trash for going back to him. they’re right! they’re absolutely right. i shouldn’t have gone back to him. but when you’ve been in love for so long and you would do ANYTHING for that person...it didn’t matter what anyone told me. i would’ve gone back to him anyway because he was it for me. it felt like a huge slap in the face when he left me.

since he left, i’ve lost all my friends, my dad is now going through divorce along with intense therapy (the therapy has to do with me so now we constantly have deep, emotional talks to try and help each other out; it’s mentally exhausting and i hurt for my dad), my brother continues to relapse on meth and won’t stop drinking (he was sober before until April 2020), and my health has declined so much. this doesn’t even scratch the surface...a lot has been going on. all this while i’m trying to change and work on myself. it’s so hard, especially when you have a lot of mental disorders working against you. 

i want to make friends, but i am so bad at meeting people over the internet. it feels disingenuous to me, even though i know the people are genuine. i need a new job, but every time i apply, it goes no where. i apply to stuff every day. i feel myself growing distant, my parents invited me to move in with them when they move out of state soon...i was gonna go but i don’t want to be a burden to them. they already hate dealing with my depression and my episodes...
my suicidal thoughts are every day now. i constantly have to debate with myself whether i should check into a hospital or not. im going to therapy but it only does so much...

921,"To you artists and commissioners of art, your input would be most valued here...

I commissioned a particular artist to do work for me on the 24th of August. Progress was looking good as they followed up with me just a few days later on the 27th to show me their sketch so far - it looked great. However since then, I haven't heard anything at all from them until I decided to check up on them a week later on the 3rd of September. 

I messaged them on discord and promptly received a reply from them saying they were sorry, but they had been working on other commissions and been busy playing video games 😑. Like, this person legit confessed that they were spending a bunch of time playing video games instead of working on commissions - not very professional. They then said they would have progress for me within the week but it's Saturday already and I've still received nothing.

I commissioned this artist to draw two figures for me and after two weeks, I'm pretty sure they still haven't even finished the sketch. We agreed on half&amp;half payment, so if the sketches were finished I'm sure they would've contacted me by now for the second half. I'm a bit of a gamer myself so I'm not ragging on the person for playing videogames and I understand that everyone needs downtime, however it seems whenever I go on discord I can see through their profile that they're playing videogames. 

See, the delema is I want to get a few pieces of concept art done (not just one) all in the same style - by the same artist. I really like this artist's work, but how can I commission this person for more pieces if they demonstrate to me that they are unreliable? 

Since I already paid this artist half upfront, I'm seriously considering taking the sketch (when they eventually finish it) and concluding our buisness there. Maybe then I could cut my losses and atleast use the sketch as reference art for a more reliable artist.

926,"So I’m a college student, and a lot of my friends have already graduated. However, they (the ones who graduated) are some of the closest and best friends I’ve ever had.

One of these friends, who we’ll call A, is a conservative. When he was at school, he showed conservative tendencies and labeled himself as a libertarian. I personally identify more as a leftist/socialist, and whenever he brought up some weird conservative talking point I mostly kept my mouth shut to avoid any serious conflicts.

After A graduated and moved back home, he started to get noticeably more right-leaning and just generally started to be a bit of an asshole. I mentioned once in a group chat with him in it that I had noticed a lot of Trump signs up near campus, and he responds with “Wow, I bet they hang black people in their back yard too!” When someone else told him to fuck off with his nonsense, he used the “It’s just a joke, bro!” defense that I absolutely hate.

Anyway, another friend of mine who had graduated, who we’ll call B, came out as non-binary/trans last year, has changed their name, started presenting more feminine, and has started HRT. Unbeknownst to me, A sent B a letter essentially stating that A does not find B’s new identity valid and that they are worried for their mental health, along with a book that claims to “debunk” the transgender movement.

To me, this has very much crossed the line, and I no longer wish to be friends with someone who won’t support a friend’s transition or even claim for them to be a valid human being. If A had said nothing and silently went about his days, it would be different. Sending B a handwritten letter and a book with junk science feels almost evil to me. Am I justified in not wanting to be friends with A anymore? And, if so, how do I go about breaking it off cleanly with them?

TL;DR: Conservative friend won’t support my other friend’s new gender identity and has sent them a letter and an anti-trans propaganda book. Is it ok to longer be friends with them?",05Sep2020,1

I decided to take the initiative to be a healthier person, and it's been okay so far- I get out and exercise more, I've cut out a lot of sugar and carbs from my diet. However, I've been having issues with the rest of my family. They know I've been struggling with my weight my entire life, and vowed to be supportive and helpful. They all eat pretty badly, to be frank, but I don't expect them to change their diets for me. I just asked that they make efforts to not have all the sugary, carby stuff directly in the open, but they haven't really made any physical changes. I know part of making these lifestyle changes is mental strength, but sue me, I've got shitty self control at the moment and it's not going to change by me putting my mind to it, I've tried far too many times and failed an equal amount. I think I'd be fine once I get past those initial days, but it's been hard when the first thing I see after opening the fridge is jugs of sweet tea and boxes upon boxes of icecream bars, or seeing the pantry full of pastries.

932,"So basically my girlfriend and I have paid 50/50 for everything and our first date was a free thing I got creative with that she loved.

My reasoning for never paying for my date's bill on the first date is because growing up probably 70% of my friends were girls and the number of times I heard ""I'm kinda just going out with the dude to get free dinner"" turned me off of it. Once I got to senior year of high school I realized that this thinking is more common than I thought so it just completely turned me off of it.

We've been together for about a year now and we've never complained about it. On special occasions like her birthday or Valentine's Day I'll take her on a trip and go to a fancy restaurant and pay, but if we're hanging out and it's like ""Let's go to Chipotle"" we just pay for our own food.

What spurred this doubt, however, is actually Tiktok (lol). We've seen more and more Tiktoks about how men should always pay for everything (food, bills, etc.) because being a woman is inherently more expensive. I agree with the fact being a woman is definitely more expensive inherently, but the issue is, we're both in college and don't work at the moment so it's just not feasible. If I ever have a higher income, after all is said and done and we're still together then absolutely I'll pay for everything, but as it stands we're both just college students.

Am I being greedy or selfish for this? She's assured me it's not an issue but I feel like I'm being a dick. Especially cause when we met i didn't wanna be one of those dudes that got used for a free meal.

\*\*TL;DR\*\* Broke college bf and gf split all of the food bills 50/50, even from when we first met. We've seen videos on places like Tik Tok saying this is toxic and unhealthy, especially since women's products on a day to day are more expensive. Should I stop doing this?",05Sep2020,1
933,"So lets start it out with a backstory. My husband and I met last December and decided to elope after a month. It was the best decision of my life. He’s my best friend and we work perfectly together. We love each other and are very affectionate... the problem is our sex life. We have  sex MAYBE once a month now. At first it was constant. We couldn’t keep our hands off each other and I’m a super sexual person. It makes me feel close to who I’m with. 
He just doesn’t seem to want it ever. The first 3 months were constant and then it just dropped off. Then we started arguing constantly because I didn’t like the lack of sex then it finally came to me accepting it. I talked myself out of my giant libido and wanted to make him feel comfortable. To add he does have a history of sexual trauma as a child. 
Every time we have sex now it completely feels staged and forced. I really don’t know what to do anymore. I love him immensely but my needs aren’t being met. What am I supposed to do. 
I have never pressured him into anything either. The chemistry just isn’t there anymore and we aren’t clicking. On all other aspects is a perfect match. I’m so torn and don’t wanna feel like this.

937,"I'm on my phone and English is (kind of) my second language, so here is your warning.

Hey there

I'm 16, my sister is 19 and my Dad is 54. Dad moved to Germany 20 years ago after my mother had lived in Ireland for 3 years and she wanted him to know the German culture. She got pregnant with my sister so they decided to stay in Germany since they both had a table Jobs and a nice Appartment. 

Because we live a 3 1/2 hour drive away from my German family, I've been had a different childhood with them than most of my friends, but I wouldn't say I feel disconnected to them. 

With my irish relatives however, I feel very disconnected. My father has 4 siblings (3 sisters and one brother) and 2 of his 3 sisters have kids, all three of them are kids and they really get along. Since me and my Sister only see them once every year, we don't really feel connected to them. 

I would like to know more about Ireland, about how Granny and Grandad were as parents, how the troubles where for my Dad, if he ever was discriminated because he was irish etc, and I don't know how to ask him. I feel like the grip on my irish identity is getting more loose and loose, and the fact that because my father lost his job 3 years ago we've only been to Ireland once in that time doesn't help. 

The few Times I talked to him about it I did get some nice stories out of him, but he got philosophical and started to talk about how much he Missed talking to Grandad every Friday (they used to to that, sadly Grandad died 2017) and seeing Granny (who died 2013). Don't get me wrong, I too think it's very sad they are dead, but I want to know more about being irish than about how he misses his parents. (Man I feel like an Asshole typing this out, I hope you guys don't get this in the wrong through.) 

TLDR:My Dad is Irish and he moved here 20 years ago. I want to know more about Ireland and feel more in touch with my irish identity, but I don't know how to tell him, since these kind if conversation usually end in him saying he misses my Grandparents.",05Sep2020,1

940,"Hi everyone! About two weeks ago, I moved into a suite on my college campus. There is a main room, a shower room, bathroom, two single rooms, and a double room (which I am in).

Here's the situation: I am very, very sensitive with smells. Most natural smells are fine (food, outdoors, etc.) but things like perfume, cologne, strong-smelling soap, candles, and lotion cause severe reactions. My throat closes up, I get migraines, I can't breathe, I sound like a 70-year-old smoker, and I throw up. Not fun.

Now, when I moved in, I told my roommates that I am sensitive to smells. I believe I said something along the lines of, ""Hey guys! Sorry if this causes any inconveniences, but I'm really sensitive to strong smells like perfume and lotion. It would mean a lot to me if you were able to either use smelly stuff in your room or try not to use it around me."" Pretty self-explanatory, right?

Wrong. In the two weeks we've been living together, I have had to ask three more times for them to stop using perfume, a shit ton of essential oils, and smell diffusers. I've had to either leave the suite entirely or sit in my room with a mask on (which restricts airflow even more). I even offered to buy them new products that are less aromatic with my own money. I've had to run to the bathroom twice to throw up and have been unable to breathe on multiple occasions. I get extremely painful headaches/migraines and need to stay in my room, but the smell usually follows me in there, so the pain can last up to 10 hours just because of one spray of perfume.

I'm at a loss for what to do at this point. I've asked them multiple times to stop using strong-smelling stuff, offered to buy them new products, and tried to be passive. I'm worried that if I confront them again I'll come across as bitchy. What do I do?",05Sep2020,1

948,"This is going to be long but worth the read. I'll try to keep the paragraphs light.

I've told her story on here before but I'll recap:

Characters:

Ron- uncle

Angie- dead beat girlfriend of uncle

Sarah- oldest daughter

Other characters to follow...

Ron is a great guy. He's always strives for a good job and a good life. He had one set back which was knocking up a girl he was dating (Angie). He immediately moved her into his house, and made a nursery for the baby. Good guy. 

Angie became a stay at home mom, so he worked pretty hard to keep them happy. Really it was more she refused to work. She got pregnant again and started neglecting the first child (Sarah). Because of this, Sarah was 3 and still in diapers, and didn't know how to talk. Everyone thought she had disabilities. Nope. Just neglected. 

Now also by the time Sarah was 3, Ron had passed due to a freak accident at work. At the funeral, Angie confessed she had an affair and was pregnant with the other guys kid. It was a tough time on all of us so we forgave her and allowed her to continue living in Ron's house. 

Angie moved her mother into the house to help take care of the kids. Now neither of these women had jobs, and she was relying on gov and her new baby daddy to pay her. 

The new baby was born and Angie stopped allowing my grandfather (who originally owned the house) to work on the house. The house was a fixer upper to begin with. So with three kids and two adults now living there he really wanted to fix it up. 

A few months go by. No one's heard from Angie. Grandpas been banned from *his* house, and no one's seen the kids. 

Until one day. Sarah (3 remind you) walks out the front door with the newborn in her arms and her younger sister waddling behind her. They start walking down the sidewalk. A concerned neighbor calls them over an calls police. 

Police show up and take the kids back home to see the door wide open, and both mother and grandmother into he couch sleeping. 

That's not all they see. 

The floor is completely hidden by garbage and dirty laundry. Pizza boxes and other take out containers block most walk ways. The girls' bedroom had one matress on the floor with a hole in the middle of it. 

And the rats. 

Rats were everywhere. And roaches and other vermin. 

One officerakes his way to the kitchen where he sees there's no back door. Just a blanket hung up. He hears Sarah walk in and sit down at the table. She's eating cereal that appears to be a few days old (chunky milk.). 

Cops have seen enough. They wake the adults (yeah. During all of this, somehow they still slept). They tell Angie that she will need to appear in court for what they've seen that day, and that they've already called DPS and explained the children's living conditions. 

Angie immediately tried blaming grandpa for the house. Saying that it came in that condition. Grandpas however won that rebuttal. However the judge was lenient and gave Angie two weeks to get her house in order, with grandpas help. Children would stay in custody until then. 

The very first day cleaning, Angie discovered a box hidden in her box spring. It was savings, made by Ron, for Sarah and her sister. There was $25000 in it. She seriously, took the money, got up, and left; called her baby daddy, and they ran off to Vegas. 

She immediately lost custody of the kids. My grandparents adopted the baby boy and my aunt adopted the two girls. 

Once Angie found out her dead bf's parents were raising her little boy, she and her new guy tried sabotaging the custody. Behind grandpa's house was an alley. They stood in the alley, shot some pistol rounds in the air, and then dropped *shot gun shells* in grandpas yard. Then they called the police saying they heard gunshots and that it was *this* house. 

Cops showed up, and talked with grandpa. They found the shotgun shells that obviously were old and in the alley found the 40 cal shells. They knew exactly what was up. 

Angie and her guy were now in legal trouble. 

She got pregnant again and that baby got taken away as well (don't know why). My aunt adopted that one as well, another girl. 

Not this aunt, that we'll refer to as Sheila, was able to get all the girls potty trained, eating right, talking properly, all within months of adopting them. They were turning into little proper ladies. 

But Sheila also had a quirk. She had a son, and then immediately got unterine cancer. So she couldn't have more kids (which is what helped her decide to adopt the other kids). But because of this unfortunate epidemic, she started to see the world as a cruel place. Then, at her son's second Christmas party, he ate a brownie with walnuts in it and choked on the nut. He turned out fine but Sheila was terrified.  She decided it was safer to tell everyone he was allergic to nuts so that he'd never choke on a nut again. They were too dangerous for him. (Starting to understand the quirk?)

So while she was raising these girls, she was doing so while keeping them in the dark. She straight up said ""I'm going to hide them from this dangerous world. If I had my way, they would enter convents when they turned 18."" 

And that's how she ended up with a 19 year old son who can't tie his own shoes...

The daughters were more adventurous. Sarah wanted to be a realtor. Her little sister wants to go into the makeup industry. And so Sheila decided to encourage their decisions. 

&gt;HOWEVER 

&gt;Sheila never thought them about boys. And how to date. And how to be treated. And how to treat boys. 

After Sarah turned 18 she wanted to know more about her mom. But of course, Sheila, wanting to protect them, refused to talk about Angie. That turned into Sarah rebelling, and finding Angie herself. 

She learns that she has 5 other siblings! (That's 9 total, guys.) Angie encourages her to come over and hang out with her little brothers and sisters. It turns into Sarah babysitting for her. Soon it becomes almost a full time job. 

&gt;By this time, Sarah already had foot in with a large real estate company, but pulled out, and went part time at a dairy queen to be closer to Angie. 

So I don't know how it happened, but *somehow* Sarah ends up pregnant with Angie's bf's baby. And Angie's cool with it. And Sarah's cool with it. And they got her an apartment. And Angie basically gave her all her kids to raise along with being pregnant. And Angie's bf visits from time to time. 

And we don't know how to explain to her that that's not how family works. She's so excited to have her mom back in her life. And shes so excited to have more siblings. And she's so excited to be pregnant.

951,"So, I (20M) am currently in college (Senior) preparing for professional school (M.Sc.) for around 2022.

All my life I have been a terribly picky eater, and only excercised occasionally. I love video games, reading, and film and I do not want to eliminate these things from my life. I do however, want to be more active and do more things outside my comfort zone. I think a good way to start would be to start eating more new things and excercising.

As far as eating, I have always basically been a picky eater. It has its highs and lows. My diet normally consists of chicken (fried), pizza with various meat topings, raw pasta with butter, lots of bread, potato based things. A lot of fast-food badically. I can eat steaks on occasion and salads without any type of dressing. I mainly get turned off by meats, sauces, or anything that looks unappetizing to me (basically anything in heavy sauce or broth). I absolutely love raw fruits and vegetables, though. Even things like brocolli, celery, radishes, etc. I can eat just about anything like that. I thought a healthy alternative woupd maybe be ""vegetarianism"" but with fish, eggs, bread, and nuts. Obviously this isn't vegetarianism but I think a more-plant based diet would be enjoyable and healthy. Would this be a good thing to pursue?

As for exercise, i currently am about 180 lbs, 6'0.
I can't devote a crazy amount of time to exercising, but I have a lot of land for walking and hiking nearby which I think would be a good way to stay active. Would this be a good way to get in shape (coupled with pushups/situps before bed and in the morning?). I would really prefer to avoid gyms or gym memberships. 

I have listed some of my ideas, so feel free to critique or offer any alternative advice. I realize I have a problem and want to fix it. I have never really had a girlfriend and I want to improve myself to hopefully improvw my chances. I hope to mention these issues to my therapist as well. I apologize for the lengthy post, but I would greatly appreciate any help you can provide!!!

952,"So... A little back story. My relationship with my dad has been interesting. He has a temper and when I was younger he was much worse, he's slapped me and made weird comments and touched me inappropriately (like pinching between my thighs and slapping my legs. In his eyes this was a joke, it was not meant sexually but still uncomfortable).

After I moved out for university our relationship improved a lot and he's mellowed out. But after finishing my placement I've been home for a while and tonight we went out to celebrate my brothers 18th birthday. My younger brother (13) is his favourite, he gets very defensive of him. While we were out we were laughing and making little digs at each other, in fairness we do tend to bully my younger brother more but he takes the joke and its fine. We're all very close and that's just the nature of our relationship (like greeting each other with a middle finger and roasting each other).

After saying good night to both of us I heard my dad go into my brothers room, after a while I heard him threatening to punch him and telling him he needs to look at him when he's talking. I should've gone out to diffuse the situation, I regret that I didn't now. But I later checked on my brother and he had a 3-4"" scratch on his chest and a small cut on his eye.

Apparently he came in telling him that he needs to stop bullying my younger brother, my brother was doing a work out and planking so was facing the opposite way. My brother replied saying he wasn't exactly bullying him and my dad kicked his foot and stomach. My brother then tried to walk past him through the door way and he grabbed him which I assume is where the scratch and cut came from.

I'm more shaken up by this than he is because it's not the first time he's done this. But he's never told my mom as he doesn't want to cause issues in their relationship, I don't feel like I can't not tell my mom that he's been doing this but I have absolutely no idea how to act or go forward now. All this time our relationship has been improving and I've been thinking he's improved but then I find out this?

Calling any sort of authorities is completely out of the question as this would just lead down the path of him/myself being disowned and causing problems much bigger than this.",05Sep2020,1

954,"Hello. First off I'm on mobile so I apologize in advance if the formatting is off. I just want to hear unbiased people's advice on this, and I'll try to be as objective as I can.


My best friend and I haven't had a single fight before and she's one of the only people I can just never get tired of. We spend a lot of time together and I don't regret it at all. However, after I broke up with my ex a year ago she continued being very close to him, and still is(on everyday speaking terms). I didn't say anything because it felt wrong to be selfish and demand her to not be friends with someone but it did strike me as a bit off. After that I had a falling out with another person who was in our friend group. That person spread lies about me being involved with drugs to others who don't know me well personally, and after knowing that Best friend kept being close to her as well.


I didn't say anything about that either, as we all were close before and I didn't want to interfere with their friendship even though I was kinda uncomfortable with that as well. Eventually I reconnected with a group of people who used to bully me in middle school. It's been years so I don't really mind anymore, I understand that kids can just be like that and I am a pretty emotional person so I was an easy target. I told Best friend about what happened before though, and how I was nervous to spend more time with them again for obvious reasons.


I got especially closer to a guy, we played music together and spent time in each other's homes, also met each other's family. I ended up having a crush on him which BF knows about, of course. Every time this boy did or said something meaningful we'd analyze it, haha.


Eventually she stayed at my place for a week, and I invited the group for a day so all of us would spend time together (5 of us in total) and it was fun, also worth mentioning we were all at my place. The only thing that was a bit different is BF was kind of... Making playful jokes that she never did before, such as cursing at me or insulting me jokingly MUCH more than usual. I went along with it though because admittedly it was funny. Next day my crush who is a part of this group invited us out with them, and we went biking together, but eventually my knee gave up on me and I was way behind everyone. They waited up on me once and I told them to go on, because I was embarrassed, but after that I couldn't even walk properly anymore and no one came back for me. I ended up limping across town and they were all waiting at my place, and someone even asked me to bring them stuff, until I eventually fell down and they were like ""oh sh*t"".



Now all of this didn't surprise me much because it's typical behavior of that group but I didn't expect Best friend to just go with them and not come back even after I was barely walking. It is pretty much my fault though so I didn't make a scene.



After this though, she started texting the friend group and everyone stopped communicating with me. Eventually crush reached out a bit but nothing much, we made plans and long story short he forgot about them. During this whole process Best friend is texting him and another guy, seemingly going after guy #2. I tell her how I find this weird and she says she does too and that she'll stop talking to my crush. She didn't, and eventually she told me she wanted to visit for the weekend, I told her I wouldn't be able to this weekend and she said ""ah I wanted to see guy 1 and 2."" 
I told her I didn't want to hang out with them and after that she made plans with them, including me, without my knowledge and only let me know 2 days early, even though she knew I didn't want to see any of them. Since you know they've been going out, ghosting me, and texting my friend every day. I didn't attend the plans and had a stern talk with her. And now she seems really pissed off at me.



Is this normal??? I really don't know if I should be upset or not anymore. I feel stupid because all of them act like this is normal but I feel really really betrayed by the whole situation. Some friends told me what she's doing isn't ok. After confronting her, at first she behaved like everything was alright and now she's mad at me. What do I even do, how do I go about this? I'm sorry for such a long post, I honestly am lost.",05Sep2020,1
955,"Not because of Covid. Because i’m scared the teachers are going to be disappointed in me.

Generally, when i’m at school, I can easily maintain a ‘good student’ image because i’m quiet, I blend in, and I don’t get into trouble - but in reality i’m actually not that great at all. I don’t get into trouble, but I am lazy. I only do the minimum amount of work I need to get by, I often leave things to the very last minute, etc etc.

During quarantine I really let my laziness get the better of me. I did barely any work. During the summer school holidays I tried multiple times to catch up but lack of motivation got the better of me every time. Although I have some of the work done, it’s not nearly finished. 

And I have to go into school on Monday having done barely any work. The teachers are going to be so disappointed in me, and I have so much work to do and i’m still unmotivated, and i’m really stressed out about it.
Especially since i’m going into Yr 13, an important exam year for students in the U.K. (we take exams in may, and the grades determine whether or not we go to university) so I need to take this stuff seriously. And I just haven’t. And i know it’s my fault for not doing any work. 

Anyway. Sorry for the rant. How can I de-stress myself before monday? Or get some motivation before then so I can finish the important stuff before I have to face my teachers? 

Thanks.",05Sep2020,1
957,"I’m a junior at my university, I have always been interested in science as a subject and a whole. I started out as a Pre-Vet major, then when the course work started to get too stressful and draining, I switched to Bio Ecology Conservation. Im quite content with it but I was never able to secure a position in a lab here, now I feel like Im not able to pursue anything career based in this major due to my lack of field experience. I have also had a very extended interest in sex and sex education, but again lack of experience and that area is not well know it doesn’t feel secure. As for a favorable option, I really like baking and cooking and possibly want to open a bakery one day. But as a long term I don’t know I would be able to sustain something with pursuing that option overall especially with the outlandish major. I am very confused on what to do, and I don’t want to make a wrong decision. Any advice would be welcome.",05Sep2020,1
958,"So basically I was in an online relationship with this girl (we'll call her s) for about 8 months and we were really good for each other and got along perfect but then another girl (call her m) started giving me attention and at the time things were getting old with s due to never seeing her because she lives in a different state and I ended up catching feelings for m and breaking up with s

But it turns out the relationship I had with s was a lot better and m didn't really have the time for me and I was fine with that and I was gonna work with not getting enough time with her but I ended going to the same state s lives in cause I had already made plans a long time ago and I couldn't back out.

 s reached out to me and we ended up meeting up just for old times sake and long story short we realized we both definitely still had feelings for each other and started talking again but I know it's wrong cause I'm dating m but I can't help but think things would be better with s and I feel really bad cause I wanna make them both happy but I can't so I'm just wondering if anyone has any advice on who I should try to be with or it I should be with anyone at all?",05Sep2020,1
959,"So 3 days ago we found some really, really small abandoned kittens, which would’ve been absolutely done for if we didn’t find them - they were laying there for two days. 

Needless to say, they were “weened” wayyyy too early. Unfortunately, because we live in a middle-of-nowhere-shithole village, it took us two days to find kitten formula, time during which we’ve had no choice but to feed them cow milk. 

Thankfully they’re alive and somewhat stronger now, but today I believe we “switched” the milks too quickly, because they now seem to have diarrhea and they’ve literally pooped on one another.

I’m kinda grossed out by this and I wish I’d know how to clean them up properly. (Obviously a bath is out of the question)",05Sep2020,1

961,"Hi all


So there has been this girl I met in kinda mid-July.
First time saw her eyes, I realized i was in love with her.
Yea that may sound stupid, but its the 2nd time in my life this happened to me. Fell in love with a girl and also by first sight.

We have been seeing each other at the beach almost 6 days a week, and on the cafeterias or for a walk fucking hundreds of times.

She is the most sweet thing that has ever happened to me. I am thinking of her like 70% of the day.

So as you read from the title she left.
She left at her university home (she is 18,freshman).
(Usually unis start here by October so hopefully she'll be back some time soon).

So I missed my chance to talk to her.

Actually no, i had many many chances, but I'm fucking nervous and my heart beats at 200 palms per minute when she sits close or next to me or stares at me from a small distance.

She has been giving me all the signs(flirty shit,caught her staring millions of times, finds excuses to come and be near me, is always on my optical field. Even when the cafeteria is empty she will come and sit to the closest table that is in front of me and from a side I'm looking so she will be staring at me.

I have noticed her also do some sexy dancing moves in front of me,give me sexy looks, giggles when she is with her friends and pass next to them, shows me her body and bends in front of me at the beach, comes and swims   close to me, when I'm with my friends and she passes by she either looks at me or bends her head down because of the nervousness, something which I also do when the roles change.

Ok so i thought those signals were pretty good, and as i mentioned im really nervous on approaching a girl I like, i decided to go for it through Instagram.
Sadly i didn't get a follow back..... So i thought all those signals were misunderstood and thus I un followed( in case she asked me why i did it, I'd say that there was no mutual interest)

But I meet her on the same places I go and she has almost same behavior. I do not get that behavior but okey, I just cannot overcome my fears and go talk to her.
The problem is :
Now that she is gone to her uni home, do you think I should write a detailed message to her on Instagram or fb explaining that I'm a nervous oblivious coward and that I love her no matter what happens? Tell her that I have been thinking of her for like 70% of the day and how important she is to me? 

What else could i write?

Or do you think i should ask her friend any details?

I want to open my heart in her chat and write all i feel for her.

Now depending her answer, i will act accordingly.

Please I'm in very big need of your help, help a fella out.

P.S. I have seen her upload some meaningful stories, like songs named : don't rush, power over me, and some others. Dont know if that thing stands for anything.

P.S.2 Her friend sent me a friend request today on Facebook.

Thanks for reading and stay safe!!! :)))",05Sep2020,1
962,"I was wondering if there some form of material that I can put over my current walls. I dont want to paint my walls + this room use to be used for something else so the walls are kinda messed up. I wsnt to be able to put led strips in the walls. The color im going for is black as well.

963,"So this one is quite a story. A friends ex girlfriend (an ex girlfriend he cheated on while i was there)  asked me if i wanted to hang. I said no and she insisted she just wanted to talk about their relationship and ask about him so i gave in.

964,"I’m a college student living with my parents. COVID’s got it all fucked up though and my parents are out of work since they work in the restaurant industry in Vegas and tourism is at an all time low.

They’re planning on selling the house at the end of the year and moving to the philippines and they expect me to move with them. I absolutely can’t do that, I don’t speak the language nor do I have any want to be anywhere near the Philippines.

It’s not certain, but I can’t take that risk. I got a job at a fast food place today for $9-$10 an hour. I have some friends looking for a roommate and we can start looking for apartments together.

My concern is the car, my dad currently pays for the insurance and stuff. I might be able to take it since we have two vehicles in my house but I don’t know how how getting car insurance works.  Can I get some advice about cheaper car insurance? I know it’s bad to get cheap insurance but cash is tight. Also if I end up buying a used car instead and registering it and getting insurance. Do you guys think I’ll have enough money for ALL of that by the end of the year if I save my checks?

Also, I’d appreciate any general advice about moving out. My parents don’t know I’m considering moving out with friends, how do I break it to them? They’re asian and they’ve beat the idea of me staying with them for forever. Stuff like “you don’t need a boyfriend you have us” or “you don’t need a job you have us” has prevented me from getting my life together.",05Sep2020,1
965,"My (25F) life has gotten to a point where I've found myself stuck in solitude, and it's starting to really affect my mental health. I've already struggled a lot with anxiety and depression issues, and this added component is just amplifying everything.  


I live with a roommate but she's rarely around. We will hang out for maybe 2-3 hours a week. Otherwise, I spend all of my time alone in my room. Every day this gets harder. I used to be able to wake up and try to be optimistic for a better day, but by the evening would come I'd unravel and be an emotional mess. Now most days, I'm in tears moments after waking up.

I dont have anyone to spend time with. I don't have many hobbies, but I feel like because of my headspace, I can't gather the energy to participate in them most days. Some days I have a lot of energy and can get through it, but it's rare.

I used to be very independent and ok with being by myself. For work, I often travel. So traveling by myself to new places all over the country gave me an empowering sense of independence. Because of covid, this is all on hold indefinitely. 

So now, I just sit alone all day and instead of being empowered by it, I feel like I'm barely making it through my days. 

I have not used a single hour of PTO this year for the very reason that a day off will mean another day home alone, and I can't handle that.

How do I come out of this?",05Sep2020,1

I am a lecturer, so I get frantic emails from students at all hours in the day.  I know that I don't have to respond...but the fact that *it is there* is enough to become a mental burden.

Does anyone have any suggestions?",05Sep2020,1
