I'm really scared and stressed. I hate when this happens and the worse is that i have no idea what they're arguing about. I managed to hear a few sentences and i'm worried it's about cheating. 

I'm really scared and trying so hard to hold back my tears. It's late at night and i'm sitting with my siblings that have no idea what's happening. 

I hate when this happens it's like a quiet fight that i can't do anything about and i want it to stop immediately. 

I could use some kind words and advice that could help me deal with this. 

I'm 17 if that helps and sorry for my bad english.",18Aug2020,1
1,". . because there’s only one major achievement that I am proud of since then. That would be graduating high school at an early age. I’m so lostttttt. I’m a (19f) and I have no job (although I have a few interviews lined up to be a warehouse worker for now) and I dropped out of college. This might sound cliché but college just isn’t for me. Which automatically makes me a failure in the eyes of my family and I am afraid of being kicked out soon. I just do not know what’s next for me. I would feel the best if I had some type of career going. I’ve been considering a trade, I just don’t know where to start honestly. I feel so lost. I stay in the house everyday with nothing to do and it’s my fault. I’m a failure (and a bit dramatic lol). But seriously, everyone is disappointed in with me,

My partner has shared with me that they were abused(raped) from a family member and family friends repeatedly as a child. Their mother would always just look away. They say they want to heal but feel useless and don't feel that they deserve....peace I suppose. They don't open up to past issues like this amd i dont want them to bottle it up again. 

I want to go choke out the people that hurt them. I want to protect them and love them and squish them together. But i dont think that's the right answer.

5,"I graduated from high school just three years ago. I had aspirations of going to college but because of my low g.p.a and test scores, I couldn’t go, or at least not to the school of my dream. Instead, I worked various dead-end jobs. Later on, I realized that I was getting nowhere so I went ahead and did a semester of community college. My major was journalism (which I love), but I dropped out after realizing the work load was too heavy. I also didn’t like the fact that I had to take a bunch of classes that were completely unrelated to my field of study. I was taking 4 classes and on top of that working part-time at a shoe store. 

Most of my friends from high school went on to attend some of the most prestigious colleges and universities. Every now and then I get a bit jealous and it makes me feel insecure. I’m no idiot but at the same time, I’m not Albert Einstein. I know a few things but there’s still a lot I don’t know. I’ve never achieved a 4.0, I think the highest g.p.a I’ve gotten is a 3.6. I honestly wouldn’t mind going back to school but at the same time, I don’t like the concept of school (at least here, in the U.S). On top of that, my anxiety and depression seem to worsen whenever I’m in school (deadlines, tests, socialization). I just feel like if I had some sort of degree that perhaps, people would respect me more or view me differently. What do you all think?",18Aug2020,1
6,"Hi friends! Throwaway account here. I'm new to dating just because of personal choices (male, straight, early 20s, recent college grad) and have recently started using online dating services to see if I can find someone I vibe with. I found a woman I really like - we agree on a lot of moral points and have similar interests and life goals, but the service I'm using (OKCupid) won't let her see my intro message or anything unless she likes me back first or pays for the premium service. Because of her profile, I'm inclined to believe I'm just barely out of range for what her search settings might be set to (as in, I live literally a few miles outside of the range she's likely using.)

I know the internet culture of women being messaged by interested men tends towards the creepy if not downright upsetting. Is it taboo/creepy to find her on social media and send her a DM in order to circumvent the dating app, or is it okay as long as I'm genuinely interested and respectful? Are there any other ways that I might get an edge in this situation, or should I just be patient and hope for the best? I've received mixed responses from the people I know in real life, hence why I'm asking here.

Located in the northeastern US, there is a person who owns many businesses in the pet industry. These businesses include places like pet stores, vet clinics, and products like food &amp; treats.

The issues come at each place. 

For example, at the pet store:
Testing product ideas on the puppies
Purposefully misleading customers on puppy info
Falsifying documents: dog papers, USDA reports, etc

It’s a marketing job, a specific sect of marketing. I know about it (2.5 yrs of exp), but more of managing and theory, not technical application. 

I have a job currently, so I would be leaving. This company is more legitimate, 2x my salary, better benefits. But I am scared to take it and fail miserably.

12,"First off, our family is not impoverished or anything. We are in the upper-middle class and my dad has a stable job.

I need a new desk for the upcoming school year. I literally have no desk space due to the size of my desk and the space my monitor and keyboard take up. 

Secondly, I understand that there are bills to pay. Living in a upper middle class house needs a high paying job to pay mortgage, utilities, groceries, etc.

My dad also came from a poor household. So I can understand why he wants to save as much money as possible. Even his wanted career path was squashed because of the lack of funds to study in the field he wanted. 

But this isn't about the desk, all day he browses Facebook Marketplace for good deals, and in his mindset, if its a good deal he will always consider buying the item, even if its not necessary at all. When I point him out on this multiple times, He gets angry and frustrated and retaliates by talking about my grades and how hes right. Sometimes I even think that he knows that its wrong but hes too stubborn to admit it. Every aspect of his life is seemingly about money. To the point where he doesn't take proper care of himself, Physically and mentally.

I want to tell him that you can always make more money, but you can't make anyone happy if thats all you think about. But what do I have a say in this? I'm just a student and know nothing about bills and work. If i do say something, He'll get pissy and complain about my grades and how I just sit around and do nothing, and how he does all this work and puts food on the table. But that's not true. I am grateful for what I have, but He always is quick to assume the worst out of the situation and more unfortunately, the worst out of people. He is always working in his office, so he doesn't see me do work, therefore if he didn't see me I didn't do anything, right? I do my share of work. I don't like this cycle, I feel it splitting the whole family apart. Because of money. 

And does get me wrong, he loves his family dearly, but often times his vision of making money gets in the way of everyones *including* him's vision of being happy. 

I play 2 instruments. I want to play more. He would be glad to if it didn't cost too much, but he says it's because of my grades that he won't get me them.

How can I talk to him about this? He won't listen if I talk to him.",18Aug2020,1
13,"Hi.

I don't know where to even begin with.
I'm (28F) had unstable relationship for most of my life.

I'm chubby and smart, I love to read and don't use make up. I've never been the popular type. Bullied in high school yadiyada. When I got to University I met my first friends.

So at 21, fresh student, I lost my virginity a gew years back but never had sex again after. I'll spare the details but he basicaly came asked me to dress up and leave. Ended up dating a friend lf a friend a few days after.

Anyways, at 21 I started dating my friend brother. We dated a little over a year. It was literally hell. He was abusive and I ended up in the hospital a few times.
One day I was finally strong enough to leave him. He stalked me for months. Waiting for me after work and sleeping in front of my appartment door.

After this.. First relationship. I did not want anything serious. Unfortunately i went on a sex adventure. From Fetich to others. I had a lot of partners. For years. I was ""dating"" for 2 3 months and moving on. Never happy &amp; always with a back up plan. Sometimes dating 2 3 peraon at the same time. I know. I was a B*

The only ""serious"" relationship I had after was a football guy that I datded for a bit over a year. When he started planning us moving together. I broke up with him with the first excuse I could find.

Now, lucky I met my current fiancé. He is the light of my life. He made me stronger. I helped him as much as he did for me. We have been dating for 2 yrs.
He has a child from a previous relationship. (10M)
That relafionship is over for years and I have also been faithful. ( I know im suprised too)

Now I trust him. He won't ever cheat on me. But I cannot stop being scared that he will fall in love with someone else. He does everything for me, loves me so much. Altho, I have no ""older"" couple around me happily married. My mom is telling me she wanta to divorce my dad. Other couple gets on each others nerves. So base on those ""exemple"" of a long lasting relationship. Im scared as hell to lose him.

My question is : how can I stop being affraid that he connecta with someone else amd stop loving me ?",18Aug2020,1

I was trying to explain to him the metaphors of the poem he was analyzing, and he didn’t understand what I was saying so he got frustrated at me and grabbed my arm.
When he grabbed my arm he twisted it and pushed my fingers back. He’s much stronger than I am and it hurt me very badly, my arm has clear bruises and is sore, he didn’t break anything but it does feel horrible.

I love my brother, but when he acts like this I feel scared to be in my own home, or scared to do something that might set him off. I don’t know what I can realistically do about this, or if there’s something I can do to diffuse him or stop him from having such anger fits.",18Aug2020,1

18,"My son is 7 years old. We made the tough decision a few years ago for him to live with his dad full time (in order for him to have a more stable life-he hated going back and forth and when he lives there his family watches over him instead of having to stay at a daycare center in my town)  and I get him every other weekend because we live over an hour apart. I live in my family's town and my ex lives in his family's town.  He is very attached to his father, and visits are difficult due to the drive and him getting homesick easily. 


My husband wants to move back to his country and I want to go with him. I hate the state I live in, and I have never wanted to stay here, but I can't afford to move to my son's town either, there are no jobs there and my ex has to drive far every day to commute to work. I am so torn about what to do. I know I want to move with my husband and be happy together, but I also worry about what kind of impact it will have on my son. He already has anxiety issues and is mildly autistic and very much attached to his comfort zone and his routine at his dad's house. 


I've been trying to just take things day by day and hang in here long enough until he graduates high school. Knowing that once that happens it will be okay to move away and have the life my husband and I want- settle down and have a house, be with his family. Has anyone been in a similar situation?

20,"I’ve been dating this girl for about a year and a half. We started dating junior year of college and I am now 3 months graduated. We’ve had our good times and bad times like any other couple. I tried to break up with her 2 previous times in school, but she seemed super into me and always reeled me back in...one of the reasons I stayed with her was because of how much she loved me and wanted to be in a relationship with me which made me feel good.  

Fast forward to recently, we moved to a small town 1.5 hours away from her friends and family and 5 hours from mine...Is he works at a decent paying grocery store because she doesn’t have a degree and I have an hour commute to my good job and and hour back home, but I am working from home this week. We’ve recently had slight problems and arguments, but I don’t think it was anything toooo major, issues related to social media.  She visits her friends this past weekend, and a couple of mine come over. My friends leave, but she doesn’t come home Sunday...she comes home Monday morning before she’s supposed to work and says she’s leaving me...I’ve kinda been in shock all day, I wasn’t expecting this.  I don’t know anyone in my town and I felt super lonely and depressed after I woke up from a nap today. 

I don’t know what to do...I love my job and I want to stay within the organization (which is national) but I would hate to commute 2 hours every day for a year only to come back to an expensive rental house that only houses my cat and I.  I guess I can go home for a week, but that’s quite the commitment to make the drive.

22,"So here's the situation, when I (19 M) was still dating my ex (20 M) he moved in with me into my parent's house. Long story short things didn't work out and we separated a couple months ago. Now he has no where to go because his parents won't take him back, but they did offer to let him store stuff at their place. He currently stays here but in a separate room to himself.

 When we were still dating he asked me and my parents if he can buy and keep a gun in the house for self defense against intruders. My parents and I agreed that it's not necessary (we live in a safe neighborhood) and it can pose a danger (my little cousin visits often and I deal with suicidal thoughts). My ex then talked to me about buying one behind my parent's back, which I adamantly disagreed with since this is their house and I don't want to get into trouble for something that we don't need. After we broke up he mentioned he might buy a gun, but keep it at his parent's place. I told him it was a waste of money since he needs to be saving for his own place, but ultimately I didn't care as long as it's not in the house. He later told me he decided to not buy the gun since it was too expensive.

The other night I went to take back something he borrowed, and I found a gun underneath the bed. It was loaded and the safety was off. He bought this gun illegally as well. I put it back where I found it, and I haven't told a soul until now. And I don't know if I should go straight to my parents, confront him, tell the police, or just pretend I didn't see anything.

23,"For quick context, I'm (22M) attached to 21(F) for 1 year. I have this friend (22M) that has been a friend of mine for 2 years and running. We shall refer to him as G.

As soon as I was attached, G has been constantly complaining about the lack of commitment from me and how I was an inadequate friend. (I spend time with G physically at least once a week and text him every day.) G has also been telling me things such as ""you're not as good as your girl, you should treasure her"" and ""I dont understand why your girl would pick you when you're below her caliber"". We argue at least once a week due to the lack of effort on my part (according to G). There were 2 such events in which he admitted to ""purposefully causing hurt"" by words just because he was angry, and he attributed it to his past and that he has no control of.

Recently, G and I hit a new low in our friendship and we hugged for the night. The next morning, I told G that though the hug was meaningful, I didnt feel comfortable about it, hoping to form a boundary. G wasnt having any of it and said I was overreacting and I toyed with him because everything that night was fake since I was uneasy. G repeatedly said I hurt him and cheated his feelings. 

Even after apologizing, he then gave me an ultimatum and said if I cant sacrifice time, I have to sacrifice a boundary to make up for it. Time has been tight on my end due to school, family problems and other social commitments. 

Events have been reduced in intensity as there is just so much more to type. I know that I cannot give him as much time as before I was attached and before I was in school, but am I bad for spending lesser time with him relative to before I was attached and busy?

We had to stop paying our HOA monthly fee after September because we were short on money and were barely making it. I've been trying to catch up on bills ever since the HOA being one of them. In May, We had gotten a notice of weeds in our rocks and had contacted them to let them know we needed a little more time to get them out. They said ""no problem take your time"" They did not let us know anything else was going on. Then come July all the sudden I had someone show up to serve me for the past due hoa bill.

We contacted them immediately and let them know this was the first we had heard of any of this, that we knew we hadn’t paid our monthly but the HOA hadn’t contacted us what so ever about it nor did they mention it when we called them about a violation of weeds. They preceded to tell us that the HOA said they sent us two notices and well as the law firm had sent us a demand letter which they said they got confirmation of delivery.


I immediately asked for copies and copy of the signature they said they got. The demand letter said it was delivered in person on 1/9/2020, and the signature was no were close to my signature. They would not even talk about a payment plan till I was either served with the summons or got the wavier notaries, which I found extremely wrong to have to do during this pandemic but I adhered to it and got it notaries and delivered it myself to their drop box, as they do not allow anyone in their office due to covid19. When I told them my whole family was in the high risk category for covid19 and we try to limit our outings due to it. We asked them if they could decrease or remove some of the late fees and interest fees. They wouldn’t not at all and told us they will allow us to pay back in full over the next six months and we have less than 48hrs to respond to that deal or it will be removed.

This is a $200 bill is now over $4k, I am still waiting for them to give me a total. We barely make enough to pay bills and put food on our table right now during this pandemic. Has anyone been in this situation? We are looking for any advice. We can not afford a lawyer. Would we be better off talking to the judge about this in person? or what should/can we do? They are trying to take my house that I have lived in for 12 years now. I can not believe they will not work with us what so ever besides a 6 month plan we cant afford they are our neighbors.

32,"Hey guys. So basically, I entirely neglected to do my summer work for my Gov class until the week that school starts, so I’m doing it now. For the summer work, I have to write two essays, one about a conflict or power struggle between different branches of the US government (legislative, executive, judicial) and one about a conflict or power struggle between the national government and a state government (or multiple state governments). In each essay I have to explain the issue and give my position on it. Each conflict has to have occurred this summer, and that’s pretty much the only rule.

I’m a solid essay writer, so I don’t need any pointers in that area. Also I can pretty comfortably choose a position on each topic (if I don’t personally lean one way or the other I’ll just choose the easier one). It’s just that I don’t really keep up with politics largely because I find them to be very depressing. I live in the US, if that wasn’t clear already. There are probably a crap ton of topics to choose from with Covid and the protests and everything that Trump does, but for some reason I’m at a loss here.

Also, I’m not sure if this is the right sub for this type of question. If there is a better one, please let me know what it could be. Thanks in advance!",18Aug2020,1
33,"I have admitted a few times on reddit that I was in an abusive relationship back in highschool. While my girlfriend began the abuse (which she refuses to ever acknowledge) I certainly did not respond by leaving or doing the mature thing. Instead, I became verbally abusive myself. In my opinion, the entire relationship was a toxic mess and I never considered one single person to be the “abuser” and one to be the “victim”. For me, it was just a horrible relationship where we were both horrible to each other. 

It has been 4 years since then.  I have been with a new woman for 3 years and we are happy and healthy. I pretty much left my ex in the past and buried that time in my life. At first I admit I was weary of my new girlfriend due to trust issues and some of my own toxic behaviors, but I fixed that right up and became a much better person. My ex has consistently labeled me a verbal abuser to people we know in real life, people on the internet, and added in that I was racist and homophobic to boot. I know for a fact the racism and homophobia is not true, but I admit my sense of humor was very edgy. I was younger and just thought what I said was harmless jokes, but it has now become the perfect ammunition to help destroy my reputation. She calls me scum and a menace, but we literally have almost no contact since highschool. She has never named me on the internet, but a few months ago she threatened to. I tried to apologize and come to an understanding. I took accountability for EVERYTHING she threw at me. This includes things that I believe she made up. However, I appreciated her giving me a chance so I gave her the benefit of the doubt. Things were “fixed” for a few weeks, but out of nowhere she determined I was not genuinely sorry, I am a selfish horrible person, insulted my girlfriend, and then blocked me on everything. 

Due to everything she says about me, I seem to be forgetting all the progress I’ve made. I’m beginning to actually view myself how she describes me and it is giving me anxiety and depression. People from my highschool unfollow me to this day as she continues to label me an abuser. It’s nobody particularly important to me, but now I know just one more person sees me as bad. I’ve worked incredibly hard to become a better person, but now I cannot even convince myself that I actually am a good person. Even worse, she will never allow me to tell my side of the story. She has already convinced everyone to hate me, especially because she can leverage social issues over me as well. I fear I will eventually lose everyone, including my girlfriend. I fear career loss and an all around horrible life, where my highschool past will always loom over me. Changing kind of seems futile now, like I should have never even tried if the world will choose to view me as the same person from then.",18Aug2020,1
34,"Hello. I’m 28 yrs of age. I don’t have a college degree, I’m a welder by trade, and plan to lead my mothers real estate firm when she retires. (I’m Going back to school for my real estate license, and continue to excel in my experience in fabrication while in school), I pretty much have everything mapped out on what I want to do with myself and invest in, and I believe in living comfortable and am no where near programmed to settle for a struggling life even though that’s how I was raised in some events growing up. I was always taught to make do with what you have until a better time, and most women I have met look down or frown upon that type of mentality, because they believe it’s “mediocre” or not having some sort of class/standard within myself. It’s not that I’m I used to the struggle, the ghetto, or whatever the hell u wanna call it. I was raised with working class parents, Not rich ror middle class, just a stable environment for a child to be raised in. I guess maybe I should just wait until I’m rich to date women. Even a friend of mine told me I should not be dating at all if I’m not ready to take care of her 100%, and also a lady this morning on the radio was arguing that a guy that has power and money and make things happy is very attractive. So should I keep living within my means and go about with my plan? Or work harder as harder for a women’s lust?",18Aug2020,1
35,"I (17M) am in a relationship with my girlfriend of almost 2 years but I’m not sure if I’m happy, we barely talk and when we do, we end up fighting and I hate it. My best friend (17M) has a sister who is in 10th grade (I’m in 12th) but is 16 and I really like her. I get butterflies in my stomach when I see her name pop up on my phone and I’m really falling for her. We talk a decent amount and it seems like she seeks out to talk to me more and enjoys talking with me. When school was still a thing I would go over to my friends house in the mornings like 30 minutes before the bus normally comes and we would all hang out but when it was time to drive to school (me and my friend both drive) she would ride with me every day and not with my friend (her brother). She has asked me to go with her to small things and I hang out with her and her friends rarely, but when I do, it’s never awkward and they seem to think I’m okay. I’m not sure how my friend would think if I told him that I liked his sister. I don’t know if she even likes me or she just thinks of me as a friend, and I don’t want to end my relationship to take a chance. Any advice?

37," So my friend and I planned on moving to to the city together and becoming roommates while he goes to school and I work (recent graduate). The thing is that he picked out a pretty sketchy run down apartment and I'm concerned that we will run into a whole host of issues while living there. I was away for work when he looked at this current apartment so I didn't see it personally but based on other as we had seen together and were looking at I trusted my friend when he said that this was the apartment because all the other ones were quite nice and we had even agreed that we didn't want to live in anything super sketchy.  

The pictures looked pretty good and based on my friends description it seemed like a great choice for us. I have already signed the lease for this place and just saw it for the first time the other day. The building is quite run down and some of the wood on the sills is almost rotting through There is also gross moss growing on the outside and has a very sketchy appearance. 

 I am quite a passive person and had a hard time voicing my concerns to my friend who seemed to overlook the issues I saw quite easily. I'm sure I could make it work in this place but I'd rather try and find a bit nicer of a place. I just had bad experiences in other apartments with getting broken into and having sketchy people around as well as maintenance issues such as leaky roofs.  

 Do I tell my friend I don't like the place or is it too late to try and switch places so late? Not sure how he will react and don\\t want to upset him or start this whole thing off on the wrong foot. please help lol",18Aug2020,1

I should say that they might not be divorcing but it may be the outcome of this. It felt so sudden too. Me and my brother were downstairs watching stuff on our devices when my mom comes down crying telling us to sit and listen. I've seen my mom frustrated with my dad and only fought once. I really didn't think it would lead to this. I dont know... I feel like I am to blame as well as I normally close myself from the world and dont connect that much with my family. I still connect with them like when we played Jackbox yesterday but when I think of that I think about two days ago when my mom joked about finally seeing my face since a couple days ago. I don't know what to do or how I can help my dad. He's taken a bigger blow to the heart than me and it shows. He just came into my room and asked if he can help with anything. I still dont know if I can speak properly. All I can say was ""I dont know"" which came out so soft that it might have sounded like ""dont"".

46,"My mother (66) passed away on August 4th from Covid... She was sick with pneumonia in early July, then a week after getting released from the hospital she was having issues getting out of bed. I went to see her that day, and decided to call an ambulance and had her admitted to the hospital. She was confirmed covid positive on July 18th. She had asthma, COPD, and fibroids in her lungs so we already knew we would probably never see her again... which only made this whole experience worse.

My Dad (64) also had Covid-19 at the same time, but made it through. However, he was hospitalized at the same time due to gangrene related to his diabetes. He had to have two major surgeries to get rid of the gangrene. Once he was conscious, we (dad, myself and sister) made the decision to let my mom pass since she was no longer breathing on her own.

I’m not close with my dad... he’s become very political in the last few years and has pushed all family except my mom away. I’ve only spoken to him in passing when I would visit my mom. However, he has been living with me for the last 2 weeks due to his surgeries. My mom did everything for him, and now I feel like I’m taking care of a giant baby instead of taking care of myself.

On top of all this, I ended up getting covid from helping my mom. I’m a senior in college, so I took an incomplete for my summer courses and took a few weeks off for work. I had to withdraw from the fall semester due to everything going on... but I feel so lost now.

How do I process my mother’s death when I have a toxic person living under my roof? My sister, the person I’m the closest with lives several states away... I’ve tried to confide in her, but she tries to 1-up me on who has the worse life. 

How do I get back to “normal” when my mother is gone, I’m not in school, and I dread work?

The entire time we've been here she hasn't done much except yell at everyone.

51,"A lot of this is my emotional reaction to things that have happened or are currently happening to me. I have goals but I am having a lot of trouble pursuing them consistently.  
I've had a recent breakup with a partner who had been acting weirdly for a few months at least, I just thought they were unhappy with their job or something, and they broke up with me prior to going on a trip. After discussing the breakup just prior to them leaving they decided to think it over on the trip because they weren't even sure to break up with me. They wrote a long letter as to why and left it with me to read while they were gone. It had a list of problems they were having with the relationship and why they were unhappy. I reviewed it and we've yet to discuss it but we will soon. When returning they realized they can't live without me and don't want to breakup and they've seemed as happy as we were before they started going downhill. Ever since that I've been in pain. I constantly think about how they can't discuss their problems when they occur and they rather have it fester until it boils over and they just want to breakup. I am going to talk to them about it soon but I've been in pain and working a lot I don't even want to discuss it when I get home. We've been together 4 years or so and live together since almost the beginning.  
On top of that, I've been dealing with a job that I love but co-workers who are incredibly childish and immature and their attitudes are draining. They aren't offensive but they're annoying to me and I have to supervise most of them. However,  I receive no backing from my managers so rules go out the wayside. I'm trying to leave the area and perhaps do the same well paying job elsewhere but it's difficult with CoVid-19 having developed. I just seem to be receiving stress from all angles and I've been depressed since when my partner started being unhappy.

They stated their firm was stated in the agreement and they had all of the information about the case, even the date i signed the documents, name of the firm, the lawyers names, i told them i didn't know such firm and don't know who they are. For 20 minutes the guy was speaking highly of his firm and wanted to ask me a few questions about my case.

I called my firm and they said no one was suppose to call me, more bells ringing off, then he ""calls"" them at the same time and i get hung up on. Then i get a call from a different number from my said firm, the person sounded frustrated and i hung up and called back the same office number. Same person picks up, tells me they will explain everything and hangs up and calls me again from another phone number. I don't pick up and call the first lawyer i signed with, i asked for a copy of the agreement, he said he's not in the office and i would need to call tomorrow and request it. But he also stated that if any one calls me and mentions their office that it should be fine because people are suppose to contact me. But this person was another lawyer from another firm.

58,I'm moving on but I can't stop thinking about sex. Which is bad because we're still close frienss.,18Aug2020,1
59,"How do I deal with feelings of jealousy in the moment, when I know they are unfounded and silly? Thats the short if it anyhow, here's the longer contextual bit:

My (M27) fiance (F25) are high school sweethearts and have been together sine I was a Junior and she a Freshman. I had girlfriends before her, but I am her first and only significant other. We've been best friends through it all, and it hasn't been an easy road all the time, but we've always maintained that we are eachother's ""people"". 

We are very open to eachother, we'll tell eachother who we think is cute, who we have little crushes on, and we'll involve stuff like that in our bedroom activities and role play occasionally. This has never made me feel bad before, and to the best of my knowledge it hasn't ever made her feel bad. Again, we try to be very communicated when things aren't going our way.

Last year we went on a camping trip with some friends, dabbled in some drugs, and things got a bit sexually touchy between her and one of our other friends. They didn't wind up doing anything overt, just some butt rubbing through pajamas.  After the camping trip was over she told me about it, and we incorporated it into our fantasies and role playing, and man it made the sex electric. And again, no bad feelings from my end at all, just eroticism.

She talked about how she wanted to go further with him during the camping trip, but didn't know if it would have been okay with me. And that prompted a serious conversation between us about opening our relationship up to different sexual partners, and not just fantasies. She having never had another sexual partner besides me, was quite curious, but didn't want to do anything that would hurt our relationship or me. Myself, having had sexual partners before her, am of the mindset that sex is very fun, and told her that I was honestly okay with it providing she adhered to a couple rules, that we came up with mutually:

&amp;#x200B;

1) She had to keep me in the loop on things. That doesn't mean call me right before and ask permission, but it meant more like don't hide it from me, let me know afterwards, keep it incorporated into our sex life as well.

2) No romanticism. I didn't want to be a polyamorous couple, it was just to be swinging. So that meant no ""dates"" with hand holding and whatnot, no ""I love you"" texts, no telling other people that she was in a relationship with someone else.

I think its important to note at this point that this was a serious conversation that happened over the course of a week or so, interspersed with a lot of sexual fantasising and role playing involving various situtions and people she thought were cute. Oh, and also, while I was agreeable to her sleeping around, she has quite a low self confidence and was not wanting me to sleep around, because she thought it might make her feel bad. This was also completely mutual, I love her, and I don't want to sleep around if it would hurt her in any way.

At this point we fast forward a year. She graduates from college and starts a job that she absolutely hates. It makes her miserable, but its good money, and it is the thing she went to school for, so she is feeling pretty trapped in it. Her days are quite stressful and she cries and sleeps a lot. Our schedules also conflict quite badly so we are seeing way too little of eachother.

On one of our rare days off together we hosted a get together with some friends for board games and some drinking. Eventually they leave, except for one who decides to stay the night (Actually the younger brother of the guy from the camping trip earlier in the story). We hang out for a while and then I go to bed, I'm a bit of a lightweight.

The next day my fiance tells me that they hooked up that night, twice actually. She was worried about my reaction, but again, I felt nothiing negative at all, and instead it once again jumpstarted our sexual energies a bit and what followed was a few weeks of fantastic sex and fantasizing.

This guy lives out of town, but would come up to visit once every other week or so for games. When he would, they would hook up, or when she went to his town on a trip, they would hook up. They began snapping eachother and the like, still no bad feelings from me by the way, and this went on for round about a month and a half or so I would guess.

Cut to one of the worst nights in my life. I come home from work and she is crying, won't tell me whats wrong. Finally I get it out of her. Over the last year she's felt dead inside from her job, distant from our relationship because of our opposing work schedules, and says that if something doesn't change we aren't going to make it. I know this sounds cliche and predictable, but this blew me out of the water. In all our years together I had never thought for a moment that we would ever be apart from eachother, we were planning a wedding, I was fully expecting to be with her forever.

From that point on I was stressed as all hell. Constantly doing chores at home, texting her and snapping her throughout the day, just trying to be the best boyfriend in the world to try and mitigate the stress of her everyday work life, and generally try to make my presence more known to her while she was at home and I was at work. Trying to fix the situation and bridge that gap that had grown while I wasn't paying attention.

It was at this point that I noticed the other lad was starting to come up quite a bit more often. He would come up and stay with us on each of her weekends. The sex still wasn't bothering me at all, that still very much was erotic to me, but I noticed the giggling, and then the tickle fights, and then they started pushing the couches in the living room together and having sleepovers and I would sleep in my bedroom alone. On each of her weekends.

Now I know exactly what you're thinking at this point, that there is soemthing going on between them and I'm blind and not seeing it, but I was definitely seeing it, and I kinda broke down one night to her about it. We cried a bunch and talked, and she assured me that they were not a couple, it was just that their relationship had grown to being close friends. They were having sex and stuff still, but all the giggling and sleepovers were things she would do with any of her other friends. She said she had no romantic feelings for him whatsoever, and I 100% trust and believe her on that.

She dropped a bit of a bomb on me when she said that, I'm part of her life, so its hard to disassociate from her stress when she's with me. But he isn't part of her life, and around him she can just turn her brain off, and laugh and let go. She related it to being like a bad habit, like taking a few drinks after work. She told me that she could see how upset it was making me, and that she would definitely stop if I asked her to. At this point my jealous feelings were gone, and I was just so sad for the situation she was in, where she was so stressed and upset, and I just couldn't bear myself to take away the thing that was helping her find release from that. So I told her I was sorry for freaking out, and that she didn't need to stop.

Its been another month and a half or two months since that talk now. He is up here quite a lot. I feel like such a GRINCH, because I'll come home, they'll be cuddling, and I'll get the most sour taste in my mouth. She's offered several times to stop since then, and each time I tell her that its okay, I can swallow it, I just want her to be happy. 

And I Truly believe I just want her to be happy, when I think about it, but in the moments when I'm playing on my computer or washing the dishes, or just trying to sleep, and I hear them giggling and laughing, I just feel so GREEN that its not me making her laugh. I don't even feel any ill will towards him, more just... immasculated and jealous. I want to be the one she can disassociate with.

I'm writing this now because he's been in my house for a week under the pretense of looking for a new job ( he hasn't looked yet ). In that week they have slept together each night, the text messages I receive from her at work are sporadic, I have not had any sex, and I just feel like such a heel. 

She will notice occasionally and come in and tell me she loves me and that she is so grateful for how I've been handling this with her, it will brighten up my world and make all of this seem so silly. But then the jealousy will creep in hours later again.

Way TL;DR: Fiance is sleeping with another guy. Sex doesn't bother me, but giggling and cuddling do. Its the only thing that seems to make her happy though, and I want her to be happy. How do I fight my own feelings of jealousy in the moments  when its hardest, so that she can work through this thing she needs to do. Does anyone have any jealousy fighting strategies?",18Aug2020,1
60,"I am female and 15. I have had this job for a year.  The owner slowly stopped giving me shifts and then when covid 19 hit I got no shifts. There is a lack of communication on what’s going on most of the time. I am unsure if they even want me back because I never asked for a break during covid-19. When I first started my job I was pumped for the money and new experience but it was very boring because the (all young female staff) would make me stand at cash for my entire 5-8 hour shifts while they would be in the back laughing and on their phones. Many of the girls talk about everyone behind each others back and it is overall a not very exciting job. I like the money though and I NEED the money because when I graduate school I have no financial support to help me pay for university and college. Any thoughts? 

EDIT: I really would love to work at a dog daycare, anything involving animals or anything outdoors where I can listen to music and relax.

61,"I am a 38 year old man who spent my entire life in education. I worked my way up from assistant to teacher and the principal. I have a passion for working with people and have pretty much been on my game for a long time. I loved my staff, my kids, and elements of my job. During my tenure year, my favorite and long time boss left! The decision was left to the new boss (of 3 months) who had other plans for her NEW position. She denied my tenure, which means...I'm out.

63," 

This is something that happened tonight, and it honestly bothers me so much that I really can't sleep because of how much it upsets me.

to summaries it to the best of my ability, I was playing Warzone with a friend of mine with two other acquaintances of ours. The way that these three play surpasses anything that I can ever do. While each one can have about 5 to 10 kills or more per game, I struggle to even get 2 and I die often. So after about two games of losing my friend messages me in private to say, ""dude, just let us play trios. It would be more fun for everyone"" Basically asking me to leave...I don't fight this or anything and I make up an excuse for the other two that I need to go to bed early and turned off the game.

I understand that some people love to win and hate losing, and I get it is unfair of me to force anyone like that to play with me. But it really fucking hurts no matter how you spin it, you know? Like I already know I'm dead weight. I wish I was better at reacting, better at aiming, I'm just not. I really try to improve, even in fighting games, it's the same. I just don't have what it takes. but put me in front of any single-player game and somehow I can do it whatever difficulty it is or whatever kind of genre.

I’ve enjoyed playing my guitar, violin, and saxophone and have just recently tried making my own music.


And just recently, I’ve been interested in learning how to fight. During my college season and a majority of my life I was told to check out boxing or some type of MMA because of my height and size of my limbs. I think that was an ego boost but I’m pretty dense soo I’m not sure.


At the moment, I’m studying kinesiology trying to become a doctor or a physical therapist. I enjoy school and feel like it should be my priority to have a steady career.

While they made up I've been still very upset. I try talking with Bea but she really only wants to talk with my one closest friend and really not anyone else. I've been upset about it but recently Bea has pushed my limits. We talk to another girl who isn't in my friend group, they help run a discord server with us and are a mod in a discord server that we hate. Bea has been using this girl to have her destroy the other server and only talks with her when there is drama with that server. In a call Bea called the girl a puppet who kisses our ass. I got extremely mad as I'm friends with this girl and I told Bea don't say that because I actually care about that girl. As things got worse I finally decided to tell the girl that bea thought of her as a puppet and she broke down. Bea had still been talking to this girl like she actually liked her when she was only using her and it was fucked up.

I'm now left the rest of the group confused why the girl left and Bea thinking this girl made an alt account to join the server. Because my best friend is friends with Bea it's really hard for me to tell them how I actually feel about Bea

The thing is, I met a foreing girl there and we hung out a lot during my travel. We had amazing times together for a couple of days and one hour before leaving she came with me to the train station to say goodbye. I just can't explain how amazing those times together were. We enden up kissing in the TS and we left crying... Before leaving I promised her I was going to see her again within the following year.

After I came back to my country, I can't explain how hard I hustled to get a chance to see her again (I live in latin america, and so the economic situation is really bad). So, I worked a lot and sold some stuff I didn't use to get some money, after that I started learning her language so I could communicate better with her (We talked in english, but I speak spanish and she speaks russian). Within the first 6 months, we talked A LOT through Instagram and basically DMs, telling ourselves how much we missed each other and that we couldn't wait to meet again. I had everything planned; I was going to Russia in June but then Corona hit hard and I ended up being in lockdown for 6 freaking months (I've been in lockdown since March, and I still can't live my house here in Argentina).

In my country, things started to get worse but I had faith that I would see her again, my travel was postponed to February 2021, beacuse I applied for a scholarship to get to study the language there, in her country, in her city, so I could see her again because, I realized how in love I was AFTER I left her.

The thing is, 2 weeks after finally getting my scholarship reviewed and approved (which costed me a lot of work, procedures, an interview and even some money), she tells me she's got a boyfriend and that she used to like me a lot, but distance and language and time did its thing.

93,"I just need to talk. Feeling very....defeated. 

I’m nearing 35. I have a fiancé, a daughter. We work in a niche trade industry (fiancé and I work together) and moved to a new job in New York. This job is about 50% commission, and average income according to financial records from the district manager show a great salary with a recent store buyout, which meant that average would increase as we took on more work. 

Then covid happened. 

Our industry relies about 96% on school music programs. With delayed starts, frozen programs, frozen budgets as the schools try to recoup the costs of setting up the district to do what they needed to do to keep kids safe.....we’re hurting financially. We’re making commission on bits and bobs, have roughly 2 weeks left of it, and it’s so minimal we’re just breaking even. The summer is where we make the bulk of our commission. Without it, we’re living on a base salary that doesn’t cover all of our monthly expenses. 

The only option to keep this job, for now, is #1) one of us take a part time job to make up for the loss or #2) one of us quit to save on daycare costs (it eats 70% of my monthly income on base pay alone) while the other works 2 jobs. 

Second option is quit and move in with a family member while we rebuild on an entry-level salary in a new profession that hopefully is well-paying for our needs (as in I’d love to go to the store and not worry about what to put back if we’re $10 over budget) and is moderately recession-proof. 

We have no idea when school music programs will recover....if they recover. Arts programs are always on the chopping block and last to bring back. A second job would be tolerable if we just knew there was an end date. 

But, if we move in with a family member, we have support from family nearby to watch little one when needed, connect us with jobs, pay less with living expenses, etc. 

Downside is we’re literally starting over. We won’t have the money for moving vans and storage units. We’ll be selling a car, throwing out our furniture, getting rid of most of what we own. We don’t have much and most of the shit came from Wal-Mart....but it’s ours, y’know? We bought it. We didn’t go dumpster diving during rich kid dorm move-out days. 

We’re also losing most of our money moving (family is in MO) when we could use that money to pay off debt. 


So it’s just....trading one shit situation for another. We can have a shit situation but have family around, or wait this shit out and see if things turn around here in NY and one of us work ourselves to death (losing time with our daughter in the process) in the meantime. 




I hope all that makes sense. I just....hate this. I don’t want to start all over again, but I also don’t want to constantly worry about how we’re gonna  afford feed our daughter. 

I know this is all because of covid....but I still feel like such a failure. I have 3 college degrees and I’m about to apply for a goddamn job stocking shelves again. I lost my job in the last recession as a teacher, and now here we are and I’m losing half my income because of the covid closures.

I let a friend move in with me and she left her stuff in my patio and the cops were called because apparently i had “junk in my lawn” got cited for that. Im having my roof replaced and i couldn’t park in my driveway so i parked next to the curb and got a ticket because my car was parked in a way that affected flow of traffic (literally everyone on the block fucking does this).

96,"So without giving away too many details, I was offered my direct supervisor's position, but I only have half of the schooling and only one year of experience in my field with no experience in any supervisory position. I'm sure my supervisor gets paid around 100k, but my supervisor told me to expect around 50-60k, when I was at least hoping for 70-80k. I can understand why they would not want to pay me as much but the position is one with high liability and responsibility (especially during covid). The opportunity is really great because of the prestige and title of this position.

Now, I also got accepted into a scholarship program with post-graduate resources and placement and it starts in less than a month so I have to make a decision between the two (as they are both fulltime). I have not told my employers about my acceptance to (or even applying for) the program but if I do not get the supervisory position (for at least 70k) then I will be pursuing my education. 

However if I accept the program, then I will be rejecting the supervisor position and also I would have to change my shifts unexpectedly (I'd work less because my education would be fulltime), so it would be like a double whammy to the company. Also I'm on great terms with my supervisor and it would definitely detriment to our relationship (and future requests to be a reference). 

I don't know what I should do, especially if there's a possiblity that they give someone with more experience the position and then I end up losing both my opportunities.

So reddit what should I do?",18Aug2020,1
97,"For context, I’m 19F. My 17 y/o brother wanted to start losing weight. He had a little bit of fat on him, however I wouldn’t call him fat. He tends to go on pretty extreme diets, like the Keto diet, or other self-created diets in which he basically tries to reduce his intake of whatever it is that he thinks is making him fat to basically nothing.

This time around, he’s essentially starving himself. He counts calories constantly (always staying under 200 per day) and he tries to run to burn more calories. He recently revealed to me that he hadn’t had any bowel movement (meaning he hasn’t pooped) in about a week. He sleeps 12-14 hours a day but is always exhausted. And he sees nothing wrong with it.

He’s lost about 27 pounds in 2 weeks.

My family and I have all tried to sit him down and explain to him why this is unhealthy. The speed at which he’s losing weight is far to great and he’s not doing well. He’s a pretty stubborn person and he’s always the most “logical” person in the room. No matter how many articles or scientific studies we bring him, he’ll always have something to counter it, or he simply won’t believe us. 

I have told him that he needs to be concerned, and that he should go to the hospital if he hasn’t pooped in a week, but he keeps saying that he’s fine. Please help!",18Aug2020,1

102,"So I got into a long, discussion with my Dad last night and I want an honest opinion about how I handled it. I didn’t handle it very well, but hear me out: 

Last night before I (24) was coming home from going into town to get internet connection, I got a text from my Dad (60) asking how much longer I would be. I said I would be home soon. But then because I just knew that my Dad has this habit of commenting on the dog barking whenever I come home, I sent him a text saying “I swear if you comment on the dog when I come home I will just sleep in town”. And I didn’t get a reply. 

I get home and my Dad is stand-offish. I ask him what he thought of my text and he said he was offended, because he was just concerned about me. I explain to him that I’m sorry but lately I’ve had it up to here with his comment on the dog barking (because we never trained him not to bark) and because it’s basically something he says to me all the time when I come home. So I explain to him my feelings and he says that he sees my point. But then he goes to sit in the couch in the dark. I ask him what’s wrong. And then he goes into that he had a long day of clearing brush (completely by choice, it’s not like his job) and told me that he needed to sit down. And goes into this mini rant about how hard his day was, (“I worked 12 hours today”) even though he was the one that decided have the trees cut down and clear the brush himself with my Mom. 

And then somehow he gets on this topic about how I am rude and how much he and my mom put up with me. And i don’t think I’m that rude. I mean, I apologize for things that don’t need apologizing for. I do get annoyed. And I’m assuming he’s been picking up on my additive towards him because he has been super annoying: he likes to be around me whenever he gets the chance, from the first moment I get home from work he’s standing at the door waiting for me most days. And it’s constant physical touch with him whether I’ve expressed that I’ve wanted it or not. And if I don’t want a hug, he will have to touch my shoulder or smell my hair. It makes me so annoyed and uncomfortable. He also has been doing things that I would not approve of like chopping down a  large tree by himself, and then getting the chainsaw stuck in it, and then yelling for help as my Mom and I struggle to get it out while slipping around in slushy SNOW while it’s WINDY outside. 

He is also very condescending whenever I express something that is troubling me about him. He will also say one thing and then change it later. For example, another night a couple weeks ago I arrived home late. It was midnight and I apologized. And what does my Dad say? He says I don’t have to apologize because I’m an adult and I should be free to make my own chooses. Well, last night, he said the exact opposite. He said “you know, I don’t like you being out late and you shouldn’t be out late. You should be home at a good time..” and yeah, I agree, but then why are you mad? When you said the exact opposite not that long ago? 

So we get into this long tangent-it wasn’t like he was yelling or I was-I tell him how I feel that he likes to make me into the bad guy whenever I voice a problem involving him. Like, yesterday I said that it bothered me that he did this thing (bringing up an issue that happened a long time ago involving me) and then saying that I was rude because of that one time. Or couple of times to be fair. 

So, I know it was wrong that I sent the message and worded it the way I did, but I have been so frustrated with my Dad and other things on top of that. So I apologized and explained that to him. And he actually apologized, and said he was sorry, and I felt good. But I feel like my Dad likes to guilt trip me whenever I have an issue involving his behavior. Because then suddenly we’re talking about my behavior. 

I’m sorry this is kinda all over the place. But I’d like a second opinion.",18Aug2020,1

I’ve told her SEVERAL times that staring at me makes me 50 shades of uncomfortable. When she does it I make sure I glare at her. The “if looks could kill” kind of glares.

She still isn’t even fully grasping the “Ive gone most of my life being sexually and physically abused so don’t touch me” part, well she does until we’re at my grandparents, then she pats my arm or leg or rubs my shoulder which is beyond me why she thinks she can do it, and make my grandparents think that part of my life went away, which the abuse did, but I HATE being touched. I always will. I have a big personal bubble and the only things allowed in that personal bubble is my dog and cat and the dogs I babysit.

114,"**Backstory:**

Last year, I started uni. Something happened where my parents broke my trust by looking through my messages on an old phone which caused me to cut contact. 

This caused numerous issues, with my Mum constantly trying to contact me, ringing me at every opportunity and making suicide threats. 

One time, she called me saying she'd overdosed to try and get me to come home. She hadn't, but i'd called the police about it and they said she was manipulative. 

Since, I have been living at home due to lockdown.

**Now the main event:**

I wanted to live with my boyfriend this year, but due to Coronavirus i've been living at my parent's home. 

I also got a job offer which meant i'd have to live at home to save money. Since this has likely fallen through, id been talking to my boyfriend again about us living together. 

Now, another thing to note is that my Dad left during quarantine. He'd been seeing another woman, but my parent's marriage has never been good due to how badly my Mum treated everyone. They were always arguing and I had a rough upbringing due to that, i'd say.

My sister has a place at uni and visits occasionally. She will be moving out in September. I had planned on living at home, but stuff changes and now I want to move out.

This morning, I mentioned I wanted to live with my boyfriend. She cried and said my family would be disappointed in me. She said my cousins had never lived with their partners, and that I wouldn't be given any money from relatives towards moving out if I left (which my sister is getting, and apparently i'd get if I lived at home). 

She said due to the divorce, she would lose the family home as one person would be living there and doesn't need that much space. She then pulled the suicide card. She said there would be 'no point in being here' if I left.

I'm in a predicament now.

I am NOT responsible for my mother and I made that very clear to her. But she won't accept it and I fear I will relive the past year (which traumatised me) if she blackmails me again.

I wondered if there is anything I could do, or anyone I could discuss this with? Any advice welcome. Thanks",18Aug2020,1

The virus is an issue but so is instructional presentation.  As it relates to my other child, the final decision is that they will be attending an online school in an attempt to provide uninterrupted instruction as the end of last year was a total wash.  Understandably, our district was not prepared for the pandemic, however, they are still not geared towards online instruction.

I do have a step child who has made plans to attend in person, full time.  This leaves a giant gap in our safe bubble and custody is split.  If there wasn't potential exposure in this regard I might be more apt to accept that the four year old would stay home another year, but since this is the current circumstance, which I have no say in, I wonder if I should continue with the preschool enrollment.

So on with the situation now: 

A little backstory:

I've (18F) been in the foster care system for more that 2 years now, I have 2 (14F and 16M) other siblings who chose to live with my dad instead. I was with a very crappy family for the first 2 years who were abusive in a verbal and neglectful way, unfortunately even when I brought it up with the social workers, they just found a way to put the blame on me. Anyways, now I am on independent living at a different place where they still pay for me to survive until 19. It's not too bad except there's a lot of life skill I don't know and I feel super awkward living with someone else I suppose. On the bright side, I have plans to go to University this year and as far as I know they'll be helping with paying for it. 

Here's the issue: 

My sister who CHOSE to go back to her dad and even blamed me for ruining everything back then, now needs feminine hygiene products which our dad doesn't provide for her, nor is she allowed to leave the house at all and she asks me to buy her the products which I did the first time and secretly left it on their rented property. This time, I went shopping for her again but unfortunately I don't have any means of getting to her location safely. I wanna deliver her the things but I can't. I know it's not my responsibility but I feel bad because we used to be so mean to each other when we were younger. I have nooo idea what to do.

So, I am 15m as of this time but I am going back to roughly when I was ~13 give or take? And throughout my childhood I was pretty neglected and hardly received any good attention.

So being a 13 year old that was fairly neglected I did a big ol' fuck up and lied.

I lied about my past, I lied about my age and I lied about other shit.
We can already see where this is going.

I claimed I was 16, I claimed I was hurt in many ways and some of that was true and some of that was false, I claimed much more shit and it got me the attention I seeked.

But it doesn't stop there, more recently to many people, to get that teenager ambition, I've claimed I am 18 because I just wanna be included in shit, I wanna be in the good times.
I do a lot of shit 18 year olds do anyway,
I've had intercourse, gotten wasted, smoked and other shit.
I can hold my own and what not so I feel happier in that sort of group but I feel shitty about it because I am lying

But it hasn't all been to be lewd and crude, it can be so I can actually interact with others because people are scared to hang around kids, probably because of this type of shit

So at the end of the day I am asking for help.
I am asking, what the fuck should I do?

We also share mutual friends who I would be comfortable mediating with. I don’t need all the money at one time, if she needs to pay me back $50 or $100 or whatever at a time that’s fine by me.

127,"Kind of a long post but I have a lot of bullshit to share. 

I've had a best friend for 9 years since I was 12, now 21, we'll call her Madison. For her 23rd Birthday this year, she really wanted to go out of town. So Madison, a couple girlfriends and myself drove a couple hours away to stay at a nice air bnb by the forest for the weekend. She wanted to take her car because it's slightly better gas mileage, being a hybrid.

Madison was very clear in not wanting to drive while we were there so she could drink as much as she wanted for her birthday. That's fine, she just said I'm ""the only other person who can drive"" because of her insurance. Just a little explanation, she's been in 2 accidents before where she was deemed at fault and so she has an insurance broker to find the cheapest insurance possible, because it's pretty expensive monthly with those 2 points on her record. 

Also, I cosigned for her current vehicle she just got 6 months ago because she has no credit, her dad's credit was not good and my credit is amazing. We were working together at the time and she asked me if I would cosign for the 5k loan, it was kinda hard to say no because she was my friend and would complain all the time how badly she needed a reliable car to commute the 20 min. to work everyday because her car then was a $300 POS, she had to shovel $600 into it to just keep it running. I figured it would be fine because she has full time work now and makes good money, I wasn't concerned with her not paying her car loan every month.

Back to the collision:
We were on the freeway heading back to our air bnb after grabbing fast food, I was driving. A vehicle hesitated in front of us, driving sporadically, seeming unsure if they were supposed to take the exit or not. Last second changed their mind, crossing the v-shaped lane lines and pulled in front of us, then hit their brakes. I hit my brakes as soon as I saw this but we both ended up curving the same direction and I rear ended them.

No one was hurt, but Madison was having a panic attack due to PTSD from being in other accidents. One of our friends comforted her while me and our other friend assessed the situation. Their back bumper had barely a couple scratches, Madison's vehicle was a little crunched in the front but not bad, it was still driveable. I stayed pretty calm, called my mother and asked her what to do (because I'm a great driver, I've never been in an accident before.)

So I took pictures, swapped information with the teenager, and did not call the police because no one was injured. I called my insurance and filed a claim immediately, because my mother told me we have full coverage insurance and I'm covered in any vehicle I drive. I told Madison everything will be fine for that reason.

My insurance called me back the following week, I told them what happened, they proceeded to tell me they couldn't help me because Madison's insurance has to take care of it even though I was driving, they would only take care of it if the car wasn't insured. Fuck. I called her insurance and filed a new claim, explained what happened again, they said an adjuster would contact me. While waiting on the adjuster to contact me from Madison's insurance, the adjuster from the other driver called me the next day.

The other drivers adjuster said she filed a generic claim online, didn't even know what happened. So she took my recorded statement and I told her what happened. She was like ""obviously this isn't a standard rear ending"". Yeah no shit, it wasn't my fault. She said that they've tried contacting the other driver but can't get ahold of her. So basically we are waiting on this 19 y/o to respond. Come to find out if she doesn't respond they are automatically just going to put me at fault. ???

So a couple days later I call Madison's insurance again. I manage to get ahold of the adjuster assigned. I tell what happened again. He records my statement, I tell him about how I tried to get my insurance to cover it since I was driving and they wouldn't, and how I gave a statement to the other drivers insurance and how she is currently ghosting the situation (probably 'cause she knows she fucked up). He proceeds to look up Madison's policy and guess what?

I'm excluded on her insurance. Me, specifically. The co-owner. Her policy is permissive use, which means anyone else in the entire fucking world could have been driving, and Madison's insurance would've paid for it. And also that apparently we're married. We don't even have the same address. I do remember a couple months back her saying something like ""it's cheaper if we're married"" and I said that was fine. But being excluded? I would not have driven her car if I knew that.

So I talk to Madison. She claims she didn't know, and that  they must've done that to make it cheaper somehow without her knowledge when she was threatening to leave them. But I do remember us joking about the ""we're married"" part in the past.

I call my insurance again, saying that I'm excluded on her policy so they have to take care of it. They say because I'm excluded specifically there's nothing they can do either. Fuck!

2 weeks go by, all we know is we are waiting to see if the other driver has finally decided to answer her phone, and if it's been determined who's at fault. I call her adjuster, it's a voicemail saying she's out of the office another 2 days, I text the number and say I will call then. She texts me the morning she returns and says basically ""oh yeah it's been determined your at fault and we aren't fixing your friend's car."" I was fuming, I wanted to Karen out on her so hard. But I didn't. Why didn't anyone contact me as soon as a decision was made?

I told Madison, she said this really sucks but just so we're clear, she expects me to pay out of pocket for the damages since she ""wasn't the one driving, did nothing wrong"".

I decide to go to my insurance office with my mother to talk to someone in person. This guy tried his best to help me, we'll call him Dario. I explained everything that happened, from the collision, to being the co-owner, to being excluded, to being given the runaround by 3 different insurance companies. I asked if there was anyway to contest the decision of me being at fault. He said not really, unfortunately it's a he said-she said situation and since I didn't have a dash cam or anything it wouldn't go anywhere.

Dario felt bad that I co-signed for Madison, explaining he's seen so many young people trying to be a good friend and getting screwed over. He explained to me that it's so much more responsibility than just the car loan; if the car gets in an accident in the future, I'm just as liable as she is and if she gets sued and doesn't pay it/doesn't wanna pay it then they'll come after me.

That just reminded me of a friend who's still paying off 30k after his gf crashed his car in another vehicle. I started crying, because I don't know how much it's going to cost, me and my fiancé are both struggling to find work amidst the pandemic, 3 thousands dollars is all we have to pay rent/food/bills/etc while we're looking for work (which won't last long living in California), and it could be all gone in the blink of an eye. My mom offered to help me if I needed it.

So Dario says what he can do is sign me up for my own policy instead of sharing with my mom, and add Madison's car to my plan so both of our cars have 100% coverage if anything were to happen in the future so I'm protected. He can't put her on the policy rn because of the 2 points on her record, but I can give her ""permission"" to drive ""my"" vehicle if that makes sense. He suggested Madison drops her shitty insurance and we split the cost of this one, which would also make it cheaper for her monthly. He also confirmed she did in fact sign a paper stating that I'm excluded on hers.

That was an overwhelming 3 1/2 hours at my insurance office. I got home, didn't have the energy to tell Madison everything that was talked about so I asked my mom if she could just give her a call to let her know. That did not go over well.

Unfortunately my mom is really frustrated by the fact that Madison excluded me on her insurance which is why this whole mess started. So apparently she was kind of aggressive talking to Madison, telling her exactly that and how she needs to take some responsibility. Madison proceeds to blow up my phone with text upon text, saying how it was me who fucked up, I need to be an adult and take full responsibility, it's so fucked up that I'm making my mom pay for it (don't know where she got that from?), how ""mommy can't bail me out forever"", how she's not paying for anything and the blame will not be put on her, it was her insurances fault, etc.

I didn't respond at first because I couldn't talk to her right then, and I didn't want to with her being so fucking rude to me when I've been doing absolutely everything I can to take care of this, I texted her back saying if my mom told her everything I don't know why she'd be upset, I had to get insurance on her car to save myself from getting screwed in the future, and the upside is that splitting the cost means she can drop her shitty insurance and it'll be cheaper. Eventually she apologized. She wants to keep having her own insurance so I'm just gonna have to keep paying extra Incase something happens in the future.

Madison can't take legal action against her insurance because she signed the paper that excludes me, regardless if she read it or not she still signed it. I don't think she would have purposefully excluded me is the thing, so that's where I'm kind of tied up.

Madison works at an auto repair shop (internal repair, not external- so she can't get her car fixed there because it's only cosmetic damage), she just told me today her boss is talking to a company that salvages parts from vehicles, so I just started to see she's making somewhat of an effort to make it cost less for me.

It's a shitty situation, I just don't think that the responsibility should be 100% put on me, since we are in this together. I'm looking for advice on how I can discuss this with her without seeming like I'm attacking her and having her blow up at me again, but I would like a compromise. Or at the very least her admitting some fault too. I feel like I'm getting a bit taken advantage of. Should I just turn the other cheek, and live on with this uncomfortable feeling and eventually let it go? Or are my feelings justified?",18Aug2020,1
128,"Just to be clear, he is not abusive to me. But to my mom, psychologically and a while ago it was physical as well. He has the mentality of an actual 5 year old, never admits he does anything wrong, and has never apologized for anything. I have tried time and time again, to sit down and talk to him and explain why he did wrong in the past and why he should apologize etc, etc. But it just doesn't work, at this point I've pretty much accepted that no amount of conversation will get him to admit or realize anything. 

He was a dick to my mom again last night, can't stand him anymore, so I told him today that I am not going to speak to him until he apologizes for hitting my mom in the past &amp; for last night. I am prepared to go weeks/months, but I am just not sure if I am wasting my time doing this as I was reading that the silent treatment is ineffective.

For the longest time I've felt like we just let him get away with so much under the assumption that any action we take against him is futile. Police involvement is just not an option, no way of getting my mom on board with that, so I just feel like this is all I can do at this point. Any advice would be **seriously appreciated**.

TLDR: Have a 5 year old as a dad that seem incapable of change. Tried to reason with him to no avail, now giving him the silent treatment until he apologizes.",18Aug2020,1

I want to support everything they do entirely. I hate the words slut and whore, I really do. I don’t believe they should ever be used except in extreme scenarios (ex: you sleep with your best friends husband?

the stories are things of her body, her ass several times a day (bare), her boobs several times a day. clear pictures of them. and she complains about guys in her DMs saying sexual things to her and being vulgar but i’m like ..... you post that what do you expect?

am I being a misogynistic woman? is that crude for me to believe in that manner? if so, please give me tips and educate me if I am being shitty in any way, shape, or form. these are my views right now but if I should believe differently as a woman towards other women, please let me know.",18Aug2020,1

Shortly after I decided I didn’t want to keep living like I was. I wanted to be better, both for myself and this baby. I got myself off all the drugs and the alcohol. But now I have 6 months of back child support that’s 700 dollars a month and no car. I really want to fix my life but with my wages being garnished 65% I can barely pay for my food and rent.

So, after chatting for a bit, I took the initiative to ask her if she would need or want me to pick her up from work to send her home, my intention is just that, to meet her for a short while while on the way to send her home. But she said it's too fast, and she have her colleague to send her back home from work. I respects her decision politely and so we continued chatting.

Today, I asked her again if I could pick her up after she ends work, she said why am I mentioning this almost everyday, either giving her the impression that I am in a hurry to meet her, or pick her up from work, hence I explained to her it's not that I am in a hurry, it's just that I am asking out of gesture. And then, from here things took a turn for the ""better"" ( I hope ? ). Because she ask me this, do you want to pick me later around the afternoon, and send me to pick up some stuff which is quite a faraway place ? I told her sure, I don't mind although that place is about 30 minutes away from where we live. She immediately felt bad and was saying stuff like I think I'll pay you the petrol money for the trip, because she's afraid that I would think that she is just using me for this.

Now, here's my question, how do I know that if she is only using me and not really wanting to meet me and/or appreciate my gesture of actions that is meant for her ? Because I've been used before, but still, every girl is different, I'm debating on this whether or not to give her the benefit of doubt, advice ?",18Aug2020,1

142,"A friend keeps bringing up a war with China. He brings up events that he considers “To be part of the build up”. Telling me that we’ll be drafted and killed in one of the biggest wars known to man. 

It’s scaring me because there is a lot of truth to it. Watching the news, seeing it, and now it’s looking like it.


My father on the other hand (who’s a veteran) told me there’s no chance because of nuclear technology and that there’s really no need for soldiers anymore. If we did go to war, it would just be nukes.

Then another friend tells me that I’m better off joining a gang. Idk anymore.

My friend told me he wouldn’t mind getting 
drafted and that we should just accept our fates.

144,"alright so I’m in this strange predicament 

I’ll be starting university next month, and I kind of sort of want to “rebrand” myself since I didn’t like how I was in high school (a very timid, almost nonexistent, demure kid). And one thing I wanna change is how I’d be called. I don’t have an English name, so everyone I know calls me by my given native name, which I don’t exactly love. To me, it sounds ugly, and many people misspell and mispronounce it. 

[context: Where I come from and where I live (and grew up) in are two different countries]

And I have the liberty to make an English name for myself, but... 

1. I don’t know what name would be okay!! 
Nothing stands out or sticks to me. For a long while, I’ve been introducing myself as a different name to the many internet friends I’ve made to sort of test it out. But I don’t know, it doesn’t feel like me yet, but maybe I just have to force myself to connect with it and soon I’d get used to it. Or find another name that I like, but I have no clue.

2. I’m kinda really shy. It’s kind of embarrassing for me to make such a bold move, and my current friends might think it’s weird. And I’d have to change my name on my social media, and that might be weird. I know of a few people who did change the way they’d be called, but aaahh idk what if people judge me? And would I really have to change my name on my social media? What would the people who already know me think? 

3. My uni has this get-to-know-each-other-and-the-school thing some time this week. Which means I’d have to decide in a few days. Probably by tomorrow. And what a pressure. What if I choose a name and it seems cool now, but I just don’t feel it later on? It’s not like I can keep changing it. Once is probably already enough. And I’m panicking. 


* the name I’ve been testing out was “Ely”. It’s an odd spelling of the common “Ellie”, but I liked it since it has three letters like my original name. I really really really want to have an English name. But these reservations are putting me in panic mode.",18Aug2020,1
145,"I'm a 20yr old female living in a strict, conservative, immigrant muslim brown family. my folks have always been toxic to me since i can remember. when im out, im always afraid to go home, and i live in constant paranoia and fear when im at home. they did a lot of mental and emotional abuse to me to the point where i ended up unable to hold the pain in and had had a really bad mental breakdown in front of them. i got diagnosed with severe depression afterwards and have been trying to get better, but its hard to when i still live with the source of my depression. 

my folks have such extensive control over my life that i was forced to be dependent on them. they remind me daily and make me feel so indebted to them that anytime i choose to do something good for myself that doesn't align with their ideology and beliefs, i dont have the courage too because of the guilt ill have. for instance, all my friends who ive told my situation to all told me to move out, but i couldnt just up and leave like that because my folks have showed their disapproval before when it comes to me moving out (i.e. they only want me to move out when i get married). recently though, my folks and i had another big fight which unlocked the courage i needed to decide that it was finally time for me to move out of my toxic household. 

i didnt tell them yet (plan to have given them a month notice) i had given myself 6 months worth of time starting now, in august. im currently a full time college student, and my folks are paying for my tuition until my spring semester when i told them im paying for my own. my folks have my my savings, but they wont give it to me so i have to start from scratch. i wanted to get a full time job by this month and save every penny i make so that by 6 months, i have a good starting amount to support myself with. however, in turn of events, my folks and i got into another argument and they threatened to kick me out of the house by the end of august. im unemployed right now and have no security in terms of being able to support myself by the end of this month. 

i need all of your help :( truly. im still going to get a job by this month but its not going to be enough for me to not end up on the streets. im scared of whats going to happen to me in the future and i have no support system i can lean on. i would greatly appreciate any donations. if everyone who saw this post donated a single dollar, it really would help me.

I have a special needs child as well so we tend to have alot of the same social circle.

150,"I met him three days ago. We hit it off extremely well, and I felt like we had a great bond. We'd talked all day practically non stop for two days using snapchat - sending texts, videos and pictures, voice messages, and voice calling (no nudes, and nothing super sexual). 

Yesterday, he told me he had a headache since he woke up. That headache lasted all day. In the early night he told me he started coughing up blood and was feeling faint. 

He then told me he had an accident in taekwondo (I don't know when) and had a serious brain injury. Apparently the doctors told him he would probably live max to 25, then in June, got tests done and the doctors took back that statement and said he'd be fine. I really don't know anything else about his medical history other than he said he has epilepsy but I don't know what kind.

Well about thirty minutes goes by since he told me he was coughing up blood, and he stops responding to my texts. Not opening them. I have no signs that he has been active at all. I've called and texted numerous times since then (it's approaching 24 hours) and it's all been left on delivered.


So I know what you're thinking, maybe he ghosted me in a fucked up way? 
I don't believe that. He seemed absolutely so caring since the beginning. He pulled a ""prank"" on me where he left me on read for like an hour as I kept sending stuff. I told him the day before that I had GAD. When I admitted that the ""prank"" have me anxiety he apologised profusely and said he wouldn't do it again. I find it hard to believe that even if he were to ghost me, he'd just leave and not make up a story that would instill so much worry in me.

Am I silly for worrying so much about him? Do you think he ghosted me? I have no other way to contact him or anyone that would know him. Is there anything I can do?",18Aug2020,1

He said he’d stop being friends with these toxic people he knows that take advantage of him and bully him, and that’d he’d also stop watching their live stream too:
*He would continue being their friend, and of course he’d use the “It’s real this time” lie. He also says he’s not obsessed with them, yet watches their live stream religiously, that person who live streams happens to be my ex-girlfriend too (Who I haven’t even spoken to since early 2014).*

154,"First off, our family is not impoverished or anything. We are in the upper-middle class and my dad has a stable job.

I need a new desk for the upcoming school year. I literally have no desk space due to the size of my desk and the space my monitor and keyboard take up. 

Secondly, I understand that there are bills to pay. Living in a upper middle class house needs a high paying job to pay mortgage, utilities, groceries, etc.

My dad also came from a poor household. So I can understand why he wants to save as much money as possible. Even his wanted career path was squashed because of the lack of funds to study in the field he wanted. 

But this isn't about the desk, all day he browses Facebook Marketplace for good deals, and in his mindset, if its a good deal he will always consider buying the item, even if its not necessary at all. When I point him out on this multiple times, He gets angry and frustrated and retaliates by talking about my grades and how hes right. Sometimes I even think that he knows that its wrong but hes too stubborn to admit it. Every aspect of his life is seemingly about money. To the point where he doesn't take proper care of himself, Physically and mentally.

I want to tell him that you can always make more money, but you can't make anyone happy if thats all you think about. But what do I have a say in this? I'm just a student and know nothing about bills and work. If i do say something, He'll get pissy and complain about my grades and how I just sit around and do nothing, and how he does all this work and puts food on the table. But that's not true. I am grateful for what I have, but He always is quick to assume the worst out of the situation and more unfortunately, the worst out of people. He is always working in his office, so he doesn't see me do work, therefore if he didn't see me I didn't do anything, right? I do my share of work. I don't like this cycle, I feel it splitting the whole family apart. Because of money. 

And does get me wrong, he loves his family dearly, but often times his vision of making money gets in the way of everyones *including* him's vision of being happy. 

I play 2 instruments. I want to play more. He would be glad to if it didn't cost too much, but he says it's because of my grades that he won't get me them.

159,"(I apologize for any grammatical/spelling/formatting errors, I'm writing this late at night and on mobile).

Background: F19, diagnosed with bipolar disorder, multiple anxiety disorders, and dermatillomania (compulsive skin picking).

Okay, so, I have fucking awful self-esteem half of time. Because of my bipolar disorder, sometimes it's better and sometimes it's awful, but it is a lingering issue that hasn't gone away, even on my best days. I've got no reason to have low self-esteem. I have a boyfriend of almost 4 years who only ever says I'm cute/pretty/beautiful/etc. But it's ever prevalent regardless.

I have dermatillomania, which is an OCD-related illness where I get compulsive urges to pick at skin blemishes. I feel an uncontrollable urge to pick at every scab I get and to pop every pimple I get. As a result, I'm covered in these blatant and awful looking round white scars and, oftentimes, open wounds as well. These scars make me feel terrible. They're so awful looking, to the point where I'm desperate to get scar reduction treatment/surgery but can't afford it.

It's not just that though. I have trouble looking in the mirror. I dont like my face. I'm insecure about my chest size and my hair. I'm not even secure in my interests (although it's not as bad as it once was), and fashion sense. And on my worst days I think I'm hideous all over, inside and out.

I've had low self-esteem for years at this point. My therapist has tried walking me through my low self-esteem but it's only worked a little bit. I can't find any way to reliably work towards fixing my self-esteem. I only ever get ""noooo your so pretty"" (which doesn't help at all in the long run), or other advice that doesnt really correct my thinking for long. And this is all complicated by the fact that I have ever changing moods that drastically effect how I see myself a lot of the time, even though I can still feel terrible even when I'm hypomanic.

My low self-esteem I feel is inhibiting a lot of my life. It's preventing me from branching out into new things or talking with new people. It makes my mood worse. And it hasn't happened yet, but I know that if I don't do something about it, I could hurt my relationship with my boyfriend.

I'm stuck. I don't want to hate myself but I feel like it's the only option I have.

I need help on how to reliably correct my self-esteem and stop it from controlling my life and making me feel miserable. I need something more than just empty compliments or vague advice. I need a way to help me start changing my thinking.

Any sort of advice is appreciated.",18Aug2020,1

Growing up my dad was an alcoholic he wasn't a bad dad he just didn't have much of an outlet but he cared about me a lot so because we lived in a small town with literally nothing to do he bought me an Xbox which I used to have fun on but his alcoholism got worse, he got a girlfriend, and he got somewhat better but the girlfriend fueled his alcoholism when they both got drunk all they did was yell at each other and the thing is they got drunk a lot so every week or so I'd have to hear them bicker the sad thing is Everytime I went home I thought are they gonna be hanging over or still drunk?

166,"I've had pretty bad luck with the neighbors that live across from us. When we first moved in another family lived there and they constantly parked in our spot and their many kids would run up the stairs screaming which made my pets run and hide. We delt with it, after all that's kinda just apartment living. But then they moved out and the current tenants moved in.

I wasn't even sure anyone lived there but I got my confirmation as I opened my door to them screaming and yelling right outside our door fighting over a baby and a phone. The fighting was constant. Most of the times when we'd give in and call security or the police they would tell us they already got however many calls before and already had someone on their way. I'd record him laying his hands on her from our bedroom window when he'd pull her out of the car but as soon as cops showed up she would just deny it all. 

I think the guy was forced to leave or got arrested no idea. But now I guess cause he's gone the lady just puts her kids dirty diapers right outside the shared pathway. It stinks. It attracts flies. She's left them out there to rot for more than a week before. The noise was one thing but this is just disgusting to me. I think to myself surely if I complain my apartment would put a stop to it right? 

I feel like I'm living in crazyville over here cause I'll send them a picture of a dirty diaper outside and they respond with ""we called and talked to her and she says she didn't do it."" What about the picture? I have sent them at least 6 different pictures of it. If it's not her then should they not be wanting to know who's leaving dirty diapers outside our apartments? I complained so many times that one morning the manager came over and knocked on my door and there happened to be a diaper outside! He picked it up and threw it away himself but still came unannounced to my apartment during a pandemic simply because he wanted to talk ""face to face"".


I asked him what proof he needed beyond photograph evidence and he simply said that what we can do is have a meeting with her so we can figure out what our problem was with one another. I replied that I didn't know her and I didn't want to. I told him I wasn't interested in having a meeting during a pandemic when the resolution of the problem doesn't require anyone to meet face to face.

I never did get a reply. Is it really normal for someone to leave diapers outside like this? I feel like our apartment manager is treating me like I'm complaining about nothing but I find it so disgusting.

This situation happened because i showed her my computer stand from amazon i got recently and said, “you should write a review on this,  it almost broke my computer because i lifted it a little and it flipped over” and she told me “well you should have done a better job shopping” so i said “what!?!? its not my fault!  its literally the way its designed!” because i was offended that she tried to just say it was my fault.  but she stood to her statement that it was my fault, so i told her, “see what i mean, thats the stuff you do,  you didnt have to say it was my fault u just dont care that you are being offensive” (she does this all the time and i will always call her out on it because im so fed up and done with her shit and all these one sided battles where shes always right)(and i know that i could just respect her and hope it comes back well no, ive took that approach and the way i felt was like it was to the point of me being her “bitch” already.  and thats how she started treating me.  so that approach didnt work, so now im standing my ground and always backing myself up with facts but when i say the facts it flys right over her head) and then she said “i dont care” so i walked upstairs for a second, walked back down, and obviously this took some nerve for me to say but its true, i said “thats why i dont respect you” and she got so pissed off she tried to march to my room stomping up the stairs all crazy but i just locked my door on her and she didnt do anything.  but then my dad came to my room to talk to me and he told me i shouldnt have grumbled to her abt the computer stand because sometimes people dont wanna hear it so i was totally understanding im telling him “yeah your right i shouldnt have done that” and the only other thing he told me was “just relax, dont let it ruin ur day”  so that made me feel much better, but as he was telling me that last part, my mom yells at him “YOU FUCKING TALKING TO HIM?” and then comes upstairs and starts bitching at my dad abt how he doesnt do anything, which is so fucking unreal because my mom doesnt have a job so literally the only money we get is from my dad who works 55+ hours a week.  and she still tells him every day “you dont do shit around here!”  um without him wed be fucking homeless!! how can she have so much audacity.  thats not even the right word.  i forgot to mention im 17 btw.  and my siblings are my 15 year old sis and my 10 year old bro.  and my dad has the exact same situation with my mom.  she bitches at him all day for whatever reason she can find and then she holds a grudge forever so if he does something the next month then whatever happened in the past gets brought up too.  my mom makes me so sick with her behavior,  i have a 600 square feet house with only 1 bathroom 1 kitchen and 2 bedrooms and 1 living room, so what my parents did was builts 2 more room where the living room was so that my brother and sister could have their own room.  but now we have no living room.  just a hallway from the front to back yard.  my house was already the 3rd smallest house in my area, and now its even smaller cuz of that.  so i have to be totally cluttered in here with my family, so its hard for me to avoid my mom, its really almost not possible, like im hunrgy rn and shes downstairs so yeah i just cant go down there.  or she WILL bitch at me and call me names.  she calls me doodooboy, hopeless, narcasist, loser,  faggot, stupid, dumb, and many more names i just cant think of, and each of those names make me feel a different way and i dont think she knows how hurtful she is.  i have changed a lot as a person over the years..  i was an innocent kid in middle school but i started smoking weed in 9th grade and became addicted and have been since then.  and i developed anger issues.  i used to be a woosey in middle school, people would bully me, but in 10th grade i grew bigger and i became the bully and then no one picked on me anymore, im probably one of the scariest guys in my school, people really show me a lot of respect when they talk to me.  but not my mom lol.  she will tell me something like “you such a fucking losah sitting there haha look at u u fucking losah.  u cannot do nothin u so fckn hopeless.  u weak u.  u weak minded. hahaha, u and ur dad are exactly the same haha bunch of fuckin losahs.”(that is losers in hawaii slang) she really says shit like that and i have so much hatred towards her atm.  she seems to not give a fuck how much shit she does to my to make me hate her more and more. i hate her so much i would KILL her i didnt feel sane.  i have so much bent up anger within my that i am so ready to release in the form of killing and destruction.",18Aug2020,1

170,"One of my only posts on Reddit. I know that I'm a little young, I don't know if I can say my age on here but I have a measly $1,000 in my bank account. Dad says I should save it or something. I don't know what I'm going to save it for because I can pay for college so I guess he means after college, but I want to get a good computer. A budget gaming laptop. I did a whole day of research, like I learned computer stuff for it, and came across the Acer Nitro 5 10th gen Intel, and it sells for about $700 depending the place. I really like the computer so I decided to send an email to my dad (He's scary and I also like emails because of links to show him) with all my reasons to get it such as: I can finally have a good computer, It will not be handed down slow old or broken like the surface pro 4 I have right now, I will be able to play games on it, such and such. Then they said no gaming computer so I wrote a whole other email explaining that I will also use it for work, and how good it will be to have because I actually will work with it. They said no again. Today's like the third day of this and now I'm writing another email explaining that I THINK I should be able to spend my own money because I literally never ever got to. I know that I might be spoiled for wanting to use 70% of my savings on a computer but if I get it then I can do work with it and make money. I feel like they aren't supporting me fully but that's fine. I also feel like they are somewhat strict, and I know some parents can be way worse but they since I have a brother that's 3 years older then me, I think they think that I can do the stuff that he does, so I'm being assigned 70 hours of work on my summer break from school. I'm going to 8th grade. Mostly from my dad all the time. They also say that if I want to get this computer, I need to get all a+, exercise, make friends, and do stuff in real life. I already get grades that are above the average in my school right now and in the past. I exercise. I have friends and talk to them daily, and I'm not going to in real life socialize with them during -----, I'm sorry, and they want me to have a good ""work skill"". That's why I want this computer. So I can actually do work. Efficiently and easy. I came here for help on writing the email today about how I should tell them that I should be able to get the computer and not wait because I already have done what they want/met their requirements. Any ideas? Sorry if I sounded like I was complaining.",18Aug2020,1
171,"So my sister and I are both pregnant, about a month apart.  She and I talked a little over a month ago about whether we each wanted a shower, and my feeling was it's a bad idea to throw parties during a pandemic, call me crazy.  Anyway, this is my second child and her forth, so we really don't need to be having showers anyway.  I offered to organize a virtual ""sip and see"" for her after the baby comes, which she declined, saying that she didn't want to have anything because of the same reasons I already mentioned (""It's tacky to have a shower for your 4th kid"" - her words verbatim).

Smash cut to now, and I find out she's agreed to have a friend throw her an in-person sip and see after her baby comes in November.  This concerns me further, because her pregnancy is high-risk and there have been some complications with the baby (possible heart defect and small gestational size due to an issue with her placenta).  Is she really considering having a party that involves passing a medically fragile baby around for a bunch of people to hold?  During a pandemic?  Quick aside, her friends have posted a lot of pictures on social media without masks/no social distancing, etc.  This had a lot to do with my apprehension to throw her something in-person, socially-distant/outdoors.

So clearly she did want me to throw her a shower and was just being polite by declining my offer to do something virtually.  Since then, another one of her friends and her mother-in-law have also reached out about throwing in-person showers for her, and I've politely explained that I offered to throw her something virtual and she declined my offer, and that the virtual shower was where my personal comfort level was, pandemic-wise, but ""feel free to plan whatever you'd like"".  Trying to stick to my principles while not insulting them, all while knowing that throwing parties right now is idiotic, has been a special exercise in word acrobatics.

Honestly, I feel like I don't want to prevent her from doing what she wants, but it makes me feel all wrong for so many reasons.  Like, why are people wanting to throw parties during a pandemic?  I feel like I'm being gaslit by a bunch of people who have decided to just ignore the severity of this thing.  And I'm just left here looking like a dick who's refusing to throw a shower for her sister...

I should also mention, I reached out to my sister calmly and assertively, asking her what she truly wants, ""because a lot of people seem to want to throw you a shower, and you told me you didn't want one, so I just want to be sure that's accurate.""  And now she's mad at me..?  Not picking up when I call, etc.  I can't win.  Am I the one who's unreasonable here?  Please talk me off my ledge.",18Aug2020,1
172,"For some background, I (F17) have been seeing this guy for a few weeks without telling my family. I grew up in a very conservative catholic household so dating is a very serious thing for them.

 I, being an idiot, made the mistake of trying to sneak out at night so I could go on a walk in the park with my date, and my older sister (F18) found out. She called my phone a couple of times (very angry I might add) and told me to come home or she would tell my parents. After having a talk with her she said "" If you don't tell our parents you're seeing someone, I'll tell them"". So I told them.

We had a loooong talk about relationships and such, how I am still pretty young to be in a relationship, that he and I can only remain friends, that there will be lots of rules when I got out, etc. I don't blame them, they do it because they love me and want the best for me. 

Unfortunately I tend to rebel a lot against them (yes I know it's stupid but I can't help it) and I obviously was not going to stick to their rules. I didn't wanted me seeing this guy being such a big deal due to the fact we have only been seeing eachother for some weeks. Now, days after I told my family, they look at me with disappointment; everywhere I go I feel the judgment in their eyes. They look at me as if I was a whore.

Today I went on a date with him told my parents I was going to the mall. We actually went to his place to cuddle and watch some movies for a bit and then got shawarma to eat before he dropped me off at the mall. For some reason the day of my date my mom thought it would be a GREAT idea to go to that mall and buy some clothes for my little sister. She called me to ask me where I was and I panicked so I told her I went outside the mall with him to get lunch (in a way it's kinda true). 

One of my parent's rules when going out was that I could only stay in one place. If I wanted to go somewhere else I needed to call them and ask for permission. So of course my mom got angry at me for disobeying her (which is fine since she has all the right to) and now I'm grounded for around 1 or 2 weeks. 


It's mostly my fault for not listening to her and doing what she told me not to do. She has told me from a very young age to be docile and obedient, to alway be prudent and keep things to myself when it comes to them. Yet here I am being the opposite. 

I still can't stand how they treat me every since I told them I'm seeing someone, for some reason it makes me feel extremely guilty. I just want to be able to go on dates with him wherever I want but since I still live with my parents I have to listen to all what they say. What should I do now that I'm grounded? Should I cut off contact with this guy? Or should I not listen to what my parents say? Am I really that young to date?",18Aug2020,1
173,"Hello, 
I don't really know where to go for this and I really hope to change my situation but I don't know how. To keep in short, when I was graduating high school me and my parents came to an agreement that they would offer me monthly allowance ($150) and pay for schooling if I agreed to go to community/ cheap state college. I agreed, at the time our relationship was much better than it is now. I struggle with extreme social anxiety and depression. I definately think the pressure from my parents had a lot to do with it. My parents are very manipulative and treat me like a child. They won't let me leave anywhere without telling them, and I can't say NO to doing something not related to chores. For example, this past Sunday they have made it a habit to go hiking. However, it gets hot and all my parents do is argue so I don't like being around them honestly. That morning, my mother asked if I wanted to go, I said no. Later, she's yelling to says come on when I already said no????? This is just one example of many, if I say NO to something, she will pretend I said nothing at all or guilt trip me such as ""not everyone can do what they want."". Later on, My mother was complaining that the trail wasn't ""interesting enough"" in 98 degree weather and I asked her to stop complaining as it was her idea in the first place. Then my father snaps at me acting as if I just said something vile. Because of this, they lecture me all the time of how I'm always hostile or angry when they don't realize that they make me so. They never give me emotional support or always invalidate how I am feeling. When I say something such as not doing well on a exam or something, they lecture me about my failure rather than something as simple as ""try to do better next time."". I haven't had friends over in years, I can't tell them about relationships. I moved out due to this about a year and a half ago, and my mother still called me every single day. I told her off and said I can't have Hours long conversations with you every day and to stop calling. My roomate was stealing some of my tips so I chose to go back home, but I still regret every single moment. I had a really bad breakdown last Sunday which lead to self harm. I don't know what to do. I'm very close to graduating I'm about 8 months but not a single day goes by where I wish I was dead. Is there any way to set boundaries?",18Aug2020,1

175,"If you’ve ever been truly, completely in love with someone and managed to get over them - I need your help. In 2017 I met a man that I fell HARD for. I was positive that I would marry him and I gave him my whole heart. Our relationship had its issues but overall I feel like it was pretty healthy. Towards the end what tore us apart was religion (he’s a Christian and I’m not religious) and his family pressuring him to live differently than he was at the time. We began arguing about possible future scenarios more than anything else and after a year together ended things. I wasn’t ready to give up but he was and said he couldn’t see us together anymore but still loved me. I was completely devastated and ended up getting into a new relationship just so I wouldn’t be alone and have to deal with the heartache (terrible of me, I know - although I’m not in that relationship anymore). When he found out he blocked me on all social media (I’m still blocked) and we never spoke again. 

The problem is that here I am two full years after our breakup STILL not over him. I’ve tried therapy, doing things for myself, looking up advice, etc. and nothing will do it.

176,"I work as a receptionist for a small office. I have been working there for almost two years. There is one other receptionist besides me. I work twice a week and the other person, three.

At the beginning of August, I took the two days off because I had to attend personal matters. I let my manager know two weeks in advance. They said okay and I took my two weeks off.

For the last week of August, my mom and I are planning a small road trip in the woods. It was hard to get her vacation hours and I was waiting until everything got sorted to tell my manager. It is 2 days less than two weeks in advance, but I told them when I was sure. I let them know today, and they said they cannot cover for me because they are going somewhere so it looks like it will be hard, they said. Then they added, “While we’re at it, we have done a lot for you this year and I hope you understand that. Next time if you need a day off, let us know in a month advance.”

So couple things here. I was willing to cover for my other coworker or try to talk to them about some way I can make it up here. I knew it was gonna be hard to ask which was why I was already nervous but it was just an immediate no from the get go. And when she says “we have done a lot for you” that is referring to how for the month July, I only worked once a week due to me having summer sessions AND business was slow from March-June so it was an agreement anyways. It just sucks that this bites me in the a** because I can’t really cancel the road trip and she SUDDENLY drops the whole “let us know one months in advance”???? I understand their position as a small business but it’s not like I ever called in sick or had a day off on last minute notice? Every time I have something come up, I let them know in 2 weeks advance like how it usually is.

I also have another intern position where I go on the days I don’t work as a receptionist. It is close to what I want to pursue and they offered me a paid position so maybe I should just quit this receptionist job? I was thinking about it but I never want to end on bad terms with anyone esp if it’s not necessary. I was thinking about telling them at the beginning of September and ending it at the end but now I don’t know. Please let me know what you guys think about this situation?

180,"My Nmom allowed her friends to rape me when I was 5. She locked the room so I couldn’t escape.

I’m less independent than most 20 year olds and it’s understandable why. My mother most likely has Munchausens by proxy, I was in special education as a child and not allowed to learn to take care of myself. I learned it from Sesame Street and from other children and then they coerced me into suicide when I was 9 and pulled out of SpEd. I gained more independence until I was 15 and developed schizophrenia (possibly from meds they forced me to take in middle school), and believed that adulthood and “the real world” was sinful and my mother encouraged it. I found out it was schizophrenia at 18 and my mother tried to stop me from leaving by trying to convince me to gouge my eyes out when I was trying to stab myself with a knife during a severe psychotic break (which she triggered by repeatedly telling me that I had doomed the world by “losing faith”), I thankfully got scared and threw the knife away. I didn’t get into any college I applied to so I enrolled in community college and recently finished with two associates degrees and was accepted into all 5 schools I applied to. I am leaving in January as my first semester is online. So please understand this before you call me a “spoiled rich kid” or “basement dweller” or w/e.

They allowed me to live with them as an adult and don’t know that I will go NC after graduation. I am not allowed to seek psychological help and was required to go to cult meetings to not be kicked out. The cult meetings are suspended for COVID but I have another problem. My mother got a dog and I pet him when my mother or brother are holding him but avoid him otherwise because he jumps on me, licks me etc which is triggering as a rape victim. Last week I had a panic attack because he bit and licked my inner thigh and my mom ordered my brother not to stop him. Today I agreed to pet the dog. He licked and bit my hand and I moved away, Nmom physically grabbed my wrist and stopped me from leaving which triggered a panic attack. Because of this my Nmom has refused to allow me to go downstairs when the dog is awake. GCbro has also refused to speak to me and I am just greyrocking them all. I can just keep food in my room during the morning and eat it at the right mealtimes. This situation is fine with me but I’m scared it will escalate into getting kicked out of the house before January or losing my job with our family business or both.

I have 4k in student debt and 3k in savings, my only source of income is working in our family business 7 hours a week though I am looking for a second job and have interviews scheduled. I’m also confident that I can get tutoring and babysitting jobs now that the school year has started. I’m unsure how to handle this situation but my plan is to move all my money to an account that they can’t access and then just keep the peace until January when I can go VLC/NC.",18Aug2020,1
181,"    (On mobile) Some back story, my (17m) sister (15f) has been in/out of baker act since January but now she has stabilized. Stepdad (43) is very understanding of her condition but still has had trouble adjusting to our new life with her (certain things locked away, etc) my sister is kind of a brat and can’t take no for an answer as she was a bit spoiled when she was young. Now to the issue.
    So today while I was at work, my mom found out she has to back to work tomorrow. Now tomorrow my sisters “bf” was supposed to come over and my mom was fine w it, but since she’s gonna be gone she told sis to ask SD. He said no because of covid, also he just didn’t want anyone in the house. My sister got pissy and went to her room from what I heard.
    Now tonight I was in my room playing xbox and heard screaming in the kitchen. My sister went again to ask if he can come over and my SD said no is no. She got very disrespectful to him and my mom, saying he isn’t her real father, saying to my mom she really married this guy etc. SD then replied, “you should have stayed in the hospital”. My stepdad is an awesome guy imo, but he went over the line here. I went to the kitchen and tried to break it up. I did yell at him to back off because my sister is still unstable mentally and he knows that, he is the adult and shouldn’t scream back.  My mom is very upset, sister is upset, he’s upset, im upset.
    I apologized for screaming at him but he knows that I will never let anyone speak to her that way, but I know my sister was wrong to disrespect our parents. My mom is questioning their marriage now and I would hate to see him go. He’s been the best SD ever for about 6 years and he provides for us and is always tried to take us as his own children. I kind of don’t know how to feel about everything. Everyone is wrong but my sis and SD have too much pride and neither will apologize. Mom is mad at SD for speaking to sis like that, but sd says she shouldn’t disrespect them that way.

A little backstory: We started talking in game but that was a temporary server and I at the time I didn't have an account on the main server so he asked me if we could talk on discord and I gave mine to him. Meanwhile I've created an account on the server and we've talking and playing since back then.

The thing is: he talks to me every single day.
I like him, he is nice, he helps me a lot in the game (it makes me feel even kinda guilty because he helps me with hard equips to get, and expensive stuff) but I don't really want to be talking to him everyday at every moment.

This is a common problem of mine, people want to talk all day everyday nowadays and I'm a person who really likes to be home, who don't hang out much, so to those people I seem ""always available"" and actually I am because I'm not ever that busy but still I don't like to be constantly talking to people 24/7 non-stop.

Since the quarantine finally allowed me to sit down and try out makeup, I've been playing around with some. I'm stuck at home so the only people I have to ask ""how does it look"" is my parents. My parents started to get concerned with me since they were worried I do not have confidence anymore... I'm not sure how to explain it to them, it's not that I dont like how I look its just that sometimes I wanna look snatched? 
Lowkey it's more I'm a bruh girl 90% of the time but sometimes I just wanna feel girly
How do I tell them I'm okay? And if you have any makeup tips/ reccomendation feel free to lmk too lol",18Aug2020,1

191,"Basically I’m very paranoid when it comes to sex or anything sexual. I have a deep fear of getting pregnant. I still live with my parents and don’t feel comfortable asking about birth control but I do use condoms. 
Basically me and my boyfriend had sex the other day. He used a condom and didn’t cum. We took it off and I have him a hand and blow job, which he came to.

We made out after and he performed oral sex on me. The penetration was protected and he didn’t cum so I’m not worried about that. I am worried about there possibly being sperm in my mouth, which transferred to his through making out, which then got in my vagina from oral. Is this even possible? I rinsed my mouth out with water after I swallowed but I’m not sure if that would have done anything. My period is supposed to come in 14 days so I can’t tell if it’s missed or not yet.

 “so u don't pay child support for like over 2 years and then now u say u don't have enough money when you've just been spending it on yourself and living luxuriously doing things like flying to l.a? you should have been paying us ages ago, an amount that would be way more than what i'm asking from you now. wow. and then you try to invite me to go somewhere with u like how dumb do you think i am? i know you're probably gonna kidnap me anyways. if i had a dad who cared about his wife and children maybe my life wouldn't be so bad. i wish i wasn't born to someone like you.“

194,"So I recently started a job at a restaurant as a hostess, and tbh, it’s the best job I have ever had. I recently finished training and it’s such an awesome feeling to make money again (I’m almost an adult so I still sometimes need to borrow money from my parents). 

I told a few friends and one of them (I’ll call her J) reached out to me and asked me about helping her with an interview at the same restaurant for the same job. I helped J and did a mock interview with her. She thanked me but she told me the reason why she was looking for a job: her parents were going to kick her out of the house.

Here’s a little background on J: her and I have a bumpy friendship, but it’s a friendship nonetheless. The only thing that makes me mad is that she either exaggerated the truth or straight up lies about things. Most of the time I’m not involved until she tells me, but this was different. It was also the last straw for me.

On Friday, I worked from 5 p.m. to close, while J was there since 9:30 a.m and worked a double. She was still training, but the trainer didn’t show up and J was all by herself. Unfortunately, there was a really bad rush from 11-3, with a “full house” (due to COVID, we can only have 50% capacity). Luckily, J was almost finished with her training, so she did a really good job and made a lot of tips (which was extraordinary because hostesses don’t usually make that much in tips). She kept on telling me this, and I kept on saying I was super proud. 

Here’s where the story gets fishy: J said all of this, but then said she never got a break. If you work a double, you would get a break. One manager (two were on duty,  B and the other W) B told J that she would most likely be out around 7. Around 5:30, we got a rush and we reached a wait. Around 6, J was complaining about how she didn’t get a break and would have to work 10 hours (a regular double) and her feet were starting to hurt. During this time, I just listened and tried my best to keep being motivated to do my job. As we were bussing tables, J wanted to do cups instead of plates so she could see the manager and try to get his attention indirectly. I thought it was not a great idea because it was a rush and I knew she was going to be kept longer. Around 7, she was starting to become impatient. Sure enough, she asked our other manager, W, when she could clock out. W told her that he didn’t have time to clock her out and needed to stay longer. J told me she would be crying if she needed me. I got frustrated, but I moved on. It sucked she left me all alone, but I knew what I was doing. 10 min later, J comes back. At this point, it was around 8 and J kept on complaining that she worked for “almost 10 1/2 f****** hours without a break. I almost blew up at her, but I kept my cool. Anything I said didn’t matter bc she would complain about it some more. I asked if she worked the next day and she said “yes!! Till close!!” angrily. Guess who also worked the next day? Yours truly.


She was finally allowed to go @8:30. I was cut about 9:45 and was told I did a really good job and got discounted meal that I should have paid full price for. That steak was very good. 

The next day, I went in at 9:30 and I thought I would be out by 4. Everything was going fine and I was having a good time. All of a sudden, W called me over and sure enough, J called and said she had “food poisoning.” I did not buy this one bit because we shared a meal together a few nights prior, and I felt fine. Either she lied, or she ate something else. Granted I knew she had a bad day and I like working, but at least come up with a better excuse. I took her shift and ended up working a double.

Later I talked to B and vented to him about the whole thing. HE PROCEEDED TO TELL ME THAT HE OFFERED J A BREAK AND SHE SAID NO!!!!! Words couldn’t explain how angry I was about this. It’s one thing to complain, but it’s another thing to lie and make management look bad. 

I finally clocked out around 10:15 p.m., and apart from about a half hour, which I happily accepted, I worked around 12 hours and 15 minutes, and I’m pretty sure that’s longer than 11 hours.

Tomorrow I work with J and I don’t want to act fake, but I don’t want to cause a mess. What should I do?

Tl;dr: I basically worked with a coworker who complained and lied about working too long without a break. The next day I had to work longer than she did the day before bc she came up with another lie. I want to confront her without making a scene.",18Aug2020,1

199,"my mom disrespects everyone in my house, me who is 17 years old, my dad, my 10 year old brother, and 15 year old sister.  but me and my dad are at the top of that list.  she is just super rude to us, if me or my dad says something like “i had a long day today” she will reply with something like “why u gotta tell me”.  Yet at other times she will be this loving person.  and when she is this loving person, she will totally play victim its weird.  she makes like we bully her, when i can tell you for a fact that no one would ever even have that chance to “bully” my her because she would snap on any of us in this house.  im really baffled.  she pretty much bullies everyone in the house with her words, calling us names, making everyone do the stuff around the house exactly when she wants it done, and shes just always yelling at us.  but then what thats jot happening, she tells us, “you guys are so mean to me” UM WHAT THE FUCK!  so i ask her “what? when are we ever mean to you” and then she calls us non appreciative for the stuff she does.  first of all she dont really do to much.  She is always talking about her work load.  but she doesnt even have a job.  all the money in my house comes from my dad who works construction all day.  all my mom has to do is take care of the house!! my small 600 square feet house.  i mean it cant be that hard to take care of a house right?  i mean the way i see it is that my dads job being an actual physical job would be way harder than just taking care of the house!!  yet my mom bitches at my dad and tells him he “doesnt do shit”.  which is unreal.  cuz he does do shit, he literally pays for everything we can see in our house lmao.  so with all of this, im usually thinking something like this, “my mom doesnt even have to do barely nothing around here, she doesnt even have a job, she dont have to work, my sister does the dishes, all the has to do is keep the house clean which i already do, and she goes shopping.  thats it, she just gotta go shopping and keep the house clean.  dont other people have to do that AND their job!?!? she doesnt have a job!! isnt the stuff she has to do like basically nothing?  and then she has the nerve to tell my dad ANYTHING.  with the way her life is, i dont think she should be grumbling about ANYTHING or at least mot grumbling to my dad!! my dad spends his whole day at work, comes home at 6 and goes to sleep at 8 EVERY DAY.  AND SHE WILL BE BITCHING AT HIM FROM 6-8  ON MOST DAYS.  I HAVE NO RESPECT FOR MY MOM,  BUT I HAVE MASSIVE RESPECT FOR MY FATHER.  i dont know how he puts up with her shit and idk why he doesnt stand his ground.  he always just lets her go until shes done.  i feel so bad for my dad i love him so much and he actually had very bad mental problems from his childhood where his sister killed herself when he was 17 and my dad would be abused and he was on anti depressants for a long time but hes off it now and has been doing so good but now my mom is always in his face.  always calling him names like loser and stuff.  is my mom just a horrible person?  i think she is.  she calls black people niggers all the time shes super racist i tell her dont say that by me shes just like why its true and she says it again.  i hate her so much for so many reasons but as soon as i stop typing this, i forgive her and feel bad and i just want to make her happy.  and then i figure that with the whole situation i will just find it within myself to change this and make it better.  but the truth is that i wish o wouldnt always forgive her, i wish i was able to never forgive her and i was able to harbor all these feelings so that she wouldnt be able to get me with her “traps”.  the way i felt abt all this 2 years ago was “im walking, but i dont know where im going” and i made a song about it and till this day that quote holds to be true.  im walking and i dont know where im going.  im moving through life, but without any help or words from anyone else or anything like that, i just dont know where im going or where im at. and i wish i did.",18Aug2020,1

214,"
I (F34) have been friends with this woman (let’s call her Amy) for over a decade. We met when I first moved to the city and she became a staple in my life. She was witty and sarcastic and had that sense of righteous anger many women in their early 20s have. She has been there for me many times but there have also been some times I have felt very cast aside by her.

These are the things I just can move past:

-About 5 years ago I was in the middle of testifying in a very public court case against a serial rapist/ stalker. I was having massive panic attacks daily and sleep paralysis episodes where I’d hallucinate that my rapist was standing over my bed. She was in grad school at the time and I told her I knew she was busy but that I was going through one of the hardest periods of my life (and was suicidal), and I could really use an ear. She just kept telling me she was “too busy” and finally after 3 months made time for me to come over for a few hours.

-A few years after the above in incident I called her and told her I needed a friend to talk to. I had just uncovered repressed memories of being sexually abused and nearly drown by my mother in a bathtub. She listened to me talk for about 15 min and then during a short lull she said “k, can we talk about me now?” I was so stunned I said yes and regretted it instantly because I was definitely it done but also so hurt I felt like maybe I had some something wrong.

-Two years ago I booked two of the biggest gigs of my performance life (shows with audiences of a few thousand people). Things had finally started to turn around for me so I was really excited to tell her the good news. Instead of reacting at all she said “That’s nice, but did you hear [my ex from 3 years ago] asked if he could come to our House Christmas party? Wtf?” I felt very unheard. Later when she overheard me telling another friend she jumped in and said, “what, why didn’t you tell me that?”

-a month after the performance, I said to her “things are just going so well for me. This has never happened to me before, I feel like the worlds going to explode or something, it feels too food to be true.” To which she replied “that’s pretty self centered, thinking the whole world revolves around you so it’s going to explode because things are going too well” (like, what!?)

-when her friends or roommates or coworkers vent to her she calls it “being forced to be their therapist” (She is a counselor but this to me feels like part of being a friend)

-if I don’t reply to a tell or call with a few hrs she assumes I’m mad at her

-she generally shuts down conversations when any of her beliefs are challenged

What do would you do in my shoes? Do you think I should let this friend go?",18Aug2020,1
215,"So last month, I (15F) met this guy (15M) playing this video game and we added each other on discord and started to talk more. He was very different from other guys I met. He actually responds very fast and outright lets me know that he cares. I've had a history of guys who did not care or pretended not to at least.

We would talk like everyday and play games. We eventually traded numbers and socials and would talk on those / facetime. I was able to get to know him more, and I got comfortable enough with him to tell him deep things about me.

I have trouble with responding fast and he would let me know that frequently, yet he would continue to speak with me. It really showed how he cared and how insistent he was with talking to me and it was a nice feeling.

Recently, he has stopped responding fast and most of his replies come after 1-2 hours even more (keep in mind he used to respond within minutes and he actually seemed interested in talking to me) and they're very dry. We have also stopped playing games / talking on call every night. I have talked about this with him but he continues to tell me that he likes talking to me but yet the responses are still slow and dry.

My friends have told me to move on but I really like this guy. I know I don't even know him in person but we used to talk about how we have plans to stay friends for a while and meet eventually. It is pretty hard to let go of this friendship/my feelings.",18Aug2020,1

Background, i have an onlyfans page, i post lewds (not nudes) for some extra source of income, became more active in covid as i was dropped from my job. Couldnt find a new job so i had to commit more to onlyfans as it sourced me enough to at least keep myself full.

Yesterday, i wanted to take a picture of my phone's broken screen to send to the store to enquire about the price for fixing that kind of screen damage. Like i said, i wasn't finically doing that well so i wasn't going to pay too much to fix my phone. It's still workable but the screen is constantly flickering. I asked my bro for his phone to take the pic, he said to just take it and he will send the pic to me later once he is out of the toilet 

He is using an iPhone, where you don't have to unlock it to take a picture 

When i took his phone, his phone was unlocked as it was in a game's lobby screen. I took the picture of my
phone screen and proceeded to send it to myself via whatsapp since his phone was already unlocked and it would save him the trouble, so why not? 

I went into the app and wanted to search for my name to send it to myself, but when i typed my name in the search bar, some weird fucking stuffs came up. It was convos with his friends saying how ""hot"" i was and stuff along that line. I knew i shouldnt, but fucking curiosity man and i pressed into the chat and found my lewds being shared to his friends and they were discussing about how ""fuckable"" i was and, yeah you get the gist, i don't really want to go in detail on what he said about me to his friends.. 

I also found out that he subs to me monthly and has access to all my lewdy pics.

it hurts a lot for me to know that other people have real issues. i know this sounds like i’m trying to make this all about me, but i am really not. 

i feel like my issues don’t matter, which they probably don’t. i know this sounds really really dumb, but sometimes i feel like my issues and problems aren’t valid because i don’t have any mental illness (i am not saying that i want any illness. i am very grateful that i don’t). maybe valid isn’t the right word.

i just really wish that i could take all the pain and suffering away from the people that have mental illness have and put them on me. i definitely deserve it more than them.",18Aug2020,1

223,I was on my break when I found out someone related to a friend of mine passed. I went back to work after my break and felt eh. I started thinking how soon life can be taken away from someone you love but don’t see often or talk to often. That scared the shit out of me and just put me into this mode of panic. I stepped away from my register and went in the bathroom and just let it out in front of 2 coworkers who were in the bathroom. One asked if I was okay and I told him I just needed a minute (I’ve never talked to him before because he works in a different department). I just couldn’t stop getting in my own head and making things worse for myself so the manager on duty told me I could go home. Well I’m starting to think if I over reacted and feeling like my feelings arnt valid because it was my own thinking that caused this. I’m embarrassed that I had a melt down and walked out of a shift and now I have to face this when I go in tomorrow. Like I’m fine now but the anxiety of everything is starting to kick in.,18Aug2020,1

225,"I [16/F] am having trouble keeping myself afloat. I checked my screen time today and I spent a total of 11 hours on my phone. I’ve been getting horrible headaches and toothaches, and I’ve become very lazy. 

I’ve noticed I’m gaining weight, and I’m worried. I try working out here and there, but I lose motivation after day 5 or so, and always have excuses not to. I’m also starting to loathe my physical appearance. 

I tried to keep myself motivated and feeling accomplished by studying languages, but now I can hardly bring myself to pick up a book. I buy all of these workbooks, but never use them. 

I’m noticing my room is getting dirty, which is unusual for me. 

Really, the only thing that’s making me feel productive is my job, which forces me to be active and stay off of my phone. 

I’m going to be in school in 2 weeks or so, but that’s just staring at a screen for the most part. I just want to see my friends and peers, but that won’t happen anytime soon considering I live in America and no one understands how to follow a couple rules. I’m usually a straight A student, but I feel like I’m going to lose my mind with virtual learning and my grades will deteriorate. (This is going to be my Junior year- 11th grade. I’m doing [full IB ](https://www.ibo.org/programmes/diploma-programme/) .)

226,"Hello. I need to rant/seek advice about a recent situation involving my band.

I'm a musician that's in the works to debut a new band. I have a background in marketing and have helped other artists build stronger followings and sales through online marketing. I've also done some gig work as a photographer/videographer. Although I love to help other artists succeed, my true goal is to build a sustainable living with my own music.

I've spent months trying to stockpile as much content as I can (song recordings, logos, graphics, etc). I have two songs professionally recorded and will be going back for 2 more next month. In the meantime, I've been trying to hire a local music video director to work on making music videos for the songs I've already recorded. So far, I've gone through 4 directors in the span of 4 months and they've all flaked out on me.

Now I before I go into the details, let me preface this. As mentioned, I have experience in video work, so I'm aware of the common annoyances that some videographers deal with when interacting with potential clients (high expectations with low budget, not knowing what they want, etc). I always try to avoid being ""that client"" and that usually leads to a great overall experience for both me and the person I'm working with. A person who commits any of those behaviors is usually the biggest turn-off for any videographer/director. Just wanted to make that clear before someone uses the ""maybe you're a bad client"" argument.

The first two directors were people that I've connected with from my previous music project. One of which I've worked with before (twice actually) and had a great work ethic. We'll call him ""Director 1."" The other I've never worked with, but i've seen what they've accomplished for other artists and I loved their work. We'll call him ""Director 2.""

Naturally, I began with Director 1 since we've worked together in the past and became acquaintances since. We set up a phone call and I discussed my ideas. Of course, since he's a professional, I presented my idea as a basic concept I'd like to explore further, but made very clear that I was open to different concepts that he might have in mind. He seemed very interested and said he would get back to me with a budget breakdown (list containing equipment, props, rentals, etc. in order to determine final price). He never got back to me after that call.

I moved on to Director 2. We did the same thing: scheduled a phone call (which he was 5 hours late for by the way), discussed the song, concepts, and potential budget. He said that it was totally doable and would get back to me with a detailed treatment/storyboard. He never did.

That whole process took a month until I decided to move on and scout the internet for another director. I came across Director 3 through instagram. Seemed like an up and coming individual. I sent a message and they were excited to take on the project. We set up a phone call and the guy seemed to be on board. I presented the concept I had in mind. In a nutshell, he passive aggressively said the concept I had was bad and that he'll send me a new concept in a week. I found it odd since Director 1 and 2 said they liked the concept. Additionally Director 1 was always honest yet flexible/open-minded with video concepts when I've previously worked with him. Regardless, I waited to see what Director 3 would come up with.

A week passes, and Director 3 emails me a treatment for his new concept. Essentially, he turned the music video into a nonsensical romantic comedy that has the main character (me) as a womanizer who tries to get the one girl they can't have. Keep in mind, the song is energetic instrumentally, but very depressing lyrically. Additionally, based off his concept, it was very clear that the equipment, props, and actors needed to make his concept happen would be WAY over my budget (which wasn't low to begin with). I told him nicely that I really appreciated the work, but the message of the song doesn't really align with the concept. He said okay and asked for the lyrics (which I'm surprised he didn't ask for originally). A couple days pass and he send me another passive aggressive message saying that his concept is the best option and that if I didn't like it, I can find someone else. I was already having some bad feeling about this person, and that message pretty much validated my concern.

So i'm back at square one. I found another director that was referred to me by a friend. I checked out their work and really liked what they were making. So I reached out them with my offer and budget. They responded the following day and seemed very excited to take on the project. I sent them the song upon request and haven't heard from them since.

This has been such a frustrating process. I feel like giving up. I tend to be very self critical (often times to my own fault) and feel like there's something wrong with me. Am I being hard to work with? Or am I just having bad luck?

Has anyone else had similar experiences with trying to work with people for photoshoots, music videos, or other projects? What should I do?

Thanks for reading!

tl;dr - Trying to get a music video done for my band. Gone through 4 directors. 3 of them disappeared and the 4th one was a close-minded jerk. Anyone else experience this with videographers/photographers? What should I do?",18Aug2020,1
227,"	During the summer I applied and got a job at a new grocery store coming to town. I am a 19 year old college student trying to save up for a car, so I applied for part time. Once I started a lot more of it was out in the hot Texas sun than i realized, but that’s not really my biggest issue. 

	When i looked at my schedule and saw 40 hours I was pretty surprised to see that when I assumed 30 at most, but i assumed this would just be for a couple of weeks while the store was opening... but that hasn’t been the case. I’ve talked to a few of my coworkers and they seem to be in a similar situation, having 40 hours or more and being high school or college age. 

	School is starting in a week, and I need less hours since I’m going full time, but its been pretty hard to do that. On the website you have to do it 3 weeks before the start date but it remained pending the whole time it was up. My manager got sick with COVID so I couldn’t ask him, and the scheduler isn’t around in the afternoons when I work. I finally talked to the head of the store over the phone, where he sounded very disappointed, but nothing else has happened since. 

	The unexpectedly long hours and my anxiety about school and getting to school and work through my parents at the moment is making me pretty miserable, and I’ve already considered leaving, but the work isn’t too hard and the people are nice. I’m just not sure what to do. Should I push harder to get my hours changed, or quit to find another job? I’m open to any knowledge and advice.",18Aug2020,1
228,"(This is kind of embarrassing so I used a throwaway account) 

When I was younger I had extreme anxiety at night. This would include panic attacks, hyperventilating, not being able to sleep and hysterical crying. My parents were great and supportive about it and took me to see many therapists. After a ton of different therapists one of them actually made it stop and i felt almost normal at night. (This was about 3 years ago). Before therapy On a normal night I would have this anxiety but if I was away at a sleep away camp or sleep over it would get sooooo much worse. After therapy though I was able to do so many more fun things like overnight camp. 

For almost 3 years I thought I was ""cured"" but recently it had come back. In February (pre covid) I went to an overnight ski camp and the anxiety came back so I faked being sick because I just couldn't handle it anymore and I knew they wouldn't let me go if I said ""I was homesick"". 

But of a back story here after I got over my anxiety the first time I found an AMAZING overnight camp that is one of my favorite places on the planet. This year I wasnt able to go however because of covid and funds. The camp then said that they would reopen with strict covid policies and would bring down the price. My parents signed me up without telling me because they knew how much I loved it. This was very nice of them but im not sure if I can go because of my anxiety. I haven't told them that it came back. This week I've been in hysterics at night and almost threw up once because I dont want to go. I leave tomorrow. I dont want to tell them I can't go because of how hard they worked and they already paid. I'm literally freaking out right now can anyone please help me",18Aug2020,1

231,"Hello! I have this situation right now and I wanna see how you guys can perceive my situation. 

I got a call from a colleague that our regulating board sent an email that she did something that can be considered as malpractice or fraud and she needs my help. 

So I went to her place and saw the email. Which states that she did treatments with a bunch of people and it was billed wrongfully. So technically it is fraud. 
Thats why she should email the board back with the proof that she didnt do it. Well, she really didnt do it because she was away due to her maternity leave. 

I looked in the letter and saw 1 familiar name. And it was my other friend’s name who worked for her for 3 days she got her contract on aug 6, worked in aug 7 and stopped at aug 8. And lets name this friend Maria. 

The email states that there is this Person from the public who claims that my friend treated Maria and another girl and billed money and used her license to get advantage of Maria’s and the other girl’s money. By fraud. But again, she was on maternity leave. She was not there.

We bill our own clients and doesnt wait for a receptionist to help us and I asked my boss if she can give Maria a job because she quit her other job. She is not really licensed in our field but she was allowed to do few things like basic ones but no extreme treatment so she treated my boss, and 1 weird client that brought her mom to our clinic for a treatment

Then according to the letter it was received august 8. And the treatment was at aug 7. And Maria can attest to that. But my boss denied it and said Maria never treated any client but her. But I was there and another witness that MARIA DID WORK. 

But this was not about Maria working. It was how Maria’s full name ended up on that investigation report! Like why would it say that my friend treated Maria when they did not even meet? 

Now my friend called our boss and my friend told me to record the phone call. Now in the middle of the conversation my boss said. 

“There is one only culprit with this fraud incident and its (insert my name here) “

Then she added


My friend: what is Maria doing there? What does she do? 
Boss: she works for the clinic. To learn but she never treated anyone.
Me and My other friend  listening  : 🤯🤯

We knew that she was lying because prior to this call we already know that Maria treated this one patient. On aug 7 but she insists that Maria never treated anyone else but her. (Which is untrue) 

My boss repeated it again. 

Boss: I never let maria treat. I let her clean but never treat it was just me. She just worked on me. No other client. i believe its really (insert my name) 

Now. That I knew that my boss is blaming me with serious stuff and keeps insisting that it was me because she is my friend and technically I do the billing because the receptionist is lazy and doesnt do stuff. And it was in our contract that we might take care of some billing. Wellllll

What should I do? i know that she betrayed me by backstabbing and I kinda dont wanna see her anymore but it will look like I know something if I just quit/m well what do you think ? Help",18Aug2020,1
232," I am still sleeping in the same bedroom ever since I was a young boy.   My apartment is pretty tiny, one bedroom, shared with my parents and my brother.  We live in a VHCOL city.

b) move out on my own into the city and pay high rent and live my own room (more independence, less money saved)

235,"So, I'm 21, and I'm quarantining with my parents. Over the duration of the shelter-in-place order, my dad has consistently criticized me, bossed me around, barged into conversations between my mom and I and insisted that we were wrong about whatever we were talking about, spoke over me in general, grabbed me or blocked my path when we passed in the halls, jokingly crowded my space at inappropriate times, blamed me for things going missing or breaking that I had absolutely no part in. Today I was standing in the kitchen, and he pushed me to the side and said ""get out of the way"" as he was walking to the sink. It was definitely done in a jokey way, and he didn't push me hard, but it sent me over the brink. My anger bubbled up in a way it almost never does. I tried to calmly express my feelings at first, but he kept laughing and mocking me so I lost my shit and got in his face and *screamed* at him. I don't really remember what I said since it was all in the moment, but afterward, my throat hurt and he seemed equally stunned and sheepish. 

I just feel awful about it. I think I probably could have taken a deep breath and tried to stay cool, but I completely gave into emotion. But also, this has been building for a long time. Is that kind of screaming response ever appropriate? Was this an overreaction? My dad has also said that I am overly sensitive, and I wonder if he's right. This is the first time I've screamed at him like this in my life. 

To be fair, my dad has also done a lot of wonderful things since the quarantine. Sometimes he'll say he's proud of me without prompting, he compliments my artwork, he tells me he loves me, and he'll help clean the kitchen and doesn't give me a hard time about not contributing more because he knows how busy I am (I'm a college student in finals season). I can't overlook that.

My problem is this: I’m terrified of leaving my dorm room and being seen by other people. There aren’t too many students here because most students at my college are from in state, but there’s enough that I feel kind of overwhelmed. I don’t have a roommate, and the halls are mostly empty, but I’m so worried that someone is going to see me do something dumb because I’m still figuring things out. 

Going to the bathroom/showers isn’t bad because I saw other people doing it already so I have a frame of reference. My problem lies with the stuff I haven’t dealt with before, like my key card acts up and I don’t want people to see me standing there swiping it like an idiot, and my mail key won’t turn in my mail box.

The communication got weaker and weaker from her side in 2019, casual texting, because she said she had exams and she wanted to keep focus mainly on that and which i understand cause i knew how hard focusing is for her. But in October of 2019 5months prior to her exams she stopped responding to my texts, for a month i didn't care as much when i didn't get a response cause she used to leave me on read here n there before too, but after another month i started worrying a lot about her, i didn't have anyones contact so i couldn't do much about it. I'd call her phone no one would answer, another month passed and at this point i was too concerned so i started looking her family members up so i could contact and ask about her, got her fathers number called him he never answered or called back, looked up her brother's Facebook or Instagram but they were old and abandoned accounts. 
A couple weeks or days later she casually comes and says ""Hi"" and i finally get relieved of the stress and ask her where was she and she says "" I didn't have a charger and i was busy studying for my exams (which she had in march 2020) and i didn't wanna lose my focus "" i was so infuriated by that response but i couldn't say much to her, i asked you could have used someone else's phone to atleast let me know, i was really worried and she simply brushed it off by saying "" sorry i just didn't wanna use my phone much""

My (F) crush (M) is my ex's best friend (M) who is one of my closest friends! I know this is messed up, especially since we've only been broken up for 3 months. But holy shit. We both admitted to having feelings for each other 2 weeks ago but I don't know if this will work (at least not right now) but I really, really like this guy! We get a long so well and I can honestly see a future together. We vibe so freaking well and every time I see him I just smile uncontrollably. That night where we admitted these feelings, we ended up drunkenly making out pretty passionately and while I don't regret, we both still feel bad because it's against the bro code and all that. We kept it to ourselves but its not something we can ignore.

We are gonna hang out 1 on 1 this week and we're gonna have some lunch, hang out and talk about these feelings in a mature manner since this is a very difficult situation. But I keep thinking of that wonderful night together and I don't think I will control myself. I keep wanting to wanna kiss him again so bad. I want to control myself but I'm thinking deep down maybe I should wait months or even years until I date him so that my ex doesn't feel betrayed.

This is such a difficult situation and I need some advice. Have you ever dated your best friend's ex and how did it work out? Should I try and move on and wait years later? I really like this guy but I have no idea how my ex would feel. Especially when he has dealt with insecurities and jealously issues throughout our relationship (which eventually brought it to an end). It would be kind of messed up if I dated his best friend but I hate to let him go when I really think I found a special connection with him I've never felt with anyone before.

I had been boxing in my negative feelings for many years now and I finally expressed them. Instead of a heartfelt talk she kept making me feel degraded, worst part of the argument was that when I lost control I yelled “I want to die” and she was unfazed and taunted me outside my room.

Staying at my dad’s place long-term seems impossible as he’s living in a small apartment with my sister and him with two bedrooms.

Im debating on just suffering through the pain of living with my mother until I graduate college but I don’t know how to return to that house, anything helps.",18Aug2020,1
248,"I recently moved back in with my dad after a breakup, and some weird stuff has been happening. While I was home alone for a few weeks because my dad was on vacation, I had a couple of creepy coincidences. First, I would wake up to my dad's dog going absolutely bananas in the middle of the night, barking, and growling at something outside. She woke me up at least twice while my dad was gone, and it was annoying but not yet weird. Another night I was laying in bed looking at my phone and saw something that looked like a flash of a camera, but I told myself it was just the neighbors coming home or something. The same night, my dad's dog freaked out at something outside. 

Next, a few of my friends reported to me that a random account had added them on Snapchat and asked if they knew me. Whenever a friend would defriend it, or block it, they would go back and check the blocks and see that they had deleted their account. A few days later an account added me and said they were a teenage girl, who added me from ""quick adds"" and sent a photo of her but it was clearly a picture of Riley Reid. After I blocked her I went to the blocks and saw that she had deleted her account. I went and checked all my social media and noticed that a couple of accounts were following my Instagram that didn't have a photo, had no followers, and were only following me, with similar usernames. 

The night before my dad got back, I took his dog on a walk at night, and she kept growling and looking behind us the whole time, so I looped through the woods on a dirt road and got back to the house. Then later on she kept whining like she wanted to go out, so I took her out on a leash and she was barking and growling going crazy at a large bush in the yard. I was scared so I went inside, locked all the doors, and called my ex who came over with a baseball bat, right as he was about to pull in I saw a large shadow move across the lawn. My ex stayed over and nothing else weird happened, other than being embarrassed when my dad came home early.

When my dad came back everything was normal except for being awkward toward my ex. Later when I came back from work my dad said he found something disturbing, and I was scared because immediately I thought he found one of my sex toys or something. But it was actually much worse, he said that he found a pile of roofing nails by the mailbox, in the driveway, and in the front yard where I park my car. He said that they could easily pop a tire of a mail person or one of our cars, and asked me who hated me because he said no one would have done it to him. My dad accused my ex but I told him there was no way he would do something like that, since we broke up due to the fact that he wanted to date men, and we were still best friends. I asked my ex about it too and he was horrified and brought over his webcam so I could aim it at the window with my computer and hopefully catch whoever was doing these things if they are a person. 

&amp;#x200B;

So I don't know, is someone stalking me? Nothing weird has happened in about a week. When I was a teenager I was stalked and assaulted by a classmate, but I knew from a friend, and online prisoner search, and background checks that he was in prison for assault. A new google search recently revealed that he had gotten out, I don't know why because it's only been two years since he was in, and he went to prison for assault with a deadly weapon. I live in a completely different state from him, and across the country now. I also think that he can't leave the state because he just got out but don't know exactly how it works.",18Aug2020,1
249,"So this is my first time here, I'm a 13 year old girl &amp; for only 3 days, I dated this guy who was around my age, but we just met, I only said yes because I felt bad for him that he didn't had many friends. He was nice, but I only liked him as a person. I hated myself for lying to him. When I broke up with him, he wanted me to go back with him, while I told him lies about my parents finding out, they don't know about this, &amp; I'm scared to tell them. Then they put a bad drawing of a penis, saying it was a giraffe on my friend's Discord server. One of the rules there is no NSFW content because she doesn't want to be associated with the NSFW side of the Gacha community (she does Gacha videos), so my friend, another friend, &amp; I decided to block him &amp; ban him from the server. He then told me on an alt account that his friend told him to do it or his friend would spread lies about him. I allowed him back to the server &amp; unblocked him. Right now, he started to say 'Fat' three times on my friend's server, then said that his brother did that, then put 'Lmfao'. Another rule on her server is 'No swearing'. Then the his alt account said that the server sucked, while saying some bad words. Then he started spamming something that was the reason I marked this as NSFW. His alt account then started spamming a picture of an tan guy about to put his penis into a white girl's vagina. I had no choice but to ban him since both of my friends are offline. Then he kept telling me that it was his brother &amp; he was doing it. How can you switch account's in 1 second? Then I told him that I only liked him as a friend. He then got so angry at me, calling me a 'fat fuck' &amp; started to tell me something that lowered my self-esteem more. I have depression &amp; anxiety. I have been trying to control it, but it became worse, thanks to him. I really need help. I don't know what to do now. What if he starts making more accounts to tell me awful things? What if he raids my friend's server? What if he reports me to Discord about false things? Please, moderators, please don't take this down. I'm really scared, I need help. Please, anyone. I need advice.",18Aug2020,1
250,"Looking for some objective and worldly advice. 

After a few months of uncertainty, one of my best friends since middle school sent me an update that his wedding is still moving forward later this year in Southern California. I agreed to be one of his groomsmen earlier this year before we fully understood the gravity of the pandemic, and I am considering backing out since it appears things have not gotten better with COVID-19. 

I feel obligated to attend as he’s not only one of my lifelong friends, but also one of my groomsmen at my wedding a couple years ago. I completely understand how stressful wedding planning is and can empathize with how the pandemic is muddling everything up. However, the situation they’re putting the wedding attendees has been a bit distressing...

What I don’t understand is him and his fiancé both work in healthcare, treating patients on the frontline. Half of the groom’s party also work in healthcare, so I figured I can’t be the only person concerned, but they’ve been more preoccupied in planning a group bachelor party so it looks like I might be alone with my apprehension. It almost feels like they’re downplaying the COVID risk since they’re moving ahead as usual while being in the medical field, despite the world around us saying otherwise. Also I would have thought they’d be more concerned as they are at a highest risk of infection. 

Their wedding venue is outdoors and they say they’re spacing people out, but it will be a roughly 100 person wedding where masks are “optional.” I also realize I’d likely have to remove my mask for pictures and come dinner/drinks/cake I don’t think there will be much I can do to protect myself. Masks are really there to protect others from you, not you from others, and I have no way of knowing if everyone will choose to wear them. 

I’ve talked this over with my wife, who also wants to be there to support and encourage them, but knows the risks. She does not want to attend and doesn’t know my friend as well, so I don’t want her to go. We’re both younger (late 20s, early 30s) so we know we’re not the highest risk, but are also aware that we still don’t know why some people get sicker or die from COVID, while others don’t. We can’t predict  how we’ll do if we get infected and we’ve been sheltering in place with proper precautions since March. 

My wife said I could use her as a scapegoat by saying I can’t go because she doesn’t want me to, but I think that’s not right to blame her. I just don’t know the best way to approach this and tell my friend my concerns. I’m thinking I shouldn’t go since I’d likely infect my wife too if I got sick, so it would be selfish of me to put her at risk... wondering if anyone has some thoughts/advice. 


TL/DR: I’m a groomsman for a friends wedding in CA and am thinking of backing out since I feel proper precautions are not being taken. Not sure how to best approach the conversation with the groom.",18Aug2020,1
251,"Background: I (21 f) was r*ped and m*lested at a young age and I still deal with trauma from it.
For most of my life, one of my family members (60 f) has been pinching my butt. It's gotten worse in recent years and even in recent months. I've asked her to stop multiple times, told her to stop, and even shouted at her, but she keeps doing it and even complains at me for yelling at her. I don't think she knows the extent of what happened to me, but I feel she shouldn't have to. Recently, my cousin (26 f) has started grabbing my butt, too. They both grab, slap, and pinch it. When I told my cousin not to, she said ""if you don't want it to happen, then you chose the wrong family"" like it was funny to her. My aunt tried to pinch my butt last weekend and I've had entirely too much of this. I'm thinking of avoiding them and family gatherings entirely until they get the message that I'd rather not be sexually assaulted by my own family members, but my mother (65 f, doesn't stand up for me) says I should hit them in self defense if they do it again. I'm especially against hitting back because I'm afraid of hurting anyone. Please tell me what I can do! Again, I'm not going the legal route, so please don't suggest it.",18Aug2020,1

- Lots of different food choices
- Inexpensive housing (I want a 2000 sq ft house under 450k)

253,"I’ll start off my saying that this relationship hasn’t been good for a few years. My brother and father are both very stubborn and they just refuse to see each other’s side of the situation. 

My brother has been unemployed and on benefits for a while now. He has mental health problems (depression, anxiety) and hasn’t been able to hold down a job for more than a year. He is quite talented at getting jobs, but holding them is another challenge altogether. My brother is currently living out of his van with his girlfriend on benefits and travelling. He doesn’t like being around the family (extended as well) as it makes him panicky and feel as though he is inadequate just because he doesn’t have a job. He seems a lot happier ever since he’s been in his van as he is doing what he likes but the comments from my family members make him feel guilty for not being around more even though he feels uncomfortable. 

My father was born in the 60’s, has been working since the age of 17 and hasn’t spent more than a week in that whole period unemployed. He’s a bit of a mans man and complains that people nowadays cry and complain too much about having to work for a living even though he has apparently gone through mental health struggles himself. 

The problem is that my dad sometimes gets really fed up with my brother being on benefits and asking for money, so much so that a comment will be made online and it’ll blow up into a ginormous argument that takes a while to repair itself. As I said before they are both so similar in the worst ways like they both have anger issues, but my brother is extremely sensitive and takes everything to heart. They’ll swear at each other in these arguments and say things that they don’t mean and it’s hard to come back from. My dad feels as though he lost his son a long time ago. My brother feels as though my dad isn’t even trying to empathise with him and just thinks he’s lazy when I know for a fact that my brother has some really bad self esteem issues and these comments that he is lazy just perpetuates his self loathing. 

I’ve been on both sides. I was unemployed after dropping out of school and I know how guilty and awful my family made me feel. I have a full time job now as well, and I see the importance of purpose (not necessarily financially) but to go out of your way to do something productive everyday. 

I guess my question is, how can I make each person see the other persons side? Is it even up to me to try and mend their dwindling relationship and to encourage them to do some self reflection in how they deal with each other? I don’t know what to do anymore and I’m scared that my brother and father will never be civil again. 

Any advice would be a godsend right now. 

Sincerely, a tired family member.",18Aug2020,1

255,"Lots to clarify here so I’m gonna try my best. I have my girlfriend (F) who I have been dating for just about 10 months but been really close with since 7th grade and a friend (M) of mine who I have been close friends since freshman year. Back before F and I were dating I introduced her to M. They really hit it off and became really good friends, which I thought was fantastic, I mean who doesn’t want your friend and girlfriend to get along together well? 

Well eventually I ended up getting really uncomfortable about them hanging out with each other, especially after we started dating because I knew that they had some feelings for each other which withered away pretty quickly. But irregardless I set my boundaries after I noticed they liked to play fight. I told them how that really doesn’t make me comfortable knowing and they kinda just told me they don’t think anything of it. Well I hate to be a jealous type so I bottled up that discomfort and let them keep hanging out, first mistake. 

Things were great for a while, until about a week or two ago... so M started dating one of F’s friends and we all went to the beach. Well things got a little awkward and they started play fighting in front of me and F’s friend, but again I hate to be a jealous type so I didn’t say anything at the time, second mistake. Well afterwards just for the remainder of that day F got a little distant, we didn’t really cuddle like normal or anything. 

Fast forward a few days and M is tripping on acid at an overnight party and he starts to have a bad trip and calls F and asks her to come pick him up and help him out at 4 AM. Usually I’m his go to person for this due to my experience so I was a little taken aback when F told me about the next morning but she ensured that all they did was get McDonalds and listen to music until he calmed down. Whatever, that’s what friends do, they help each other so I wasn’t bothered by it, third mistake. Well shortly after that, like the next day M broke up with his girlfriend, he had his reasons and they made sense so I didn’t think much of it. Then the next day F and M got into a fight and they haven’t been on good terms since, the reason for the fight isn’t really pertinent. 

Well tonight I’m talking to F and she starts to tell me about everything that’s happened the past week or two since the beach. Apparently that day she caught feelings for M, then that night they talked about it. He even ended things with his girlfriend just so they could talk about it all. F told him she doesn’t want to act on it because she loves me and stuff and M understood. However because of it he saw it as an open door and started discussing the feelings he harbored for F. The night of the acid incident they ended up talking and he ended up saying he loves her. He broke up with his girlfriend the next day. 

He was planning on keeping all of this a secret from me and I’m thankful that F told me all about it. At first I was really mad, I kept thinking back to the beach, seeing them wrestle each other with their hands all over each other, then I thought about all of the other times when they would hang out alone, what else did I not know about? I think about how they were planning on keeping it all a secret and how my friend was gunning for F despite her dating me, saying he loves her and that he can’t see himself with anyone else. Like how long has this been a part of his plan? I feel genuinely betrayed and hurt, and idk what to think or do. 

I spoke to both of them and aired out my grievances, told them I don’t want them hanging out anymore or even talking, although I was angry so I was pretty harsh about it. But now I’m sitting here and unsure if I should keep this relationship, because before this I could really see myself marrying F and spending our lives together. I loved her from the bottom of my heart and I want to try and fix it but idk if I should. And the same goes for my friendship. I don’t want to lose them both but I also feel so hurt and betrayed like I have no other choice. What should I do? It’s not like they can help what they feel and they didn’t cheat on me either to the knowledge of my extent.




TLDR: My friend and Girlfriend developed feelings for each other. He broke up with his girlfriend after he told mine he loves her after she trip sat him at 4Am. They kept it secret for about two weeks and now I feel betrayed. Especially when I think back to how they wrestle and play fight with each other.",18Aug2020,1
256,"I [21f] am currently lost in my life and don’t know what to do. I’ve suffered from social anxiety and depression since my early teens and have been in counselling for it pretty much constantly until early last year when I ‘graduated’ (don’t know what else to call it) from secondary care services. 

Context: I live in England, specifically the north east. 
I finished secondary school with 5 GCSEs and completed my first year in health and social care BTEC realised it wasn’t the career sector for me and switched to A-levels (maths, classical civilization and history) However despite studying the 2 years I didn’t get the full qualifications. I have a A grade AS-level in classics and a D in AS maths and a full history A level at grade B. This is because in the second year I relapsed badly in my mental health and had to drop out all exams except the history exams and 2 maths re-sits. This finished in June/July of 2018 and I haven’t been in education or employment since despite finishing counselling early last year. 

More context: I’m also incredibly overweight, have been all my life, and in November 2018 had a gastric sleeve operation but I’m still incredibly overweight so basically another thing that I’ve failed – my fault I know. Because of this I get anxious going outside, even more so than due to social anxiety, because I feel like I look ugly/unkempt no matter what I do – not helped by the fact that I keep trying to teach myself make-up and failing. As such I feel like my life is on hold until I get the weight off but I’m not being proactive in doing that so I’m not making any headway.

I’m still comfort eating and not exercising, again I realise this is completely my fault, because eating junk food is one of the few enjoyable things about my life. At the same time I’ve tried so many healthy eating plans over the years that when I try to change my diet I don’t know how to eat healthy anymore since I don’t even eat 2 full meals a day – I’m lucky if I eat 1 meal a day. 

So when I left counselling last year I was given a leaflet with a number for me to ring to get help getting into employment but I didn’t do it straight away. I went to Bahrain for 3 weeks with my mum to stay with my dad and I tried to keep healthy routines while there and to exercise since there was a private pool. 
But I have this bad habit of pushing myself too much with exercise and burning myself out because I can’t keep up with it. So the first day I swam 100 laps, small pool, then the second 120-50ish(can’t remember), then 200, then 300 and finally I spent hours swimming 400 laps – I was exhausted, miserable and constantly hungry and just broke into tears when I got on the scales and hadn’t even lost any weight even though I ate healthy and didn’t snack. 

By this time, it was the weekend, which I have off from exercise anyway and allow for a treat but when Monday came, I couldn’t get back into a routine. I tried just sticking to 100 laps but only managed 50 then got out exhausted and started slipping into old eating habits and not exercising. I talked to my mum about my concerns and she said it was fine since I was on holiday and we’ll get back into a routine when we go home. 

Only this never happened. So because I feel my life is on hold because of my looks I never rang the service to get help with employment. This is also because I have no idea what I want to do with my life. I don’t have any dreams or aspirations. Except to get a steady job/apprenticeship, ideally 9-5 type hours, with a £30,000 salary within a few years of establishing the career (so not within the training/learning phase or as a starting salary) which makes me feel like one heck of a choosing beggar considering I don’t have any profitable skills or any skills really.

On to the current situation. Like I say not in employment or education with no dreams for a job for over a year so a failure in this department. Still obese, so a failure in this department as well. Living at home with my parents and sister at 21 soon to be 22 and still in the exact same place I was over a year ago so a definite failure. My days consist of getting up at about 10:30am going downstairs to take my tablets grab a can of redbull and maybe a snack before going upstairs. 

Then spending all day on my laptop listening to music, reading manga and doing basically nothing. I have no friends, no social interaction with anyone except my mum + sister and occasionally my dad. I feel like my youth has been wasted. I’ve never had the chance to go out with friends or ever been to a club and make memories or go on holiday with friends instead of family.  

Through the day I manage to fool myself into thinking its okay and just retreat into my mind but at night I’m struggling to sleep anymore. I lay down to sleep at night and see all the fat and just want to take a blade to it because I just hate it and myself because I know my current situation is my fault. I know I need to eat healthy, to exercise and to get help with employment but at the same time I just don’t know what to do anymore, I don’t remember the name of the service and I don’t have the leaflet anymore. 

I’ve taken the Myers Briggs personality tests (ISFJ) to try look for recommended career fields and look at career profiles but none of them are something I’d enjoy so I’ve pretty much resigned myself to working a job I don’t like just to make bills in the future but I can’t find any that I would be good at. I don’t have any skills. I’m useless.  

I’m so overwhelmed by it all that I’m just stuck unable to move forward but I don’t dare talk about it to anyone because I know it just comes off a self-pity. It comes off as self-pity even in this post and I hate it because I know I’ve got no one else to blame but myself. I also don’t want to go back to counselling because I don’t want them to know that I failed. That I’ve done nothing since discharge and yet I’m whining about how bad my life is. I know its ridiculous. I’m sorry for the world salad of emotions that is this post but I thought it was necessary to understand the situation and also I realise now that I might have needed to say this to someone so I’m sorry for that. 

Basically reddit, what are the specific steps I should take now? What should I focus on first? Will my appearance indirectly affect my ability to be hired? Since coupled with my anxiety I’ve no idea how I would appear confident in interviews especially since I struggle to even talk on the phone. Please just any practical advice would help. Also, really sorry for the long, possibly illogical, post and the heaviness.",18Aug2020,1

And she said she’ll stop drinking if I say so but I don’t wanna be mean so I said it’s her life do what you want (in a nicer way obviously).

261,"I'm a college student \[M22\] who's in my third different uni/college program and I really don't care about my program. Before I get into that however, I'll summarize my schooling expierence for the past few years that lead me to this point.

My school years summarized in joint points

\-Finished high school in 2016

\-Year 1 and 2 of uni were spent studying political science

\-Year 3, I changed schools and enrolled in a one year program about media

\-Year 4, Enrolled in a 3 year marketing program and finished year 1 of 3

\-Year 5, this September I will be starting my 5th year of college/uni and I'll be doing year 2 out of 3 in my marketing program.

However, I could not care less about my current program. I get decent enough grades but I don't pay attention because I'm just not interested in it. I chose marketing because I didn't know which program I was actually passionate about, so I just chose a business related degree because I figured those are more versatile to get a job with. I don't really feel any interest in this field though (both marketing and business as a whole). 

I'm hesitant about changing programs yet again however, because if I stop this program and start from the beginning in a different program, I'll end up having been in post secondary school for around 8-9 years. Spending almost a decade to get one full undergrad and a one year program certificate degree is insane. People can complete undergrad and get a masters in the time it would have taken me to get just one full undergrad degree.

So the piece of advice I'm asking for is what should I do with this program? I'm not really that into it at all but the problem is I don't know what I'm passionate AND good at (in terms of school). The one year program about media that I did, I did enjoy it but I wouldn't say I was actually good enough at it to pursue it further as a career. I don't wanna start a new program and end up spending almost a decade of my life to get one under grad degree, but I'm really not interested at all in my current marketing program. Any advice on what I should do would be appreciated! If you need me to further clarify or explain anything don't hesitate to ask, thank you!",18Aug2020,1
262,"So, I've been friends with this ESTP for 4 years now. We originally met at a Jiu Jitsu class we both attended when we were 11, and... Well, we were far from best friends at first. For our first year of knowing each other we clashed a lot and all but hated each other. Over another year we slowly grew to frienemies, then friends. Now the two of us are very, very close and he's a great guy that I like a lot. I'd be interested in dating him but I'm not really sure how to approach that, especially after hearing that people with his personality type are attracted to people that ""make them nervous, keep them wondering, etc"" (I don't get it but to each their own). He's far from nervous around me, and as I've never been in a relationship or even been friends with someone like him before I don't know if I have any chance or should just move on.

I feel like I’m always crying since I want to be confident and happy and outgoing like most of my family but I’m always so scared of even the most improbable things like what if I swim in this lake and get my foot stuck and drown?

265,"My sister is toxic. She blames everyone rlse for her problems and pushes them away and acts like no one likes her. She talks about people behind their backs and lies about it. I lived with her for 2 years. 

I moved in because I was in a bad situation and she needed help with rent. I lost my job and it took me about 4 months to get a new one. But after that I slowly ended up paying all the rent. And slowly she started getting really bad with her hoarding issues and blamed them entirely on me. Even though I owned only enough cloths to get through a week, a bed, and a side table.some how still couldn't see the floor of my room she had so much crap. 

I moved out and she still treated me with no respect and constantly turned me onto a joke. I now realize its because she resents me for our mom making life miserable. (Our mom was abusive).

But now I can't take it. I no longer want to be in the same room with her. Our other sibling dont really get it. They see that it hurts me but don't really get it. And they even invited her to my birthday party without telling me.

Do I ask them to choose? Do I ask them not to invite her? Do I take a step back and just not do family things? 

I don't want to stop seeing the rest of my family but I never get one on one with anyone because I can't drive and they really one do stuff with everyone involved. So its not like I can just pop over to say hi.",18Aug2020,1

269,"So I’ve been having this issue for a while now. I didn’t post about it earlier because I felt bad talking about it on this Reddit because I feel it’s not as important as most of the other stories on here, but it’s been bothering me a lot lately and it’s gotten to the point where I need to do something about it but idk what to do. And I don’t want anyone to take this the wrong way, and I don’t want anyone to think that I think my situation is worse than others. It is not.
So a while back a girl I liked asked me to dance with her, so I did. Fast forward a few days, I wanted to talk to her but had no idea how to, do I decided to “accidentally” send her a post on Instagram since that was the only way we could communicate. Well turns out that it was taken the wrong way and caused a whole rumor to be spread about me in my class.
I tried to ask what they thought it was supposed to be and explained that it was only to start a conversation but everyone said I was just begging for attention. 
A few weeks later I really started to notice that no one really wanted to talk to me. I have no clue what to do. I want to talk to everyone again but I am scared to start a conversation with anyone because I don’t want it to be taken the wrong way and make the situation even worse. I feel that I have waited too long and it would be really random to bring anything up. I’m not great at socializing and I’m really stuck. I’m not sure if I’m just being paranoid or over dramatic or if it’s just because I haven’t tried to start something up, but it’s been at least a year since I have talked to anyone at my school.
Due to everything going on, I am currently doing school online so there isn’t really any way for me to bring it up irl without it being taken the wrong way. Does anyone have any advise for me? It would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",18Aug2020,1

275,"My dad is a math professor, and has been teaching my8th grade brother very advanced math topics, stuff I only learned in 12th grade. Today I saw that he had ordered a Calculus textbook online to teach him with. I would be fine with this, except that I'm not sure my brother is entirely wanting to learn it. Sometimes I can hear him crying downstairs from the math lessons. I'm also not sure it's healthy or right for him to be learning these advanced topics when he already is taking 8th grade level math. There is no point in learning calculus now if he will have to take the class again in high school.

I'm wondering if I should do anything. I've brought it up with my parents, but they just say that he enjoys doing math (which I don't doubt,I'm just not sure if this is right for him). Should I contact the school or something, or is this fine?",18Aug2020,1
276,"I'm sorry, I know this should probably go into r/sleep or r/nightmares but no one ever seems to answer when I've asked for help there before.

Basically, 90% of my dreams are nightmares. I have no idea why, that's just how it's always been, same goes for my dad. That's alright, I'm used to it by this stage so most of the time I just use the usual coping methods and crack on with things. I've also experienced bouts of insomnia since I was around 11 or 12 (I'm a 20 year old female). However, lately it's just been really bad. I have a lot of gory nightmares that always leave me shaken for the whole day, unable to stop thinking about them; being torn apart by an angry crowd, being crushed to death on an elevator, people getting partially squashed, being trapped under mangled corpses, faces and other areas of skin rotting and sliding off, people tearing pieces of their body off and eating themselves, being bludgeoned, to name a few.

To get to what I need advice with, over the past 2 years, I've been having nightmares that leave me very shaken and on edge for multiple days, and there are times like this where I'm too afraid to sleep, that have been getting progressively worse both in intensity and frequency, same with insomnia. In the last 9/10 months or so, I wake up with heart palpitations and covered in sweat, feeling dazed and jumpy for the rest of the day/days, sometimes I wake up so stressed that it triggers my asthma. 

I've been having these nightmares where there's a strange creature that's always trying to find me, appearing as a freakishly tall skinny woman with a hunch. Everything else in the dream is fine and no one seems to notice it except me. It walks about, muttering continuously, enraged, wringing its hands. Somehow I can tell that it's looking for something, it doesn't know what, but as soon as it spots me it knows that I'm what it wants. I always run from it, trying to cry for help, but no one sees anything wrong, they either tell me there's nothing there or that I'm lying, that I deserve it, or the creature kills them before they can respond.

The thing is, last night it came again, except this time it was different and it's honestly got me really, really shaken. This time, it knew I was what it wanted from the start. I can see a mirror from my bed, and in the dream I was hiding under the covers, looking through a small gap at the mirror. The thing suddenly appears beside me, and I can see it in the mirror. It was wearing my clothes. The clothes I had been wearing yesterday. It lifted the covers and just smiles this horrible smile, saying ""I found you"", as it starts to bend down. Luckily my brother came into my room and woke me up by accident.

I'm just lying here frozen in my bed, 6am, exhausted and too afraid to sleep because it genuinely feels like this thing is waiting for me. I don't know why but just something about the fact that it knew where I was and was wearing my clothes has really scared me and filled me with dread. I'm sorry, I know this is a stupid thing to post here when there are people who need help with actual problems, I know it's not real, but please, does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this? Is there any help I could get for it? Has anyone had any similar experiences to this?",18Aug2020,1

1. try to sleep until I fall asleep (maybe I’ll fall asleep at 3) (I’m also deep sleeper and would normally wake up at 11 plus I wouldn’t hear my alarm)

278,"I have 2 cats that are part of a capture, spay/neuter and release program. Cat A has adjusted to living indoors and knows how to use the litterbox but she still goes outside (when I go to work and whenever she wants too). Cat B has never adjusted to being inside with the door closed so she doesn't know how to use the litterbox. I plan to move 1.5 hours away from my home (rv park) to a condominium that has no outdoor areas, so they will have to adjust to indoor life permanently. I'll be living with my mom until I find an affordable location to live and she has a pet stroller so I can use that for them when I'm not at work so they can see the new area, but safely. Cat B is allergic to fleas (my mom's cat is allergic too, the scabs are the #1 sign) but Cat A gets monthly flea treatment. I will have to give both of them a flea bath before they're allowed out into the full extent of the home. That's not the issue. Cat B panics with a closed door, and according to one of the workers of the program, Cat A urinated everywhere when he tried putting her in a home but she only urinated on my bed when I was asleep and didn't see that she wanted to go outside (after that I bought a litterbox). I know I'll have issues with Cat B since she has never been in a real home and I'm worried about her urinating everywhere (I will keep her in a single room with the other cat - mother and daughter - until they adjust and they get along with each other - yes, there is already a food/water bowl and a litterbox is there ready) but they both like me.

279,"my (16f) dad and his gf have been dating (again) for about a year. i don’t like her (neither does any of his family) but i put up with it because my dad is an adult and makes his own decisions. anyways i was never directly involved in her pettiness towards my dad, i just picked up on it. but a few weeks ago, she and my dad went on a small break i guess, and a week after that, he was at my house and then SHE SHOWED UP AT MY HOUSE to talk to him because he missed 2 calls. she didn’t know he was at my house but she just assumed. my mom answered the door and the gf was passive aggressively rude to her.

now comes this past week, my dad and his gf “solved” everything and were “back together” (never actually broke up). i was upset because i don’t like her and i couldn’t believe she came to my house and i really thought that would be a last straw for my dad. anyways i didn’t talk on the drive to my dads and she kinda ambushed me when we got to dads house and was like “i refuse to leave until this is sorted / you talk” “i don’t understand why you’re so upset about us being together” “you don’t want your dad to be happy?” (trying to guilt me!) “you won’t understand but love is hard and we want to make everyone happy” i was not responding to anything because i had nothing nice to say, and i thought everything she was saying was laughable. finally i told my dad that i didn’t want to talk and i was going on a walk. i went to my aunts house for a few hours and when i went back to dads i didn’t say anything to gf. 

now my uncles b-day is this weekend and my dad told him 3 ppl were coming, (he had to book a room in a restaurant i think??). the thing is i don’t want to drive 3+ hrs with gf or be near her at all, but then again my uncle payed for 3 ppl (i think, i’m not sure if it’s per plate or something else, he is also kinda rich but his money is still valuable and i don’t want to waste it.) 

so, should i suck it up and go see my family and ignore gf? or do i ask my dad to tell her that this will be a family trip with just me and him? i’m really at a loss for what to do as everything seems like a lose-lose.

282,"For about a little over a year I've been clean from any IV drug use, well any heroin or meth at all really. When I was using though my little brother and I used together quite a bit for awhile. We didn't always use together. It took years but we did end up starting to run around together. He's always been more into meth and I've always been more into heroin when it came to the preferences, so especially when we first started really using openly around each other there was this idk, year or so period where I was super into mixing benzos with my heroin and ended up overdosing like 6 or 7 times. My brother was there for quite a few of them and when you overdose, you're not there for the scary part, so when you wake up from the high and everyone's scared shitless it just doesn't feel the same and you don't get the same scary experience someone had of just watching you almost die. Anyway, I've since had to change things up quite a bit because of some pretty horrible mistakes I ended up making and the fact that I'm 30, but my brother is 21 and he's living it up. He ended up deciding he was going to move to Arizona with some friends that I knew weren't clean and I begged him before he left to please be careful, especially if he was going to be doing heroin down there. He of course tried to act as if that's not even in his future plans whatsoever and lalala. Fastfarward  to THE FIRST DAY HE IS THERE. We get a voicemail from a cop really not saying much and his phones location was at an ER. He says it had nothing to do with drugs but I have a hard time believing any of that. I legitimately believed he died and I wanted to talk to him and tell him how angry and terrified I was and how could he do this knowing that we're over here loving him and would be crushed if anything happened to him and I just couldn't because I felt like the biggest hypocrite in the world. I felt like saying that would be such a slap in the face to him after all those times he had  to be in those situations with me and I acted as if it was no big deal and continued on with no changes at all. I think he thinks I'm mad at him for what he did but I'm really not. I really just have no idea how to face the way I feel about being so close to losing him and knowing I did that to him so many times.

We are both 18 and Basically a year ago I had worked with this girl and I liked her so I asked to hang out and she said ""like a date? Because I would want to date you"" we ended up hanging out a bit like going on walks, rollerblading together, going to a movie together, and having some food at a restaurant. It felt great and we would stay up late some nights to just text each other. We never actually ""dated"" because I had to move. I knew I was moving because of my dads job and this destroyed me. I also moved many states away, (live in USA).

Once I had moved away we would stay chatting on insta about random stuff and how it sucked I moved. Then about 4 months went by where we didnt talk to each other. I tried to do that because I still felt something and i figured that would probably help get rid of the feelings. It didnt. A year had passed since I had moved and we started talking again on and off. She had sent me a pic of a trail we used to walk on and said ""remember this?"" She also had said ""yeah 'Qwerty' so why did you have to move? Now I've got nobody to hang out with here"" and I had replied saying if it was my choice I would have stayed.

We ended up video calling a few days ago and we saw each other face to face for the first time in over a year. It felt amazing and we were both happy to see each other. We have texted after the call and she said ""it was super nice to talk again, it's been over a year""

289,"My brother is getting married in a few months. Before anyone jumps in on the whole social crowding topic - it's going to be a very small wedding outdoors (ceremony with some food) with proper safety measures in place (i.e. distanced seating).

I'm the best man.  However, I've been working abroad and will likely be unable to return home due to the travel restrictions and quarantine policies.  The original plan was to go back for 2 weeks (using vacation time) and do a whole bachelor party/wedding thing.  Now all that's thrown out the window.  If I were to fly back, I'd have to quarantine for 14 days, essentially using up all my vacation and not being able to see anyone. At the end of it, I might be able to attend the wedding ceremony.  Also, there would be older folks at the wedding and since I'd be flying back, I wouldn't want to put anyone at risk. I would be travelling alone but to top it all off, I was supposed to save my vacation days because my wife and I are expecting a baby at the end of the year. 

I do feel a bit of guilt in knowing that I can't be there for my brother when he gets married.  He was the best man at my wedding a few years ago and I wanted to do the same for him.  But unfortunately, due to the whole virus situation and travel restrictions, it is near impossible.

I'm now trying to be a bit more creative in sending him and his fiancee best wishes. I was thinking maybe recording a video message that they can play on their wedding day, kind of like a best man's speech or maybe a '10 tips for a successful marriage' parody video.  I also wanted to plan something for a bachelor party but I have no idea what can be done.  The rest of the wedding party is all back home, so I'm the only one that won't be able to make it.

Does anyone have other ideas on how can I fulfill my best man's duties to the best of my ability despite being on the other side of the world?

In that time I changed majors back when I was in my second year and almost finished in the spring but that major ended up not working out that semester (I had to withdraw from a class and so did not graduate). I ended up changing my major because I decided that I did not want to be in that career field anyways and repeating it would mean doing all the clinical hours and classes again. I changed to a general studies degree so that I can still graduate soon (this fall). But I’m wondering if getting that bachelors degree is worth it or if I’m wasting my time and money and should do something else like quit college for now and work. I could maybe come back to school later for a different degree program.

—-

I have this guy friend who’s a bit odd? I don’t know if I should completely remove him from my life and block him. This sudden thought came about after he sent me a picture of him after He had hung himself. Believe me, it was sudden. One moment he sent a picture of gum and ask me what the comparison between him and it was,  then the next...Rope around the neck. He was still texting me so he didn’t die. I told him I didn’t find that funny. He said, “everyone laughs at it differently” and that it’s a meme. He also said that he took this picture 2 years ago. 

I showed my family and they ultimately told me I should drop him and possibly report it.

I’m aware of dark humor and that one anime video game,called literature club. But I never told him i like that sort of thing(I dont). And I rarely see anyone make dank humor personal. However, he does think he’s a funny guy. He makes personal memes including himself but never to this extent. 

Anyways, I’m always giving him the cold shoulder. And reply with a few words. But it’s because He talks about himself a lot. And I think he low key thinks he’s better than me? Even though he wants my praise?? It’s weird but that’s how our conversations go. We’re artists by the way. So he constantly shows me his works. 
He’s always telling me of his plans. And if he asks how I’m doing, it’s only just for me to respond, “and how about you”? Since, I don’t like to be all about myself in a conversation.  

And it irks me that he has this thing where he has this fake “positivity” going on. Like it’s creepy at times where he acts like nothing bothers him. He doesn’t want to acknowledge the bad. I told him about it too and he just shrugged and smiled. However, I do notice he vents his negative emotions in a noticeable weird silence.

It’s just strange to me because he once ask me to be his gf and when I told him no, he asked if he could put what happened on Discord. I said yes since we were both looking at Discord on his computer. I thought it would be interesting.  (He had a discord server back then and the ppl were toxic.) And oh boy they let me have it. I was bothered by it but he just let it happen until I said I didn’t want to see no more. 

I know I’m not perfect in any shape or form. And I know I did things in the relationship too. But I just don’t wanna unnecessarily block someone. Recently, I had a breakup with another friend. They told me I’m bad and that my past experiences with others are clouding my judgement. I don’t have many friends. I don’t wanna prove her right. I’m honestly scared that I might feed into that by ditching this guy.

296,"So, my uncle acts more like a child or teenager than I do. He refuses to ever admit he's wrong, if you give him even slight criticism he claims everyone hates him and is against him and he's overall just completely underdeveloped as an adult I truly believe. 

Right now, he's pouting and refusing to talk to me because I dared say that sometimes he's the issue. I also said I wasn't gonna say anything else until he calmed down cause he was in a miserable mood and anything I said was just gonna cause him to get worse. The ""silent treatment"" is not how any mentally healthy adult reacts to any situation. He refuses to get any kind of therapy though because that would require him to admit he's the problem and not literally everyone else.

How can I get him to listen and realize that he needs help. Like, whatever issues he has I know I can't fix them and it's not my job to but I do want to see him improve.

For context: I live with him and probably won't be moving out for at least the next year because I'm not going to college until then. If I could afford to move out I probably would and just leave him to his misery because I've been trying to change him for years to no success. Also he claims I know nothing because I ""am too young to have experience"" yet also refuses to listen to his 85 year old mom, my grandmother so it's definitely not actually anything to do with that.",18Aug2020,1
297,"Please bare with me. It's a lot of information and it may seem scattered and I am really sorry about that.

Background: We both grew up in strong christian households that thing marriage is super important and all that. My family also made it clear that being anything but straight is wrong or mental illness related. Anyways, they are pretty christian. I never dated despite the offers because I wasn't interested in it. Then I met my husband at 17 and we clicked and dated. Fast forward 2 years and we are married.

The first 6 months of marriage: found out he lied about how much money he had, lied about paying his bills, etc. He was 4 months behind on our car payment and 6 months behind on his wedding ring payments. He also didn't know his bank info. I was mad but tried to be understanding. I took over the finances and got us back on track. I also realized that I was Bi and finally was able to admit it to myself. I ignored it though because what did it matter? I was already married anyway. But I felt like I was lying to myself so a few months later I told my husband. He's a Christian too so I was scared. He was upset but because he said he always suspected and felt like I already knew when we were dating. A part of me wondered if I was attracted to women during highschool but I always shoved it down because of my christian upbringing.

The next year: over time he'd bring up threesomes since I came out to him as bi. I turned it down because I wasn't comfortable with it. He'd mention it anyway which was frustrating. We argued about it and eventually he seemed to understand. A few months later I saw that he had created a snap chat under my name and a new one under his. He was messaging other girls as both of us to sext and roleplay a threesome. He even sent MY nudes that I sent privately to him. I was furious but easy to forgive which I kind of regret sometimes. Also he knew the one of the chicks he was sexting threesome stuff with.

The little things: He doesn't help around the house despite how little he works in comparison to me. I don't believe in gender-roles for cleaning; I think it's dumb and he said so too. I also think everyone should do their share but that if one is working more hours, the other should pitch in a little more housework. I used to work part time while he worked full time and I would come home and clean, cook, grocery shop etc. But he doesn't do the same for me now that the roles are reversed. And with covid, I am still working 50 hrs a week and he is unemployed but I still come home and do the household work it seems.

The last few months: He plays video games all day but gets mad at me when I come home tired from work and in need of alone time. He says I am being mean. Sometimes I am short, but I am not aggressively mean. I usually just say I need a minute to myself before I socialize because I am pooped from work. He doesn't usually appreciate that. I have been thinking I want to leave but I don't know if I really want to. I am scared of starting over. He has good moments that remind me of before we got married so I get confused. I feel lost and I am not sure how to proceed. There's more to the story but I feel like I've already typed to much. Feel free to ask questions or whatever. Thanks for your help.

\*\*I am not perfect in this relationship either, I don't want to come off that I am. Sometimes I have a quick temper or let my anxiety dictate my behavior. This isn't fair to him and it has been something i have been heavily working on for the last year by taking meds and going to therapy. However, in the last year, it feels like as I get better he gets worse and that is something that causes me stress. idk.",18Aug2020,1

They have offered to give a generous sum of money towards our first home. The condition is that we need to provide them with a copy of our monthly budget. 

We gave them a high level overview and now they are asking for more detail. As in a break down of how we spend our money day to day, not just percentages of bills etc. Personally I am struggling with this as I find it to be an invasion of privacy. Especially as we have since moved in with them in the short term and I already feel like they have a very good oversight on how we are spending our time/ money.

300,"So I graduated high school in 2019, took that upcoming fall semester off with the intention of locking down a major. I went with a local state school, as it offered very lucrative scholarships (enough that I don't have to take out any loans). This school is also very STEM focused, and I was stuck with a very small selection of majors. I chose computer science, feeling it was the best of my options. A decent half of the scholarship was also dependant on me picking a computer science related major. 

I made it through the first semester, my grades were fine but I didn't click at all with the classes. As the new semester approaches I find myself dreading having to go through more, and the thought of 3 years even after makes me nauseous.

301,"Sorry if the title is vague, I didn't know what to title it. Also! This post is very honest, probably too honest :') but I need help.

I'm 14, to preface this. I have an eating disorder, BED mixed in with some classic anorexia for some flavor, of course, as well as general depression. I probably have BPD as well but I haven't been diagnosed so I won't say that for sure. I'm morbidly obese (sad), and with my depression I can only motivate myself to take showers every once in a while, if I'm having a good day. So, yes, I do generally look like a baby Jabba the Hutt. Basically the stereotype of the greasy basement dude living in their mom's basement, very far gone, I know.

Anyhow, recently I've had these moments in my day where I'll leave my pitch black room, to go to the bathroom or something, and I'll enter the living space. I'll see my mom talking with her new boyfriend, the room is much more colorful, the natural sun is shining through the windows, and it's *clean*. And, in these moments, I hate it in my room. It's so dark and lonely and my bed is full of crumbs and the only way I can escape is by slipping into the blissful ignorance of my computer screen. But I always, *always* go back to my room.

And a few minutes (maybe an hour, I'm bad at time) ago, I had this realization. My depression is consuming me. Not in a self pitying, doomer kind of way, but I have gotten so used to the surroundings my depression has created for me that it is now my normal. I have just a god awful personality (I'm so fucking mean, man, it's not even on purpose), no motivation to do really anything no matter how basic it is, and the only thing keeping my head above the metaphorical waters are these small moments where I realize, 'you're not okay, you've deluded yourself into thinking you are and you aren't'. I want to make a difference in the world, no matter how tiny it is, but I'm really scared I won't be able to do that with how I'm going as a human being.

Now with the advice I need. Uh basically, what do I do? How do I deal with this? I don't want my feelings, my depression, to overtake me. I'm scared, like a lot. I want to get better, I don't want to be mean or hurtful, I want to be a person who does more good things than bad, and I want to be healthy, mentally and physically. How do I start bettering myself? And, I guess, saving myself from getting eaten whole by my depression.

302,"Not sure where to ask this so I’ll ask here. 

I live in an old college accommodation apartment and the layout is such that my desk is against a brick wall where my housemate sleeps on the opposite side. I thought brick walls were good at keeping sound in so I used to carry on playing video games and skyping my girlfriend late at night while facing the brick wall. My housemate recently sent me a text saying he can hear my conversation with my girlfriend (hinting that I should keep it down). It was 3:30AM so I felt really bad and apologized. The next day I talked to him in person about it and he was nice about it, telling me that he feels bad about bringing it up. I asked him whether it’s only when I’m being loud, but he said it’s every word. Ever since then, I’ve been paranoid about it and feel nervous even making a phone call with family or just listen to music because I don’t want to be a bad housemate and ruin his sleep or have him listen into everything. The brick walls are pretty thick but it’s an old apartment. The noise doesn’t come through the door because it’s sealed pretty well. The windows are always closed when I call, so I’m not sure what I can do to fix it.

I can’t hear every word he says when he talks to his friends while gaming, but I can hear his sharp laughter sometimes when he gets loud. Is there anything I can do to keep the noise in with a brick wall? I heard a bed sheet on the wall could fix it, but I want to be sure before I buy a bedsheet and struggle to hang it up.

303,"Well, to explain, I’m a 13 year old boy, which may convince you already that this is stupid, but trust me on this, I’m no liar and I’m more mature than most.

To start ever since I was young, I’ve been too kind, gentle even, so much so that it’s I’m my natural nature and I can’t help being nice even when I want to be an asshole to prove a point, I was born homeless, among the unfortunate and am growing up poor.

To the point, for the past year I’ve had a girlfriend, we were legitimately perfect for eachother, she was kind although had many mental issues due to past abuse, and looked more than beautiful. I ended up losing my virginity young, which is not the best thing to admit for being really young.

After a while I got too comfortable I guess, and became bitter, toxic, and lazy. I’ve since then learned my mistakes but it impacted our relationship badly keep that in mind

A while later she went to her aunt and uncles, and we couldn’t spend time together, so we grew apart, I felt she never complimented or appreciated what I’ve done for her, although I was kind and gentle towards her, always appreciating her. She was constantly too busy for me.

A few days before she came back we broke up, I broke up with her because everything was too toxic. We’re still friends, and she has since then got a new boyfriend although he’s toxic, but I don’t think she sees it well.

For me, ever since then, I felt left in the dirt, I’m really lost, I can’t hang out with my friends and my PS4 broke, so I have nothing to play at all to release stress and forget things for a while, and like I said I’m poor, I can’t get a gaming pc I’m trying to get anytime soon. 

My ex’s parents are mentally abusive so she has a father figure who stands in that place, he was supposedly really nice. But recently he talked to my ex’s real father saying that I had sex with my ex and I have nudes to prove it (i did not have any nudes of her) so he was just trying something. What he doesn’t know is that it’s ruining my life, me and my ex are still friends and I was thinking and planning on visiting her to talk, and it’s all I had to look forward to, I have nothing else. But he ruined my chance and she still trusts him.

Who was my girlfriend recently betrayed me, she has for a while been in a bad scare of her being pregnant with her new boyfriend. How she betrayed me is her father confronted her about her big pregnancy scare and she panicked and said it’s because of me, she’s scared I got her pregnant, which isn’t true, it’s her new boyfriend. She said she almost attempted suicide because she felt so bad, and I think she truly does feel bad, because she isn’t guilt tripping me or anything, and she seems genuinely sorry.

Of course I have other friends, I’m not the introvert type, but none of them really help

I just feel lost and confused for now, but really, if my father died and I got out of that depression, I’m sure I can get out of this one",18Aug2020,1

306,"hey everyone, my fiancé and I recently moved into our first apartment and have been here about 17 days. One of the selling points for us was that the entire complex is non-smoking. Since we’ve been here, our upstairs neighbor has dropped cigarette ashes onto our patio, we let it slide but it has gotten increasingly worse since then, at first a few ashes, then what seemed like a whole ashtray worth, and now tonight i went out to find 5+ cigarette butts :/. Just wondering how others would approach this, as i’ve no experience with living in an apartment complex? Should we just talk to management since smoking is not even allowed in here (a technically a violation of their lease), or should we approach the neighbor first, and if so what is the best thing to say? i’m not great with confrontation and looking to get them to stop dropping shit on our patio.

308,"Backstory: My father was adopted when he was born (in the 50s) and therefore had very little record of his birth and bio parents and all of that. He also wasn't told about the adoption until he found out by accident when he was 12, so he has some issues around family stuff and genealogy (rightfully so). My parents are also divorced.  
  
My dad was told from his birth that he was Italian and German, so therefore I was also told that I was Italian and German. Over quarantine my mom and I decided that I would take a genealogy test so I could figure out what my genetic makeup was since I had this kind of question mark on my dad's side. When I first sent the DNA in to get it tested I joked with my mom and dad about ""seeing if I'm really their kid or not"" because I don't really look like either of them and throughout my life we had always had this running joke that I'm a changeling child. (I realize now how this may be insensitive to my dad because of what he had gone through as a kid but he was always in on the joke and never outwardly said anything.) A few weeks ago I got a call from one of my dad's friends who was concerned about my dad because my dad told him that I had made a joke about not being his bio daughter and that he was worried that it wasn't really a joke. (My mom never cheated on my dad.) Anyway, I got the results back a couple of days ago and as it turns out we're not Italian, I'm 98% white bread and 2% milk (almost 100% German and British with a little Eastern European/Russian). So how do I let my dad know that we aren't Italian without making him think that we're not biologically related?

319,"So I (mid-ish 20s F) work at everyone’s favorite American supercenter. It’s about what you’d expect, it sucks, but there are bills to pay.

So we’ll start with the girl (20s/30s?? F) named Lily (fake). We work close to each other but not directly with (slightly different departments). I’ve been working at this place for two years and she’s been here as long or longer than I have. I’m not a socialite and tend to keep to myself at work so I’ve not spoken more than 10 words to her in those 2 years, just the occasional friendly nod/smile and hellos. 

Then the guy, Jonathan (29M) arrived last winter. He behaves strangely to put it simply. One of my first conversations with him he confided that he had a mental disability, had been in multiple comas from biking accidents, smokes a lot of cigarettes, and lives with his mom. Despite the fact he isn’t bad-looking, that’s not my type, bluntly. 

He wasn’t good at subtlety. He said he wanted to be friends and I figured I could use more friends (as I’ve mentioned, not a socialite). So in the beginning when I’d be nearby I’d try to have a conversation and be friendly. Any conversation that lasted for more than a few seconds eventually ended up with him making statements like “I’ve been single for too long”. I guess in hindsight I shouldn’t have been so vague about my romantic disinterest, I just wanted a friend.. eventually I added him to Facebook (no harm really, I don’t post personal stuff, just pictures of animals.)

Fast forward a couple months towards the blossoming pandemic and I still have some small conversations now and then, but suddenly he’s super distant. My direct coworkers start gossiping saying him and Lily began dating. Later after my shift he’s made a big announcement about it on Facebook (like, the embarrassing sort that would leave me mortified if I was in Lily’s shoes, but to each their own). I kind of know how it looks to be friends with guys who are dating someone, especially a coworker, so I start distancing myself. We don’t talk nearly as much and I even took him off Facebook. 

So a few days ago I get a message request from Jonathan on FB, basically just a “Hi how are you it’s been a while” type message. Odd because we never messaged before and I see him all the time at work. But I had an inkling so I snooped his page and it said he was single. Today I walk into the break room and I do the simple nod and hello I always do for Lily (and basically everyone) and she’s glaring at me. I sit down and arrange my stuff on the table and she gets up and leaves. I walk out the break room to go to my locker and she’s sitting in the hallway still shooting me very angry stares.

So I’ve deduced that the two of them broke up and somehow I got roped into their drama. Maybe it’s not a big deal but I feel bad that someone I barely know hates me. And I’m livid with Jonathan because I’m convinced he thinks I’ll be his backup girlfriend (which, no). Should I ignore this whole situation, or do something about it?

Sorry for the text wall, it all just kind of spilled out.",18Aug2020,1
320,"So there's this girl I have a bit of a , the fact that I've never asked a girl out beforecrush on. We're going to be seniors in high school this next year (although we haven't gone to the same school in years). I've never really talked to her outside of school and school-related events, and I have no idea how to approach her now, especially now that, where I am at least, physical school isn't really a thing anymore.

Some background: I think I first met her in 4th grade, and I'm like 90% sure she's been having on-and-off crushes on me since then. However, we stopped talking when I left her school after 7th grade. Months ago, before the virus, I joined a club at her school that she happened to be a part of, and I interacted with her a little there. The first thing she said when she saw me was that she missed me. I haven't seen her since the virus ramped up in mid-March, and we've exchanged only a tiny few words over social media. We weren't super close and we barely know each other at all anymore, but I think she liked me at least a little.

She doesn't have social media profiles anymore. She did until about a month ago, but I really doubt she'll be on again for the foreseeable future, and I'm kinda starting to miss her. I don't know what to do. I do have her email, which I obtained both from it being publicly displayed 2 years ago, and also from a mutual friend, but I don't know what to do with it.

I've never asked a girl out. Actually, I've never even asked friends out (it's usually a house-to-house thing with me). I know that there are a lot of ways that I can and will overthink this, but since I'm so inexperienced, those dumb little details can really trip me up mentally. I really want to tell her how I feel about her, but I don't know how to tell her without the usual creepiness that comes with someone unexpectedly popping up in your inbox.

Also, between the virus, the fact that I can't drive and live in the middle of nowhere, the fact that I've never asked a girl out before, and the fact that I have exactly zero ideas on how to operate in the usual ""hangout zones"" since I rarely leave my house, I'm extremely reluctant to literally ask her out. I wouldn't even know what to ask her out to. What do people even do outside their homes?

If I can't think of a good way to do this soon, I'm literally just going to send an email or hangouts message telling her how I feel. I know that's far from ideal, but like I said, we barely know each other anymore. Still, she's the kind of person you really feel like you want to get to know.

Any advice or tips?",18Aug2020,1
321,"Last year I went to a doctor who diagnosed IBS. However mine is more on the psychological side. I’m afraid of the worst. When I sit at home I would literally go toilet twice in the morning and that’s it for the day. When I have to travel different thoughts enter my mind;- *Is there a toilet en route to your destination? How far is the nearest toilet? Will the restaurant let you in?* 

When I lived in London I worked about 45 mins from home. I had a nice routine where I would leave an hour early because I knew that in 25 mins there is a service stop with lots of toilets. I always stopped there in the morning. Always. Some days were better, some literally going 90mph just so I can make it on time. Its crazy, I hate it. It affects my mental state and my relationship. But I have to say my partner is very understanding. But I know it’s a burden. We leave the flat and come back literally 2 seconds later so that I can take another shit. In other words my shit has a huge impact on me. 

I used to do telephone consultations with a therapist. We didn’t finish it because of the virus outbreak (the therapist was called to other more vulnerable patients). But tbh I was sceptical about it. I had to do exercises on a piece of paper on what has an impact on how often I need to go. i.e. diet and how I can work on it. I tried it following the steps there but it didn’t work.

I know communication is very important. My close friends know about my stomach problems and don’t fuss about it when they need to wait a little longer at the airport for me. But I hate to be in those situations. 

Sometimes I would get slight panic attacks. At least that’s what I think I’m getting. An increased heart beat rate, excessive cold sweats and anxiety. This would happen when I’m literally stuck, stationary instead of moving in transit i.e. traffic, holy mass, the underground tube stuck on tracks or just last week- a plane landing 

My wedding in in one year. That is my goal. So that I don’t shit myself in front of the altar and I have a great night, not thinking about finding toilet.",18Aug2020,1

Since school is about to start, they added some of the classes. In Google Classroom you can see who else is in your class, and I wanted to see if I knew anyone. When I look at one class, theres this girl that I absolutely hate. She records me without asking me, she says we're dating, constantly touches me and some other stupid stuff too. She's obviously joking, but its annoying and other people actually believe her. She did this all back in middle school and wouldnt stop. Shes very obnoxious and loud and just not fun to be around. Even if I told her to stop she would just keep doing it. Eventually when we go to class she's going to be doing the same things.

330,"So basically, my boyfriend and I had a disagreement where we were debating our future. We wound up staying together but we were going to take a week away from each other. So, because I had been spotting on my three month birth control, I figured this would be a good time for me to go on my inactive week especially since I was looking to be getting my cycle around my birthday next month. It was up in the air whether that week would end sooner. This was on Thursday. I stopped my bc that night. Well, we wound up spending time together on Sunday and having unprotected sex. I figured when we hung out I would be protected on my inactive week just in case we had sex and we’d both been getting tired of condoms. I told I stopped my bc before the deed however I said I stopped it on Saturday (so the night before) instead of telling him it was on Thursday cause I didn’t want him to freak out or get scared. He was still cool about not using a condom. Anyway, he didn’t pull out twice that night and then I got scared so I ran to the gyno and she said I should be fine but gave me plan b just in case at my request. I’m also changing my bc cause I’m sick of the mood swings, spotting and migraines. I took the plan b tonight. However, I feel bad that I lied about the Saturday thing and didn’t tell him about how I actually stopped on Thursdays I know it’s only 2 days but I feel bad, should I tell him? I know this is like a white lie and he’s told way worse but I feel bad however, I don’t think it would have made a difference.",18Aug2020,1

This group of people also have been bullying me in the past, and I’m sure that if I did try to get someone else involved at the school, they would plead their innocence with a smart assed line. Which would end up revolving around to kick me in the ass.

But alot of times when I'm doing something that I told him about and he made some sort of joke about I'd remember him telling the joke or like when I go to play my flute I remember he's the one who pushed to start playing it again after I stopped 

You see where I'm getting at? It's like most of the day even when I'm not talking to him he's on my mind in some way or another and not in a romantic way

But at the same time the thought of losing him or us stop talking really saddens me 

I just i don't know what to do about it

335,"AITA for trying to quit without notice?

Started working a minimum-wage job right out of college, Boss promised full-time contract with benefits and a pay raise once I settled in. Asked for contract multiple times but never got one, always heard an excuse or “attorneys are working on it”.

For three months I didn’t get a single contract or update on my salary, and Boss asked me to take a pay cut below minimum wage (my current salary) - when I asked if that was legal, Boss chewed me out by saying it was a “slap in the face” that I would ask for more money during the pandemic, and the accountant took a pay cut and “they’re an adult” (I think it’s illegal to discuss other employee’s salaries in the US?).

Fast forward to now, seven months in, and I FINALLY get an “employee handbook” and Boss says to reply “Yes” to the handbook email to agree to it. Nope. Didn’t do that. Boss even said there is no contract now that I’m full-time, and I “didn’t need” a contract during my freelance months because they “trusted” me.

Old friend reaches out asking for help at their company, with better pay. I tell this Boss and they say “oh, I spoke with another employee and we agree that you should be paid more, but we can’t match that.” WTF? And when I said the other job pays more, Boss asked, verbatim, “well, why didn’t you just ask US for more money?” (After me constantly demanding my contract and getting chewed out for wanting minimum wage? Heck no.) Boss asked me to stay for 30 more days, but I don’t have any contract saying I need to. Handbook even says advanced notice isn’t required.

Last week I was incredibly sick - an anxiety attack (caused by THIS JOB) spiraled into what I thought was going to be my death. I didn’t text my boss back for 24 hours and laid in bed trying to breathe and saying my last prayers...but I’m okay now.

The next day, I told Boss I’m leaving for health reasons and they went OFF - saying I’m unprofessional, breaching my 30-day notice and ruining any chances for a reference, and that the handbook IS my contract and I never replied to the email to “sign it”. WTF. I also said I need time off for my health and Boss rudely asked “so how are you going to make any money?”

Boss demanded a medical cert saying I can’t work, and I said I don’t need one to resign for personal reasons, to which they said “That’s not what my attorney said” and “we’re facing legalities”. I never signed anything except a NDA.

How should I quit at this point?",18Aug2020,1

I'm 34.  Engaged.  I run my own dream business where I make around 150,000 a year to work 3-4 hours a day and the work is not overly difficult.  I'm blessed in this respect.  Starting my business, growing it, and drinking in the lifestyle that comes with financial success feels as though it has run its course.  At first it was amazing, now its novelty has worn off and money means so little when there is nothing to do. There is only so much weed you can smoke and video games you can play.   I'm bored and don't do either anymore.

I have a lot of acquaintances through my work but only one real friend, we see eachother once a week or two. I don't drink, don't party and basically chill at home a lot busying myself and sleeping in.  I won't be having any children and really hate small town gossip/politics. It's so incredibly boring here and I told myself I wouldn't die here--- but I live a very easy life.

I've traveled a lot over the last five years to know this place is a shit hole and I want to save up money over the pandemic to do either:

&amp;#x200B;

A) Stay where I am, buy a house (I rent), get a dog, travel/stay in a different location 2 months out of the year to escape this hell hole.

  
Pros:  Continue my easy life, own a piece of property and save for retirement although I'm not a big retirement saving type of person.

Cons: 10 months of mind numbing boredom out of the year.  Feeling of no new experiences are capable where I live other than buying new things, Harsh winters. 

B) Move to california with some savings, starting a new career as this particular business I started is unique to North Dakota and I could not re-create it in California and honestly even if I could, I wouldn't want to deal with the struggle of starting from scratch and re-starting a business.

Pros:  Be near the ocean/mountains and a place that actually feels like you are on planet earth not a lego board, new experiences, life feels like an adventure, novelty, meet new people/new experiences, better climate.

Cons:  Starting over with no idea what I'm going to do, leaving my life behind, having to work regular hours again, never own a home (Possibly a condo), not as much freedom, no retirement savings, no job security, a much more challenging life.",18Aug2020,1

Tonight, I went out to a show and B was there but M was not. B came to my table where I was with other friends and sat down really close to me and immediately put his hand on my upper thigh and kept it there until I nudged him away. I tried to play it off because I didn’t want other people noticing and maybe spreading rumors. After a while, he offered to buy me a shot and he was really insistent so I said yes and then he insisted we go for a walk.

During our walk, he was really handsy and kept putting his arm around me or trying to grab my butt even though I told him multiple times to stop. Eventually we sat down and he started telling me all these things about his sexual relationship with M and finally admitted that when I was still living with M, he used to go into my room when I wasn’t home and take my dirty underwear out of the hamper, and just sit on the bed and smell them. Honestly I’m pretty drunk right now so I don’t really know what to do or how to feel.

351,"I've always considered myself a regular old chap, a friendly old chum, but looking back I've always been locked in a constant pit of depression with what feels like a lack of support around me to help me through. I know logically that that's not true, there are many in my life who care about me, and love me and will try to do anything to support me, but holy shit it feels like I'm completely alone some days. My first attempt at a relationship ended a while back after several months after my girlfriend made out with another chick at a party (and dumped me over text during class the following day). I have a dnd group to play with but it's been tough with quarantine and its slowly splitting apart. My interests are become uninteresting rapidly, my life is falling to pieces and I do nothing to stop the infectious decay ruining my life.

To put it bluntly, I hate myself. I can’t help but focus on my flaws and instead of seeing my strengths, I always think I’m not doing enough in those areas and feel like I’m failing. I put on a “customer service” face whenever I’m around people and always help them out when I can and do what I can to try and make them happy, but when I’m alone I’m miserable. I’m starting to feel like I’m basing my self-worth on how much I help people and how often I can make them happy, but I put no value on my own feelings or emotions, like I just exist to make sure others are happy.

I want to change that, but I don’t know how. I just can’t shake this feeling and I don’t know how I can change my perspective, how I can feel like I’m worth something more than just what I provide for others.

361,"So....I know I’m a giant idiot or for this...but let me explain:

I signed up with EZ Pass when my job required me to commute farther, and my ezpass account was connected to my debit card obviously. After a few months I lost my debit card, and had to get a new one. I realized I hadn’t connected my new one to my account when I went through a toll booth and it said “toll unpaid” or something. So I updated my information on the website, or so I thought, and afterwards, whenever I went through a booth it would say “call service center”. Now this is the embarrassing part: I just never called. As dumb as this excuse sounds, I worked three jobs at the time, and just never got the chance to call them since their call center closes at 5 or 6. Furthermore, I was never home as after work I would stay at my BFs house. So the violations and mail piled up. This is gonna sound really dumb too but someone I mentioned this to said since I have an EZPass account, if I call them and dispute this, they won’t make me pay the administrative fees (~$50.00 a violation), just the tolls I owed but I never co firmed this on my own. So this exacerbated my willingness to put this problem off. By the time I got around to trying to finally make sure my payment online was good, i wasn’t allowed to even login, it would give me a message saying to call the help center. This has been going on for months. Every week, I would go through the booths 6 times. That’s 6 violations a week for MONTHS and I can’t afford to pay an administrative fee for every violation I’ve accrued. I’m scared and I just want this looming nightmare to go away. 

My question- do you know anyone in this situation that has successfully disputed this and just paid the tolls they owe instead of all the violations since I do have an EZ Pass account? Do you think I have a shot at successfully disputing this?",18Aug2020,1

I know its long, but please read it, I need help 

So...
I am a male 20y, she is a female 21y, she was depressed most of her life, she got kicked from her parents house, then went to live with her aunt and cousins then got kicked again

Now she lives by her self in an apartment where she barely have money for food ( cuz of the rent she pays) she works btw

She just have her phone, clothes and a bed, nothing else, no TV no fridge nothing 

I try to help her with food sometimes, but most of the time she won't accept it,

She literally stay sometimes 2-3 days without any food

She lives really nearby its like a 3 min walk from my house 


We go on walks sometimes, we go eat sometimes if she agrees to, and sometimes times I go visit her at her work just to cheer her up a little, she needs someone to talk to, so I try to be that person as much as I can 

, she is really depressed, and her work is even stressing her out even more 

Even when we go together, I am getting depressed myself, cuz of how bad I feel for her, and cuz of the vibes she spreads I guess 

Even though she is the most friendly loving caring person I know, idk how she ended up like that 

And from what I understood from here whole kicked out situation, she had nothing to do with it, it's just injustice and dumb family issues I guess 

She refuses to go to therapy (she can't afford it, and won't accept someone paying it for her) , she refuses to go out with me ( like go and do something fun other than the boring walks, just to give her a little bit of a good time) 

Same when I invite her to a hangout or any activity with me and my friends ( she kinda doesn't wanna see people) 

All of her friends are guys, she doesn't like girls for some reason 

And also one day I found cutting marks on her hands and arms, she did that to herself. 

I just don't know what to do, and i can't keep watching her living like this 


Please what do I do?

365,"(copied from r/teenagers because I got almost nothing for advice over there, so I hope I get something here) 

I've already figured the cause of it; browsing all the depressing posts on Reddit, looking at the shit storm that is Twitter and just generally looking at shitty news on the internet. However, it's just suddenly taken its toll on me in less than a day, whereas I've been fine for months beforehand. Combine that with lock down and a repetitive lifestyle since it began and I've just suddenly become the literal epitome of the rebellious teenager. In less than a day, my teenager instincts have kicked in and I've just started to look at things at the worst way possible.

It's not like I'm not doing anything either. I've been able to start exercising and get a decent diet going, lost about 10 lbs in 2 months, may not seem like a lot, but it's better than nothing. Meditation seems like a good option, but my mind gets lost in its own thoughts way too quickly, so much that I can't sleep at night, even without a phone by my side. I know I can stop looking at how everything is going to shit online, but I don't have the mental fortitude to stamp those kind of thoughts out of my mind. I have seen and heard more than enough dark and evil shit that goes on in this world to ever just not think about it.

368,"So, let me explain: I like spending time with my husband, family, and friends. That’s it. And even that gets extremely exhausting very easily. The only person I can be around 24/7 and not get tired of is my husband.

It’s like any social interaction outside of that at all is so exhausting, it affects my everyday life. I ultimately dislike every job I have because I’m dealing with not only coworkers, but worse- small talk with customers (or now rather, patients). It isn’t that I don’t care- it’s just so. extremely. tiring. To the point of me thinking that I have some kind of autoimmune disease or something medical causing my fatigue. I kind of put two and two together after realizing that I feel totally better after a weekend recharge- I know that the socialization is what’s exhausting me. I can’t stress enough on how tired I am.

I just don’t know what to do job wise. Changing jobs, unless I’m working at home is pointless, I’ve tried it many times. I can’t take time off, and I can’t just not deal with patients. Thankfully, I’m a Christian and what moves me forward is contentment in Christ. But I can’t ignore the fact that my job is exhausting me and I don’t know what to do.

Last Friday, I hosted a party at my place for my coworkers. 

I am an intern in a start up so we all super young and get along quite well. Party didn't turned out very well thought. 

Martin, my superior invited a friend of his, Amina and with another intern (who was actually my pal beforehand!) locked themselves in the bathroom the entire evening to plan how they were going to go to another party. I was kind of offended but hey i was not going to make drama over this. Later, i knocked on the bathroom door because i needed to go to pee. They refused to open the door and i had to come back knocking 10 minutes later... still refused and when i came back another 10 minutes after I banged on the door and seriously kicked them out of the bathroom. I was pretty angry at them so I explained how that was a super disrespectful behavior. 

If I had the next day a great discussion with Martin about what happened and received his apologies that i gladly accepted, the other intern thought.... Since then he does not talk to me, look at me or even say hello. He never apologized. Total coward!!! I feel even more offended by this behavior than what happened Friday evening. 

However, I am a professional person and personal drama do not belong it the workplace. But i am hesitating between squaring him up jussst a little with a confrontation (maybe not the best idea with a coward) or plainly ignoring him? What would you recommend me?",18Aug2020,1

377,"My boyfriend is prone to cults. As the tile says, his last job was one of those door to door book selling jobs which made sure you woke up at 6 am, exercised, took a shower, didn’t eat breakfast, and was out of the house by 6:10 AM. Then they didn’t stop working until 10 PM. 

My boyfriend explains more and more of the policies that the employees had to follow and it seems so much like a cult. I wouldn’t have an issue with him having joined a success cult to make money but he keeps denying that the policies were cult-like. 

He holds this job in high regard even though he was in a ton of pain throughout the job. He slept in a flea ridden home, got barely any sleep, didn’t make as much money as promised even though he worked his ass off, and basically it seems like everything about this job was a cult. 

I’m not sure how to convince him that he shouldn’t hold this job, other religions, and MLMs in high regard. He thinks that they’re admirable jobs because they’re hard to do. And he doesn’t believe pedophilia claims are as common as they are in churches like Catholicism. He thinks a lot of people made up their claims(He’s not even catholic, nor grew up catholic) and his opinion changed when its ‘normal people’. Like someone says they’ve been raped and he believes them but when religion is involved his belief in the victim wains.). 

And he doesn’t believe that MLMs are scams and are pyramid schemes. He says “pyramid schemes are VERY different” but the way I see it from all the woman I say join MLMs growing up, my mom buying into them a couple times, and internet research, it’s an actual scam. But it’s a scam that is considered legal. 

How can I try and convince my boyfriend that the stuff he holds in high regards his well known to be scams and cults? He doesn’t seem to believe me or my sources whenever I bring them up. Idk if there’s a different way to approach this for victims of cults. I truly believe his job last summer made him think this way because he did not have these same opinions when we first started dating last year. His opinions changed after this job that I believe is a cult. 


I’m not sure what to do. I don’t want him to think that all religions are perfect and I don’t want to make him think that all MLMs are legit. I want to make sure he wasn’t brainwashed by this last job he had. It’s definitely worrying me.

378,"I'm a 20 y/o old girl currently still living at home (in Belgium), but this situation is making any mental recovery almost impossible as I'm still living together with the person who traumatised me in the first place, namely my bordeline mother that is currently still not getting psychological help. The rest of the family, my father and brother, lives a life in function of avoiding to trigger her. While me and her have a very special bond unlike anything that a normal mother-child relationship should be like where she sees me as both an appendage of herself she can completely control and as her only emotional support system. This and her having been physically abusive in the past fucked so much with me that I'm still trying to repair the damage, but real progress seems impossible as long as this bond is not cut completely.

The mother of my boyfriend of a couple of years, herself being a psychiatrist, helped me a lot to already address important issues and get a grip on understanding both myself and the situation more. She has been proposing, or rather been quite adamant about the fact that I should move out as soon as possible and get psychological help. Even going as far as saying that I could move in with them for minimal rent. My boyfriend has also been trying to convince me of this idea.

Now the problem is twofold. First and most importantly, I am a student working a student job where legally I can only earn up to 500 euro a month. I wanted to start studying medicine starting this October and already got accepted. My parents don't contribute anything to me financially apart from food and housing, so I need to pay for university myself which in my country for classes and books is about a 1500 euro per year that needs to be paid before uni starts. This is the exact amount I have in savings currently. All of this leading me to conclude that moving out now to live on my own is not an option, but instead staying home for at least another year at the cost of my mental health is one if I want to start studying medicine this year while saving up to move out the year after, but this is far from ideal.

Second option being to move in with my boyfriend whom I do want to build a future with and whom I have already lived with for weeks and weeks in a row multiple times. Communication is good, boundaries and giving enough space as well. But at the same time it would be leaving one dependency to join another, especially given that he lives in another country (Germany) and I'm still only at a moderate level when it comes to the language that is spoken there. Plan would be to work, learn the language and save up to finance going to university the year after there or to the uni I got accepted in as my boyfriend is currently applying for an master's taught in English there. Which definitely would work out quite nicely if things don't fall apart between us, which I don't think they will, but there's always a chance. Most importantly, this would allow me to take time for myself to recover in a relatively low-stress environment, which I honestly really need, and focus on getting professional help.

There are of course also different options, but with limited time and resources, I'm really at wits' end about what the best way forward is. Any advice would be very much appreciated.",18Aug2020,1

As a kid my moms friends would hype me up or tell me I'm so smart or something all the time which I always ended up believing, that's until I went into highschool and realized I am dumb as hell, I struggle with keeping up in my classes and practically on every report card there was a F, (I somehow managed to pass which I still dont understand till this day), I'm genuinely worried that I wont be smart enough to graduate my senior year, but anyway I'm getting off topic. 

Conclusion I have what I believe is 0 talent, I feel like its always me against the world at times and i can't say for certain (since I'm not a doctor) I'm almost sure I struggle from some type of depression, mood swings or  some type of mental disease at this point, and I say that because one moment I could be perfectly fine and the next I could feel like a pile of trash and hate myself for absolutely no reason, I'm unable to take compliments for some reason, like whenever someone compliments me I either think there lying or just saying that because there a friend of my moms, I dont have many friends, and the ones I do have I feel like only hangout with me because they feel obligated to hangout with me, I have never had a girlfriend  before which gives me anxiety and makes me nervous anytime I talk to one, I have 0 self confidence in myself and have absolutely NO drive to do anything at all or apply my self into something, I am a compulsive liar, so I lie about the most stupidest shit sometimes and have no idea why or do it out of fear of what the result will be if I tell the truth idek how I picked up this habit, think I covered most of my mental problems, or most of the ones that come to mind off of the top of my head anyway.

So after reading this i ask, is there any hope for me?",18Aug2020,1

386,"Hello, I am in need of some advice and help. There is a chat room I have been on, the first time was when I was 15, and it’s still active to this day. This concerns me because the chat claims to be pro choice for suicidal people seeking help. Except this place is terrible and the owner has doxxed at least a few people and harassed idk how many. He’s told me and a girl I met online to kill ourselves. This guy is also apparently a pedo from a rumor I heard but I’m unsure if it’s true, he also does own a teen chat and picks on teenagers because he thinks they are “weaker” or something. To add onto that he instantly bans anyone if he finds out someone is gay or doesn’t agree with him politically.

387,"As it says in the title of this post, my sleeping schedule has been ruined. Back when quarantine started, months ago, I started going to sleep extremely late (from 1-2AM to about 5AM when it started). From then, I continued it and it became my normal schedule. However, sometimes I went from 5AM to 6AM-7AM. During that time I woke up anywhere from 4pm to 6pm. This was during March-May 2020, btw.

During June and July, I started going to sleep more and more late, until about the beginning of July, when it started going extremely wrong. So, in one day during july, I went to sleep at 9-10am which was normal at the time, and then I woke up at 7pm. The day after, I wanted to do an all nighter for no reason whatsoever. However, it failed. I have fallen asleep at 6-7pm and woke up at 12am. I decided that I had to fix this, so I decided to try another all nighter. However, at 1-2AM next night I fell asleep for about an hour, and when I woke up (in the middle of the night) I wasn't able to go back to sleep. Then the next day I fell asleep at 7pm, waking up at 3am. After that, I fell asleep at 10pm, waking up at 7am. However, I haven't learned anything because in the following nights I managed to fuck my schedule over once again. After a few more days when I went to sleep at 8-9am, that became my normal schedule once again.

If that's not bad enough, a few days ago it turned worse once again. I started going later and later to sleep (10am, 11am, 12am) until a few days ago when I wanted to go to sleep at 8am-9am until summer was going to end. However, this was impossible, so I decided to make another all nighter attempt in order to fix it. That all nighter failed and I fell asleep at 4pm, waking up at 10pm that evening. A day after, went to sleep at around the same time and woke up at 9pm. Then, the following days have been another cluster fuck until 2 days ago. 

2 days ago, I had an idea to fix this. I wanted to go to sleep at more and more late times of the day/night until I was going to go to sleep at 2-3am, or something normal (I used to go to sleep at that time before all of this) (Ex: today I go to sleep at 5pm, tomorrow at 7-8pm, etc.). So, I went to sleep yesterday at like 5:30pm, waking up at 11pm. 

Now, it's 11am here (haven't slept since 11pm last night), and I'm not sure what to do. Should I continue trying this? Are there other ways to fix this? I tried everything I thought I can do until now, so I made a reddit account just for this.",18Aug2020,1
388,"Tried to keep this as short as possible. Tldr at the end

I(24 male)feel so broken. Every time I try to move forward, I just feel like I get knocked down. This process gets more and more demoralizing, to the point where I feel like I’m going to give up soon. I would never hurt myself or others, but give up as in quit on my dreams and live a life of complacency. 

My immediate family/circle is fairly small. 4 years ago, I abruptly lost my uncle. Forgot to message him back one day, the next thing I know he’s gone. 2 years ago, I took care of my grandma on hospice daily for over a year, and eventually watched her slowly pass away over that period of time. I was in the room when it happened, and it was the worst thing I’ve ever had to deal with in my life. 
.

So Here I am today. After working bs jobs, I sit down and think, something has to change. I played baseball through high school and truly believed that was going to be my life. From 19 to 24, I didn’t know what I was going to do moving on from the fact that it was time to give up baseball. One day, I was working a photography job, and truly became fed up with the idea of a 9-5. I quit the job, and decided To pursue a career in videography. 

From that point on, I’ve felt a level of dedication and devotion towards my new craft that I haven’t felt since I’ve played baseball. The only problem is, the place I was raised and currently live has very little opportunities for what I want to do. With that, I decided it would be best to move to Los Angeles. I’ve tried once about a year ago, but on top of my car that wouldn’t make it, I truly couldn’t motivate myself to leave everyone behind 

My parents are older (55). They don’t have the best health in the world. Everyone is in one of the worst shapes I’ve seen them in. Mom seems like she’s truly giving up in life, not concerned about health and continuing bad habits, regardless of my countless input. My dad isn’t as drastic, but neither one of them care about what they put in their body and that bothers me alot. My older sister(35) is lays in bed all day due to a sedentary lifestyle that she has no intention on breaking. Both my mother and sister live together, and every time I go there and see them it really hurts me. 

I try to fight this feeling because it feels like an excuse, but seeing the people I love the most not doing great is easily the most unambitious   feeling ever. It makes me want to quit to the point where I want to get away. I really don’t know what to do and I can’t move on to the next stage of my life without dealing with this situation. Any advice, prayers or words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated. I’m not going to quit but it’s just getting really hard and I don’t know who to talk to about it. Anytime I talk to them, they listen, but they don’t make changes. That makes me feel like they don’t care about my feelings, but more importantly themselves. None of them say anything to make me feel this way, in fact they encourage me to go be great. But I just can’t. Life is so short, and I want to make myself happy, but I don’t think I can by leaving the only people I really have behind.

TLDR: at the end of my wits. I need to move away, but mentally I can’t. I don’t want to leave everyone behind because life is short and I never know what’s going to happen. I know once  I do, things will get better for me as an individual. But I feel like I’ll be even more depressed being so far away from the few people I have left in my family. What should I do?",18Aug2020,1

390,"There's so many things I want to say, but I don't know where to start. Sorry for the long post. 

My husband is bipolar. He's taking meds, which I thought were helping, but apparently not. 

He said he was faking being happy and doesn't feel that the medicine has helped at all. We don't currently have insurance, so he can't go back and look into a medicine change. Even if we did, he wouldn't want to go back. He's been against medicine since the beginning. 

I don't have the energy to type out even a fraction of what he's done in the past, so I'll stick to Sunday/Monday. On Saturday, he suggested we go to an amusement park, so I bought the tickets. Sunday, we went and he started to get really cranky. After a bit of this, he ended up breaking his phone on purpose and walked off. 

I sat where I was for 2 hours hoping he'd come back, and then when the park closed, I waited an hour before I left. He ended up calling me 5 hours later to come pick him up. He had walked 20 miles and couldn't go anymore. His feet were blistered and his legs were in extreme amounts of pain. He ended up drinking, so had lost everything (including his glasses) but his wallet and keys. 

We ended up talking and he apologized, and he said he wants to be better. We went home and fell asleep and then left to go get groceries the next day (we took a friend as well). At the store, he got super angry about how he has so much to deal with and how he shouldn't have to handle anyone else complaining about life (friend mentioned a problem he was having). He left the store and I followed him, telling him that just because someone's problems aren't as bad as his doesn't make it okay for him to complain and no one else. 

He ended up throwing his second (and last) pair of glasses on the ground (breaking them) and started to walk away. I followed him, yelling at him to stop for about half a mile before he stopped. He was super angry, and wasn't listening to anything I said. We ended up going to the car and going home without getting groceries. 

He got home, slept for a bit, and woke up still super angry. He ended up leaving the house on foot. I had to follow him in my car to convince him to come back because I would be super worried about where he was. It was 12 am and he had no way of contacting me if he needed help - exactly like the day before. 

He went home, said some nasty things, and now I'm sitting here, scared to death he'll try leaving the house again. He told me he feels like going out and getting some hard drugs. Only thing that's stopping him is that he has no money. He's also said multiple times that he wants to hurt himself and/or die. 

I love him, but his mood swings get so nasty. It's hard to take care of myself when all my energy has been spent on him. 

We've never had a lot of money, so I figured I would go to a coding boot camp (basically like going back to school), so I could get a better job with way more pay. I ended up quitting my job so I could focus on it full time to get it done sooner. 

Earlier this year, he didn't have a job for like 3 months, so he said he would be okay returning the favor with me. 

Ugh, I don't know what to do. He's not physically abusive, but has been pretty mentally abusive to me. He is abusive to the things around us, though (if that makes sense). He breaks things, and has said to me before that he does it so he doesn't hurt me. In the past year, he has broken about $3k worth of stuff, including a $1k laptop that I had given him. Two different times, he's left things in such a state that it looked like a literal hurricane had passed through. 

I know I don't deserve it, but I feel stuck. Even before quitting my job, I felt stuck. We have a house together, so if I left, he'd probably not pay and ruin both of our credit. He's also not willing to leave the house and let me keep it. I cosigned on his car, so if he decided to stop paying on that as well, than it would ruin me even more. 

I have to walk on eggshells a lot of the time around him, and I can't really speak my mind, otherwise he gets upset. I still remember the time when I did say something he didn't like, and he full on screamed at me at the top of his lungs to shut up for like 10 minutes straight. 

He gaslights me, saying that I'm the one who said or wanted certain things, when I know it's not the case. Like with the amusement park, he said that he had a horrible time, it was my idea, and I should have just saved me money. It's not that big, but he's done it with almost every thing that turns out bad (especially when it turns bad because of him and his moods).

I have depression myself, so it's really hard to think about this in a positive light anymore. I don't even really have the motivation to keep learning coding anymore. But I have to force myself. I have to be responsible. I wish I could just hide for a week and have him take care of me like I do for him, but that's never gonna happen. 

My friends have told me over and over that I should just leave and its not as impossible as it seems, but it's just so hard. I just think of when he's happy, everything is great. And then it's not, and he has no one but me. 

I had a bad childhood. Long story short, my brother should be in prison for the things he's done. I used to wish a Prince in shining armor would find me, and sweep me away to a happily ever after. 

Is it bad that I am kinda wishing for that again now? I know it won't happen, and I need ""to save myself"", but I'm not sure if I can.",18Aug2020,1
391,"Alright, I don’t feel like telling the whole story, it’s real long and emotionally exhausting. Essentially, an old lady stole my brand new cat carrier and I don’t know where she lives. I have her first and last name, her phone number, and email.
I’ve contacted her several times over the past few months to return my cat carrier to me and refuses to, when initially she told me she’d return it the next day. 
I have receipts for the carrier and everything, so my next step is to (unfortunately) get the authorities involved.
Is there a way I can get her address from the above mentioned info I have of hers? I tried doing a phone number search on google but it’s not even under her name..

392,"Hello,

I'm an 18 year old who had to run away from my home due to abuse. It's been almost a year since then and I can typically go about my day without it really bothering me too much. I've developed lots of coping mechanisms, picked up numerous hobbies, made plenty of new and supportive friends, attended therapy for some time, etc. However, the one thing I can't do without it being too painful is playing video games. 

The most painful memories I have of my abuse always occurred when I was playing video games for some reason. Abuser beat my other parent and I into a mess? There was a video game playing in the background. Abuser comes back from work angry and so locks me in my room to take it out on me for hours on end? My video game is still on in the background. My parents are getting in a nasty fistfight? I'm seeking solace in my room, playing a video game.

Now, whenever I sit down at my console to play all the memories come back to me. I relied on video games as a coping mechanism from my abuse for so long, now that I feel better and just want to play for fun, I still feel all those emotions I did back then. I would love it if someone could offer me some advice. Thank you :)",18Aug2020,1

397,"There is this celebrity that posted their favourite hobbies, movies, music, all that kinda stuff. And for the past, like 1 and a half years, I’ve been super infatuated with this one person, a minor celebrity, who I’m not gonna name because it’s embarrassing. I used to go to his social media profile and see the stuff he posted, and try to get myself to like all the same things as he does. Now I hate that I did that. I wasted my time (and even some money) trying to become interested in things just because some guy who I don’t know but became obsessed with likes them. It makes me so mad that I invested so much time into becoming interested in that stuff, and now some people might think I’m a different person. I was going to choose my college major based on what he did (that was such a bad idea), and I’m going into grade 12, so I’m glad I admit it now before I went on to do something that stupid.  
I don’t know why I became obsessed with this person. Maybe I’m just overthinking it and I have been myself all along... But idk it seems like I’ve been trying to become this person and its making me become disgusted at myself. I will now find my own interests and become my own person.

Like I don't get angered by hearing crimes &amp; bad stuff like hate crimes, pedophilia, etc. I think I've developed a philosophy that nothing is good or bad it's all about perspective. (Now obviously I don't SUPPORT these crimes but I just don't morally FEEL anything about them)

407,"So, for some context, I need to make it very clear that I was marketed this product from the get go as a long term hairstyle. I made the choice to go from brown to pink, and when I called up the salon they did nothing to clearly state that this was a semi-permanent dye. They didn’t explicitly tell me it was permanent, and I know I maybe should have researched this, but it’s a salon I’ve gone to before for cuts and I trusted the stylists here.
It’s my first big hairdressing move, and what I thought would be a long term fade over maybe two or three months has now left me with borderline peach hair two weeks later. And I don’t know what to do. The salon director is insinuating that it’s my fault, that I have to keep on top of the colour and I really should have known this is semi-perm.
The real kicker is that I’m a student. I have a part time job and loans and this was meant to be a treat for myself, a long-lasting treat, a splurge that wasn’t actually a splurge because I would have this awesome colour hair for a quarter of a year. In short, I cannot afford to go to a salon ever two weeks and spend another £100 to keep my hair pink.
I really don’t know what to do here, and any advice would be nice. How do I deal with the salon?

412,"So, I (15M) met a person (17M) on a chatting website(Discord). And after a month or 2 of conversations, I felt like I could trust him with alot of stuff, including my gender insecurities. Which caused me to grow more attached and start kinda developing feelings. After alot of talking, and ""dirty talking"" he turned 18. At this point I introduced him to alot of my friends (who doesnt know about my gender insecurities and my feelings) but I felt weird, talking sexually with a 18 year old. So I started backing away, and eventually I told him that we shouldnt talk like that, and I'd appreciate if he didnt show anyone screenshots of our messages, and the stuff I'm sensitive with sharing. Come to find out he shared alot of screenshots and the secrets I told him to one of my closest friends, and completely violated my trust. Me and her got mad at him, and he left the server we all talked in (including friends). No one knows why besides me and my closest friend, should I tell them why?

415,"Buckle up.

I'm a 41M stepdad to a great special needs kid who goes to a wonderful but expensive therapeutic school.

I help co parent from time to time along with the bio dad 44M and mom 37F.  

The new school year is upon us, and so is the tuition down payment. Unfortunately for me, the person who was supposed to pay it, bio dad, has conveniently become broke just before it is due and told nobody.  Mom has no assets, and she would go to extreme lengths to keep her son 16M going as it has made wonders happen in stepson's life.

Also unfortunately, we have just moved households, and money is tight here but I think I can swing the bill. I told mom, my wife, that i
I will make sure the bill gets paid.

Here's the thing. Bio dad has lived his life constantly in a state of poverty because he is such a shitty planner and doesn't seem to see the impact it has on people.  I don't see this trend changing. 

All things considered I'm glad I can make this disaster stop.  HOWEVER, I am also EXTREMELY mad that I've been put in this position because the deal is, we keep the kids fed and cared for, and the Dad is supposed to keep the school tuition paid.

I want to make sure that this pattern stops with bio dad. He's a bit of an idiot, terrible at budgeting (obviously) but also seemingly a bit on the spectrum with his perceptions. He struggles with keeping jobs, and just at being a human in general.

There are many mitigating circumstances I won't get into about his behavior, but all the same, he has essentially failed to plan around this known and very important payment. He can be a hoarder (ok, he collects a lot of things).  What do I do to get this guy's attention and keep this from happening again?  He generally has a great attitude and co parents well otherwise. He is a jovial personality but CLUELESS with money and not aware of the impact of his actions. 

What do I do, I want this to stop!!! TIA",18Aug2020,1

418,"I have been with my partner for a year and a half now. At first his mother was nice and treated me like a daughter. I felt welcomed into her family. However, a year and a half later she's ruining my relationship. She's controlling and manipulative. She controlled my partners money, preventing him from accessing it and viewing the amount and what it's being used for... I've recently helped him to open his own bank account, as i feel that this is a necessity, and that he is entitled to the money that he works hard for. The money that is in the the account she controls hasn't been given to him (I think that it may be a case of her no longer having that money...). This whole predicament has brought out her nasty side, from telling people close to me that i will never succeed in life, make it into university (even though i study my ass off), that i use her son as a booty call and many other nasty, hurtful things. I feel that for a grown woman this is unacceptable behaviour and makes me wonder what else she she is hiding from her son, or being deliberately sneaky about. Whilst i don't like the remarks she makes about my intimate life with my partner, she has absolutely no clue and it isn't her business, to say something about it to me is one thing, to say it to my family is crossing a line. She also mentioned that she doesn't want us to move to a location of our choice and that she would prefer us to move in to a house in close proximity to hers, while her son works in a job he has no interest in pursuing long-term, much to her dismay im sure. In addition to this i believe her behaviour towards him to be absolutely appalling, the language she uses towards him, and the constant yelling and screaming. This combined with negative talk, such as, telling him he'll never hold a full time job, or last at anything, be successful etc. 

Has anyone else had trouble with a controlling MIL like this, and how did you deal with it?

Thank you x",18Aug2020,1
419,"So a couple weeks ago I was 36 weeks pregnant with my son, On this day, my husband had left at 8 am and took our two younger children to his parents house and my step daughter had already left for the day, to get her senior class schedule and do a few other things done for the school year'

I was home alone when all of a sudden I went into labour, I had been cleaning the kids bathroom, when I realised I thought I only needed to use the toilet, I felt a lot of pressure and when I looked down My babies feet were hanging out, I managed to move onto the floor and then realised I was bleeding out, I couldn't move I had to literally scream for help hoping a neighbour or a passerby would notice.

I don't know how long I was on the floor for but it felt like hours, but after awhile I heard the front door open then close and I screamed out, My step daughter ran upstairs to find me on the bathroom floor, she went to get some towels and grabbed her phone to call 911. I knew she was actually terrified and had to grab her hand to give her reassurance. The operator on the phone pretty much told her she had to deliver the baby herself until the ambulance got there.

She followed everything the operator and delivered my baby boy, when My baby was out he wasn't breathing so she pretty much tore the bathroom apart looking for a nasal aspirator, by the time she got the baby to breathe again, the ems had arrived, where both me and baby were taken to the hospital. Later on when my husband arrived at the hospital the doctor told them if my step daughter hadn't come home when she did, Both me and the baby would have died.

Even after both me and my baby were able to come home, my husband hadn't been able to take off time yet so my step daughter took it upon herself to cancel all plans with her friends, and look after the kids while I rested,cooked dinner and cleaned the house as well.

That and on top of all that has literally been my rock, In all honesty these 3 weeks I have gotten to know her more than in the 11 years I have been her stepmom. I have never been for thankful for what she has done.

I mentioned to my husband last night I feel like she needs a gift or something to show her thankful for what she has done. Neither of us can think of anything though.. any ideas?",18Aug2020,1

426,"I've been struggling with my feelings for a girl for quite some time now. She's part of a group of friends and I've had a thing for her pretty much since the day I met her. 

We get along quite well and at first we were both seeing different people, so telling wasn't an option because we were both happy with our respective partners at the time. But we've both been single a while now and are currently looking for dating opportunities (as much as one can during the pandemic).

The fear of rejection is one reason I have long decided to not tell her, but not the main issue. I have been rejected before and it's a part of life, it sucks but I'll get over it. I'm mostly worried about getting rejected and that affecting the group dynamic. I don't want things to become weird or awkward when we meet up as a group. I have always valued the friendship and how much fun we can have as a group above my own wants/needs in this particular scenario, feeling it was best to just let it go and hope it would fade away.  

But in the last two weeks I have come to the realisation that perhaps I do need to know. With Corona being somewhat stable in my country, and us being able to do some social activities again, I've been trying dating apps again with some very mild succes. I had a date with a girl, who was lovely and she was all for a second date. Now initially I was too, but then the doubt started, I wondered why I was suddenly reluctant to go on a second date. 

I found it would be unfair to the girl because I wouldn't be 100% in it, because in the back of my head I'd much rather be with the aforemetioned crush and that the possibility will always linger if I don't make my feelings known. But the only option for making my feelings known right now (should u decide to do that) are via text, which makes it even harder, because I cannot think of way to do that without putting pressure on her.

It's a bit of pickle and don't really have anyone to talk to about this is an unbiased way.

So any advice or thoughts are much appreciated.",18Aug2020,1

429,"i already posted this kinda, but it needed some rephrasing. 

whenever i get sad or cry i can’t help but think that there’s people that have real things and real issues for them to be upset about. it makes me feel like i’m upset for no reason because what i cry over isn’t even a big deal. and i don’t really have any valid reason to be upset at all because people have it worse.

i’m really not trying to make this about me, i’m sorry if it comes off that way.

431,"For context my dad has always been (at least in my lifetime) a selfish, mean-spirited compulsive liar, but most of his emotional abuse was focused towards my mom, and not towards my sibling and I.  Now, I am still afraid of making him upset, because he does have a very short fuse, and although he doesn’t blow up as badly with me if I make him upset, it still scares me a lot and stresses me out.  He is working from home because of COVID, and I have never actually spent this much time with him in the house before.  He would typically be at work most of the day, and once he got home he would essentially eat and go to sleep.  The longest vacation from work he’s ever took was probably a month, maybe a month and a half, so that’s literally the longest time (before now) that I’ve had to deal with him being home.

My dad is fine with me on the surface, he cracks jokes, tells me funny stories, and he does provide for me financially and does get me what I need for hobbies and interests that I have, even if it’s expensive (he still guilt trips me for it and makes me feel bad, but at least I still get what I need).  The best way I can sum up his typical demeanor (how he is with me and with strangers, not how he is with my mom.  AKA his “normal” demeanor) is very sarcastic with dark and/or seemingly mean spirited jokes, but sometimes you’re not sure if he’s actually being sarcastic, or if he’s serious.  He is serious about things more than one would think.  Truthfully, I don’t talk with him very much, because he did always used to be at work, and just him being in the room makes me anxious.  I’m always terrified of making him angry, so I opt to just not interact with him as much as possible, and if I have to then I am all smiles and light-hearted, so I minimize my chances of passing him off.

Anyway, lately we have been discussing a big purchase that affects the entire family.  Of course, you would expect me, the child, not to be involved much in this, but he is only discussing it with me, and not my mom.  More context, he doesn’t talk to my mom unless he’s forced to, and he’s very nasty to her when he does.  I am updating my mom on what’s happening and what her opinions are on it, since it affects the whole family, and so she can have a say in what’s happening, since my dad is not giving her that chance.

The problem is, my dad and I don’t agree on what the best way for the family to move forward with his type of purchase (forgive me for being vague, I just don’t want anyone I know to recognize my situation).  I am preferring a route that is more modest, and makes more sense long-term (in my and my mother’s opinion) and he is wanting a very expensive, lavish way of moving forward, that makes me unsure if that will affect my future financially.  My dad cares a lot about what other people think and likes people to be jealous of him, so I worry that he is making this decision based on what is brag-worthy and not what makes sense for the family long-term.  Throughout this whole ordeal he has been giving me, what I think is, conflicting information, and today, I think he may have tried to gaslight me into saying that the expensive bit was what I had always wanted.  This didn’t work, as I know that has never EVER been what I wanted and I have made that very clear to him in many, many ways.  I just feel very panicked, because I am chronically ill, and although I am managing a lot better, I need his support for a little longer, so I can get a job and hopefully take care of myself, and I’m scared he’s not thinking this through.  I’m afraid he’s not putting the same amount of foresight into my financial future as he did with my older sibling.  I just don’t trust him, because he does lie, so I can’t take his word for it that everything will be fine.  I’m just so tired of being my parent’s liaison.  I wish he would just be civil for fifteen minutes to discuss this with my mom and not with me.  I feel manipulated and I don’t know enough information to know whether he is telling the truth about the family’s financial situation or not.  He complains about my family spending money all the time, but then turns around and says doing a huge purchase is completely fine.  I feel manipulated and I don’t know what to do.  And if the decision goes badly it’ll probably somehow be my fault, because it’s “what I wanted”. 

I’d also like to note that my father has plenty of mid-life-crisis toys, (that he bought without telling anybody, by the way), so this is not a man who needs more brag-worthy things in his life.  He has plenty of nice things, so I don’t like how he complains about me and the rest of my family spending money on normal, everyday things, while he has a ton of luxury items.  It makes me so confused as to whether the family is tight on money or not.  Sorry if this is confusing, I’m really confused right now.

433,"So basically me and my friend play games together and my computer has been suffering from terrible connection problems and input lag. I asked my friend for help and he offered to help me start with a brand new, fresh OS installation and to optimize my PC for gaming. We spent about 3 hours doing it, he explained everything he was doing in detail and how it would help. After he was done, it was a night and day difference. I was extremely happy with it, but there was a slight issue the next day. One of my games wouldn't run for some reason. He was asleep during this time and I stupidly decided to reinstall it again so my program would be fixed.

He also informed me that that particular issue required a 5 second fix, which made me feel even stupider. So what do I do? I feel really bad, I wish I didn't do it. Is he being unrealistic?

437,"So I recently started a discord server with a friend. The server over the summer has gained momentum with a combination of streaming and many people not having jobs over the summer. In the creation of the server there were to us [26F] and [26M] along with a [15F] who joined due to a game of similar interest. The idea for the server was a place people can have fun.


Recently the 15F has become very toxic. Which is part of gaming, but to the point where people are getting uncomfortable. Whenever someone says they like something, she needs to insert herself and say she doesn't. If a group of us play a game together, she will be extremely negative and mean. She makes jokes about suicide, is very manipulative and hurtful.


I would point those out to her. I started to play with her less and less since it was making me uncomfortable and hoped that I just needed a break. However it continued. She will ping us in chat to play with her and then if no one comes or responds she will say ""no one loves me"" and so forth. Very manipulative language. To the point I had others coming to me who were concerned.


Im aware of her home life and I understand that it is not ideal. I have let her know multiple times if she needs to talk or help finding resources i will do so. I also have contact with her of age older sister and go to her with things that concern me about the 15F. 


Today myself [26F] and [26M] talked to her about what has been going on. Making it clear that we are concerned for her mental health, but her behavior has been very unacceptable and that it needs to change. As expected she said she'd leave and we made it clear that wasn't what we desired from this conversation. We are concerned about her but we can't allow this type of behavior in chat, its effecting everyone. 


Part of me wanted to talk to her about it because its a important lesson that we may have things going on in our personal life but we cannot take it out on those around us. I hope that a gentle but firm approach would allow her to see that, but ultimately I know I am not in charge of other peoples mental health nor should I be the punching bag for it. If this behaviour came from someone else in the server they would get a warning and then kicked. 


She never responded to my last message, but i made it clear that we would like her to stay and we can help her find resources, but we would like to see a change in behaviour. I just worry that I didn't handle this situation correctly. I dont want to cause her more pain but I also don't want to allow toxic behavior to be seen as okay within the server.

448,"My friend is an absolute guardian angel for any kind of animal. She saves insects from puddles, gathers sick and lonely kittens from the street and cares for them until they find a loving home, helps dog owners to resocialize their best friends, builds save environments for hedgehogs, bugs,... And the list even goes on.

For some time she has been observing a new ""dog trainer"", as he calls himself. At first it looks like a normal training session, but if you look closer you'll see that he uses a thin clothes line instead of a leash.
The cruelty begins here, cause he uses it as an infinite choke collar. Even when he trains puppies and they just sniff a little bit off the way he will pull them upwards for so much they basically hang on the gibbet. He does this for seconds or even a minute.
Using this kind of infinite choker is actually forbidden where we live, but he doesn't seem to mind that OR the fact that he hurts the animals.

My friend has researched how to help these poor dogs and asked shelters and societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals for help with the same result everywhere: she has to bring charges on her own.

She would have done so long ago, but this so called trainer is also pretty aggressive and sadly good with words.
He has a history of threatening people and apparently he has been accused before, but talked his way out of it and sometimes even charging the people who said anything. 

So my friend is scared that he might ruin her life and the life of her family even IF she could charge him successfully if he finds out it was her.

I know he's a great guy who loves and respects me but he's very different from the type i usually go for, the bad boys.""Mr Nice Guy""is the polar opposite of my ex boyfriend of one year who was really over possessive and obsessive. The kinda guy who would get jealous very easily and the kinda guy the other guys would be scared of(the type i like). I've been trying really hard to develop feelings for Mr Nice Guy because i know ill never find anyone who is going to love me that much but i can't. It's so hard. At times he's really serious, at times i think he will never be able to commit and that he cant be a good significant other like my ex. Things were always easy with him. It was easy to be with him and to like him. i cant help but compare him to my ex. I know that is wrong because every guy is different and im being unfair to him. I dont know if its because he's not my type or if i need time to get over my ex. ( its been 6 months since we broke up) Should i wait to see if ill be able to develop feelings for him or is it just a terrible idea?",18Aug2020,1

452,"currently my brother (B) and me [F, 15] are on holiday with our dad (D) and his girlfriend (GF). we are staying with her family (her mum and sister, with other family close by). it's the first time we've been on holiday with GF and we have had some issues in the past with them whispering about us even though we are still in earshot, and saying bad things directly targeting (especially my brother) what we are doing or how we look etc. they have quarantined together in Ds flat and we have been staying with them every couple of weeks, and it's mostly been ok apart from one big falling out between me and D. (D can be very difficult and the main issue is him not being able to be wrong or hear a different opinion, or have things happen in a different way than he wants. he also has a habit of swearing at us which he says is a joke, but doesn't sound joking and is actually quite hurtful.)

whilst we've been on holiday, we met GFs other family at one of their houses and i had to take some fresh air becasue i started crying (i have some issues regarding my body) and D went out to comfort me. i told him the basic problem and how supportive my mum is being and trying to help me feel better about myself. now i hear that GF told all her family that were there that my mum called me fat and told me to not eat as much and that's why i was crying... excuse me?!?! my mum is so supportive and my best friend, why would she ever say anything like that to me??? D obviously shared something that i asked him to keep private, and what i said has been twisted to make my mum seem bad.

the other day i went shopping with GFs younger sister (about my age) and it was just us two, while B went with D and GF into the closest town. when we all met up again i noticed B looking very upset and annoyed, which i know is either after something annoying has happened or somebody has said something negative to him. i find out that as a joke B had asked for sweets on their way out of the supermarket, and GF proceeded to call him a spoilt brat (with D there) and it not being a joke.

D and GF also have a big thing about talking about B in relation to his body and snacking, as B used to snack a lot but now mum and i are helping him to be healthier, so those two things aren't really and issue anymore. but D and GF always say things like 'look, he's going to the kitchen to stuff his face again' when he's getting a drink, or telling him not to get a snack 'because you've already filled up on sweets and not real food'. these comments make my brother feel terrible, and very angry. 

lastly, the issue with the whispering has now also been targeted at GFs younger sister. her and B could hear D and GF saying that GFs younger sister was jealous and lonely (they didn't hear the whole conversation so they don't know why), talking about GFs other sisters amd family rudely and that my mum is trying to ruin the holiday and that she uses fear against us to get what she wants (for clarification, these things aren't true). 

i usually tell my mum everything, and i have spoken to her about the whispering and stuff concerning B and i, but i am not going to tell her the stuff that's been said about her as it will upset her greatly and i don't want to ruin the friendship that her and D still have. but i am beyond livid abput the fact that 1. my mum is being talked about badly in the first place 2. that the false things that have been said about her have been shared with other members of GFs family. i have asked that GFs younger sister clarify after we've left that my mum would never say anything like that to her kids and that i was not crying for any reason regarding my mum. i really want to confront them and put them in their place, but i know that i will end up being lectured by D and GF won't ever disagree with him. 

i am extremely upset and angry at both of them, and i don't know what to do. i don't know whether to confront them or to wait until we get home to talk with them with my mum present so it doesn't cause a massive argument or to not say anything.",18Aug2020,1

454,"So basically 1½ years ago I stupidly lent an ex-partner/ex-friend some money to cover some medical costs (about £600/$800). There was no legal agreement about the loan (yes I was stupid, I thought I was doing a nice thing) but I have bank transfer records. Despite discussing incremental payments a few months ago, he has been completely silent about it. A couple of days ago I messaged him about it (politely and calmly I might add) and he responded extremely angrily. 

His response was so furious that I'm less worried about the money now and more about my safety. He didn't threaten anything but he swore a lot in his messages and I'm worried what he'd do if he sees me. We're from the same small hometown at the moment and I think he's back here too, at the moment. I have generalised anxiety disorder which this worry has been playing on and I'm having nightmares about it. 

Does anyone have any tips on how to keep myself safe? Or at least make myself feel a bit more safe. I'm in the UK so can't really (and don't want to) own a gun, plus that feels a bit extreme cause I think I'm probably overreacting anyway. Thanks in advance",18Aug2020,1

He has said and done many mean things to me as a friend over the years of knowing him and behaved in such a manor where he wouldn't own up to his mistakes or lie about them to try and look like the saint. 

And I am partly saddened by the fact he has more followers then me, gets more likes then me and now gets his birthday remembered unlike my fiasco last year. I am purely frustrated by all of the rude things he has done to me just for him to continue living on an amazing life. I have spent so long trying to prove my worth to him only to realize he had been treating me toxic.

459,"This year has been the worst year of my life and I am unsure how to move forward. First I would like to say that I only just turned 21 and I’m in college. I know this year has been rough for everyone but this year has been especially devastating for me. 

First, my mother had a massive heart attack in February. They sedated her and she had other complications that required surgery but her heart was too weak so they gave us the option to let her go. I watched her die. 

Second, COVID took my only last living grandparent in March. My grandma, who I hadn’t seen since before my mother passed away because her retirement home shut down, was all alone in a nursing home when we got the call that she had COVID. She died alone. 

Third, I was just made aware that one of my closest friends in college passed away. She took her own life. I’m shocked and overwhelmed. I slightly feel like it’s my fault because the night before she asked me if I could come get her because she was fighting with her roommate. I usually do help her—this was just the wrong time as I was dealing with personal relationship issues with my boyfriend and I told her that I would help her the following day. She never responded. I feel personally responsible for her death even though I know it’s not my fault. I could have never known this would happen. Or that’s what everyone says. 

Since my school is mostly online I have no motivation anymore. I stay awake all night thinking I’m bad luck or that maybe I deserve these things. I have also been incredibly sad and lonely being in quarantine since March. I know i should go back to counseling but I hated the counseling that was virtual which is part of the reason I stopped. The virtual therapy just wasn’t working for me; I felt like my therapist was getting relaxed with this and would often sit on the phone with me in silence. I’m just tired. I just need some guidance on what is the next step.

461,"So I'm not really sure what wisdom Reddit will be able to provide me here, but I thought I'd ask anyway.

I've somehow managed to surround myself with 3 people (my brother (28), my father (55), and my girlfriend(21)) who are simultaneously self destructive and suicidal. And that is obviously a horrible combination, as they blow things up and then slip near the point of suicide.

They are all, in my opinion, rather selfish and narcissistic. For instance, my brother will insult my mom and his wife, angrily rant at them and break things, and then proceed to victimize himself and say that he is the product of child abuse by my dad (somewhat true), that he can't deal with it all, and that he is barely capable of holding himself together and needs our support. 

My girlfriend behaves similarly. She can be crazy sometimes and very selfish at other times, doing whatever she wants to do with no regards to other peoples feelings. When I talk about ending the relationship she says that her problems are also a result of child abuse and that she will kill herself if I leave her.

Now with all three of these people but particularly my brother and  girlfriend, I actually do believe that they are suicidal. In many cases they've pushed everyone close to them away except for me, and they really rely on my support. However, it is very hard to tell if my support is keeping them from self harm, or if it is enabling their behavior. 

I come from a culture where therapy and things like that are uncommon and looked down on. So basically what should I do in this situation.

463,"Basically so if you're stalking me you know from my recent posts i am in some kind of weird relationship with a girl where we both like each other a lot romantically and physically and we talk to each other like we're dating, but technically we're just friends

Btw, i'm 15 she's 14 so yeah teen love and stuff

Basically, lately she's been pretty sad and anxious for unknown reason, she says she's overthinking things a lot and overall she's pretty nervous, plus the pandemic and school are making it worse for her.

I have the feeling it's probably because she's kinda scared to be in a relationship with me, even if we just talk online, and even if i'm okay with that, i would not like her to be anxious because of it, because she could be thinking i may not be interested in her if she acts in some way or another.

I'm not sure if that's a correct thought, but if that's the case i am trying to explain to her that i like her so much it would be pretty hard for me to even slightly think of not wanting to be with her.

If that's not the case, could you guys help me understand better what's happening, and maybe find out a way to help her? I really want her to be happy.

Also one time whenever I walked past him he tried to grab my inner thigh and I would just back away and my mom just Shrugged It Off and whenever he hugged me once I swear he tried to kiss my neck and it was the most disgusting feeling ever.

Also nobody knows his real name not even my mom or where he lives. People just call him Hawk and my mom's friend thinks he's been in jail for 17 years (he's 60 something) but we have no idea what he has been in jail for and if he raped someone or smuggled in drugs.

468,"Hello, first of all, I'm no native tongue and I'm on my phone, so sorry for any mistakes I might make.

Since I was a teen I noticed a few things. Whenever I had to do something, my muscles seem to get fatique very quick. I did weightlifting but always got the feeling my power was gone way before my friends. I didn't think much of it and it didn't realy bother me then.

Now I'm 29 and it's still like this, maybe a bit more but I'm overweight so this might be the reason too.

I noticed around 4 years ago that if something touches me for a longer period, for example arm rests from a chair. I start to feel pain, it gets worse from time to time. It's not squeezing me, I have plenty of space. It's more like if I'm sitting comfortable they touch the armrest slightly. The pain stays even if I move away. Even the next day if my gf or me touches my leg at the point it realy hurts. Not just a little. A lot. I can't realy stand it.

471,"So to give you the full picture, I've 3 brothers, we'll call them M, AA and J. J and AA are my older brothers, and M is my younger.

My only full brother is AA, as M and J both have different parents.

So to start things off, well before I was born my mother had 2 relationships, both ended up being verbally abusive to her, cheating and in time abandoning her, I was 8 months old when my biological dad left, and my brother only 2 years (AA)

From what I know, my mother also went through trauma via her father sexually abusing her when she was younger and the rest of my family (she has 2 sisters and 1 brother, including her mum) swept it under the rug since he was himself mentally unstable and that's just what my family does apparently, leaving my mother to deal with it alone, and pretending like nothing happened.

So, my childhood was... Relatively normal, I can't remember much of it now at 22, but I do know she did her best to give me, AA and J a good childhood. That was until she met M's father.

They hadn't been dating long before she ended up pregnant by him and he seemed like just a regular decent guy, who was crazy about his motorbikes and loved to go out riding and hanging with other bikers. He had 2 daughters of his own and they were just a regular normal family, although he didn't have much to do with their lives other than sending them money and taking them shopping. 

To make this shorter I'll just sort of cut through the prime events that happened during their relationship

-M is born

-We all move to a different village far away to avoid her weird family

-Mum gets a heart condition leading to numerous heart attack, and 2 strokes

-M's dad gets more abusive, threatening, shouting and the relationship between him and my mum is falling apart

-M's dad becomes increasingly violent to my mum pinning her down and screaming at her

-Mum doesn't call the police until one day when he attempted to murder her with the phone wire.

-Nothing comes from them doing this as my mother tries to avoid any court systems and things like that as she's agoraphobic, and just wants to move on with life keeping us happy and safe (sweeping it all under the rug)

-Myself and AA enter highschool, constantly being bullied and being outcasts as we didn't really know how to socialize with others

-My mother starts to party with J's friends, staying up until 2 AM, kissing his younger mates and leaving us in the house while she goes out to drink

-J and mother have a huge argument, he leaves home

-Mother stops partying and makes the decision to pull myself and AA out of highschool to home tutor, only to never actually teach us and just tell us to go online and use other sources (I was in year 7, my brother in 8)

-Mother let's her agoraphobia rub off on us by reminding us how horrible the world is and how bad people are, not letting us see our very few friends in case of pedophiles or people coming to attack us

-Mother struggling with money day to day, our diets consisted of a packet of crisp and a chocolate bar.

-Mother meets a man who helps her out with money, buys her a new TV, an expensive dog and tries to get her to do things he likes

-Man ends up being manipulative and cheats on my mother

-AA comes out as gay, my mother questions it before accepting it

-Both AA and myself started suffering with suicidal thoughts and anxiety.

-AA finally snaps and leaves home arguing with my mother whom used to slit her wrists, saying how much he hated her, she always says she's done her best for us.

-Just Myself and M living at home. M has ADHD and is a bit brattish but that's because he's young and undisciplined, as my mother would give into any demand he has because she wants to be a good mum.

- Mother is diagnosed with MS and Dementia (Haven't seen any proof)

-Mum ends up getting more animals in her small home with little funds impacting even more on M's and myself as she refused to walk them, leaving only myself to do so

- My depression gets greater, never leave the house and barely leave my bed most days

-M is also pulled out of school and not actually home taught due to how poor the school treated my brother for his mental state

-House is constantly messy, until mother's family decide to bring us back to our original home town and try to get my mum sorted mentally

-I finally snap one day at my mother exclaiming at how she never gets any help around the house and how useless her kids are (I was the only one who would mop up after the dogs, do the washing and look after M)

-She tells me she wishes she never had me, I say I wish I was never her son and how my anxiety is her fault, she states all the good things she's done and tries to throw me out.

- Next day I contact J and his partner, asking them if they can come get me and help me get my life together, which they do.

- Mother ends up messaging apologizing and making out she didn't mean anything

- I finally start eating correctly, sign on so I can get some funds and rent somewhere and actually start my life as an adult

- End up meeting the love of my life whom lives in the same city as my mother, we move in together and I'm slowly getting better at being normal (can't talk to people without having a panic attack, feeling sick and wanting to just run away)

- AA ends up in an abusive relationship himself and comes home to my mum

- Try CBT Therapy but doesn't work, all while my mother is messaging asking me for funds since AA isn't working and is ""Sponging off her""

-AA moves in with my partner and I to get him out of the situation with my mother, helping him get on his feet

---TL:DR

Mentally unstable mother who was abused is over protective and makes poor decisions leading her kids to fall into depression, anxiety and self harm, with no education.

My mother well and truly believes she's done her best for us and whenever we had even mentioned anything she'd just go on a rampage about how hard her life was and show us self harm scars, she would call her animals her ""Kids"" and give them more attention and looked after them better than her own, we had the internet and computers as our only way out of this hell.

I no longer really talk to her but she's constantly trying to get back in touch, asking about me, messaging my brothers and making out I'm being ignorant, I don't know at this stage if it's best to actually throw all of it on the table and confront her, or just let the dementia and brain aneurysms do their thing and slowly take her, try to make her happy and pretend like everything is okay for my younger brothers sake?

At this point I feel so lost and I don't know what's right or wrong. My now husband to be is so supportive and without him I doubt I'd even be here, he seems to think I should just ignore my family and focus on what we have now, leave the past behind and cut her out",18Aug2020,1

477,"To begin with while my parents were out, a letter had been posted to my house the letter was not sealed so it was open (you can see the content inside). Inside contained two pairs of underwear which looks clean and quite new but the private area seemed a little discoloured. Immediately I was shocked but noticed that the letter was abit strange, as the name and address was written on a sticky note then taped tightly to the center of the letter. The letter was stamped so was not mailed directly by the sender. At the back of the sticky note it wrote “D Red, White x”, this corresponded with the lacy underwear colour.

I don’t know what to do as it’s not possible to just talk with my parents about it. As my dad is very anti social quiet person with some temper problems. My relationship with him is not normal we never talk casually, just when he needs help translating or things such as car insurance renewal, what to eat etc. My mum is the opposite very kind, very likeable and sociable. She a lot of times have been shouted at by my dad over stupid little things and honestly the events she has been through any woman would have divorced. 

But we are in Europe (originally from asia) and my mum does not have any qualifications. My dad is not the typical husband, very unromantic and has never said happy bday to my mum ( does celebrate with her though). She has accepted that this marriage is almost like friend like. Furthermore, she’s prefer not to separate because of my and my younger siblings education. And complications regarding shared assets etc. My dad is very hardworking at his job and my mum helps him. My mum has a way of holding conversations with him really well.

More about my dad is that I have seen in his history he frequents lingerie sites but to see models in them (sexual arousal probably he is not aware of internet porn). I have seen these last few days he looked at a parcel delivery service. The thing is he’s not stupid why would he have female underwear mailed to our address with his name? It’s so strange but we have had a scan letter addressed to his name 1-2 yrs ago. 

Is this some sort of sick prank please give me some advice. There’s no way he’d cheat as he has to work all the time to maintain the business and furthermore his super closed anti social person.

480,"They make me feel dumb because I am dumb and I feel like I don't understand alot and can't hold conversations at all..

I can't relate to people on television.. I can relate to smart people on television in the way that they for the most part are ""real"" and introverted and reserved and that is what I am - and that they mostly ""can't have fun"" because they are always so serious and smart - that's me except the smart part.
I can also relate to the dumb people on television but only for the reasons that they are dumb. For the most part the ""dumb"" people are always fun and having fun and are social and everything but that not me.. I have all the bad qualities of these people.. And I who watch movies and series all the time think it's hard to relate to people and it makes me feel like I'm not human.. I can't have a role model cause no one is like me.. (in the bad way because nobody in their right minds would wanna be me)

But yeah I can't hold conversations.. I can only be with my friends when we are all together.. Onterwise it becomes awkward because no personality matches with mine either

When I'm with my friends they think I'm the ""normal"" person because they are fun and weird and says weird things and all that..
That makes me feel like I am more like my parents because they are normal but when I'm with them I'm the ""weird"" one..

So you see the problem here? I can't get along with anyone because my personality doesn't match anyone else's.. I don't even know who I am anymore.. I am no one.. I am.. Me.. In a bad way..

I will try harder in school now so I can become smarter but it still doesn't matter because yea idk.. I still feel so fkn stupid and I hate that i don't have anyone that I can actually hold conversations with.. It's only on very rare occasions I can..

There is NO ONE like me..

483,"Hello.

Um, this is really weird for me to say but I am really wondering about this. 

So,,,when I was younger. Maybe 8 or 9, I saw a show/documentary about crimes and laws and stuff. I saw a small clip of an acting of two people playing out the r*pe of a minor (they did NOT act the r*pe out! just the beginning of the guy kind of approaching the girl). 

As a young kid, I didn’t know how to feel. Then the thought of the whole process just came to mind. At the time, I didn’t know what I was doing, but now I realised I was touching myself in a not-so-pure way to it. It was like my way of feeling fear? 

I swear had no ill intentions about it... 

I was wondering if I would get into legal trouble for this? As I am a Catholic so I want to confess it to the church but you know, at the same time I am conflicted whether or not this was not allowed.",18Aug2020,1

486,"Her mum, in my opinion is abusive. There have been a number of occasions in which I've felt that she's been manipulative and spiteful towards gf. Their house is a mess, due to her mums hoarding she is currently sharing a three bedroom house (including the living room in bedrooms since that's what they use it as) with 5 other people a dog and three cats. 

Gfs happiness and college are number 1 priority but, as far as I can see based on what I've seen and what I've been told by her she hates it there. She's miserable. Gfs mum guilts her into feeling awful for not being home whenever shes been out in the past to the point that on two occasions she considered quitting college so she could be at home. Due to her course being so heavily coursework based it requires a lot of work to be done outside lessons. And because of the state the house is in and her mum's ignorance to the fact that her daughter is in full time education and needs to be working every day on college work she can't do her college work at home. Instead she commutes to the college so she can use computers there with software she needs. These are HUGE worries of mine and I'm really concerned that she's being manipulated by her mum (as she has done before) into staying there. 

The idea of getting a job had been spoken about before, we said she needed to get one so she can save up and move out. But since talking about this she left home at beginning of lockdown and given circumstances stayed here for 4 months, to the end of which my parents said that she is welcome to stay for as long as she wants even if that means to the end of your college course... So this means she no longer needs to save up the money to leave. She can leave without the money. Additionally, her mum wastes all of her money on weed and tobacco, god knows how much she must spend a week on that stuff. I'm guessing probably 35 a week? This wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't for her paranoid and irrational behaviour as well as the fact that she can't afford to put proper food on the table. My gf more often than not has to buy groceries as well as cook for all 6 of them and clear up after them. It is ridiculous. Her mum owes her over £700 for groceries. Since her grandmother passed and gave some of her inheritance to gf her mum as taken advantage of this. Gf does not have any of those savings left. So even if she does get a job I'm really worried the money she'd make wouldn't even be kept for herself but instead taken by her mum or stolen as she has done at least once to my knowledge. 

But her friend has mentioned that there's a couple places where she lives that need people to work there and she's wanting to hand in a CV today. However I feel that this is a really bad decision. It's going to further chain her to that house which in the past she's been so desperate to escape from .

487,"So a while back, my girlfriend (now ex girlfriend) was at her friends house and this guy had cam over. Throughout the night this guy touched her and made uncomfortable advances that she did not like, hover at the time, she was way too shy to speak up. 

Years pass and we’re always hating on this guy. We dated a total of four years and throughout that time she knew how much I hate this guy. He had basically touched her in appropriately without her consent and I just wasn’t about that. 

About a month or two ago, we finally broke up. We stayed on good terms but things have just been really different since then. 

Yesterday I find out from a friend that he had talked to the guy you had done that to her years ago. They were talking about how we had beef and then the guy brings up pictures of himself and my ex skinny dipping. He says “the beefs over now” as if he was toting her as some sort of trophy. My friend, being the good friend he is, texts me about this and I get really upset. I call her and ask if it’s true and I tell her that the guy is showing people the pictures of them. Naturally she seems upset and all that but I just don’t know. I feel so weird right now and I know I shouldn’t because she’s not my girl anymore. But at the same time, this guy had molested her before, and she knows how much I hate him. I sort of feel betrayed but I know I shouldn’t. I’m also talking to this new girl who is super sweet, but after finding out about this, I know I’m not over my ex and I just don’t know what to do.

We got into fights over chores and my mum basically said seeing us fighting hurts her more and she doesn’t mind cleaning up after her children so what’s the big deal. 

I wish I’m a bigger person than this. That I don’t get bitter but I do. If I continue to help he’d just continue to not learn.

494,"*Around December my best friend and I stopped talking. I never knew she stopped talking to me, I asked what I did wrong so I could at least know that. She didn't respond but she saw the message. About a month ago after our mutual friend J asked what was up between me and her, we started talking to each other again. Two days ago when M,J,and I were talking about the drama she's started I found out that she was talking shit about me almost every day to our other friends. She continuously said to our other friends that she didn't care about me and said a bunch of other mean things, J and M knew about it but didn't want to tell me. I thought me and A (my best friend) were really close and she would never do that to me, we looked alike and acted the same. For the most part, we had the same interests, and like never had an argument in the past 2 years I knew her. I feel betrayed and upset since that was going on for months and no one ever bothered to tell me, they had so many opportunities to.*

 *I also lost my friend group due to not being in the group chat we made (I was kicked out of it and was never added back) even though I knew a majority of them longer than her, so I was basically lonely and had no one to talk to during those few months. If I'm being honest, I really needed them during those months, I just wanted to be able to talk to some people about how my life was changing so quickly. During those months both my bettas and my sister's pet fish died, I was told some really traumatic news and felt awful about not being able to help, and had to stay at my Uncle and Aunt's apartment with my sister to be safe and process this right. I was really worried about how my grades would change due to the fact that I didn't have some school supplies, thankfully my grades went up instead of down.*

*So my question is, what do I do? Do I cut her off? If so, how do I do it? I'm not one for confrontation. To be honest I'm not sure if she's still talking shit about me. I'm glad my friends eventually told me what she was doing. I can't exactly get better friends since I'm doing online school which means I won't really be able to interact with different students that much.*",18Aug2020,1
495,"Hi

(Already posted to /r/legaladviceUK)

Apologise for terrible writing and formatting. I am a bit stressed atm.

So  basically my girlfriend lives in a room in a big share house in England  (I  live an hour and half or so away). A few months ago a new tenant,  this  older man (around 50) moved in.

Let's call him Raj.

While  he started out being pleasant in the months following Raj would  act  weird in different ways. He would make up excuses to ""lure"" other   tenants out of their room. Once he called my girlfriend on the number   she gave him ""for emergencies"" and pretended to not know where the   remote was so she would come down and help him (it was right there on   the carpet in front of the TV). Stuff like this happened several times   so my gf just started ignoring his texts and calls, he once even asked   her out to a a cafe with him.

(Now keep in mind she is a 22 year old clearly fairly timid young girl and he's an old man)

Meanwhile  the other housemates noticed similar strange behaviour (it  seems he  tried to ""trick"" people into coming out of their rooms too) and   somebody confronted Raj about it, this only made things hostile between   him and the rest of the people in the house.

It  quickly became apparent that Raj was an alcoholic that basically  spent  all his time drunk and as time went on he grew outright abusive.  He  once yelled at my girlfriend for telling him he was putting garbage  in  the wrong bin and after being called out for that called another of  the  housemates ""fucking bitch"" when she greeted him in the morning (he  was  drunk). Apparently he also once told some of the guys in the house   that he was going to kill them.

At  this point everyone was tired of his shit and the police and the   landlord was contacted. The police opened an investigation into his   threatening behaviour that we haven't heard much about since, however   the landlord talked to Raj and made him move out. Which he did a couple   weeks ago

So all well and good yeah?

No,  a few days ago my gf gets a call from Raj that she doesn't  answer,  then he sends her an email where he apologises for leaving  without  saying goodbye (????) before ending it with a creepy ""I am still  in the  area if you wanna talk"" (Why ever would she want that?)

Well  she ignores that too and few more days ago by with nothing.  However  this morning I shit you not, as my girlfriend is walking to work  he  comes up to her and the end of her street and says he ""wanted to   apologise in person (again not for being creepy or for yelling at her   but for leaving without saying goodbye)"" before ASKING HER WHEN SHE GETS   OFF WORK?! She, shocked, lies and says she has a long afternoon of   meetings before hurrying off.

This  is essentially where we are now. She is calling the police today  from  work but I'm unsure what they will be able to do, last time they   weren't off much help.

Has he done  anything that amounts to harassment? Is there anything  else she can  do? This creep knows where she lives, knows where she works  and seems  out of his mind.

I know she  definitely should have been firmer with him from the start  and by now  told him to please let her be, but as I mentioned she is  very agreeable  and fairly timid. I've tried to make her work on this but  it's clearly  a WIP. However could she have been any clearer ignoring  both his email  and his call?

Also I'm currently out of the UK visiting my home country so I'm feeling kinda powerless over here.

Another few fun facts about Raj

* He  moved to my GF's town because his ex wife and pregnant 18 yo  daugther  lives there. But apparently they don't want to meet him. His son however has supposedly met with him.
* He apparently uses several different names, and gets mail delivered for other very different names.
* When  they first talked to the police about him there was  something about  none of his names being in a registry or whatever, don't  know what was  all about so that's just a side point.

I also got this (maybe crazy) idea to message his ex wife on facebook, explain the situation and ask if he's in any way dangerous. But I'd feel bad dragging her into it in any way.

Appreciate any help.",18Aug2020,1

So me and my friend have been best friends since elementary school. 1st grade I believe. We were college roommates for 2/4 years. A little over a month ago I got extremely sick. I was honestly terrified seeing as we are in the middle of a pandemic where people are literally dying and I and live alone where I often was waking up unable to breathe. She knew I was sick bc I let my 2 bffs know in a group chat as I’d spent the 2 days before I woke up sick hanging out with them. 

I genuinely thought I had covid so i quarantined while i waited for my test results. said bff continued hanging out with my other bffs 3 MONTH OLD BABY as if I didn’t just tell her she might have contracted the virus from me. i said something very politely and expressed how i was concerned i’d have to bear the guilt should something happen to the baby because of their actions. i understand it wouldn’t be my fault but i know deep down they’d blame me. she ignored me completely. no response. in fact not only did she ignore my text, but she responded to my other bff in the chat and said “on my way”. i then texted again i’m the morning stating how i felt hurt and disrespected that they would ignore and brush off my feelings like that. no response.

over the next few days she barely responded in the group chat. i got my test results back and turns out it was pneumonia, not covid (not that thats much better but i felt relieved). not once did my BEST friend check on me and ask if i’m ok or if i need anything as i was stuck at home for a week unable to leave. that upsets me. i unfriended her on social media because honestly it’d been 2 weeks of not speaking and i felt she doesn’t deserve to know what’s going on in my life. she deleted me back and we haven’t spoken since. it’s been over a month.

i’m kinda sad about it but also what the fuck? every time i express myself it’s a fight. no matter how nice and sympathetic i am about it. i even made sure to sound extra understanding when i expressed how i felt about them going around the baby bc i knew she’d somehow make me feel like i was being unreasonable and attacking her. i feel like because of that, the friendship isn’t even worth saving.. Who gets so mad at someone for expressing themselves that they don’t speak for months???? Was I childish to unfriend her? Maybe. But it was draining to keep seeing her view my stories of me saying how miserable i am and how i need things but can’t leave and not.... asking to help.... or if i’m ok.... as my BEST friend.",18Aug2020,1

507,"8 years ago I (F18) was stalked by a guy (27). We did the same major in universty and studied together sometimes. He wanted more than I did. I try to stop the contact after sometime, because I started to feel uncomfortable around him. For example, he would rage at me for walking with shoes inside his home. The last time I was at this place I had the feeling: if I stay here I'm going to get hurt. I can remember that my mind became very clear and I just knew excatly what I needed to do. I was able to get my bag and put my shoes on very fast. I run down the stairs in the complex. When I was outside I called a friend and put my mobile on the ground, so if he would go after me someone could hear it, because I had to unlock my bike and drove to my home as fast a I could.

After this, I told him that I did not want any contact anymore. He had problems with accepting this, he would call me and text me multiple times a day. He would text that he had to pick something up at the university and that he knew that I had a lecture in there and he would come and talk to me. He texted he compliments and then he would be name calling. I did not respond to any of this.

During these months, he was also stalking his ex-girlfriend, he attacked her colleague at work. He went to jail for this, he did call me from jail

I did notify the police about the situation, I could call them and the would come immediately to me without asking questions. I did not file a declaration, because he would be escalate as had happend with his ex-girlfriend. He had a very impuslive personality. In that time I was very scared and hyperaware of my surroundings. It ended up with not being able to go outside without someone else with me, I had to check for his car if I wanted to go outside, my mum stayed in my dormroom for a few weeks and had to bring me to lectures. After 10 months he drove to the town my parents live (2-3 hour ride) and send his location via text.

The stalking last for 1 year, I think it stopped because he got a new girlfriend. In this year, I was always looking around me, I did not open the door if someone ring the doorbell, I was startled very often by noise in my home. THe years after this, I was feeling better, but I still had hypervigilance. At the uni, I was always afraid I would see him. The last two years I felt better, I had therapy. I got more confident in that I could handle the situation if he would see me and would talk to me. I was afraid that I would panick and he would see my vulerability. The last 8 years, I still got messages from social media (facebook, instagram, linkedin), but that was 1-2x a year. But never did he text my on my phone.

Last week, I got a long ext from him via my phone (not social media). He texted with new number. THat means that he took the time/energy to find my phone number somewhere. I did not respond. Then he texted again. He would tell me that he still remembers my voice and how nice I am. THat he does not know anymore why I did not want any contact with him. That he wants to have a relationship with me. I again did not respond. But I starting to feel hypervigilant again. I do sleep 4-5 hours a night, because I feel watched or I hear a sound and I will think that maybe he is trying to get into my house.

When I got the second message, I had a night shift at the university, I was the only one in that part of the building. I had the feeling that he would also walk in. He does not known which department I'm doing my research (I think). But there is a possibilty that he also has acces to this department, because he could also be doing research somewhere in the building.

I do not know If i'm overreacting. I do not understand why he texts me after 8 year. I feel unsafe. I know that he just texted me twice and he maybe will leave it with that. But I also know his history and that he can be quite impuslive/reckless. He will see me not responding as a rejection, he has trouble with that I think. I do not know if I should be afraid that he will show up at my place or work. Him texting me twice is not stalking, so I can not really say he is stalking me now. But because of 8 years ago, I feels that moment again and I feel anxious.",18Aug2020,1

513,"So me F(18) and this guy M(22) have been friends online for around 7/8 months now, we vibed pretty well from the day we started talking and we kind of *never stopped talking* since then, so of course with talking day and night you get to know a person pretty well and vice versa 

But the problem it's starting to make me a little uncomfortable, not because he knows me well i don't mind that really
But alot of times when I'm doing something that I told him about and he made some sort of joke about I'd remember him telling the joke or like when I go to play my flute I remember he's the one who pushed to start playing it again after I stopped 

You see where I'm getting at? It's like most of the day even when I'm not talking to him he's on my mind in some way or another and not in a romantic way

But at the same time the thought of losing him or us stop talking really saddens me 

I just i don't know what to do about it
Is this healthy? Is the friendship going somewhere? Would it be okay if I just stop talking to him completely now out of fear of attachment for someone I know we might lose the friendship in the future?

Also i feel I should point out but this is the closest friend I've had online And my closest male friend I have in both real life and online

514,"Im 20 years old and a Med student. I failed my Anatomy exam twice, due to mental health issues keeping me from being able to prepare properly. I have one more chance, and if I fail again, I wont be able to study medicine anymore anywhere. 

I now have the choice between taking a semester off and preparing only for this exam or continuing my studies and doing the exam next year again, but I would only have about 2 months to prepare intensively, then the rest of the 4 months I'd have to study for other stuff and could only do maybe 1 or 2 days for anatomy per week. 

The issue is, that if I took the semester off, I'd have to get a job, as I get student aid and I wouldn't get it during that time. With corona going on I'm worried I wont find anything suitable. 

I'll be really stressed this semester if I do continue, but I would kinda stay in the flow of uni life and 6 months with nothing to do but study anatomy and work a minimum wage job doesnt sound good to me either.

I'm scared I wont have enough time, but I'm also scared the in 6 months I'll be angry at myself for wasting time. 

I'm scared of becoming completely isolated. I have social anxiety among other things and meeting new people is hard for me. I would always be alone going to lectures and stuff in the year after the break (if I did it) and I think my depression would get even worse. My friends would still be there, but I would see them a lot less and I'd also have to study alone.

516," 

hi friends, I need your help. I've already posted in r/relationships but I'd like your input too.

Some backstory: I dated my ex for about 11 months before we broke up, this was for the first semester last year, and half of second semester. I met my chem lab partner, Alex, first semester and became good buds and continued to be lab partners second semester until things were moved online. Alex lives in a fairly populous city pretty far away, relevant later.

Ok, story time, buckle up.

With COVID-19 wreaking havoc, I (19F) moved from college all the way home and continued the second semester online. During quarantine my ex (18M) and I broke up, and I was reasonably sad but got over it. And after a while I started liking Alex (19M) more and more, and we kept up our friendship over the summer. We'd Zoom and watch movies or play dumb online games together. Super wholesome stuff, I know. I really loved him, like as in more than a friend. That may sound extreme, but he was, and still is, such a good match. But I was convinced that he didn't like me as more than a friend, and I tried to flirt but it always seemed to miss. So I decided to cut my losses and talk to other people and try to move on. So I sort of dated this other guy, but it didn't pan out. Then I started spending time with this other guy, Sean (20M) (who lives nearby), and we really clicked. I could just talk to him for hours and he is so sweet. He chugs that Respect Woman Juice, and so does Alex.

Alex and I were just chatting and he complimented my hair and so I told him I styled it for a date with Sean. He then said I need to tell you something, ""I was planning on asking you out once classes started again in person"". He said he didn't want to ask me out online then wait to see me for a couple of months since we wouldn't be able to travel due to COVID. He said that he understands he's put me in a weird position of choosing between himself and Sean, and he's ok with being friends if that's what I chose to do.

So my issue is deciding what to do. Alex said that if I change my mind about Sean, he would still be there to date. He said he'd also feel a little guilty if I chose him over Sean because he sprung this info on me right after my first date with Sean. I feel like this is also unfair to Sean because he's done nothing wrong and is a wonderful person to be around. But I'm worried if I stay with Sean I'll be missing out on dating Alex, and that he will move on, as he has every right to, and that I might realize I want to be with him. So fellow redditors, do I break up with Sean and date Alex? Or do I date Sean and stay friends with Alex and possibly lose him altogether? Or is there another option I don't see?

Lmk if you need more info, I know this is a lot already haha.

TL;DR: I'm stuck between my guy best friend who I liked, and still like, and a new person I recently went on a date with and have formed a good connection with. Need help figuring out what to do.

521,"I'll start this off with the truth.

I didn't take Covid-19 seriously at the start. I thought it was some overly exaggerated fad like ebola and thought of it as something that would never affect me or anyone I know.

Well, how the turn tables... 
One of the first few cases happened 5 minutes away from my house at the nearest hospital. 

All those jokes and ""it won't be that serious, cmon"" comments came to bite me and gave me a dose of reality.

So, here we are. My workplace shut down its lobby, group outings were limited, cities across the country are undergoing a wave of uncertainty and panic. 

Me and my mother are on the same page with this as we're both concerned and staying as safe as possible.

My brother along with his pregnant wife are not concerned at all. One of the most social people I know. Clearly something as silly as a population killing pandemic isn't much to scare him and his daily routines, right?

Correct. He continues to have hang outs, meetings, parties and celebrations despite the warnings and limits.

He proposed to his now wife and expected me, my mother, and my diabetic high risk step father to come to the wedding.

This created a temporary rift within the family which had several arguments regarding the safety of us, the baby, the people invited, etc.

Brother visits with his friend and they sit me down talking about how I'm taking it too seriously and how we need establish herd immunity so that the rest of society can move on. Also how I'm young and its inevitable so accept it? It was pretty much a one sided conversation where they bounced remarks back at each other and called me paranoid and ignorant. 

Fast forward to a lot of long talks and guilt tripping, me and my mother finally decide to to attend their wedding.

Wedding happens, we celebrate with distance and we move on. 

Fast forward 

My brother asks me to move in with him in his new place. Financially speaking it was less of an incentive than staying with my mother, but considering how sincere he was and how this could be a new chapter in my life, I decided to go. I also wanted to be there when his baby is born.

Some months later I've been living with them for a bit. Despite the increasing severity of the covid situation my brother has continued going out and having his events and celebrations with his pregnant wife. 

They are both unconcerned about the whole thing and are with the ""if it happens, it happens"" mentality while ""staying safe"" despite their actions contradicting.

Unfortunately, where I live, this is a common sentiment. My coworkers and clients tend to share this ""Whatever happens, will happen"" mentality and are in favor of schools reopening and masks not being required.

Throughout this me and my mother have aired on the side of caution because I'd like to think we're rational people..

Well, recently my mother threw a baby shower for my SIL. I was told this baby shower would have only a few close family and everyone would be wearing masks. 

If by few you mean 30...
And if by masks you'd mean only about 7 would wear them, sure.

It seems that throughout the months my mother has also cared less about being safe. It's fine, she can do whatever she wants with her house, her body, her parties.

Except, she shamed me for wearing a mask. She told me ""Just take it off. enjoy the party, don't be a grump, go be like the others"".

The same person I thought understood my perspective was making me feel like I was wrong for expecting what was promised. 

Well, party finishes and I'm still feeling bitter about it. Glad everyone had fun but I was left at a crossroads. Feels like everyone around me just doesn't care anymore.

For me it was never about me catching it. They usually hit me with that excuse.
""You're young, if you get it you'll survive, why worry?""

To me it was never about catching it and dying. To me it was about catching it and spreading it to those that would.

As someone with a high risk spouse I expected more from my mother.

As someone with a high risk spouse and child I expected more from my brother.

I'm just not sure what to make out of all of this. I'm just an overly paranoid guy trying to take the fun away from everyone by being too serious about this. 

I don't understand. I look at other countries and I envy how well they've handled it, how easily they've respected proper distancing and social guidelines. 

But here? not so much. Here you're seen as weird if you treat a deadly virus with any ounce of caution. I'm at a loss of what to do or how to proceed.

My family are great people, but I'm tired of having to lie about keeping myself safe when I'm constantly around people who don't. 

So, do I just submit and act like them? If I get the virus, I get it, and that's that? Why should I be the only one who cares? 

I wanna say this is pushing me away from my family but it honestly feels like I'm the one doing the pushing. Life would be easier if I was like them. So should I?

Tldr: Family can care less about covid and I'm at a loss about how to interact with them.",18Aug2020,1
523,"In my area we r still in lockdown and still in remote learning from home. My mates and I  all thought it would be funny idea to join with another Microsoft account to join our Microsoft teams meeting and accept the person in allowing them to earrape the class and play stupid sounds through a sound board to troll. One of my best mates ended up doing it in 2 of my classes and 2 of his and today he trolled his science class again for the second time and stupid me joined to accept him the instantly leave.

524,"My 15yr old son just lost one of his two closest friends a week ago. His friend was 15 as well and died in a freak accident. This has devastated my son to say the least. And it has devastated me because this young man spent more time at my house than his own. The three of them were inseparable for several years. Recently my son and the deceased had grown much closer, while their other friend had started drifting away. Needless to say, both boys are heartbroken and the friendship is strained. As a single mom, I’m struggling to process my own grief while trying to comfort my son and his other friend. I have missed work for the last five weeks due to an injury as well and won’t return to my job for at least three more weeks. This has taken its own toll, financially and mentally, in our household. My sons 16th birthday is in less than one month, and for the first time in his life I have no clue how to do this. The three of them have been the only ones celebrating each of the others birthdays for years. Now with one tragically gone, and the other only partially present in the friendship, my son has no interest in this day. Any frugal ideas on how I can make this day special again? Incorporating his friend he misses so dearly? Bringing the other one back into the fold? This isn’t a question of gifts ( my son and I have always celebrated with minimal gifts, choosing experiences over things).  Any advice on any of this would be excellent. FYI: my son, his friend, and the deceased’s girlfriend (who was present at the time of his death) are joining a grief and trauma group for adolescents.

525,"I (23M) deal with a good amount of depression and struggle a lot mentally.  Part of that is the constant desire to find an escape or to make myself happy, which has not been achieved in a large part for years. One thing I constantly turn to is video games.

I was finally able to feel loved and happy after my previous abortive relationships. But she slowly tells my about her past and recently she told me that she used to do drugs in her previous relationship with her ex. 

I also heard that from friends of mine and I don't know how to deal with that. In my previous relationships I already heard similar promises like ""I won't do it anymore"" and that promises never lasted for so long. I just can't stand drugs and just thinking about it makes me feel so anxious.

When we were talking about it, she told me that she wants me to know it, because she didn't want me to hear it for the first time from somebody else. She said that it was the worst time in her life and never wants it back, that she was doing it to get closer to her ex-boyfriend, who was drug addict, and I just don't know how to feel about it?

535,"Hi,

I'm a university student. I am currently a member of multimedia team of an Online Campaign project. Our team is responsible to promote the event through FB and Insta which include creating digital poster, video or infographic. 

My responsibility in the team includes scheduling daily posting for FB and Insta. Some of my other teammates are responsible to design the poster for posting, some are responsible for writing the caption for the post and some are responsible to find out the content/info for the post. 

Due to misunderstanding and miscommunication, I have made a google calander and decided to create a system via google sheet for my team so that everybody are aware and can assign their respective task. There will be a drop down cell for them to mark down the progress of their current task which is either: ""No Content"", ""In Progress"" or ""Ready to Publish"". This system also provide me enough information about their current task to schedule a week posting. Some thing looks like this.

What I ask from my teammates is simply:

1. Assign themselves onto each task provided
2. Check the google spread sheet at least 1 time a day to know what task need to be done or need to be help
3. Upload the their finished content onto my google drive so that person who are in charge are able to find the content (should be 1 day earlier according to this logic 👇🏻👇🏻👇🏻)
4. Inform me at least 1 day earlier if their task cannot be done on the day on posting so that I can reschedule the post

And almost everyday I will tell the whatsapp group that what are we goin to post today so they dont get blur up by the tasks we have.

My problem is I keep getting whatsapp message from my team, telling me to **chill.** That is after I tell them how would I reschedule the post after 4 hours of getting no update from the teammate as I ask how is the progress of his task which should be post today. Somehow I got sad and offended.

I mean, I am chill, but they are not following the system and sometimes would end up posting around 10pm at night (Because I usually schedule either 2 pm or 8 pm)

What I thought is that maybe I have done too much talking in the group which may scare them whenever they heard the whatsapp ringtone. But the point is, if I didnt tell the group, sometimes they will get blurred up (Almost only 2 out of 6 members will open the google sheet and update their progress). Another is that maybe the thinking of we are all the same, like having an ego of ""Why should I listen to you?"" But I must emphasize, I do not defame or engage any type of rude discussion nor message to my teammates.

Am I rushing too much? Or what? Feel free to make any comment. what should or could I do to improve this situation? It is killing my spirit",18Aug2020,1

543,"Friends parent's own a small Heating and Air company, small but successful enough for both of them to take fairly extravagant middle class vacations at least every year. My friend, while resistant for much of his late teens and early twenties, eventually joined the company and worked his ass off, doing so well that his parents decided that they'll basically retire and give the company to him in 5 years (with a payout I'm assuming)

Now, before I go further, his dad is a chronic alcoholic, enough that my friend had to stay at my house a couple of times while we were in middle school. After getting drunk while taking us boating on a lake, I had made the decision not to associate further with the dad, with support and no hard feelings from the friend.

Now, after an event that my friend was not present at, everything went to sh\*\*. The dad was driving a golf cart, drunk of course, on a family and friends outing and flipped it with kids riding with him. This was 2 weeks ago and his mom has moved out of the house and is talking about Divorce. They jointly own the business so my friend is worried about it being dissolved.

My friend has a lot on his plate. His wife is furloughed until the pandemic is over, His primary vehicle was t-boned by a drunk driver, and now his parents are possibly getting divorced and probably destroying his job.

I don't know what stakes, on paper, he has in the company, and to my knowledge, him taking over the company in 5 years (this was 2 years ago) was probably just a verbal agreement. I've only told him that lawyers would be involved and that'd give him time and probably space to insert himself. But I don't know what else I can do to assure him.",18Aug2020,1

548,"A week or two ago,  a guy off of a ‘kink’ website contacted me. He was from like 40 minutes away. I checked his profile and we seemed into the same things. He was looking for a long term relationship. First thing he said in his profile. He was ridiculously good looking but not a very good conversationalist. On a whim, I invited him to come over last Saturday. He wasn’t texting me too much until we started making plans. Maybe a text every hour or four. I made a joke at the beginning about being a terrible texter and he confirmed he was too. Okay, no big deal, right?

We meet up in a public place, and I get a picture of his license. I do this any time I meet someone offline and I give the ID to two people I trust to check up on me/call the cops if I dont respond. In my head, if you have their identity in hand they are less likely to murder/rape you. 

So we go back to my place. Just start hanging out. He’s completely different in person than he is in text. He was giving a few red flags in text (couldn’t figure out how to send a picture of his license, not responding the best). But he made a convincing case finally and I met up with him. 

I told him in person, what my dad said. 

He’s gorgeous. He’s sweet. He’s polite. Says all the right things. Complimentary about me/my body. Lays it on thick. Looking back, I think he was just being the perfect man to not raise any flags. 

Tells me his sob story about losing his job during COVID so he’s renting out his house for income and working on his parents farm to pay rent at their place. Talks about how he doesn’t want me to meet them for a long while because they’re crazy conservative. Okay. My mom is like that. I get it. 

We slept together twice. He’s the first guy I’ve ever been with that wouldn’t even have sex with me until he’d made me finish. I’ll admit, at that point, I was swooning. We just stayed in bed and cuddled and it was wonderful. He left and Wanted to do something the following weekend. 

On Monday, I found out my place was hiring for what he does. Being who I am, I texted him and let him know. He responds 5 hours later ‘Hmmm....something to talk about this weekend’ 

I don’t know why but that’s when things started adding up. So I started digging. 

1. Couldn’t find him on social media 
2. Texting very slow
3. Lives far away 
4. Has already made it clear he won’t be bringing me to meet his friends and family

Is this guy married?

So I put on my sleuthing hat and go digging. I find his real Facebook. It’s a variation of his name. There is a child in the picture. Okay. Red flag. But maybe he’s divorced and embarrassed? Or had a kid out of wedlock? But at that point, I can’t let it go. So I keep going. Until I find his wife’s Facebook. She has family photos. They have 3 children. They just had a third in April or May (newborn pic in May)

Getting cheated on while married and not finding out is one of my bigger fears. I feel disgusted that I slept with this poor women’s husband. She’s a bit overweight, like me. And she just had a kid a few months ago. She’s probably hormonal and struggling to feel beautiful as it is. 

I texted him. He added me to a group chat with another number, and said ‘sorry’. Okay. Great. So now I know I’m not the first. I text the girl 1:1. They went on a date a year ago. She didn’t know about the wife and kids either. 

Lying is huge for me. He played into my biggest fear. I don’t know if I should reach out to his wife and tell her. 

I have a few concerns:
1. This man knows where I live. He wants to meet up in person to talk. How do I stay safe?
2. What if she takes it out on me? Or finds me/attacks me?
3. I know he did this, not me. But I would be the catalyst in ruining/destroying the trust of their relationship.

554,"Okay, so here is a bit of background information.

Just shy of a year ago, my fiance (31 M) and I (33 F) offered my brother (41 M) a place to land after leaving his wife and going through a divorce and he has been living in my basement ever since. Obviously, with siblings living under the same roof, some things have been less than ideal - general roommate type issues. My brother will not clean up after himself - dishes, sweeping or mopping the floor after having spilled food, etc. 

Due to COVID-19 (and 'personality conflicts' with co-workers), my brother has been mostly not working the entire time he has lived with us - just collecting unemployment, asking our mother for money, and not paying rent. Now, to be fair, I am really fine with him not paying rent or utilities, so long as it helps him get out on his own and into his own place to start rebuilding his life after his divorce. 

Recently, however, my brother has been resuming 'normal' activities like camping, attending events with his friends, dating women, etc - all while not wearing a mask or PPE. Now, he is not 'anti-mask', he just seems to think that the rules really don't apply to him, or that he is immune because he is fit and works out a lot.  I've discussed the following issues with him:

\- Both my mother and my fiance are in the high risk category. Our mother is a 70-year-old cancer survivor who only has one functioning kidney. My fiance has severe asthma and all the men in his family except for him (thus far) have had spontaneous collapsed lungs. 

\- Wearing a mask is a matter of respecting the people he lives with / near to keep his family safe.

Despite these sorts of civil conversations, my brother just spent 4 days camping with a large group of people / has been staying with a girl he is currently pursuing. He will not social distance. He will not wear a mask. 

I could add a lot of background information on other small things that he has refused to respect boundaries / house rules on, but I ask very little of my sibling otherwise. What small things I do ask of him are met with hostility (fit-throwing, gaslighting, etc). Example: ""Could you please not leave your weed out on the floor / ground where the dogs have access to it?"" (I am very 4/20 friendly, so long as people use designated areas outdoors.) Reply: ""You're literally attacking me! I guess I'm just WRONG and a piece of shit!"" Just from 0-10, response-wise. 

The mask thing is a big deal for me - I already work customer service and am extremely careful about PPE. And anyone that works a service industry or customer service knows the kind of people and responses you get by wearing proper PPE, so I won't go into what I deal with on a regular basis at work. I just don't want this to also be something I have to deal with at HOME. But both my fiance and I will have to begin wearing a mask while in our own home

I guess my question is this: Does anyone have any advice on how to approach this? I've tried diplomacy and explaining myself. Just frustrated and at a loss - looking for fresh opinions! 

Thanks, all.",18Aug2020,1
555,"Hey I'm looking for some advice...

A few years ago I opened a charity that works with 18-25 year olds to build life skills. Upon opening it I LOVED it, I was doing everything but had one or two volenteers who helped out in our sessions.

Over time as the charity grew I ended up being more and more restricted by red tape and seem to spend all my time doing paperwork or organising volenteers. On top of that we lost out on a huge funding bid due to covid meaning I'm not working a full time job on top of running the charity. 

I think I want to close the charity as I can't find anyone who is interested in taking over my role and directing the charity, especially when they find out I do everything for free. On a personal note I'm left with no time for self care, I only ever receive negative feedback and it's really just become a chore so it's definitely starting to take a toll on my mental health.

The issue is I know that in closing it will lose my social circle &amp; I'm worried that the people who currently access our support will not be able to find anything like we offer.

I set this up because I love working with people but never really expected to be doing 80% admin and worrying about funds.

559,"This may not seem like a big issue but yes it is to me. My parents can't know because they may or may not kill me. This lunchbox has been under my bed for maybe one month (I think it could be more) and I honestly have no idea how to approach this problem. You see, I don't want to wash it because the stink could be lethal since I left a sandwich in there as well. Actually, if it wasn't for the sandwich I don't    think I'd have had this issue in the first place. The scent won't go away even if I wash it very thoroughly. I know this from experience (washing partially molded lunchboxes). I wouldn't mind just washing a lunchbox that is partially molded because that's fine. But this? IT IS FULL OF MOLD AND I MEAN THE ENTIRE THING. So the second part of the problem is that I can't just throw it away. Firstly because that's a damn waste and secondly because my parents might become suspicious ""Oh starsong8066 remember that lunchbox with the Bob the Builder lid? It just randomly disappeared one day do you know what happened to it?"" And then a full blown search of my bedroom would ensue and the lunchbox would eventually be found. Also right now our city is in lockdown so I don't think I could clean my lunchbox without being seen since our kitchen and lounge are on the same floor.  

So yeah, I can't wash my lunchbox or throw it away, but I need to badly do something with it because I can't have it under my bed forever.

562,"Reading for context would be deeply appreciated, for those interested.

......

To be exact, my birthday is coming before hers this year. 

For context, we have never even socialized before. 

For the most part, it's a silly first-sight infatuation I've had to this fabricated idea or impression I have had of her since a year ago. Probably more than the actual person.

I'm very well-aware of how weird the age gap is, which is why this is the first instance a crush I have had on someone just stood out a certain way to me.

I am, surely, in general attracted to girls around my age and older, and am actually extremely weirded out by the idea of my attraction to most other kids around her age imaginable. I would bat an eye to just here that my 13 year old daughter is dating, let alone with a 16 year old.

**But my conscience has not prevented me from saving (work-friendly) pictures of this girl for myself (and only myself, in absolute private) and persistently stalking her online.**


Even going as far as to resort to scammy, disrespectful, &amp; illegal, third-party (Private account viewing) sites in the heat of desperation and creating a semi-decoy account (made just so that I could associate my actual self with, but also for her to grant my permission as her follower) only to see what she has posted in her privated social media account. 

There is indeed such a thing as reading hormones, but it's still alarming since this seems to take it to another level.

What do I want? 

While I surely won't deny my sexual urges and lack of control towards appealing images as a stupid guy, it genuinely would not even upset me at all if she had no pictures of herself there right now. 

I only know she has shared several more posts than when I've last seen her account in public, and that I am very interested.

I just want to know her better. 

Believe me or not, the best way this attraction **dies** altogether is if her candid personality as I knew it just hardly lives up to my romantic ideal. 

But at the moment, these noticable hints I've been getting of her have only left me asking for more information. 

To specify... I've been actively there for the very few of periods in which she opened up her private accounts, have read her schoolwork posted on the wall, have a good idea who and what the friends she surrounds herself with are like, get gists of personality from her way of dress, choices of avatar and bio, and read brief threads of exchange between her and her friends ... etc

But never actually got to witness her socializing at her fullest while hearing out loud the things she's saying for the countable number of times we've been in a relatively noticable distance.


My irrational objective is seeing that we are potentially relatable, and being able to gush and dream over just that alone. That's literally it. 


I don't want to even want to have a friendship with her anymore, even anonymously, considering it would just seem creepy at this point and feel awkward since we're most probably stuck in the acquaintance zone forever and just as of this school year are already in different schools.


Subconscious mentality is that ""nobody's harmed in any shape or form anyway,"" and I would NEVER for a SINGLE SECOND think of laying a bad finger on her or acting on it but I CERTAINLY still do have a weird feeling about this for an understandable reason. 


This is all without a doubt, idiotic, weird, irrational, sad and unhealthy, and I do have the motivation to work on myself. 

But besides that, another obstacle is just how controversial this is. Certain subjects help naturally better you at opening up, and I unfortunately feel this is one of them. Like a weight waiting to be *metriculously* lifted off my shoulders.",18Aug2020,1

578,"Hello, I am 15 years old, and I hope that this post doesn’t come across as melodramatic or ungrateful, but it’s something that i’m really struggling with.

My father has always been a really big part of my life, he’s always been the parent that i’ve had the closest connection too, and we’ve always had a lot of fun together. 
He has also been the parent that has brought me the most pain: from a very early age, he’s been verbally abuse, both to me and my mum, which has caused a rift in my mum and i’s relationship. He’s a ticking time bomb, and there’s no pattern in his behaviour, you never know when he’s going to explode on you. He has never hit me or her, the worst I can think of is rough shoulder grabs and him throwing things at me.

This used to happen pretty much daily, now it happens maybe twice a week, and they aren’t as consistently(?) violent as they used to be.

He recently, (a little over a year ago,) got diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I don’t know how this has affected him, he never talks about it, and I honestly can’t recognize any of the symptoms of mania in him, but that means that he’s started taking meds. They didn’t work at first, but i’ve noticed that he’s started to change. 
I’m proud of him, i’m happy that he’s getting help! But I can’t forgive him, and I don’t know if i should.

He has ruined such a big part of my life, and he has caused me so much trauma, that has been extremely debilitating in certain parts of my life. I can’t trust people, I never know when people are going to explode on me, my mental health has deteriorated, I don’t have any real connections with people, I flinch, I barely have a relationship with my mum; I can’t forgive him.

Sometimes he looks at me like a hurt puppy when my body language and behaviour makes it clear that I haven’t forgiven him, and it makes me feel horrible, I don’t know what to do. He could so easily revert back to his old behaviour, and I don’t know what would happen if i’d let me guard down and that happened.",18Aug2020,1
579,"(Pertinent: I live in the United States.) I have a 20k down payment saved up but I'm a bit ambivalent about buying a house right now. I have a well-paying job at the moment but I'd be in serious trouble if I became unemployed since I would likely be paying the mortgage by myself and there don't seem to be many jobs available anymore. I would be buying below my means to offset these risks, but I'm wondering if I should just get an apartment and save indefinitely instead.

Also, I'm here because I'm not sure who to consult about this stuff. Is there some irl professional who can help me make an informed decision? I'm pretty clueless about this whole process.",18Aug2020,1
580,"I (24M) am getting married next fall, for context. I have my brother, life-long best friend, best friend from college, my fiancé's brother and a coworker friend in my wedding party. The person in question is my coworker friend.

I started my career at my company January 2019 and he started a few months later so we established a friendship early because I was helping him through all the questions I had just a few short months before he did. Things were good, he helped me move, we went to dinner with him and his wife every week, hung out outside of that, etc. At the time, things were great so I asked him to be in our wedding about a year ago.

Welllllllll..... since that time I really feel like I regret asking him. I won't get into too much detail but there have been some serious issues in our friendship. Not to the point that I don't want to be friends, but certainly on the border (or past it) to no longer wanting him in the wedding. The list has gotten to the point where if I tell people around me, they would understand if I took him out of the wedding. (I even have a replacement in mind)

My fiancé just had a large falling out with her sister so she is cut from the wedding and already replaced by her close friend. If I'm going to cut him, I feel like my time is fleeting. My problem is, because of his over-bearing personality, if I say she cut back her bridesmaid count he would try to insist and insert his wife in the wedding to fill the hole. Although her being a bridesmaid wouldn't be a bad thing, him being in the wedding would. If that makes sense.

So... how should I cut him from the wedding while still trying to maintain and rebuild a somewhat rocky friendship? Or should I not cut him at all?",18Aug2020,1
581,"I am 22 years old and I have a 4 year-old sister. My parents are not so good at parenting, they raise their voices to my sister, insult her, threaten her... There's no physical violence but they're not ideal parents, that's for sure. They never supported me for anything, they always told me that I am a disappointment et cetera... I don't actually care much right now but I am sure that I am effected by all of this as a child.

For my sister, I love her. She's like the only thing I love in this universe. I wish my parents would think that ""There's something upsetting my child, I wonder what it is and how can I solve her problem?"" when my sister cries instead of raising their voices and telling her to ""shut up"" and threaten her. I want her to begin to learn something (like music or dancing) as a kid. I want her to have a room, where the shelves are filled with things she's interested in. A room is not just four walls you sleep within, it has to reflect your character, it's where you live. I can't tell what my sister's interests, actually my parents doesn't care about that. They don't think that they should find something she will like. I mean, it's so classic but some girls like princesses, right? My sister doesn't know about them, no one sits and watches something with her. I feel really sad. 

She doesn't have much friends either. We live in an apartment, we go to parks from time to time and of course my sister finds someone to play with for a couple hours, then the other day, there's probably different kids there. We should get along with our neighbors and find families with kids whose ages are close to my sister's, those kids will be her friends. No one cares, it's okay unless she cries and annoys them. Can't she just play by herself and not bother anyone right?

I called ""Social Services"" once, someone came and talked to me, then they called my mother and asked her to talk but my mother didn't go, then social services were no more. Of course, this led to many more fights and their behavior were even worse. 

I am 22, I don't want to fight with my parents anymore, I don't want to live with them. I lived alone for a year, in a different city, for college. I came back because I didn't want to be a teacher. I didn't enjoy school but living alone was really good. My sleep schedule was right, my house was clean, I cooked, lost weight, started to read again... It was peaceful. Now I am a student in History of Arts, I really like it, I enjoy what I am learning. But, I have huge sleeping issues and my discontinuity was high. Anyway, I guess I will quit. I will find a job, I am going to live alone anyway so, what I get will be enough. 

I think, my experience with bad parents made me realize what makes a better parent. I think, if I had the opportunities and will, I could make my sister very happy and help her build a better future. Unfortunately there's issues. First of all, of course, financial issues. Maybe I could find a better job if I finished college but, I can't wait 4 more years. And it would be too late for my sister anyway. What I will get won't be enough for me to take care of a child. And I actually don't want to take care of a child.

I always thought having kids is a stupid idea. How much time you can spare, they are your kids, you need to be with them and spend time with them. If you are working, think of the kids, what will they do while you are at work? You need to play with them. Do you know how to entertain little kids? Do you know what they like and what is good for their development? You can't get mad at them, you must think about the reasons behind their acts. You have to sacrifice your life, you will be there with them all the time. You can not just take some time for yourself, you have to play with them or watch them as they play. I don't mention financial side of this. They better take lessons and learn the notes or how to defend themselves at the early stages of their lives. They must have some hobbies and interests. You should always look out, what can you get for them, what can you do for them. Hell, cooking is whole another side of this. Food must look good, food must taste good and it must be healthy. You are going to cook for them everyday and manage make it look pretty. You should make shower a game, you should make everything a game, you should play with them all the time. When you want them to take a shower, you have to make sure that they'll know it will be fun. And if they don't want to get out of the shower, you have to make sure that they know there's more fun waiting outside of the shower, instead of threaten them. You must understand them, you have to be willing to take advice from professionals. ""They're my kids, I'll treat them as I like."" or ""Will I ask someone else to how to raise my child?"" mentality is bad. Hospital visits (just to check up their physical health or just for a small talk for pedagogues) should be routine. You should know that you can't know everything.

This is a big responsibility for me. I never wanted to take care of any child. Yet my parents are not ""parents"" for her. They weren't parents for me as well. I have mental issues, I want to live alone but I don't want to leave my sister behind, knowing she will be just like me. Sometimes I think maybe I should just kill myself, escaping all the responsibilities, not being able to think or worry about something. 

Anyway I am writing this, hoping that there's a way to forget about her. I want to go, find a job and live alone. I know I will think about my sister all the time, will she make it? Will she be a good and sane person? I am hoping that, after a while, since I don't see or hear her anymore, I will forget her. But, will I? Is there a way? How can I cope with this thought if I leave everything behind, including her. I don't know, meditations? Hobbies? Any advice is welcomed.",18Aug2020,1

584,"Title summarizes it pretty well. I'm a 35-year old guy with a professional job. Have always been pretty successful and outgoing. Have sometimes been a bit nervous speaking in front of people, but I usually push through it and do pretty well. I've even presented at conferences before, in front of 100+ people and actually had fun with it.

But lately, holy hell am I having a hard time. Anytime I am on a video call or phone conference call, I start speaking and right away my heart races, breath is short, voice is shaky. Last month I was moderating a virtual all-staff meeting (basically fielding questions and reading them aloud for our executive team to answer) and there was a long question. I had this sudden realization that everyone was listening to me, and botched the whole thing. I had to stop reading and ask for a minute to catch my breath. It was mortifying. Thankfully, a colleague took over right away and bailed me out. I resumed reading the questions after a few minutes and recovered nicely.

Since then, it's been a mixed bag. I've had really good calls, but mostly with people I am comfortable with and know well. I did have a high-stakes call with a VP last week that I did well on, although I could tell at the very beginning that it was going to happen again if I didn't just push through it.

Has this happened to anyone else? My doctor put me on a low dose of Propanolol, so maybe it's helping a little bit? I've talked to some people who have taken it, and they say it is a life saver. I can't say that it's changed things too much, because I still feel the physical and mental symptoms coming on when all ""eyes"" are on me and I am expected to talk flawlessly. It's really bothering me and starting to affect how I feel about my job -- because I am in a field/industry where I will be talking on the phone and in meetings for the rest of my career.

I have been dealing with this insecurity since a young age, and browsing reddit has made me realize I’m not the only one who feels this way. From my individual experience, I feel a lot of shame and even disgust towards my private parts. So much so that it is one of the major factors that has prevented me from ever being intimate with someone or allowing someone to see me naked. I am mostly accepting of the rest of my body, but this one part I can’t ever seem to come to terms with. I also experience a lot of fear over what a partner would think if they saw all of me; mostly that they would be surprised, disappointed or turned off. I know the common response to this is “if someone really likes you they won’t care, etc.” but I still care and that doesn’t make me feel any less awful about it, especially since most of the insecurity is in my own head.

Health insurance: what’s the most financially viable and ‘safest’ option? My university requires all students to have a health insurance plan so. 

Banking: when I turned 18 I opened a student account with Santander bank as they seemed extremely affordable. Is this a good choice? Am I missing any key factors?

Loans: do I accept the college loans and risk being debt trapped for the rest of my life or drop out of college because I can’t afford it (which would potentially invalidate my scholarship of 10,000 per year). 

Housing: do I accept the university housing that’s much more expensive with the benefit of having the college experience or do I commute and miss out on it? And if I don’t accept the housing do I go for an apartment? A motel? 

Therapy: yes? No? Is it worth spending money when I’m already financially strained.

Let me explain I'm a married man with 5 kids and an absolutely amazing wife.

We rarely have problems or fight and when we do fight it is something small and by the night we are apologising to each other. Never have I ever thought about cheating on my wife nor would I....Well up until recently my mind has been drifting towards that direction, I don't know why, there isn't a problem in marriage like I said and it not like I feel unattached from my wife either, Our sex life is great and I love being the father of 5 kids, always have been there for football games gymnastics etc.

Every now and then I feel myself watching a women sometimes while I'm at work out on a call or just out in public, my mind going other places I have to physically look away from these women, And it makes it difficult especially when I'm working and your supposed to you look someone in the eye.

I feel disgusting doing it, Like I said I love my wife, honestly, but these last few months have been so difficult, I don't even know how It even got to this point honestly.

I never actually thought that after marring my wife that I would ever feel this way even to the extent of actually sleeping with someone else honestly.

I would want to sit down with my wife and talk about this but I feel like she would freak out and assume I have already cheated on her, Which I don't blame her I feel like with the fantasies I have already that I have done so, I haven't really been myself recently because of it, And she knows somethings up.

595,"My SO (F21) was diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis a while ago. At that time she was living with her Parents and was getting treated with Humara. Humara was supposed to be covered but they ended up 3 months into the treatment sending her a bill for $30,000. After about 6 months of fighting the hospital admitted fault and the bill was dropped. When she received the bill was the last time she had her medication. That was 2 years ago. Not by her own choice either. After meeting me and moving in together her mother ""removed"" her from her insurance and we were left to try and get Medicare. We put in the paperwork and never received anything back for around 8 months and when we tried to use it we got ""this isn't your medical card"" (paperwork we eventually received said ""this paperwork is your medical card"") and more recently that our medicare ""is no longer active."" We also found out that her mother never actually removed her from her insurance but she couldn't use it and the medicare when active was put as a secondary to the insurance her mother didn't want us to use. We've fought her mom to be able to go to the doctor's and finally and after 2 years of trying to get her back since her insurance is messed up she doesn't qualify for reduced payments and we are expected to pay a 4th of our combined income a month to get her on the medication.

604,"Hey, guys. First off, apologies for the long post! Here’s the dilemma I need help with:

My MIL works for a hotel amongst a group of women who are all from the same country and have grown quite close. She bakes for them and they go out together. She has worked at this place for about two years now and is the hardest working person I’ve ever met. She has certainly proven herself to be an extremely reliable employee. However, she’s being treated very badly and it’s just getting worse.

I think she barely makes minimum wage for starters. She has been called in countless times to cover for the other women during her holiday, often with just a few hours notice and hasn’t been paid on some occasions.

As of recently, she and two other women worked overtime and were promised that they would be paid. Well, two of the managers who my MIL was previously close with decided they didn’t want to pay them but the two ladies (not my MIL) raised hell to get their earnings and eventually did, however, the managers pleaded with them not to tell anyone about this, namely my MIL, for fear that they will have to pay her as well.

Since the two ladies came forward and raised hell, my MIL overheard the managers, Diana and Roxana, speaking to each other in private about how they can’t fire one of the women who raised hell, Alina, because she cleans too well. They are actively looking for a reason to dismiss her.

Not only is this unethical and probably illegal but they’re also extremely petty with this woman, Alina. Apparently they will make a coffee for everyone in their group apart from her and do other childish things to exclude her.

Now my MIL is the sweetest, most gentle and agreeable person on Earth and doesn’t want trouble with these women whom she considered friends but naturally, my partner and I are outraged and want her to get her earnings, which amounts to about £900-£1,000 and some form of justice.

There is also a third manager, a man who isn’t close to this group of women and who has stepped in before to reprimand Diana and Roxana (the other managers) for their unreasonable behaviour towards the employees. We’re thinking to set up a meeting with him because I don’t think they have a HR department.

My question for you guys is, what can we do to report these women and hopefully have them fired? Does anyone know of any anonymous hotlines that might investigate?

I don’t want to care as much or even let on that I care, and I definitely don’t want it to stop me from...doing it.

I recently started going to the football training..I dont really like football, I just wanted something to do during the summer and socialise a bit.But I dont like playing and I also have no motivation to get better because i just don care if i win or i lose a match.

I also dont feel like just giving up because of some sort of ""pride"" feeling and thats why i dont know what to do.

607,"Hi! Quick disclaimer: I'm on mobile so formatting may be odd, and this is a long ass post, so sorry about that.

Since restrictions due to Covid have been lifted a bit in our country, my parents decided to put our house on the market as we want to downsize for a number of reasons. Me (15f) and my parents (both are in or near to their 60s) currently live in the countryside, and are looking to move to a town or village. 

We've found a few houses that we like, but there are a few issues with these, but we saw one today that my parents absolutely love. I, however, do not share the sentiment. It's a nice house, but I really don't want to live there.

This house fits a lot of criteria-- it has good sized bedrooms, space for our dogs, a nice bit of garden, good parking (with permission to get more), it's in the same town as my current school, and the college runs a private bus from the town, my parents can walk to the shops, and it's in a good location for my dad's work. It's an older house with 'character features' and it's perfect for my parents. And I'd like to point out that there was nothing wrong with the house, it was a nice house (this point may get repetitive, but it's important). I just really didn't like it. 

But I'm starting to hate it. The house is in very good condition (the kitchen needs some work but that's about it). But there's a narrow passageway that leads to creaky stairs to a loft without windows, and this creeps me out majorly and I don't know why (while my parents had been viewing the loft, I'd gone back down to the bedrooms to see these again because, at this point, the loft was really freaking me out, and when I was stood in the bedroom that I liked--my parents had dibs-ed the other rooms but this room was the one I liked most out of them anyways--I could hear them moving around up there, especially when they came down the stairs). This place is also spider heaven, and I'm terrified of spiders, I always have been. Last year I really struggled with my fear of them; I was seeing the school nurse/councillor about it, and I was constantly living in fear, going through a bunch of checks/rituals daily, to the point where it was staring to really affect my life. There were also some weird vibes about the place - it was making me a little uncomfortable, and I know this isn't really a good reason for not liking the house, but this, paired with the other issues I have with the house, made me really start to dislike it. 

When we got back into the car from viewing the house (we social distanced from the estate agent, wore masks, etc) my parents asked my what I thought of the house. At this point I knew my mum loved the house, my dad said he liked it, but he preferred one of the other houses, and he knew I wasn't particularly keen on the house. I told my mum that I didn't like it and she said something along the lines of 'well it won't be long before you go off to college and uni, and it's not really up to you, it's whether we like the house or not'. I understand where she's coming from, but all the same I don't think I'd be comfortable living there at all. 

When we got home I got away from my parents for a bit so I could think about the house (and type this) and I started to get really nervous and feel sick about living in this house - again there is nothing wrong with it! It's a wonderful house, but in my personal opinion I just really don't like it and don't want to live there. I then went to sit with my parents and my mum asked my why I didn't like it, but it's hard to explain why I don't like it, and she repeated the 'but you won't be there for long before college', 'it doesn't matter whether you like it or not, it's whether we like it', and that kinda stuff. I went into a different room to charge my phone, and after a bit my dad came in and said he said 'we will think of something' and that 'it will be okay', but I feel like he's disappointed that I don't like the house too. 

I really don't know what to do, we've only been for a first viewing but I can tell that this is one of the top houses on our list. It's a bit under budget too, so we'd have money to do anything that needed a bit of work. I know that there's a chance that someone else might buy it, or we could find a house that we all like, and my parents like even more than this one, but I'm dreading even seeing this house again. I really don't know what to do and I needed to get this off my chest. If anyone reads this, thank you, even if you don't have any advice.

I'd just like to reiterate: there is nothing wrong this the house. It's a very nice house, with very nice neighbours (we briefly met them and they seemed wonderful), in a nice area of a nice town. It should be our perfect house. Apart from the few things I've pointed out, I should love it, and I have no clue why I don't. But I just don't want to live there.",18Aug2020,1
608,"I can't decide what I want to do. I graduated this spring in Industrial Engineering in Canada and can't find an engineering job but have gotten a permanent job in a non-engineering role. I always wanted to be a doctor and thought that maybe after my undergrad in engineering I would apply to medical school. The problem is that medical school in Canada is extremely competitive and I would have to do really well on the MCAT to make up for my lower than average gpa (3.75) while also not having any biology/biochemistry/organic chemistry courses. I could do a masters in engineering with an 8-month co-op term at my local university to get my foot in the door at a company but I'm not sure what specialty I would want to pursue. 

I think the thing that scares me the most is committing to medical school, taking 4 months off work to study, and then not getting in. I could potentially sign up for a masters as a fall back and also apply to medicine but I don't know if that would look bad on my medical school application and I am not sure I want to go back to school for anything other than medicine. I took 6 years to get my engineering degree and I finally like having money in my pocket.

But I need to ask this because their dogs are home alone ten hours a day locked up in the house. They need someone to let them out in the morningeven if my parents don’t think so and I feel like they are my babies because I grew up and grew attached with them.

I am moving 30 some miles away and it’d be hell of a drive back and forth checking on them three times a week but I would only ask my parents for 15$ a week to cover a decent chunk of the gas I’ll be using to drive over there

I would reach out every few months to see if he was ready to talk and maybe be friends again and try to get his friends to talk to him. I wanted him to understand that I was always gonna be on his side and I wasn’t against him. He started to feel uncomfortable and got really mad at me, calling me crazy and not letting me speak.

615,"Hello Reddit, I am 15M, and I am terrified about moving out. I have been taught basic knowledge about money management by my parents and have further educated myself for he past few year. I have always known how scary it would be to move out but, when I turned 15, and in the past few weeks its become more vivid and I'm terrified.

I'm not scared in the sense that I would have to take care of myself and the house, and cook and do all the housework myself, that's not at all my problem. Currently I do quite a bit to keep our house pleasant and in order because of my parents being busy and getting older. I have been paying for everything myself for years, but here's my scare; the amount.

When I move out I would have to rent or purchase a house/apartment, finance a vehicle, make sure I have furnishings and basic necessities, pay for school, insurance and bills, and other things that is common for one to buy when they move out. It just seems like so much to do all on my own, while not having much time.

I find myself looking for homes in surrounding counties, looking for the best ways to save on house hold appliances, furnishings and other homely things. But back to what all makes that happen, money. Where am I going to make all that money? I'm working now and making about $215 per week and combined with my side hustles, it would be impossible. Even if I got a $5 raise, or found somewhere with better pay. I understand that you can borrow money but I really don't to be in debt, I want to stay out literally as much as possible.

Things like getting a debit card and investing would also be very complicated to learn, and I have a hard time understanding them when I read or watch/ listen about them, and the best ways to do so.

I feel like nobody else is dealing with this mainly because their parents are paying for most of it. I am one of few people in my class that have a job and have to buy things their self.

This isn't nearly all what I wanted to say, but I don't want to write everything out and get 2 people to comment. So if this does good I'll edit it and give more of my thoughts.

If you guys could give me some advice or provide me with some comfort, it would be greatly appreciated. I am also very open to questions and discussion. Thank you!",18Aug2020,1
616,"So I’m starting college here in a few weeks and I have 3 other roommates. All are between the ages of 19-20.

Im really uncomfortable having someone so much older than I living with us. I’ve spoken with the other roommates and they feel the same way. We don’t understand why someone who is almost 30 would want to live with a bunch of teenagers/early 20 somethings.

620,So i’ve never told anyone this but i’m pretty sure my parents know of it and I start therapy in November and was planning to tell the therapist about this. In 6th grade I started to twist and play with my hair a lot but it started to get bad and it would knot up so I would pull it out. Because of this I had some bald spots so my mom took me to a barber to have him help cover them up. They’ve healed up now and I don’t really do it to my hair anymore but I know that my mom knew I did it back then. After that I started tearing off small pieces of napkins and toilet paper and I roll them up into very small balls. It’s a little gross but I would even do the same thing to my leg hair. I’m a freshman in college now and I still haven’t been able to stop. I can go periods of time without it but I still do it daily basically without even knowing. I won’t really even realize it and the next thing I know I am doing it. What would cause this? I think that I have some anxiety but would that cause this? Sometimes I think maybe adhd or autism but i’m pretty sure I have neither of those. Sometimes I even do it in public like in the cafeteria a college or at my friends house but it is basically automatic at this point. I try my best to be desecrate about it but sometimes I worry that other people have seen me doing it. I would really like to stop not only because it is really embarrassing but I also feel that it is having an adverse effect on my fingers like i’m getting early arthritis or something from balling them up so tight. I definitely feel like this isn’t normal behavior for a 19 year old but I still do it. Why? What could cause this and how could I stop it? Please help me out. I will read ever response.

621,"Tl;Dr I'm in the UK, my own dentist is only seeing emergencies as they have a massive backlog due to Covid. I've tried every other dentist in the area and none will see new patients.

624,"I'm feeling like a b\*\*\*\* about how I treat my grandmother but I don't know what else to do and I am looking for advice.

1 month ago I had to move house and ended up living closer to my grandmother, it's a 20 minute walk to her home. The first week when I moved we were together 4 or 5 days that week. I clearly remember we were together friday and saturday. Come sunday I decided to have the day to myself and just what I want, but, what a coincidence! my grandmother decided to take a walk right close to my door. 

From that moment I realized it'd be hard to set boundaries with her while I'm living here, and I decided not to let her in my house during weekdays. We're together every weekend and sometimes I stop by her house after work but she doesn't come into my house. I'm working from home and I know when I can and I cannot hang out with her, but she doesn't understand boundaries and if I ever told her I can't see her because I'm busy she'd be extremely offended, and she's also capable of sitting next to me chatting while I try to work, she did that when I studied in her house, sit right behind me and chat while I tried to study.

Everyday she takes a walk somewhere near my house and sends me text messages to let me know she's there, probably expecting to be invited in, but I don't bite into that. She keeps trying to find excuses to come into my house, usually offering to bring me food, but I always say no. 

Today I was having a meeting with my entire department and she texts me saying I need to open the door, she's at the door, brought me food. I was angry beyond belief. I could have opened the door, explaining my boss and the department directors why I'm leaving in the middle of a department meeting, but I decided not, otherwise she will do it again. She rang a neighbor and left the food by the hallway.

I am so incredibly angry and upset. There's so many things here. If I let her in once, she's gonna come everyday and not understand that sometimes I need to focus on work and can't be distracted. I can't talk to her about this, she'll never understand, she'd rather lie to her teeth than ever admit she's wrong and apologize. She'd rather be estranged from my father, her son, than apologize for calling her gf's children the child of ""the dead man"" (the children's father died when they were 3 yrs old. My dad's gf heard the conversation and cried hysterically, but my grandma denies she ever said such a thing. My dad stopped talking to my grandma after that. That was 5 years ago.)

And she doesn't do things out of generosity. She does you favors so she can make you feel guilty after. She loves making people feel guilty.

If she's lonely, it's because she wants to. Neighbors are always inviting her out but she always refuses: she doesn't want to go out for coffee with neighbor X because X talks too much; she doesn't want to go out for a walk with Y because Y walks too slow; she can't have lunch at Z house because afterwards she will have to invite Z for lunch. My aunt invites her to stay her on holidays every year, every year my grandma declines, complains she never travels everywhere. When my dad was talking to her, she was invited to spend Christmas at my dad's house, at my aunt's house, at the neighbor's house, and at the house of the parents of my mom's boyfriend. She declined invitations, complains to the entire neighborhood she's spending Christmas alone.

629,"
Hey! I don’t know how to start this off but I guess I’ll just introduce myself. This may be long, so please bare with me.

Hello! I’m 17 years old turning 18 years old this November. I’m from the Philippines. I’m still (and stuck) in Grade 10, I’m currently homeschooled and have been homeschooled for the past 5 years. I’ll also just like to say that I’m extremely dumb, so please excuse me if I may sound ignorant or whatever. I have been really reluctant and been contemplating to post here since January.

You may ask why I’m still in Grade 10, well I started 1st grade late (was turning 7 when I started) and failed my 6th grade (this was when I left physical school). 

About studies, our school’s curriculum is different. They send us books to study on and a copy of the book’s answers (which should always be with the parent). I have been copying the answers unto the books and yeah well, during the past 5 years I have been cheating my last 4 grades (grade 6-9) unwillingly. I was just following whatever my mother told me to do so I could catch up to my age group. 

Well, this is the story, every time I get into a new grade, the first few months I received the books, I do the books themselves and without the other book with the answers, if I’m falling behind and not finishing the books in the required date, my mother makes me copy the answers onto the book. 

In my defense why I just followed whatever what my mother said is because I was a confused and a lost teenager just following. I didn’t have and still don’t have the motivation or the inspiration to study. I didn’t have friends to talk to. I didn’t do any activities other teenagers would be doing today. I just played video games on my old iPad to pass time, not realizing what the fuck was happening to my life. As time passes by, I developed several mental illnesses I didn’t even realize I had or had knowledge of. I know it may be bad to self diagnose your mental health, but I guess I’ll just list down what I read from the information of the internet: major depression, social anxiety, and bipolar disorder. I read some information about mental illness but didn’t quite get into it. I can’t go to a psychologist and get a diagnosis because what would they say? Both of them (well mostly my mom) are in a bad mental state. I have a hard time talking to people whether it be public or through text. It’s really hard for me to start a conversation, whenever I talk to strangers my mouth just starts blabbing out random words due to anxiety, most of the time I speak really softly.

Right now, my little brother (who is 13) is also showing signs of mental illnesses, all the same symptoms as mine; and I’m afraid my other younger brother (10) will show signs earlier. Right now, I’ve overcome most of the stuff that’s pulling me back and most of the time staying positive for the sake of my brothers. Though whenever someone gets mad at me (anyone, really) it triggers my old attitude and most of the time can’t control myself and burst in anger; but right now I can control it really well. Whenever my brothers get mad at me, I really understand first why they’re mad and where their anger is coming from. However, whenever my mother gets mad and starts lecturing me, I could not help it. Every time she says anything negative, it really triggered me. I always argued with her, but it’s no use. You can never win an argument with a person so hypocritical. Right now, I can control my thoughts to myself and not bother to argue, but deep inside it hurts so much. I learned to keep my cool and not even bother to argue, but if I ever argue with my mom, I start with a gentle and positive tone. I also learned when most of the time my mom is irritated is because she either is stressed out or just woke up.

Back to studies, I really need advice. I want to get into senior highschool, but how can I get into SHS when I learned nothing for the past 5 years. As of right now, I told myself that I WILL NO LONGER CHEAT and finish grade 10 all by myself. BUT I CAN’T. I don’t know what I’m studying. I have no knowledge of what I’m studying. I’m so stuck. I don’t understand what I’m studying (mostly math, english, chemistry).
I don’t know what I’m getting into. Right now the math I’m studying is Algebra 2. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what I’m studying. I cheated my Algebra 1 and Geometry. I can’t even speak my national language fluently. I can’t write long paragraphs with proper sentence structures. My vocabulary knowledge is low low. 

Right now, my old classmates are in great schools in my country. How am I supposed to get into their schools when I know nothing. Please help me. I want to get back into school. I know it’s not too late for me; but I feel so hopeless all the time. I feel like I won’t be really happy ever again. 

About my parents, they are both separated, (annulled, I’ll say). Divorce, for some reason is illegal in the Philippines, it may be because of religion, I don’t know really, I haven’t gotten into the subject. It doesn’t really bother me or my siblings that they’re separated because both of them are still close to us. They both live in different condominiums, but live in the same community. While me and my siblings live in our mom’s condo. I’ll start with my Dad, he’s personality... He’s a great Dad, really supportive, caring, all the good traits a father would be; though he has a huge ego and looks down on the poor, is cheap (but not when it comes to buying food), he will delay promises he kept, lazy (but that’s ok lol). He owns a small engineering company, so he’s pay is decent I guess. My Mom, however, she’s in a terrible mental and financial state (I guess). She has all the bad traits you can think of, but not too bad. Well, I’ll just say she’s really judgmental, hypocritical, criticize people in a bad way, abusive (physically and verbally), tells lies and makes up stories or changes the story, constantly brings up the past; but she still is hard-working, caring, loving, supportive in her own way and provides great food everyday. She’s just (I guess a housewife?) she doesn’t have a job or anything, she just asks my dad for money daily to cook everyday. Right now, she threatens or repeatedly says she’ll leave us for his boyfriend online (mostly I think she says this because she’s stressed, but she always says it), because she says she can’t stand being “our servant” (we aren’t asking her to do this) or can’t stand to see us children (WHO ARE 17, 13, 10 years old) be in this state, she says it’s best if she leaves so we can be independent. I FIND THIS EXTREMELY WRONG, but I cannot build up the courage to have this argument. I don’t blame my parents for who they are today, but hopefully they find whatever wrong’s with them and their children, because they can’t seem to open their eyes and see what their children are going through, it’s always about them.

For activities, the only activity I did (along with my little brothers) was swimming, which I got attached to. I did a lot of research about the sport. Proper technique, races, all that stuff. Though we don’t have swim buddies, we only had a personal instructor. So it was just the 3 of us.

As for friends, currently I have none or so I’ll say.. like friends I talk to everyday either in real life or through the internet? no. none. 
Ever since I left physical school (2015), I somewhat cut my old classmates from my life due to the reason I didn’t want them to see my state or the way I did my studies. I made some friends through video games, but I also slowly ghosted them, because I didn’t want to talk about my personal life and because I couldn’t start conversations and go through it.

As for interests.. I do take interest in Japan and it’s culture. I also do take interest in psychology, mostly to know why people react like this and that. I do take interest in street fashion, I don’t wear outfits however, because of my insecurity, which is my height (5’6”). I haven’t done much research about all the things I take interest in because I’m afraid it’d be the wrong path for me to take. I don’t know, I sound stupid right now.

My state right now.. I’m somewhat in decent physical shape. I have been keeping track of what I eat, what nutrients I need. I have been exercising 5 times a week, yet still don’t have the drive to study. I’ve been taking care of my self recently, like brushing my teeth 3 times a day, been taking care of my face; but still can’t get rid of my pimples. :(

632,"Hey all, 
I’m looking for advice for how to make my bf get up at a reasonable hour. 
He has been off work due to COVID-19 and as such has spent a majority of his time just sleeping. He sets himself alarms to wake up but just hits snooze repeatedly and eventually just turns off the alarm clock. 
I’m working from home so during my lunch break I have to spend 20 minutes trying to pry him off our mattress while he complains he’s to tired. Today I finally snapped at him saying “well I’m tired too!” And left the room. He went right back to snoring. 
This has been everyday for months and I just can’t do it anymore. I have made him go to doctors thinking it’s a chronic fatigue issue or maybe his depression acting up but all of them say he’s fine and he’s just tired. 

Do I just let him sleep all the time? 
Do I get a second alarm clock with no snooze? 

I can’t be spending my lunch breaks trying to get him out of bed anymore. So I need solutions. 
I hope you can help.",18Aug2020,1
633,"throw away account for obvious f'ing reasons 

My family is a dysfunctional fuarkin mess, with my little sister crying about how he thinks that dad was going to hit her and hates her and how she wants me to move out so she can live with me, while my dads mad at my 12 year old sister for being up at 2AM in the morning on a school night (rightfully so) drunk out of his god damn mind like every other night, all it is, is god damn fighting and fighting and fighting between these two, and i do everything i can to help but they fight and fight and fight. This is the first time i've ever opened up with well any problems ever. 

I think it's summed down to my dads (can be) a insensitive alcoholic azzhole (grew up with one of the worst lives you can think of in a first world country) I've had my fair share of threats of violence, threats to kick me out of the house etc. 

My sister (can be) a moody oversensitive bich who excuses her kuntiness on her depression. I've also had the fair share of times where i've wanted to go completely off at her.

my sister has been diagnosed with depression, dad clearly has severe depression, aggressive anxiety and a whole chit load of other issues as anyone would in his situation. He won't admit to his alcoholism even though i can't think of a night he hasn't been blind drunk. He's too proud to go to therapy. 

I just don't know what to do, i want them to be alright, i want them to love eachother ffs, i don't think my sisters friends are a good influence. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have to deal with all this chit while i'm sitting here in quarantine failing school, and you know what, i'll admit it, where i have anonymity, i have suicidal thoughts daily, i remember the first time i thought about suicide the when i was 8 and that's rare cause i can't remember 99 percent of my life. Can't think of a day i haven't since then.  I just watched 13 reasons why, which i think had the opposite effect intended cause the idea of suicide feels oh so ever more sweet. Albeit the downside is no one would really care enough if i did making the whole tape idea redundant. Now if you're worried, i'm not gonna kill myself, it's been 10 years and i aint dead yet. I'm sitting here with no real friends, constant mental bullying at school, no girl ever interested in me, absolutely no money whatsoever, a family full of people treating each other like chit. Parents who give us everything even though we are legally in poverty, yet mentally it well isn't so great. Constant suicidal thoughts. And I have to sit here with a happy face calming everyone down, because well someone has to stay sane. My mum is in the same boat as me in terms of having to put on a happy face, i couldn't reveal any of this to her as it would break her.

&amp;#x200B;

If you think my dads the bad guy here, he's not, there all good family, my mum and dad give us so so much, spend like 400 each a birthday on us even with our hindered money situation, they make constant sacrifices. They just need help. And i don't know how, they're all as bad as each other. My mum and dad can pretend to love eachother all they want, they do it because they don't want use to go through the chit of them splitting, and i mean sometimes i see hints of them loving eachother, but they don't fight, not anymore, instead they just come to me to constantly rag on eachother. FFs all i want to do is box, i want to be world champion, it's my dream, and i'm still chit atm and that's an unlikey goal, but I can't f'ing even try to do that because of this stupid azz quarantine. 

&amp;#x200B;

Look i just want my family to stop fighting and legitimately hating each other so i can focus on my fuked up life.  And school wonders why i don't show up to online classes lol. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know none of you actually give a flying chit about me, but if you read all this chit and idk why you would, thanks.

&amp;#x200B;

Just please give me advice on how to fix my family.",18Aug2020,1
634,"TLDR

My friend/roommate has been trying to find a job for nearly 2 years, gets no negative feedback other than arbitrary stuff, and after all this time I’m pretty sure it’s traumatized him. I’m trying to be supportive, but I can’t make sense of why the odds seem to never be in his favor. Ideas?



DETAILS

• My friend/roommate (White, m, 35) has 7 years of experience as a project manager (5 of which he was in a leadership position), with avg time in each position at ~2 years.

• In 2019, I moved said friend (Let’s call him S) from Tampa to Austin after ~5 months of being unable to find work there (note - he was interviewing in Tampa, but repeatedly got to the last interview before someone would tell him that they love him, but they decided to go with someone more senior, or with a closer skill set). It was either that, or he’d be homeless, and realistically at this point probably dead.

• Once here, I helped him spruce up his resume, make connections, go to job fairs and meetups (I think the final tally was 10?) for a year. Put out hundreds of applications, and around 50 interviews, but the same last-step, “You’re great, but no,” kept happening.

• For some of those positions he interviewed for, he told me that when he got there in person for the last interview, the people in question would look crear fallen, and that’s when he knew he wouldn’t get the job because he’s “fat and ugly,” even he’s got a proven track record of turning failing business lines into the most profitable LOB in a company within 6 months. 

• In the last two interviews in January and Feb 2020, one of the recruiters told him over the phone that his, “size and dress are sorely unprofessional,” but like many a shrewd observer of the legal system didn’t put that in writing.

• We caught that trend last year, so he put himself on a diet and workout routine that’s seen him drop ~100lb (370 down to 265), addressed wardrobe choices etc., but still had that slap in the face back in January and Feb.

• After almost 1.5 years without work, he found a program called General Assembly (tech bootcamp - it’s one I went to back in 2025, actually, and helped me get work), and tested into a wage-share program so he could pay for the course once he gets a job. He busted his butt in the software engineering course, graduated top of the class, and started applying for work before the course was done. He was recognized as the most charismatic, kind, driven, and knowledgeable person in the class, and was asked to regularly come back and talk to future students as part of the alumni board.

• We’re about 3 weeks out. He’s had about 12 interviews, 6 of which went to the last interview... and he’s being passed up again. These positions are remote, in the tech world (rather than communication centers). Just this morning a place considering him for an entry level Scrum-lead position (where they had previously hired an elementary school teacher with no project management experience) told him they absolutely love him, think he’s a perfect match... but that they decided to change the role for a more senior scrum position.

• He’s going to every mock interview, resume polishing, digital networking, personal grooming, etc. thing he can find and think of. He’s so solid at this that he’s giving other GA graduates lessons on how to do this, aaaand of course three of those people have landed jobs.

• To some degree, job hunting is a numbers game — it took me ~5 months out from GA, applying to ~200 positions, before I landed something back in 2015. And he gets that - that’s why he’s still working on it. BUT YALL. We’re talking thousands of applications, over 100 interviews, asking for feedback on how to improve each time and getting responses like, “we’re looking for someone with more/less experience,” “You’re awesome it’s just the position was filled internally,” and “Your weight is unprofessional.” Recruiters are baffled, career coaches are stumped, and meanwhile... no job. No money. And worsening health conditions.

• Every time he hears that same, “You’re awesome, but-“ message, it’s reducing him to tears. I’m pretty sure this whole thing has traumatized him (which doesn’t help seeing that he had an abusive childhood, commencing with his dad stealing his college fund and disowning him his junior year), but he’s not giving up. It’s just... I don’t know how to help him with this kind of trauma. Moreover, I can’t figure out why, with so much work and things that should be working in his favor... he’s still passed over.

636,"Hi everyone,

I recently moved cross country to pursue a fellowship I was awarded earlier this year.

Previously, I was really unhappy at my job, the city I was living in, and the way my life was headed in general.

Our  cohort advisors expected us to move to the university's town; but now, I   have no idea why I even came here. All of our classes are online, I'm  isolated in an uncomfortable student and awkward student housing situation, and the  university is in threat of shutting down completely; since COVID seems  be getting worse.

My passion is in  mental health, and I'm in a program for political science. I was  planning on applying and paying out of pocket for a MSW program in my city prior to  the pandemic,  but then everything hit the fan, and now I know I accepted  this  fellowship out of fear. I was worried about getting laid off, and the economy in my home state (Colorado).

I am feeling a lot of regret coming here, leaving my salaried  job, and I feel shame that my friends and family were hyped up about me being here. They will be disappointed to know I am so unhappy, so I've avoided reaching out to them.

I've talked to another person in my program who feels  absolutely the same way as me...I was excited about the social aspect of graduate school prior to me coming here, but everyone is cooped up inside.

I  feel stuck. On top  of this, I signed a lease on an apartment for the  next 9 months.

The good news  is that since I was awarded a fellowship, I don't have to pay  tuition  and I'm receiving a stipend. But I can't get over the dread I feel --  being so isolated and knowing that I'm in my late twenties and time is running out.

How I deal with this regret? For the last two mornings I have woken up out of absolute panic that I made this decision and am going to have to deal with the isolation and reality of the lack of support.

Thanks for listening.",18Aug2020,1

I'm not sending him nudes, and I let him know that. He says he's joking, but I don't know. He also once told me he wouldn't talk to me until I sent a pic. He was probably joking but it gave me weird vibes. In the meantime, the other boy who I mentioned at the beginning told me that he likes me.

641,"This Thursday, my fiancé and I are scheduled to be married via courthouse wedding. I’m truly at a loss about how I should go about changing my name for various reasons.

1) My mother changed my name when I was 6 months old by adding a new first name to my already existing name. Thus, I have four names already, all of which are 6 or more letters. I do not want to simply add his last name to my name because my current name is somewhat difficult to manage with legal documents, licenses, etc due to its length (I live in the U.S.). Plus having five names is not something I want on a personal level.

2) Changing my name at all is worrisome to me because I ran into a lot of problems obtaining legal documents as an adult due to my previous name change. Perhaps since name changes in a adulthood are more common, I will not have the same issues.

3) I’m not sure I am emotionally ready to part with my name. It’s such a big part of me.

4) I just got my bachelors degree and nursing license, so I’m not sure about the process of changing my name on those as well as my passport, drivers license, etc.

5) My fiancé is in the navy and I’m worried that if I don’t change my name, I’m going to run into issues managing our military-related paperwork. 

6) Both he and I want me to take his name in some form, but he wants me to take his name more than I do.

I have considered dropping one of my middle names and adding his last name to the end of mine, however; I’m not sure how that will translate on legal documents either. Seems odd to go from something like John Joe Ethan Smith to John Ethan Smith Jones. 

The main questions I have are: what is the process of changing your name like after marriage? What kind of documents do you have to change and do you have to right away? Has anyone changed their name drastically who has advice about how that translates on legal documents? Can anyone give me advice regarding military spouses with different last names? Has anyone needed to compromise name changes with their fiancé before marriage and how did you decide?

644,"Long post. Very sorry.

I am at a loss in life. The kind of loss that comes from not being able to commit to big changes. Found a new job, in a new town - about 5 hours away from my current environment. I am supposed to start in September, something that I was looking forward to since I am an all around social person that never had problems making friends and liked new places. But the closer this deadline of moving and basically starting a new life has been getting, the more I felt like a ticking time bomb.

This isn't me being a child anymore is what came to my mind. I just hit 28 yesterday, and while I might still be relatively young and hopefully have a decent life in front of me, something in me was beginning to stir. Before in life it was great to see something new, meet someone new, relationships have come and gone, but you adapt and you find something new and great to look forward to. However, this sense for excitement has started to become a nightmare scenario for me now, and I might have taken the only relationship that was worth something to me down with it.

I was always a relatively happy and content person. I'm not attractive, but I got by with girls. I'm not the smartest, but I somehow pushed through university. I was always happy with whatever life gave me, and having some good friends was all I ever needed in life. For years now the main person in my life was my best friend. She was (and still is) the best person I have ever met. Very open, intelligent, funny, and just enough of a crazy freak to compliment my inner thoughts and sense for humor that we always got along amazing. And that was fine. It was fine for many years. I never thought about her in any other context. But for weeks now something in me had started to develop strong feelings for her. ""It's just emotions playing with me"" - either the dread of having to move away from my best friend, being scared that I'd lose the friendship, or just something that was there all along and I just never realized. I still can't make up my mind what made me feel strongly for her.

After weeks of trying to hide and suppress those feelings, I just couldn't anymore. Even my friend saw that I wasn't good. I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep, I was constantly feeling emotionally exhausted and bad. So one evening I drive over to her and just try to explain it. Mind you that this is the person I saw as being the closest to me in life, someone I could usually tell anything to. My best friend and favorite person. So I explain that I have feelings, I know that they aren't good, I also know that she's leagues above me and was always dating hot guys - but none of that mattered to me. I always knew I had no chance, and that is fine. I just had to get my feelings out and talk to her about it. We could always talk about all problems we had with one another, so surely this shouldn't be a problem?

It also felt like things are going to be fine. I explained to her that our friendship is my first priority, she doesn't owe me anything, and I just had to get it out. A few hours of talking ended in her being somewhat confused where to go from there, and said that there was confusion with her as well - but it ended on a positive note where we both assured each other that we will stay friends, she just needs time to get her thoughts together.

I left her some time to think, and yesterday on my birthday she finally messages me again, and after a bit of chatting says she is going to drive to my place for a bit so I'm not alone. We were having some fun and were chatting again like it's back to normal - something I was very happy with for the short moment it lasted.

Then she arrived and things fell apart quickly. I was pretty done with the situation and just wanted to be the friends we always were again. And she was just talking random crap with me at first as well, but you could both see it in how she looked and how she was speaking that things had changed for her drastically. She tried to explain it, and explained that even though she isn't sure whats going on, she doesn't think that she has those kinds of feelings for me, but rather just that I touched something in her that she also doesn't properly understand. All in all it wasn't an overly conclusive discussion and ended on her just being confused and needing a time out again. It was fine by me, although there came some hurtful things in combination with it. ""I think we can still be friends"", words of uncertainty that cut deep. I was supportive and told her she can take any time to get herself together, and that I just hope I don't lose her from my life - surely a friendship that strong wouldn't crumble because of an incident like this when we knew how to talk to each other about even more personal things usually. She said that before I leave for my new place and work, we are going to meet one more time and drink together, ""maybe alcohol will help"" are her words. Also that even though she needs time to collect herself we can at least still chat and it'll somehow work out.

I wasn't a big fan of the day, because it put uncertainty on our friendship, but I tried to understand her and tried to be content with the outcome. The next morning though, the day I am writing this, I told her that I needed to leave a few days earlier after all (something that was making me more stress in general to begin with) and that I'd love if we could go and hang out one more time and talk. She just answered that it has become too hard for her after all, and she needs a lot of time to get herself sorted out, and that she can't see me anymore before I leave. 

The way it was written, short, confused and with little emotional nuance made me really sad. Is this what the best friendship I have has boiled down to? Am I just losing my best friend, my favorite person, someone I feel is integral to my being over me having spot out some feelings? After all these years, I thought it could be simpler.

So now I am here, confused, stressed because of all the life changes coming at me, and the one person that is usually there to help me get through things is the subject of even more uncertainty and sadness.

What do I do from here? Did I do something wrong, can something like this shift back to a positive, is there any action someone like me can take? Are there any experiences like this that someone could share that could be enlightening to how I should feel, act or deal with it?

I am so sorry for how long this post is. Maybe nobody will read this and it won't bring me any answers, but I don't have anyone to pour myself out to, so I might as well just let it out here in writing and put it out to sea.

All I want is my friend back.",18Aug2020,1

4. As I said earlier, I am 23 and have never experienced a real relationship. I wonder if it is normal or is there something wrong with me. I have had a couple of impulsive hook ups that I regret more than anything but nothing worth remembering.
5. I feel like I am incredibly incompetent in my line of work. I chose my college major on impulse and since I will be graduating soon, I wonder if I will find a job despite my incompetence.
6. I am incredibely lazy and unmotivated. I have perfectly wasted the last 6 months when I could've done so much more.
7. I struggle with extremely low self esteem. I never once felt like I was pretty or smart or skinny enough for someone to fall in love with me.

Please, if you have any advice regarding any of the above, share with me. I don't think I am able to live under these circumstances anymore. I honestly want to change but I don't know how or where to start. Please help.",18Aug2020,1
647,"Hello!

So a little background, I have HORRIBLE allergies. In the seventh grade, my parents took me to an allergist to start allergy shots so that I could be semi-normal. I'm allergic to animals, trees, grasses, mold, dust, some medications. Basically, I am allergic to the outside. I am the most allergic to animals (horses get me the worst) and mold. The allergist tried many times to get me to maintenance level, but I had to be given an epi a few times in the office. Eventually my allergist told me that continuing was too dangerous and to not come back. 

Fast forward to now. I'm a college student living in a dorm. Before I moved in, I noticed what looked like black mold on the ceiling. I called housing about getting a room change because I know how allergic I am to mold, and I was told that room transfers were not available and to just test it out to see if I actually have a problem. So I did. I moved in, and I've lived in this room for a little over a week. I don't know why, but I have not had a problem with the mold until last night when I had a very bad allergic reaction. We're talking swollen eyes, hives, sneezing, and trouble breathing. I had to end my shower short to get to my inhaler and down a bottle of benadryl. 

I called housing back and was informed that 1) Transfers to different rooms are not being allowed due to COVID, and 2) black mold is not an issue for maintenance to handle and to ""be more careful."" Can they legally make me stay in a room where the shower causes a serious allergic reaction? I don't really know what other options that I have. Any advice?

I told him I received my census form in the mail and filled out everything online earlier this year as did everyone else in my house.

I ask him if he has any sort of identification on him and he points to a small lanyard hanging from his neck that I can't really see, but he wasn't wearing a mask so I wasn't going to try to get any closer. I told him maybe he had the wrong house because we share a driveway with 4 other houses one of which is ""509 1/2"" and we are just ""509."" He said, ""oh I didn't know that.

I used to run a community space where my friends and I could get together, work, collaborate on creative projects, play games, etc. This space served as my office for my business which was how I could afford to do so. It also forced me to be social, in a way, which is usually uncomfortable for me.

Since COVID, understandably it’s just been me in the office. Luckily we have a group chat room that has been running for years. But since the pandemic has effected everyone so differently, understandably the room has been super quiet.

657,"I (f19) have been stuck in a rut. I struggled through k-12, and junior year of highschool found out I was autistic. At that point it was pretty late for help, and since related mental health issues weren't about to get better my mom allowed me to do my senior year online. It basically ended up being a year full of slacking for me, and once I finished I didn't really have any motivation to do much of anything. My grades weren't about to get me scholarships either, so I felt a bit guilty about putting my mom out for college (as she is already paying for school for both herself and my sister). I decided to take a year off from school. I haven't been doing much during that time, except a little bit of online work that brings in maybe $500 a month, 1k on a good one. Now that the year off is up, I've never felt more like a freeloader, since I haven't actually started taking classes, I'm living with mom and she won't let me help with bills, and I don't have a full job or any work experience for that matter. I imagine covid is buying me a little time to get my shit together, but I just don't know what to do. I've basically stagnated and become a recluse these last two years, and the social anxiety from my autism certainly hasn't gotten better (although surprisingly, not worse either). My mom has lightly pushed for me to take a couple classes, but quite frankly I don't think school is for me, I've always struggled with it and I don't think college would be any better. I really just want to get a decent job and move on with things but I don't know where to start or what to do.",18Aug2020,1
658,"I'm 14, FtM, and I've had this issue for as long as I can remember. Romance and all that stuff has always been a taboo subject in my house - my parents are Muslims raised in Pakistan and dating is not a thing there. I've lived in the UK my entire life and I'm not very connected with my roots.

I remember when I was younger, about to start school, my parents made it very clear there would be no dating. I found love kinda gross at the time and thought boyfriends and girlfriends were beneath me so I happily complied. 

My mindset in primary school was that dating at this age was stupid - it won't last and it's meaningless. I'd seen others in ""relationships"" and they usually lasted a week, and the pair would barely interact with one another in school. I wasn't worried about being with someone at all. 

However I was worried about people thinking I liked them. It was never an issue with girls, because at the time I didn't even know same-gender relationships were a thing. I really worried about boys though.

See, growing up with gender dysphoria, I didn't want people to see me as ""girly"", and since most of the girls in class crushed on the boys frequently, I didn't want my friends to think the same. I had a friend group of mainly boys, they were awesome, we always had fun and basically never argued. Damn I miss them...

Anyways, two or three of them were guys that girls frequently had crushes on. Sometimes one of the girls would start hanging out with us spontaneously only to ask one of them out which was... awkward. I didn't want my friends to think I was the same.


I very clearly remember in like, year 3, when I  overheard people talking about how if you look at someone, and blink a lot, it's flirting. That's when my issue's with eye contact started. I can't look guys in the eye for long, I frequently look away and it's super awkward.  I know that's not true now, but I still have issues. I realise this also may make people perceive me as liking them as I shy away a lot and ummm, *fuck!*

My issue is a fear of societal judgement, so social anxiety probably, I don't have a diagnoses because mental health services are impossible to navigate. I was scared of people judging me as a ""typical girl"" only getting into things for the boys. This was never the case with me ever, but I'm still scared of it.

All these things have caused a cascade of issues now, which I shall list:

    • I'm socially inept. I just cannot talk to people normally.
    • I cannot talk to men at all. The only man in my life I don't have this issue with is my dad. So when I'm struggling in school, I can't talk to a male teacher. If I have to, it's awkward as fuck. Most of the teenage boys (and girls tbf) around me are cunts anyways so I don't willingly seek out their company, but if I have to talk to them, again awkward as *fuck*.
    •I cannot form crushes like a normal person. If I have slight feelings for someone, I can easily shut them down or deny them out of existence. I can't tell if this is good or bad. It sounds good written out I suppose, relationships are still not a priority for me (if someone asked me out I'd say yes probably if they were someone who's personality I enjoyed, but that hasn't ever happened) I can only ever comfortably find a celebrity attractive or just someone who I will probably never meet in real life.

The fear is stupid. My fear of judgement has instances to back it up, but the other one is utter garbage. It's the definition of irrational. I hate it so much, but in the moment it always comes back. 

It's even stupider because the thing is I'm bi. My friends know but it's not general knowledge. I can see the beauty in anyone who is nice. I'm comfortable with my friends who are all girls, aware that I have to potential to feel attraction to them, yet I'm not comfortable with random male cashiers. What the fuck?

I feel if I was fully perceived as male (I'm pre everything) the issue would eventually minimise, but that won't be the case for a while and this shouldn't be an issue in the first place. I also feel that if everyone knew I was bi (I've had people spread shit in the past) I would develop the issue with girls. 

I'm starting counselling soon and I will definitely bring it up there, but can anyone help me out at all. It's annoying and weird and I hate it. Thanks in advance, have an amazing day! :)",18Aug2020,1

671,"Moved in 5 years ago, newest person in the neighborhood, and have been gossiped about since I moved in by immediate neighbors who have behaved terribly. I've ignored the ridiculousness, continued to say ""Good morning"", and ignored the painful, twisted feeling in my stomach, but I am at a loss as to how to handle the latest, and I need advice. 

Latest issue: next door neighbor is a married couple: we'd been friends and they weren't gossips (hurray!), but the wife has a degenerative brain disorder; not sure the other neighbors know. Well, she got paranoid, likely a result of her disorder, and decided I've been after her husband - I am not interested and never got a vibe from him either. In the past 5 years, we sent numerous text messages to each other - he'd write, ""We're going out of town, will you keep an eye out on our place?"" kinda messages.We'd talk when both happened to be out working on our front yards at the same time, mostly about gardening and home repair, but also, he confided in me while talking (on occasion and appropriately) about his experience with his wife's deteriorating condition (he LOVES her), and I also asked his advice about a personal matter that he had experience with in the past and he was helpful. I'd visited her at home and bought them a hummingbird feeder because she wanted to watch the birds from her window. We were friends. Now, she's angry about the texts including a photo of a deer on their property: I texted, ""Hey, look who's visiting your yard!"" and then they took some awesome photos from their windows and sent a couple to me. All normal, neighborly stuff. Well, the wife now thinks the texts - including the deer photo (she's not thinking straight)- are evidence that I am after her husband and she spent two weeks sending me insidious text messages implying just that. It was gross. I offered to talk and finally she agreed to talk but her mind was made up and she  yelled at me and threatened me. I blocked both their numbers after that. And now she's gossiped to the other neighbors about me saying that I've been after her husband. They are shitty people and  believe her. I am getting no ""Good mornings!"" when outside, neighbors are shaking their heads at me when I am working on my yard and the like. They are shitty, There is nothing to this. I know that, but this still hurts.

The husband took a cowardly approach to the matter (I understand he's also going through a hard time but it was still cowardly): when I told the wife that this is a matter between her and husband and she needs to talk with him, she said she did and his response was that he has no idea why I've been texting him - thus giving credence to her delusion that I am after her husband, ""Der...I don't know why she keeps texting me"". The jerk. What he should have said, ""There is nothing in the texts but neighborly, friendly messages. You can see that. We've all been friends. It's a deer, dear. Let's go for a walk"" and then make sure to give her the attention she needs and not give her delusions any attention. 

Advice: I think I am handling the emotional pain well enough, but I am concerned the wife will yell out at me when I am working on my yard - a modern version of ""You harlot!"" or similar - and in front of the other neighbors. I want to do some damage control and not make matters worse. How would you suggest I plan to respond should such an encounter take place to reduce damaging even more my already undeserved poor reputation n the neighborhood?

684,"UPDATE: 

I have decided to give it another year and in that year make attempt to make big changes. Something I forgot to mention in my OP is that we both struggle with depression. The difference is that I medicate and go to therapy to work on it, but he stopped his anti-depressants shortly after we married. 

After we talked last night, he agreed to work on his mental health because it was changing his behavior and impacting me. He has a dr. appt on thursday to see if he can get back on medications and he agreed to go to individual therapy as soon as our insurance can set us up with something. 

We also agreed to do couples counseling because in addition to working on ourselves, we also need to work on how we interact together (obviously). 

I am not going to tell him about my one year deadline. I don't want him to just improve for the year then as soon as I say I will stay, he goes back to how he was prior. I want the improvement to be genuine. However, he does know that I am exhausted by our relationship the way that it currently is and that I can't keep at it like this. So I guess my question now is, do you have any recommendation on what I could try in this next year?

TL:DR I am getting a divorce for sure if there isn't drastic improvement in this next year. After that, I will cut my losses as shitty as that feels.

Origina Post:

Please bare with me. It's a lot of information and it may seem scattered and I am really sorry about that.

Background: We both grew up in strong christian households that thing marriage is super important and all that. My family also made it clear that being anything but straight is wrong or mental illness related. Anyways, they are pretty christian. I never dated despite the offers because I wasn't interested in it. Then I met my husband at 17 and we clicked and dated. Fast forward 2 years and we are married.

The first 6 months of marriage: found out he lied about how much money he had, lied about paying his bills, etc. He was 4 months behind on our car payment and 6 months behind on his wedding ring payments. He also didn't know his bank info. I was mad but tried to be understanding. I took over the finances and got us back on track. I also realized that I was Bi and finally was able to admit it to myself. I ignored it though because what did it matter? I was already married anyway. But I felt like I was lying to myself so a few months later I told my husband. He's a Christian too so I was scared. He was upset but because he said he always suspected and felt like I already knew when we were dating. A part of me wondered if I was attracted to women during highschool but I always shoved it down because of my christian upbringing.

The next year: over time he'd bring up threesomes since I came out to him as bi. I turned it down because I wasn't comfortable with it. He'd mention it anyway which was frustrating. We argued about it and eventually he seemed to understand. A few months later I saw that he had created a snap chat under my name and a new one under his. He was messaging other girls as both of us to sext and roleplay a threesome. He even sent MY nudes that I sent privately to him. I was furious but easy to forgive which I kind of regret sometimes. Also he knew the one of the chicks he was sexting threesome stuff with.

The little things: He doesn't help around the house despite how little he works in comparison to me. I don't believe in gender-roles for cleaning; I think it's dumb and he said so too. I also think everyone should do their share but that if one is working more hours, the other should pitch in a little more housework. I used to work part time while he worked full time and I would come home and clean, cook, grocery shop etc. But he doesn't do the same for me now that the roles are reversed. And with covid, I am still working 50 hrs a week and he is unemployed but I still come home and do the household work it seems.

The last few months: He plays video games all day but gets mad at me when I come home tired from work and in need of alone time. He says I am being mean. Sometimes I am short, but I am not aggressively mean. I usually just say I need a minute to myself before I socialize because I am pooped from work. He doesn't usually appreciate that. I have been thinking I want to leave but I don't know if I really want to. I am scared of starting over. He has good moments that remind me of before we got married so I get confused. I feel lost and I am not sure how to proceed. There's more to the story but I feel like I've already typed to much. Feel free to ask questions or whatever. Thanks for your help.

\*\*I am not perfect in this relationship either, I don't want to come off that I am. Sometimes I have a quick temper or let my anxiety dictate my behavior. This isn't fair to him and it has been something i have been heavily working on for the last year by taking meds and going to therapy. However, in the last year, it feels like as I get better he gets worse and that is something that causes me stress. idk.",18Aug2020,1
685,"I have never been in a serious relationship... until now. My s/o had talked loosely about traveling and meeting his mother. Of course i like traveling until i suddenly have plans to travel then my anxiety kicks in. Long story short i agreed to flying out with my longtime boyfriend from FL -&gt; WY. I hadn’t thought to much about it until i brought it up in casual conversation, which to my mothers surprise, talked about how big of a step this is... which alarmed me as i didn’t think too deeply about agreeing to the trip next week and what the trip really means until she had said how big of a step it is. Now i’m overthinking and worried about first impressions. I’ve never met a s/o ‘s parents before, so i’m not sure how to be, but i have said hello and made some short conversation to his mom (1x) while he was on facetime with her. Should i bring flowers, or is that weird? also should i act a certain way?",18Aug2020,1
686,"So I’m a horror movie enthusiast. Recently I moved into a new flat and it’s right next to a nursery. The flat is constantly hot even with heating off, so the windows are kept open 24/7 to avoid overheating. To state the obvious, as much I want to watch a horror film, as long as there’s a bunch of toddlers able to hear any noise coming from my flat, I don’t. For the past month I’ve waited until 3:30pm to make sure all the kids had been picked up by their parents before watching anything less than family friendly. Although the other day at around 5pm, I had a bit of a confrontation with a parent shouting up at my window that I shouldn’t be watching horror movies when there’s kids around, I tried to speak to her calmly and ask when was a safe time to watch movies, but she didn’t want to have a conversation. I don’t have kids of my own so I didn’t realise nurseries kept kids that late. What would be an appropriate time to watch horror films? Or what’s the latest a parent can pick their kid up from a U.K. nursery. Like I said I’m new in the area and not a bad guy, I had an unfortunate situation where the parent didn’t want to listen and don’t want to get a bad reputation in my own neighbourhood, thanks in advance.",18Aug2020,1
687,"I’ve been resenting my dad lately because he never finished his college degree. He immigrated to the United States when he was 16 and received financial help for housing and school. He’d always tell me stories about his college days and how much fun he was having with his friends and going to the movies, etc. He dropped out two years later; and eventually worked his way to 50k/year when I was in middle school. Combine with my mom’s income, we were fine until the 2008 housing crash. He was out of a job for 2 years..just collected his severance package and unemployment. My mom suggested going back to college for a 2yr degree. So the years went by and he’s been making 14/hr since the 2008 crash.

I feel disappointed and ashamed of his decisions. He was given opportunities to obtain a decent career and he didn’t. He just gamed the system for short gains and free handouts. When my mom immigrated to the U.S, she was a doctor in her home country. She worked as a cashier and obtained a 2yr degree in a D.A program. She misses medicine but her English skills weren’t strong enough at the time so she became a dental assistant.

I’ve been resenting him since my dad doesn’t value education even when I was in school. He failed to get my sister and I proper desks. At one point, I was doing homework in the hallway because my sister was watching tv in our room. Instead of making her turn it off so I can focus, he told me to study elsewhere. We had one desk in our room for both of us to share, crappy chairs and lighting. I feel deprived of a having a good mentor growing up. He didn’t finish college, couldn’t give me a proper study environment, and now I just feel resentment towards him.",18Aug2020,1

689,"My girlfriend and I live with her parents while we save up cash for a nice house (M26/f24) We don't all have the best relationship but we get along ""okay"". 

We have a dog that we adopted and he was a great puppy but he does not get along well with the other dog in the household. It is very bad, he attacks her and it's to a point where we can't handle it. They got along well uo until he turned 6 months old just a few weeks ago.

FYI we own the dog and take care of it's every need, so it's not a ""we bought him together"" deal. We paid for adoption, food, all vet visits, etc. **


&amp;nsbp;

We want to get a professional dog trainer to help us with our dog. He is a great dog and they both get along when they don't fight. 

Here is the problem: the trainer is 600 dollars, and if the training were to fail and we would surrender the dog, we would get kicked out. 

This isn't a joke, and the problem actually is her parents. Her father is very non commit to things, and her mother is as well. We were told we would be getting kicked out because we requested our dog sleep in the kennel at night, not sleep with them, and they didn't like us telling them that. We did not want the dog to develop an attachment issue. 

Her dad flies off the handle with anger and is known to make rash decisions over small, trivial matters.


&amp;nbsp;

Long story short, both my GF and I know the training will fail because ber parents will not be consistent and out in the effort to stick to the training and methods we would be given. We don't want to keep him if he is aggressive towards our other dog, we love him but it's not okay for her to live in fear and potential vet bills from injuries hanging in the air waiting to happen.

However, we also know that if we were to give up our dog to a no kill shelter or friend/family, her dad would kick us out in a fit. What is the best option here? Would you spend your money hoping the problem reaolves itself, or bite the bullet now? 

GF and I are capable of getting an apartment at the least, but we should be able to afford a home as well. We just don't know if it would be best to even try or put our money into a trainer knowing it will fail, but trying to do the right thing for our dog.",18Aug2020,1

Anyway, before reading the rest of this post I suggest you read this first.

Anyway redditiors, I hope you and your family are safe during these times! Btw, sorry for any grammar mistakes I make etc.

Short intro: I'm f16 Muslim girl and I'm about to get my GCSE results in the UK. I live in east London and I don't have the best relationships with my parents. My parents are physical + emotionally abusive and I won't be surprised if I get diagnosed with PTSD, social anxiety or depression but even if to do get diagnosed, my parents honestly think mental illness is a joke.  Honestly, at this point I won't be surprised if I get kicked out so is there any advice on what I can do if I do if the worst happens? Fyi I'm turning 17 on January in case that matters.

Knowing how messed up my mental health was  I know I'm going to have to resit as I got terrible grades except for my recent Bio + Chem test where I had gotten an 8 and 7. Literally right typing up this post, I was getting screamed at by my mother (f52) and brother (m31). My brother swore at me and my mother called me names such as physco and was saying that I 100% have mental illnesses. They think that I'm a selfish brat who can't do anything and honestly at this point, I won't be surprised if I end up getting kicked out of the house. My parents (m55 and f52) + brother think that both me and my sister (f19) are just spoiled brats. My mother always smiles when she sees me getting beat up by my father and when I tell my father about it she quickly hides her smile and claims that she finds the situation 'funny' and 'ridiculous'. My father also accused me of lying about it and doesn't believe me as since I'm the youngest in the house I must be lying and that elders always are right and deserve respect. Even when I lost it and told them that I hate Asian culture and that elders don't respect when they don't respect me, my father hit me multiple times on the head but stopped himself because my brother was there

What's also funny is that one time I was having an argument with my mother and I responded calmly, she lost her temper and screamed at my face and then told my father how  I was screaming at her and while she was calm and talking to me politely. My mother also includes tiny details on what I have done and twists them in a way where I can't deny the truth even tho must of it is lies. My father obviously didn't believe me when he came to me to talk about it and once again accused me of lying. However, when my father and mother had an argument with each other and he was being calm and my mother was screaming at him, he then told me he had believed me on what I had said earlier. My parents, especially my father always mention things how they are my friend and I can tell them anything but as soon as I tell them anything, it's always 'excuses' and 'not even logical'. He even tells me to 'shut my mouth' and that if I even cry I deserve to be hit. I won't lie, when my parents first started screaming at me it didn't scare me as much but nowadays whenever someone raises their voice at me (especially if it's my parents) or give me a light scolding, I start to cry and I literally have to stop myself from crying. Since this scenario happened to me yesterday, I received lots of shouts from my parents.

My parents and brother (mainly my parents) always tell me that they love me and want the best for me but honestly it doesn't feel that way. They always mention how they are doing everything for me such as paying me tuition for my school as I went to a terrible one even though my parents have been told numerous times to move me from my current school and go to a better one as they constantly repeat their own mistakes. They just seem like tiger parents and think that just because they are my parents, God will let them get away with anything and that I would be sent straight to hell. I've did so much research on how parents should discipline their kids in islam and what is allowed etc and when I confront them about it they always dismiss my explanations because I'm only a child.  My parents also constantly bring up old things like how once I was a baby and I decided to stick my finger in a plug socket or how I vomited on my father. My mother always reminds me how one time my grandfather made her stand on the cold floor because she couldn't remember her 2 times tables. Honestly, I find it weird that they remember things from their childhood and that I should be grateful that I'm not going through the same suffering as them yet they constantly call me by my sister's name and don't bother calling me by my name. I remember constantly how my mother would tell me to go to hell and that I should 'shut up' and 'die' or she should 'feed me poison'. I also remember when I lost it and said that I wanted to kill myself my mother said that I should do it and to which I responded gladly and almost went to grab the knife.

There are so many things I want to mention but I'm afraid some of you might think I'm exaggerating when I'm not.

Anyway, I need a proper plan in case I do get kicked out and advice on what to do in this situation.

My parents refuse for me to get a part-time job and would prefer it if I volunteer in a pharmacy. I also can't use public transport as my oyster is going to expire

Here's my current plan:

1. Take my phone  that doesn't work that well and probably go grab a jacket and a water bottle
2. Go to the police station and explain my situation even though I may not have solid proof and I know dang well I'll probably end up crying and stuttering a lot which I might login into Reddit to show then what's happening
3. Explain that I'm homeless and don't feel safe at home",18Aug2020,1
692,"So my former crush randomly texts me checking up on me and asks me what I’ve been up to. That part is fine and nice, but she responds back days later like 3,4,5 days later, which is mildly annoying. So I respond back with the same timeline as to not seem needy or seem like I care more than I actually do. Is she just texting me cuz she’s bored? Or is she just forgetful?

695,"I had twins back in January, so they are almost about to be 7 months old. I live in south Florida with my husband, but I hate everything about living there. I hate that it’s too hot, I hate that I can’t go outside until 7 at night because of the heat, I hate the traffic, and the fact that it’s Florida. I’m miserable all day, everyday that I’m isolated inside and can’t do anything. It also doesn’t help that I don’t have any friends. My family lives pretty far away. A mom in northern Florida, and dad in New England. My husbands family all live in Boca, but they never come over to help out with the babies. The only perk about living there is our babysitter that comes and helps out. 

Recently my husband had some time off from work, so we took a trip up to New England to see my dad. I am from here originally so It was so nice to come home. I absolutely love it up here. The weather is gorgeous, there are people that I know, I’m able to go for a walk in the middle of the day and not worry about giving my babies heat stroke. 

My husband has to go back to work on Saturday, and he could be gone for a few days at a time, so I would be alone with babies no matter where I am. If I stay here in New England, I would have to stay until the beginning of September because of the way his schedule plays out. I am debating whether or not to stay up in New England because I really don’t want to go back to Florida. But at the same time I don’t want to be alone with twins all day because they are just so much work. They don’t ever want to nap, and recently they have been waking up at 330 in the morning and not wanting to go to sleep. I feel like a horrible person for saying it, but if my husband doesn’t get called for work, then he gets a free vacation from the babies basically, while I do all the work.

698,"So, a little bit of a backstory. I have a 5 year old daughter and her dad and I have not been together since she was just about to turn 1. I believe we broke up 3 months before she turned 1. At first, he would give me 20 dollars ONLY here and there to help out with our child. He gave me 60 dollars once only because I used the excuse that I have to get something important for her &amp; I went and bought groceries for us so we could actually eat properly at that time of the month. 

I have been on welfare since she was born, so I don’t get a lot in one month. The max I get right now is $100 at the end of the month, which I have to pay hydro (80-100 a month), internet (75) and my phone bill (100). I usually pay my phone bill with the 100 I get at the end of the month and I’m left with basically nothing until I get trillium which is like $80. 

I smoke weed as well and have been smoking for a few years consistently now. It’s a huge stress reliever for me and I have a lot of anxiety/depression and it just really helps a lot throughout the day. I don’t NEED to depend on it or anything but it really does help and I would rather have it most days than not. 

So the thing is, I want to take my child’s dad for child support because I know I deserve more help than 2 bags of groceries once a month. (which yes that is basically all I get right now). My daughter has been at her dads quite often since covid-19, but before that she was at my house 5 days a week and at her dads ONLY on the weekend, and when school starts in a couple weeks, I’m home schooling her so she will be with me again 5 days a week. 


I guess my daughter took a picture of my cat on her phone and in the background there I was, and right under the cat she was sitting on 2 small bags of weed that I accidentally left out for not even 5 minutes. I remember because after I saw her near my desk I ran and slapped the weed into my drawer. Either way, my daughter is well behaved most of the time and won’t touch things that she knows is mine &amp; that I wouldn’t want her to touch. She does know what weed is because she has saw it other times and I’m not the type of parent to want to hide shit from my child, she knows it’s mommies &amp; that it’s mommies medicine basically. 

I know I was in the wrong for leaving the weed on the desk even if it was only for 5 minutes. I should’ve never even taken it out when she was anywhere near me, my apartment is small so it’s kind of hard to avoid it because she also always wants to be near me, but I was 100% in the wrong for it and I’ll take responsibility til the end of time for that. 

Continuing about the child support.. basically her father saw the picture (I think she actually sent it to him on snapchat, was supposed to be just an innocent cat picture that turned into me being a horrible person for leaving weed on the desk), and I’m like 100% sure he saved it. He threatened that he was going to use that picture against me if I were to go for child support, so now I’m likely not going to go for it because I don’t want to be seen as a horrible person for this. Weed is legal here, I live in Canada but I know I was still in the wrong for accidentally leaving the two baggies on the desk in front of my child. 

My question is I guess, what would you do in this situation? Would you just still go for it even though you know he has that one thing against you (I have plenty more, like his ex girlfriend almost stabbing him while our child was in the apartment, my child actually admitted it to me &amp; so did her father in messages.). 

I don’t want this to turn into a petty fest but I need more help. I’m so stressed most of the time because I can barely get out of bed and let alone get out of bed to go to a 9-5, and I just need more help. My child is NEVER starving because I do what I can to make sure she has food available, but it just sucks that she has a capable father and he has a responsibility and he doesn’t want to pay for her. I cant even pay for any extra activities outside of school and he won’t pay for it either. I asked him for $150 a month and he actually turned it into a fight. 

TLDR; I want to take my child’s dad for child support but he has a picture that my child took that had 2 small bags of weed in it that I accidentally left out for around 5 minutes and he said he will be using that against me if I try to go for child support. I have things I could use against him like his ex gf almost stabbing him while our child was there and CAS getting involved twice recently because of him, but I don’t want to turn this into a petty fest that will ruin our relationship as parents to our daughter .",18Aug2020,1
699,"Hey, to get right into it I'm still getting over a break up. We were in a long distance relationship for about a year and a half. Before we had broken up, my ex was distancing himself and didn't seem all that interested in me. He broke up with me 3ish months ago, and wanted to be friends afterwards. I said sure. 

Ex kept treating me the same. Putting little to no effort in conversation, not replying for days, generally not giving a shit. I dealt with it because I still loved him a lot and thought he might be going through some stuff he didn't want to talk about. 

About a month ago, he told me he got covid. I was freaked out and trying to make sure he was okay. But then he completely ignored me for a week. I was REALLY freaked out, as he hadn't done something like that in a long time. Ex then responded to me and basically said, ""I know I've been treating you badly and I'm sorry, I still feel weird about you, etc.""  I said it's not okay that you've been treating me like this, and I'm starting to give up on our relationship. He said he understood and went to bed. 

The next day was pretty normal. We talked on and off all day, it was just kind of tense and still not a whole lot of effort on his part. 

The day after that, he completely ghosted me. I haven't heard from him in almost a month. I got upset and posted an angry rant at him that only he could see, and I know he saw it. I felt bad about it, but didn't apologize and didn't say anything else to him. 

Last night is when I broke. I found out he made me unfollow him on Instagram - and yes I know how shallow this part sounds, but it really hurt - and I couldn't stop crying. I still can't stop. I texted one of our mutual friends to ask if she knew what I had done wrong and why he was acting this way, but she doesn't know either. I posted another thing that only he could see saying that if he wants to talk to me or ask for any of his stuff back he has to do it soon because I'm blocking him on everything. 

I just don't understand why I still care so much when he hasn't given me a second thought for so long. I hate that I'm crying over him, because I know he doesn't feel nearly this hurt. Why can't I just brush it off and not let it hurt me like he's doing? How do I stop giving a shit?",18Aug2020,1
700,"I got super drunk last night off a very small amount of alcohol, I’m still confused on how I got that drunk.

701,"
My (19f) parents have always been helicopter parents. They were overprotective and didn’t give me much freedom as a teenager, which i suppose is why I picked a college so far away. I chose a private institution where my scholarship covered half of tuition, but my dad and I had to split the loans to pay for the rest, totaling $26,000 or so. For this reason, my dad always called my education an investment. My freshman year, about two months after I moved out, my parents announced they were getting a divorce. My mom has always treated me like a therapist, telling me grisly details about what my father did to her in their relationship despite how much I told her I didn’t want to hear it. Hearing their issues started to have an impact on my psyche, and compounded with other factors to exacerbate my depression. After COVID-19 started becoming an issue and our school shut down, I went to go stay with a friend in the area instead of go home, but that upset them a lot. They kept guilting me, saying I was hurting them by not coming home, even though they both knew I didn’t want to deal with the drama and fighting, or with having my freedom revoked. I’ve worked for my mom on and off for years, so I was getting $200 a month from payroll, but she helped me file for unemployment, so I began getting about $660 a week. We discussed saving it up so that I could move to Atlanta in August, something I wanted to do whether I had cushion money saved up anyways. So I kept saving my money and found a roomate, but my boyfriend owed money to our school and didn’t have any money or parents to help him pay it off, so I lent him the remaining $2000 he needed to transfer or defer his loans. I trusted him to pay it back, and knew how much he needed it, so I wasn’t upset about giving it to him, but my parents motto has always been “it’s not your job to help other people”, so I didn’t want to tell them. Last week, my mom decided to buy me my first car, which I told her she didn’t have to, but both my parents said they “wouldn’t let me move to Atlanta without transportation”, so we went and found a cute car for a really good price. Yesterday morning, my mom calls our bank and gets my statement for the month and sees the money I lent him, and has never been more upset. She keeps saying that I’m a liar and that she would’ve never helped me financially if she knew I helped someone else. I feel awful for lying in the first place, but I didn’t think she would have never wanted to help me again or get me the car (especially when they bought my older brother a car knowing he was a pothead at the age of 16), and now she’s saying I’ve put her into a money pit, because she can’t sell the car and she doesn’t want me to have it. My dad never wanted me to move, and doesn’t want me to move even more now, but I’m dead set on getting there and getting a job and becoming financially stable and independent. Am i a terrible person for this?",18Aug2020,1
702,"tldr at the bottom cause this is looooong. 

hey there. I was always a fat kid. I know now that I have a lot of mental issues (BPD, OCD, SPD, and more!) that mess with my brain's ability to produce serotonin and the like, and food was always a way to feel good. it developed into binge eating disorder, which means I essentially start eating and can't bring myself to stop. 

it got worse about 9 years ago. I didn't exactly realize what was going on at the time, but I was in a terrible abusive relationship that my BPD convinced me was normal. I was stuck getting practically raped time and time again and convincing myself it was normal. I was 17 at the time. by the time it ended, I was terrified of having people touch me, and my binge eating issues spiraled.

I justified it by telling myself that if I gained weight, it wouldn't happen again. who wants to rape somebody fat? I ended up going from about 180 to 210 pounds over a few months.

I eventually stopped the binging by switching to something else - self harm. I cut myself to shreds. and it felt great. this wasn't me punishing myself, or trying to feel something cause I feel nothing. the initial cutting didnt do anything for me, but the feeling as it healed, the burn when I stretched or even just picking off the scabs, was exactly the same as the rush I got from eating (turns out thats a form of dermatillomania from my at the time undiagnosed OCD). I eventually stopped self harming because I was running out of hidden skin and I realized it was an issue.

now, I live on my own. and I'm far away from any family and have no friends, so nobody around would notice me weight going up and say something. and over the past two years, I haven't controlled my eating and I've slowly crept up to almost 300 pounds. I've gotten help for my mental issues, and for about a year now I've been steady on some good meds, but earing the way I do is second nature.

I need to stop. under the care of my doctor, I'm going on a ridiculous crash diet. 500 to 600 calories a day, tons of water, and upping my feel good pills to a higher dose. my goal is to stay on this until I am under two hundred pounds. 

but food is one of the only things I have to turn to. I'm too messed up to make friends. I'm also just not funny, or interesting, and self sabotage like a mofo so I can't see myself finding someone to help. I feel like I have no energy to do anything ever. 

I know this is a lot, but I'm hoping that the people here will have related to at least part of this tragedy. what have you guys done to find happiness? how have you overcome self harm, eating disorders, weight loss, whatever? what fun things do you do that give you that good ol dose of Serotonin^TM ? 

tldr: what can I do instead of eating?",18Aug2020,1
703,"Okay so in the past year, a coworker of mine got me j to a certain philosophy. He would always say ""NO MAN LEFT ON READ"", meaning that the only way to leave is message is either unread at all or answered.
So I took this idea and applied it.

But it also works another way. If YOU get elft on read, even once, then that other person must not think you're worth it. Messaging then stops.

Ive applied this more often to girls I've met on tinder because of covid.

704,"
I’m a bit of a “late bloomer” in the romance field. In school I was too awkward/teen spazz to ever have anyone interested in me, and then in university I focused too much on studying and making friends. Cut to years later and I’m now 29 and I’ve been on a grand total of three first dates (one of which I didn’t realize was a date until I was halfway through it) and one second date. I really do want to be in a relationship but I don’t know how. First theres the classic “how do I meet people as an adult?” hurdle. Then there’s also the arguably bad habits I’ve developed as a single adult who has been single their whole life; I don’t really text people that often, I don’t know how to flirt, I can’t read when people are interested unless they are being EXTREMELY obvious about it and I do really well alone/don’t really get lonely since I’m used to being alone a lot so I don’t reach out too often. I feel like all of these are just bundling me up to be a hopeless partner since I don’t know how to give or participate in courtship or a relationship.",18Aug2020,1

She said “And it’s not like I don’t want to I just felt like it was always me making the plans or texting u.

That was her response to my question.

Keep in mind that I asked the question at 11pm.

We talked about how that isn’t true. I do text her. And even though I don’t make plans everyday, doesn’t mean I never once not make a plan to meet her or surprise her which I did. So it’s not like I haven’t done.

But I don’t have as much as she has. Which she is completely right on.

But I feel like she honestly believes I never notice in our 18 years of friendship make a plan to go and see her.

I did three times. And I remember when I was a teenager, I would ask my parents all the time to take me to them. 

And it hurts that she thinks I never made the effort.

I never once turned down her when she asked if we should meet up.

I would leave college early, I would leave work, I would leave anything I’m doing to meet her.

Yeah when we got older, she asked to meet more, and I did surprise her twice without her knowing I was coming to hers.

So we talked about it. I agreed that 80% of the time. She asked to meet up and the rest of the percentage I asked.

The thing is that she never told me this. She never tells me if she is having a problem with e friendship or problem in life.

She said I bring up shit from years ago, but that’s where her argument is based from.

Because we didn’t talk the whole 2019.

Then later she started saying, I did text more. And kept saying it’s not about the past actions. And it got me confused.

I’m so confused. And at this point she really doesn’t want to talk about it.

one day her boyfriend told her to go and make things up so she got into an argument with her and she moved in with her best friend 

she was so annoyed that she phoned social services on my auntie saying she didn’t feed her and that she doesn’t feed them but that’s not true because i basically lived there most of my childhood and they always fed me and would ask me if i wanted more and feed her almost as much 

she is my aunties only child and she always is saying she is so perfect 

my uncle had to give my auntie some money so she could help and make her house look good for social services because her house is  a bit of a mess 


rebecca got fired from her job for not showing up and she now makes money form an onlyfans

708,"Plz at least read until first horizontal, if can't read whole post.

My interpretation of all this is at the end of this post. 

Plz excuse grammar.

A novelist 40+M replied to my internetfriends post, offered me 25F free writing workshops w/ possible friendship through it. In discussion, he revealed frustrations he’s had with former students/friends. Said he’s “open-minded, but cautious from experience.” 3 weeks later, I say ""hmm ok i see what u r saying. i'll have to think abt it"". This rly upset him. He replied with big attitude. 

His reply:

""Are you for real? (I'm actually laughing so hard right now). Listen, I'm going to respond like this is the last time we're ever going to talk—meaning: it may not be, IT DOESN'T \*HAVE\* TO BE, but I also don't feel like handling you with ""kid gloves"". I feel like that's all young people do nowadays: ""audition"" people to see how kind or sensitive the other person is going to be to their particular plight. TRANSLATION: ""auditioning"" people to see just how much bullshit they're willing to put up with. All part of some larger big-brain scheme to navigate this life without ever getting hurt. Ever.

That's what I see when I look at you. When I scan your profile and peruse some of your friendship inquiries, when I think about that, ahem, ""controlling"" post you made a month ago, the one that prompted me to write you. Yeah, in the context of what I've experienced since, it is 100% clear that that post was some controlling power-play on your part (ie, if you were a male, I would argue that you were full-on exercising your masculinity to its most toxic degree). Don't remember it? Allow me to refresh...

\&gt;&gt;&gt; I really care about friends. I'm looking for friends that are actually going to take interest in each other and put effort to making quality conversation to the best of their ability, which I define by content over frequency. I prefer to set appointments when we can chat without interruptions every so often. For texting, sometimes I reply every couple hours, sometimes every couple days. But when I reply, I try to put more effort. It's why I like to schedule in advance though. I like when both people take interest in each other. I'm tired of always being the one that asks questions, but the other just answers and doesn't ask any back, share about their life, or add anything else to the conversation. &lt;&lt;&lt;

Yeeeeah. See, I figured that was nonsense, but hey, Ima curious guy.

Listen, again, I get it. This is what people do. Especially young people. You hold everyone at arms-length, and wait; wait to see if they're going to be cruel or impatient or judgmental. And then when said person being held at arms-length inevitably DOES lose patience or judges cruelly, it allows said young person to feel justified in having held a friendship that never was, a friendship that was Dead On Arrival... at said arms-length. But in the end, it's just you losing again and again and again, with nothing to show for it. \[OR WORSE, god forbid, you stumble upon some unsavory guy primed to do the REVERSE of what I'm doing right now: ie, they \*pretend\* to be coooool wit whateva; because see, they've also figured out that you're waiting to see if they become impatient or judgmental assholes, and so instead, they chill, gain your confidence, etc, and then right at the moment when you think you've found your knight in shining armor... he ""reveals"" himself (usually right after he's gotten what he probably wanted all along)\]. But the way I see it, if I'm even HALF right, and you really are waiting to see if I'm an asshole or not, I'm here to save you a lot of time and trouble.

Sorry. This, by the way, all came from my seeing the words ""i'll have to think about it"" pop up in my phone. I mean, you were so far removed from my reality, I sincerely had forgotten about you, I just took it as a ghost and moved on; didn't think ill or you or anything. But not only do you respond three weeks later, but to respond with ""i'll have to think about it"" ??? What, like, for 3 more weeks? A month or two, maybe? Kid, get outta here. lmao.

I'll close with this bit of old man advice: START TREATING POTENTIAL FRIENDSHIPS LIKE YOU WOULD A PARIS VACATION. Meaning, in one month from now, if you were going to Paris for the first time, how would you spend that month? I'm talking your pre-game. You would probably spend that month thinking about all the things you're going to do in Paris and see in Paris, you're thinking about all the food you're going to eat in Paris, you're thinking about how good you're going to feel being in, walking in, breathing in... Paris. But what you would NOT be doing... is focusing on how long you'll get to stay. Meaning, you're not going to go, ""Well, fuck, I can only afford to go for two weeks, or one week, or, hell, three days—a weekend only. Yeah, so there's no point in going. I won't even bother."" My point?  NOBODY TURNS DOWN A WEEK IN PARIS NOBODY TURNS DOWN A WEEKEND IN PARIS  No. You go, and you have an amazing, wonderful time and then... you say goodbye, you take that one last look, and then you board the plane and head back home.  That's what friendship is as well, kiddo. Nobody spends their entire week in Paris trying to figure out how to spend five more years there, or how to grow old there. And yes, like friendship, if you're not careful (and sometimes, even if you are) Paris CAN hurt you. But that's never stopped anyone from trying to go there.

Indeed, it's unfortunate, insofar as you'll always be that vacation I never got to have.   But consider all of this my, ahem, own personal ""travel brochure"", a summary of the highs and lows, the depth and range of what it might have been like to travel in my world for a bit.Good luck, little lady.\[ps: And for the record, I'm good at both #Content AND #Frequency (ie, they're not mutually exclusive)\]""

\*\*\*

I tried to clear up the misunderstanding. This is how it went down:

ME: ""when I said 'i'll think about it', i meant about the writing workshop, not about the friendship

HIM: ""bruh... i'm good.""

I replied trying to explain some of my views about what he said. The final section and basically summary of what I said was: ""I think I finally understand your interpretation of the situation. It is a misunderstanding. I am not trying to keep people at arm's length or avoiding being hurt. I am simply not good at replying fast to ppl. I get delayed, especially with responsibilities, mental health, etc. come into play. I replied late to you bc I've had a hectic, bad few weeks, and was finally catching up on a lot of replies I had to send. That was the point of the paragraph which you viewed as controlling. I was simply trying to let ppl know I'm not fast replier, so that ppl don't get hurt or keeping people at a distance if I reply late, like you did. All the other people that responded to my post seemed to have understood that. You were the one that misunderstood. I hope now that is more clear""

HIM: ""You are so missing the point. I mean, you really don't seem to have a clue as to what's just occurred these past 12 hours. For the record: this ""point"" that I'm suggesting you're missing is literally embedded in the last two paragraphs you wrote. It's like, you're Right. There. But you're too busy going on and on about how I'VE ""misunderstood"" something.  No. I have not.   Again, the point is right in front of your face; just reread what you've written... forget about my words for a second and just look at everything YOU wrote.  (Or... keep trying to ""correct"" me. Then maybe one day I'll reveal that you're the one here getting schooled):

ME: I didn't have any scheme. I wasn't trying to audition people or keep ppl at arm's length. I wasn't trying to test ppl. Sometimes ppl are the type to often run late with things. There are many reasons ppl fall behind with stuff they have to get done and thus reply late. That often happens to me. I am trying to get faster with my replies to ppl and stop falling behind. But I am not trying to avoid getting hurt or audition ppl or the other things you mentioned. Also, what you were offering was a class which I wasn't sure if I could handle, bc I'm already struggling with the workload of other responsibilities. That's why I said that i had to think about it. Not the other reasons you mentioned.""

HIM: ""Sure, because you're, like, the most self-aware person, ever.  Listen, just let it go. You're not changing my mind. Everything you say is only serving to reinforce everything I already think of you. Can't we both just chalk this up as a ""bullet dodged""? 'Cause that's how I see it.  \[btw, you still can't face the truth of your actions, can you? just gonna keep on saying the same thing over and over again, about your supposed problem with Time. Yeah, time is the LEAST of your problems, missy...\]""

\*\*\*

My interpretation of his behavior is that he has an assumption of how young ppl behave already. As soon as a response of mine somewhat fit his already made up assumption, he lashed out at me. He tried to teach me the ""right"" way to view friendship, rather than accepting that we have different views of friendship, he told me my view is wrong, and that I'm essentially being controlling and toxically masculine for having my own view. But isn't he the one that's being toxically masculine?",18Aug2020,1
709,"I'm an [F24] currently splitting time between San Diego and LA. I like San Diego, but am over a lot of the specifics of CA living like the high COL, the constant worrying about wildfires and earthquakes, the politics (I'm not heavily liberal), etc. I'm also not particularly into the beach, the party/Instagram culture, and the constant need to keep up with the Joneses, so to speak. Most of all, I'm in school and we're remotely online for the entire 2020-2021 school year which is not a good fit for my learning style. I'd rather transfer somewhere where I can safely socially distance but still attend classes in person (which is most of the other colleges in the US outside of CA) So I guess what I'm mainly looking for is:

- Fairly mild weather. Had to nix most of the Northern/Northeast US because of the winters

- A fairly large-ish city (100k+) but with a lower COL relative to LA - not expecting anything dirt cheap of course

- I enjoy nature, primarily lots of forestry and greenery with lakes and waterfalls; lots of color if that makes sense. CA is universally brown and off-brown

- Dating/percentage of single people is not really a factor

- Somewhat left leaning/centrist political views if possible? Not looking for extremes on either end and especially nothing in the conservative Bible belt

- Ideally, a place with a community college and university in close-ish proximity. I'm finishing up my transfer credits now

But the problem it's starting to make me a little uncomfortable, not because he knows me well i don't mind that really
But alot of times when I'm doing something that I told him about and he made some sort of joke about I'd remember him telling the joke or like when I go to play my flute I remember he's the one who pushed to start playing it again after I stopped 

You see where I'm getting at? It's like most of the day even when I'm not talking to him he's on my mind in some way or another and not in a romantic way

But at the same time the thought of losing him or us stop talking really saddens me 

I just i don't know what to do about it
Is this healthy? Is the friendship going somewhere? Would it be okay if I just stop talking to him completely now out of fear of attachment for someone I know we might lose the friendship in the future?

He was really clueless to not know that I was dating his friend, but in the weeks leading up a dance, he kept touching my shoulders heavily. He sat behind me in class and he would reach forward at unexpected times to congratulate me or ask to me in a group by grabbing my shoulder and lightly shaking. I was very uncomfortable and his hand was extremely heavy on me. I told my boyfriend that I didn't like him doing it and I was uncomfortable just because I wanted to confide in him. He told me I should tell his friend that I wanted him to stop. Now everytime he did this thing, like when we were passing my each other in class or when he sat behind me, it was only me he was doing it to. I'm kinda meek sometimes and I didn't want to upset him because I didnt know anyone else in the class. However, everytime he did it, I made an obvious I don't like it face and winced away. He stopped when he asked me to the dance and I told him my boyfriend already asked me. He was shocked that I was dating and stopped. Even though... I had my boyfriends picture on my phone and I hung out with my boyfriend every day. 

Now I'm regretful I didn't tell him off and I have his snapchat still. I want him to know not to do that to any other girl but I don't know if it's that big of an issue shoulder grabbing or if like... it's not that much of a shock (even though it was to me).

He says it goes a lot like this: I am happy for a week - feeling productive, seeming happy and positive, wanting to do things, be outside, cook (which I enjoy doing), get out of the house etc. but then the following week (or more often than not he says almost 2 weeks or so), I am in a depressed mood, irritable, unproductive, with no motivation at work or home and that I want to lay on the couch and do nothing. He is having a hard time dealing with this because he feels like its a problem and that he needs more help than \~1 week a month when I am in my good mood.

719,"Just now i hit my sister, we were having a fight over something stupid, she thought i had taken her clothes some dumb shit like that.
She confronted me about it and i told her i didnt, she instantly lashed out on me pushing me and shoving me
(shes 20 in 15) then she proceeded to spit on my bed
I got tierd of being her punching bag all the time and what she just did to me was awful, so i did the petty thing and trew a glass of water onto her bed and locked myself in.
A few minutes pass and shes infuriated banging my door until chuncks of wood came out, she was so pissed she began crying and begging me to open the door so she could confront me face-to-face
I did so and we both cried as we argued, finally she had enough and she ripped my bed sheets off, she spat in my face, but i wasnt angry - i was scared, she had threatened to chop my neck up before, stranggle me, i acted Involuntarily and my only focus was to get her out as soon as possible and lock my door so I'll be safe.
What happened next was nothing like I had wanted to happen, i slapped her(more like shoved her) on her left eye out of my room, it worked and i locked my door before realising the horrible thing i had just done to my own sister, i instantly unlocked it to check if shes alright but she  wailed and closed her door saying ""i wouldnt even do that to an animal and you would do that to your own sister, any love i had for you is gone"", I broke down, even now as i type that down i cry, i instantly apologize more times than i could count i brought her an ice pack and later sone chocolates and kept then out her door, she wont open it, Ive messed up...really...really badly, i dont know the extent of her injury (or if there was ohne at all) but i am horrified with my self
I am a monster just like those men on tv who hit women,
What the hell is wrong with me i think I've fucked our relationship up forever, she may have hit me countless times but never has she dont anything as disgusting as i did to her.
What can i do she wont come out and take the ice pack, she wont respond to my texts, she wont respond to me calling her... What can I do to help her and to make sure i dont do anything dumb again, im not an agressive person im an akwark gay kid whoose never thrown a punch and now Im an abuser HELP ME",18Aug2020,1

724,"First of all I procrastinate a lot. I always have. As I got a little older, I began having a really hard time finishing projects. I can spend hours drawing or writing for example and then just lose interest all of a sudden. I have so many unfinished drawings in my drawer and countless of unfinished stories hidden away in my phone.

It’s just my hobbies, so it’s not that serious. It would just be really nice to be able to actually publish a story or something. I just read one of my prologues and I actually really loved it, which is something I rarely do. Then I opened up the first chapter, skimmed it through, liked it but gave up anyway. I’m thinking about discarding it and starting over with a new idea *again* .

I usually hate my writing, even though I can see obvious improvement. I’ll find small flaws like maybe starting a sentence with “He” too much, so I switch that up. Then it’s not descriptive enough so I add descriptions. THEN there aren’t enough emotion shown in the writing so I add that as well until I finally can’t find any flaws. Then I discard the work and start something new entirely.

729,I have been told so many times that to be able to get a job in my field I have to be willing to move for a part time job. I just found a part time position that I qualify for at my ideal workplace that is across the country. This initially got me really excited but seconds later I realized that I have so many things going on in the next 5ish months that I really would hate to miss out on. I have a wedding that I'm a part of in January and my brothers 21st birthday in December and my friends 21st in October. I would feel terrible to miss out on these things. I could possibly be able to fly back for the wedding but it would be expensive given I would be moving for a part time position. I do not know what the pay rate would be but I do know minimum wage is much lower in job state than it is in home state. I would need to get a new car since my current one wouldn't make it cross country which I do have some money saved up for but would also need for other expenses. I have also been dealing with a news of a health issue that I'm trying to get an understanding of and moving would mean new doctors which is also nerve racking for me. And on top of all of this of course all of the corona virus crazyness makes it hard too. Maybe all of this worrying is for nothing since I don't know that I would even be selected. But this position is at a place I have interned for so I feel like I have a pretty good shot. I just don't know what to do.

730,"I turned 18 six days ago

On the build up to that day, I was fairly excited but that was only because I was getting a new phone. I'm easy to please, thats all I wanted on that day.

Now, almost a week into me turning 18, I feel like the world is closing in on me and there is nothing I can do, I am scared, I hate being an adult already. Let's review what has happened to me over the last few days

I got my A-Level results, the biggest grades of my life and my final results from secondary school. It felt like getting a bag of bricks thrown in my face, my results were dogshit. Thankfully, the British government appealed all of them so my grades are better but it didn't change the impact it had

I applied for Universal Credit, I just thought, I am 18 now and I am on a gap year, the job market is garbage right now, I might as well sign up for it. The process was simple enough but signing all these documents and shit and getting these big phone calls from the council was a little strange and a stress for me

I had a party on Saturday. It wasn't my idea, it was mostly an excuse for my parents to see some family members and get sloshed drunk. I don't drink alcohol. Not a drinker, never inherited that from my family but I was pressured a lot by my family to. I didn't drink drink, but I did end up taking a shot which I immediately spat out which my older cousins convinced me to do. I don't want to drink but it feels so awkward having every one else around me do it. I feel like a child which I guess is what I want but no, I don't know anymore. Is drinking just a part of adulthood?

I applied for a provisional drivers license and I am looking to get lessons. I know that this ain't that big of a deal, hey, kids younger than me know how to drive but it feels like a big deal for me. Driving is one of those things where it is one of the first steps into being a grown up. I would love to drive but the whole process of applying felt odd and mature. It kind of made me stressed

I also became a member of the Labour Party. It was my choice, tbh, it was just to make my university application look a little more deep. It still felt like a big deal for me, but thats minor

Today, I applied for UCAS, my first step into going to University. I would love to go to university, I love the university lifestyle but now that I have gone ahead and did it, fuck I am scared. The idea of living away from your family is sort of scary to me now that I have done it. I'll be independent and live on my own. It would basically be the first hour metaphorically of me being an adult

All of these things, all of these big steps in my life have just been piled on to me within less than a week and fuck man, I don't know what to feel, I am scared. I don't want to grow up. I liked being a teenager, I know I still am but you get what I mean. I liked being this kid who didn't need to know about the world and all he needed was to just relax and have fun with his friends. I have officially entered the point of no return

731,"Hello back again!!! Quick explanation: I recently found out I had a cyst in my brain near my pineal gland. My first and second updates, I was very worried because I was told I needed brain surgery to have the cyst removed. Today, I met with a neurosurgeon to go over everything and ultimately decide if I need surgery or not. The surgeon was really nice and explained that I do not need surgery! He said the cyst is nothing to cause concern over currently since it’s benign. But he does want me to come in to have another mri in December to make sure it’s not growing. He said that surgery was not necessary and that it was really risky regardless, so he wouldn’t recommend getting it removed unless absolutely necessary.

735,"Hello, we have been together for 10 months, I have kinda battled depression my whole life, and when I met her I felt so happy, seeing her, talking to her, spending time with her kids gave me a motivated outlook on spending a future with her and growing a family. Last month however I just started feeling numb, emotionless about everything, this went on for a week and then the symptoms went back to normal. However again these past 2 weeks it’s been that same anxiety inducing feeling of falling out of love.

Every time I would see her kids I would be playing with them having a good time, seeing her I would rush up and love on her and spend a quality evening with her and the kids.
I’m just damn afraid that I’m falling out of love, but deep down I know I wanna be with her and make it work. Just the numbness has me thinking if it’s either depression or the out of love feeling.

For as long as I can remember I’ve had bed wetting problems,(sometimes during the day but only if I can’t make it to a restroom) I’ve had multiple doctor visits for it and I’m actually seeing a psychiatrist for it. The medication Im taking for it now is an antidepressant or something I think but it makes me like really mad when I take it so hopefully I can get it changed. 
I’ve been trying a lot of just natural things to not do it as much and I’m down to like three or four accidents a week at night and maybe one or two during the day. it was almost every night before I started trying stuff on my own. 
I just got in a huge argument with my mom though because I Hate! Wearing pullups omg. If I’m down to a few accidents a week I feel like I shouldn’t have to wear them every night? If it’s not happening more than it happens it just doesn’t make sense to me? But she’s talking about like if it only happened once a month it would be okay to not wear them. I can’t even imagine doing it that little tbh. She’s crazy! How often would a normal person say is okay to not wear them? Or do you have any ideas that I could bring up to help?? 
Also is it normal to like not be allowed to wear anything over them at night?? Because I have to get ready for bed around 7 but most of the time I don’t even lay down until like midnight because my adhd meds.... so thats a long time to not be wearing anything just to make laundry a little easier right? 
I kinda feel like she’s just trying to make it embarrassing tbh. But idk if that’s how it’s supposed to be of not, don’t people normally just wear like a shirt? I was really close to not having to deal with that but right before I started trying stuff on my own, I was wearing sweatpants and lied about having one on under them which would have been fine and all but I fell asleep on one of the new couches and freaking peed all over it 🤦🏼‍♀️ she actually got mad about it though and it sucked for me because I had to clean it in front of her and her friend and her friends kid IN NOTHING BUT A PULLUP because she made me put one on and I was crying so it was just a mess. Plus she had to add that her friends kid was half my age and wouldn’t have done that. Thanks mom.

738,"So I know people usually want to stop giving fucks. But I want to start giving fucks about things.

Somehow I've reached the peak of passivity and Zen in my life. I used to be an overachiever then I was average and now I've become a loser.

Grades falling?meh
Loosing friends?uhm
Hurting people that care about me?hmm
Procrastinating?hmm
Corona virus killing millions of people around the world?uhm


I see people my age, living their lives, networking, being productive, making plans, studying hard, taking iniatives, making the most out of things while I just eat, sit on the sofa, and sleep.

I hate it. But I can't bring myself to care enough. I know the consequences of the nihilistic course of my thoughts and they terrify me. But not enough to actually make me do something about it though.

I don't want to waste myself away and I'm acting way too aggressive and weird for people around me to step up and guide me.

I don't know how to get out this limbo of passivity and 'go with the flow' type of life and get back my type A personality.

We rarely see each other actually, and we stopped communicating all together because I felt like she abandoned me by not calling and called it quits.

740,"Oh boy, this one will be a long one but here we go.

Back in early 2015, I befriended a Japanese boy named Taki in my college. We were good friends. But slowly things deteriorated. He had a short temper. He would get angry easily. Also, when we were around, he was zoning out constantly. Furthermore, he was extremely damn pushy and wanted to hang out with me all the time and would constantly text me about it. Also, he smokes weed a lot and play a lot of runescape. He didn't have a car, and I was the one who had to give him a ride to everywhere. He was also living with his parents.

This is how our friendship ended for a time back in 2016. We were walking in this mall and decided to get some fries from Ruby's. There was a cute Mexican waitress there. He told her that he was a photographer and would like her to model for her. The truth of the matter was that he didn't even have a camera. He got a Canon camera from Target, which he was going to return later. Then asked me to give him a ride to a beach for practice. I said yes. But when that day came, I noticed my iPhone was broken and I need to fix it. But he told me that I have to keep my promise. He annoyed me to no end. So I brought him to that beach, then returned back to Apple store. After that, I went to the Ruby's and told the waitress the truth, and after that, I didn't pick up Taki from the beach. After a Facebook call where we argued with each other, our friendship was put on hold.

About three weeks ago, I finally finished my university and decided to check on him. He was still in the same college. He was exactly in the same position that he was 4 years ago except that he bought himself a real camera though and was actively trying to pursue photography. I decided to start my friendship with him again because I was bored. For whatever reason, I was more immune to his peer pressure and he was more respectful to me. 

However, another person was also added to our friendship. A Japanese girl named Reina. She is a little bit chubby, but all in all, is an incredibly kind girl. And this is where another whole new drama has started.

I found out that Taki has been manipulating and using Reina for a long time. For start, at one point, he got scammed out of $500 in Runescape, so he forced Reina to lend him that money and told her he will return it back. Also, since Reina also has some weed addiction problem, he offered to help her by taking all of her stash and selling it for her. But so far, nothing has come of it. Furthermore, whenever they go out, he asks Reina to buy him food and would tell her that he will pay her back, but he never does. One of the most prominent of this kind of incidents would be when we he ordered a boiling crab and 1 pound of shrimp. Me and Reina ordered 1 pound of shrimp and shared it with each other. That whole order was about $80! I paid Reina immediately. But to this day, Taki has not paid her back anything for that meal. 

The thing is pretty much every day, Taki constantly texts Reina so she would pick him up with her car so he can do photography. Reina spends a lot of time, energy, and gas just to be with him, but he is either zoning out, doing photography, or would get randomly angry at him. Reina comes from a broken household and is not super-rich. She never protests because she is extremely kind and caring and have a crush on him. But she just can't take it anymore.

Recently, when Reina texted him that ""hey I am with a friend, I can't pick you up. But we are still friends"", he texted her back ""fuck the other friend you are with, I know you never cared about me, I will disappear one day"".  (I summarized their texts here, but the point is that Taki implied that he will commit suicide)

Anyway, I know I have to do something. But I don't know what to do. He always carries a knife with him, so I fear he might do something stupid if I confront him face to face. I was thinking of messaging him over discord and say to him that if he doesn't pay Reina, I will tell everything to his parents, to the college, to his boss, and even Reina's mom. 

But what you guys think?

tl;dr my friend is constantly manipulating my other friend to give him money.",18Aug2020,1
742,"To keep it short I am a 20 year old American freshman in college studying biology. I come from a poor family so I can’t afford a lot of things, especially healthcare, and I have both mental and medical problems. I know that millions of Americans such as myself are suffering from potential treatable/curable diseases but are not financially stable to seek treatment. If I or anyone in my household caught COVID and needed immediate medical attention we’d be out on the streets from medical expenses and it’d be more pragmatic to just die. No one, in this day and age, especially in a first world country, should live this way. I really want to stop this. My goal is free universal healthcare and I don’t care how “unrealistic” that sounds. My question is what career path do I have to take to be able to make such changes?

The guy I have a crush on is also pretty shy and the two of us hardly ever speak because we are both so awkward. Things get complicated when we bring in my friend. I feel weird calling her a 'friend' because we used to be close and lost contact and then recently reconnected. She is really sweet but I just am not super close and comfortable around her yet. 

The complications start bc she is the one who knew they guy I have a crush on first. She recently got out of a  2 year long relationship and she is a serial monogamist - i know its only a matter of time before she jumps into another relationship. She has previously made comments about the guy I like (and how she finds him hot, among other things I wont repeat), but I never really thought too much about it because she had a boyfriend. The other day she basically said that the guy and i are pretty well suited but that if anything were to happen between me and this guy that she would be really jealous.

How can I approach this? This is my first crush, the first time that I have ever felt open to being in a relationship BUT I dont want to make things weird with my friend.

746,"It turned him into a completely different person. He used to be happy, even bubbly sometimes. Called often, could hold a good conversation, and we truly KNOW each other. We'd been friends for almost ten years, since middle school. 

He started taking ADHD medication a short while ago - which was followed by anti-depressants, adderall, sleeping pills, etc. All to contradict the side-effects of the others, but just seem to continuously make everything worse. He can now only focus on one singular task at a time. He forgets to eat, is very easily annoyed/angered, and is now an insomniac. Started vaping nicotine. He never calls anymore, and never answers when I call him. When he did last, and we saw each other, he couldn't even hold a real conversation. He loved to play music, and doesn't anymore. 

Now he waits (daily) for his two new ""friends"" to give a damn about him enough to let him come over and feel bad that he's intruding on their personal lives (they're a couple, and seem to only hang out with him when he asks them to). All they do when they hang out together is go on their phones in the same room, go to mexican food places (he doesn't even like mexican food), and watch movies that the couple seems to wish they could watch without him there. I wish I understood why he chooses them, and not me. 

He was an amazing person, and much happier before he started all of those medications. I don't know how to deal with this, anymore. How do I? It feels like he died, and I can't do anything to help him other than what I've already done. Any advice would be great.",18Aug2020,1

750,"Hey all I been living with my 2 roommates for a few months now and we've kinda gotten settled into our routines. We all get along super well but I'm always self conscious about the amount I clean. Honestly I don't enjoy cleaning at all (and almost refuse to do it) and thus do everything I can to limit messes. For example, every time I finish a shower I wash away any hairs and any leftover soap that may be in the tub or the walls, I wipe down the toilet seat before every use and wipe it down again along with the lid and rim of the bowl after every use, I eat takeout for most meals and use plastic utensils and paper plates for meals made at home along with a reusable water bottle so I have absolutely *zero* dishes. Also due to my increased waste (from the paper and plastic), I take control of the trash and make sure its taken out whenever full. Of course there's a lot more examples but I hope that helps paint the picture.

Now to my dilemma, I'm just a naturally self conscious person (due to some past life experiences) and I'm super thankful for my roommates being accommodating and us being able to balance the upkeep of our home based on what we want/don't want to do, but I always feel like I'm not doing enough. I'd love to do things to spoil my roommates but just buying food and sweets for the house is getting old because we all prefer to stick to our diets anyways.

So in conclusion, I'd love to find different ways to help my roommates be happier and make sure I can help contribute in many different ways. I have it very lucky and have such amazing roommates that I want to spoil them if possible and have reasonable funds to do so (not enough to send them on vacations lol but I can buy anything within reason). Looking for help or guidance, thanks!",18Aug2020,1
751,"So I (17f) am the oldest of 4. The youngest is 4 f- my stepsister. My mum (39f) is her bio mum. 

4's dad has Aspergers and it's widely accepted in my family that 4 has some variant of Aspergers or ADHD, although she hasn't be checked. 

4 would be described by many as a 'nightmare child'. On top of the normal 4 year old things, she is also violent (towards humans and animals- both threats and actually being physical), she's rude, and unusually careless for a 4 year old, if that makes any sense? 

Well, my mum has recently discovered that pretending to be angry, and shouting actually makes my sister do things (like tidying her toys, or getting dressed). 

The issue is that I have (self-diagnosed) PTSD \* from my younger years from when my dad was in my life and shouting is a major trigger for me, causing panic attacks and excessive skin picking on my fingers (they're scarred beyond repair). I also get so anxious I sometimes black out or am sick.

Whenever my mum 'pretends' (she's not really, she's actually angry, but doesn't want to be judged probably) she goes into sicko mode- stomping around, screaming and shouting, kicking things, knocking things off shelves, and her most recent tactic, throwing 4's favourite toys in the bin (which obviously is devastating for 4). She then acts like nothing happened and expects us to go back to normal, even though she just screamed at 4 for 15 minutes straight, berating her and ruining her stuff. I have no idea if throwing 4's stuff away is for show, or what.

What do I do? There is no way I can talk to anyone I know about this, especially my mum.

\*  should clarify my PTSD is a mix between self-diagnosed and actually being diagnosed. Before the lockdown I was seeing multiple people for my issues and I was told multiple times by my therapist, doctors, anyone I was seeing, that I had PTSD, but it hasn't been documented yet for forms- so I say I'm self-diagnosed.

753,"My ex boyfriend is going frantically insane because I got over him months ago. We were together for about 8 months and then kept hooking up for another a few months after the breakup, because I was emotionally unstable af. It was a really messed up and toxic situation. He always treated me like crap and I always thought that was the way I should be treated, until I realized later on that’s not how it should be. 
He put his hands on me as well multiple times during our relationship so that really pushed me even more to get away from him. 

After I stopped hooking up with him, he kind of kept drawing back to me since he realized I was drawing away from him because I had met somebody new. But, he didn’t know I had been seeing somebody. I started to really get over my ex after being with this new guy for awhile. The new guy didn’t treat me significantly better but I felt better than how I was with my ex. 

My ex also moved to Maryland for school so I definitely didn’t want anything to do with him then. Once quarentine hit all of us, it was like all his attention was glued to me over 700 miles away. He would not leave me alone. Eventually I just got tired,  it’s like he wants me all to himself, yet he doesn’t want me. I blocked him on all social media there is and called it a day. That was the first time in my life that I was really done with him. 

Then, in May he creates a fake profile just to text me. I blocked him immediately because I did not have the time nor energy. I recently got a new phone but I still have the same number, so none of my blocked numbers transferred over to my new phone. 
My ex texts my like crazy because I guess one of his friends told I moved on &amp; he saw a video of me with a guy who he knows of, who is literally just my friend. 
So he’s going crazy calling me this and that, mad af. I don’t respond and continue on with my day. Then he starts creating fake profiles per usual to express his unwanted anger and attention.

So basically long story short at this point idk what to do. Every time I block him I just know he will create new profiles to stalk and harass me, but I just don’t know what to do. I can’t talk to him, he’s too childish and petty. I need advice as to getting him to leave me alone for good.",18Aug2020,1

760,"  

My father genuinely shows no interest in me or my life for 2 years now. ( I am 20 years old ) He found a girlfriend 2 years after the divorce ( awesome person by the way, love her, very good influence on him) and he completely forgot about his oldest son. I don't expect attention 24/7, I am a grown man sustaining myself today, but I would appreciate that when we talk, even if it's every 2 weeks, he wouldn't answer like „ok“, „good“, „proud of you“. When we talk, I am the one leading the conversations. I wanted to prove this to him, but he would say he gave me money to fly Germany, so I could go and work there. 1 year ago I moved to another country, namely Austria, ( in Germany I had a summer job) and started sustaining myself to prove to him, that he is treating me like a car, that being putting fuel in me as if that's all I need. He would be giving me money, but no talks, no dedication. He would sit down with me, but only if I wanted that, and still he would never left go of his phone. But with other people he would be listening very carefully. His excuse? He was busy. That cannot be true, since he is busy for me but not for others. I proved my point by finding a job in a new country and sustaining myself. My mother came and visited me. My friend from another country visited me.. My brother will spend money for a covid 19 test next month to see me, ( I wanted to pay ). I am no attention whore, but he says he loves me and cares for me, even though his deeds say something else. I tried talking to him many times and I told him, that this is not okay, he should be honest to me and tell me I am a piece of shit, a retard, an idiot, then I would understand it, but to say you love me and not give a damn about me is hypocritical. Last time I was in my homeland it was for 2 days only. Of those 48 hours he got minimally 24 only, other people got like 1 or 2 each. Also deduct the sleep for each time roughly 7 hours. After a year living in another country, he never came to visit me, even though I offered to pay for the gas. The problem is that he would say he wouldn't have time, I would believe him. Then he goes with his new girlfriend to the sea and play with her son like he was his own completely ignoring me. My family supports me. Many times I have tried to sit down and tell him, that I have a feeling he doesn't give a damn about me. He would always deny it pointing out how he spent money for this and that etc. Well I also intend to take care of my parents when they get old, but I won't be telling everyone how awesome of a person I am for doing my factual duty. Today I wanted to talk to him about this and just asked him in a calm way why he doesn't want to see me. I pointed out that he is not giving me money anymore and asked him, in which way he is different to me than an acquaintance who talks to me from time to time. He got mad as hell and started insulting me since he couldn't find an answer to my argument. Am I the asshole here??",18Aug2020,1
761,"I don't know what to do or feel. My friend and I had a crush on the same girl for a few weeks (Oct 2019) but we get along just fine.

He decided to finally start moving and get closer to her. Before the whole Covid situation (Jan 2020) he admitted to her that he liked her but she put him in the friendzone.

Now, I kind of regret telling him. I've only ever talked to her a few times in school but never online (since I never had a good reason to), but now I really wanna contact her om social media.

This is just one example, this happens all the time, either we are together buying clothes etc.

She is always trying to manipulate my opinion and force me to buy something she wants even I will be the one wearing it for years, just like glasses. 

We were at the bank and she insisted to keep my bank account card even though I wouldn´t withdraw any money off it because I respect the fact that she was the one putting few euros there monthly for past years.

764,"Sorry if the title isn’t accurate it’s the best summary I can think of. 

My brother is an addict, he has been since he was 18, and my mom has tried to get him help with assistance from my uncle. Yesterday they found out he was trying to get drugs and had me open the computer so they could read the messages. In the argument my brother decided to say “ atleast I’m not gay, not on Grindr, or suicidal” leaving me no option but to admit I was. My mom knew, I told her when I figured it out, but my uncle and brother ( I guess he did know) and the rest of my family didn’t. My friends and coworkers knew as well. 

I’m a private person if any of my cousins or family asked I’d tell them but I always felt my sexuality was a part of me not what defined me. And when the time was right if let them know, I had already started, telling a cousin a few weeks back and planning on talking to my eldest brother when COVID was gone. Knowing that my other brother would just tell the world about me I decided to publicly tell my family so atleast it was on my terms through text and FB. My family has been great but I feel fragile, sad like I am I’ll and I just want to be left alone. 

I sat down with my mom last night and before I could talk to her about kicking my brother out she beat me to the punch. She told me she can’t kick him out because she’s afraid he will die on his own. She kept asking me what can she do, but the thing is that is what I need. I need him gone, I moved home to support my mom when my dad was sick and he died this January and my brother has done nothing to help my mom during this time. Besides outting me, he has caught part of the house on fire, stolen my mom’s car, taken heroin, stolen money and jewelry, the list goes on. 

I don’t know what to do, if I move out it will put a bit of stress on me and I will honestly feel like I’m betraying my mom and not be there for her, but my brother is not gonna change. My family has said for years that when he’s clean it will be better. I grew up with him, he never shows remorse unless it’s for sympathy, he always believes he’s right, and he always feels we owe him something. All the drugs did was make him worse.

766,"So, whether you find this pathetic or not, I've never actually had a relationship that counts. I had two in Middle School that might count, but I was so young that I don't personally consider it.

I was already pretty socially and emotionally stunted, when I went into high school I was put on a medication that made me extremely emotionally unavailable, not to mention that I was extremely depressed, and going to the school therapist in an attempt to work things out.

Any relationships that I had in high school I don't really count, I didn't really feel anything. I wasn't really able to. I tried, I really did, but it didn't work.

So after I graduated high school, I started getting my brain sorted out, my family tried to get me into dating because I very much wanted to leave the town I was in, because it was awful there.

They figured getting me into a relationship in that town would mean that I wouldn't want to leave and that they could keep me forever.

That didn't work, because the only relationship that I was in was with a guy that I wasn't really interested in, but I forced myself to be with for the sake of my family.

He was sweet, until he took my virginity like a month into the relationship and then he wanted ""a break"" for two whole weeks... and then he said ""our paths are not the same"" like bro, just fucking own up to the fact that you wanted to bang me that leave me, I don't want a poem, just say it real quick and get the fuck out of my face, I do not care.

But yeah, those are all the relationships, and none of them worked out because I was emotionally unavailable, or I wasn't interested yet forced myself into the relationship.

Meanwhile, the guys that I have been interested in have only ever rejected me. Every single one of them. Not like I'm ugly or anything, many people actually see me as very attractive, personality-wise and physically. I take good care of myself.

These guys just didn't want me, because they were not looking for a relationship or they wanted someone else.

And please don't bash these guys in the comments, they were very gentle and sweet when letting me down. They made sure that I knew that they weren't disinterested because of appearances or how I was.

They are not bad people for not being interested. Please don't insult them, they do not deserve that.

But, the rejection still hurts, and every time I got rejected, I kind of receded further into myself, getting less and less emotionally available each time.

It has been about a month since my last rejection. Same reason, just not wanting a relationship, and I get that.

But I have trouble finding my type attractive now. I have trouble feeling anything. I'm scared that I've been hurt so much, that I won't ever feel love again.

But middle school was a long time ago, so I guess it won't be that bad. I can't really miss the feeling if I don't know how it feels, right?

Anyways, does anyone know how I might get my sensitivity back? Meditation, medication? Maybe some mental exercise?",18Aug2020,1

Sometimes I feel blessed for having them, but other times I feel like they don't care for me. I like being with them, because they make me feel like I belong and I do have fun and great times with them.

 A few weeks ago (The last schoolday) at school I told them that my bike was broken and  that I couldn't join them with whatever they were going to do. They planned to do something the day after they asked me, but they didn't go through with it, because it was bad weather that day. Turns out that they went a few weeks later and I found out through Instagram. 

It felt like they were having a great time and it hurted that they didn't ask me again. I know I said that I didn't go, but that was a few weeks ago. My bike was repaired a two days after they asked. When I confronted them they just said that they thought I wouldn't come and shrugged it off. Me being the idiot that I am agreed with them and said that my bike was broken anyway (which it wasn't anymore). This may not seem like a big deal, but for me it felt like I was unwanted. This could probably be, because I have 'high standerds'. On Instagram I always see people hanging out with eachother and having a great time.  I always feel bad after I see that, because why can't I have that? After that I feel really bad, because they can also be very kind to me. We send eachother memes and all that stuff.

769,"This is a repost of my own post. I posted it yesterday and got one nice answer but id like more points of view. I hope its okay.

.


I thought this would be a common issue so I searched through the sub, finding that theres not any related post. Anyways; to the point:

So me (17M) and some of my family go on vacations to the same house every summer since like 2013. Usually we are me, my sister, my dad, my step mom, my step sister, her friend and my step brother. The important one for this topic is my step sister's friend (18F).

You can probably see where this is going. Well one would say Id know her well after 7 years, and yeah Im good with her, but very, very few times Ive seen her other than in summer, so I only get to meet her once a year.

Now before I keep going Im afraid I need to bother you with some of my backstory, as I find it important.

I dont like to say that I was bullied, cause there are kids who have been under much more severe bullying than me, who suffered way more. Lets just say that I was not too popular in school. From the ages of 9 to 12, there was this group of girls in school who decided that I deserved to be humiliated. Of course, they didnt dare to hurt me physically, but there are more than enough words in the dictionary to mark a kid literally forever. And I dont mean that Im constantly depressed or anything like that; I have a great life overall now, but kids develop their social skills in school. Well I arrived to my teenage stage without those skills, cause some idiots isolated me from other kids in school.

Now that you know that factor, you probably can guess how good I am at approaching people, especially women. I have friends and if you talk to me I will keep talking to you, but Im never the one starting the conversation.

So due to all that stuff, my vacations in this house every summer consisted in shoving myself, my phone and my pc in a room and play videogames, with the least human contact possible. I guess I started realizing how sad and embarrasing that was 2 or 3 years ago. So you may say I started being human with other people when I was 15 (at best). 

So back to the relevant woman; she is, as I said, my step sister's friend. And so, most of her time they spend it toghether.

 Im still not very confident with people, so unless they ask me to join (to play a board game for example, which doesnt happen usually) I dont try to join. The times I manage to be alone with her I perform weak attempts of making her know how I feel. I always think that she knows, but Im not rly sure. Id say I uncosciously ""act"" so she doesnt realize, as weird as that sounds. I sometimes even think she may like me, cause she says or does stuff that I dont think she would do otherwhise. But of course Im not sure at all.

Now, a few days ago I told myself that it was about time that I revealed her my feelings, so I waited for a moment when we could be alone. Then I heard that she was leavinh the day after.

I couldnt find a private moment with her before she left, thus I never told her. Ive only declared my feelings once to a girl, a year ago, and it was... by whatsapp. It didnt go good. I wanted to do it properly this time, telling her face to face. You see the problem? Yep, she left. And guess when I will see her again? Next summer. Of course, I dont wanna wait a whole year. Many things can happen in a year. So I think that I should message her and ask her out once Im back home (we live in the same town), but theres another problem here: Ive NEVER texted her. We have 0 chat history. Which makes things... akward.",18Aug2020,1

She wanted a ride back, and as we were in the car she told me her roommate was not feeling well and she wanted to spend the night at my place. We went back to my place and hence our one night stand. She left early the next day and ever since then she has been totally ghosting me.

772,"Hi everyone,

I'll try to keep it short and limit this to the most important details. I graduated from college last year, but went to a local school and never lived in a dorm or with friends. I've lived at home my whole life. I went to a school where most people just went and did their shit and left, I didn't make a single friend in college that I still keep up with. I have a good amount of friends from high school and just people from my area, but most of them are now moved out  and live in a city with a lot of people our age (young 20's). I'm currently employed and make $2300 a month after taxes. Here are my current expenses (or what my expenses would look like if I moved).

\-Car insurance - $120 a month

\-Car payment - $400 a month

\-Gym membership - $40 a month 

\-Mixed Martial Arts Gym Membership - $120 a month 

\- Rent?? (Normally in the $700-$900 range for this area)

So each month i'd probably be left with around $500-600 for food and anything else I need. Also worth noting I have $10,000 saved up. 

I am really stuck on what to do. I want to balance being financially responsible but I really feel like a change of scenery would be good. I'm 23 and have lived with my parents since the day I was born. My life is fine here, parents are fine, but I want to make new friends and meet new people. In the location I'm in, that won't happen. It's out in farmland. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was thinking about trying to find a place with a 1 year lease and going from there. With the money I have saved up, I feel like I could definitely afford it, I just would not be saving that much. Maybe that's ok for now? I just really feel like the benefits outweigh the negatives, but I really want some other opinions from people. Thanks a lot.",18Aug2020,1

I’m just looking for some advice on how to handle this situation. I’m a 20 y/o college student in Northern California and I work on campus within our admissions office. My official title is Student Ambassador but I’m also a campus tour guide. 

Long story short, my manager has no boundaries and she treats my coworkers and I inappropriately. She sends out our weekly schedules on Sundays, sometimes at 8PM. The transition to a virtual format has made these issues 10x worse because she feels that now we’re at home, she has access to us 24/7. She tries to schedule meetings and change our hours the day of and if we cannot make it, she gets upset with us. 

She’s done other horrible things but the issue at hand is her texting me on my day off. As an hourly employee, I work 20 hours a week with Tuesdays off. This has become a very demanding job as she volunteers us participate in things like online outreach, focus groups, trainings, etc. 

Well it’s Tuesday and it’s my day off yet my manager won’t stop texting me about a program. We were asked to help with phone calls for another office on campus which means IT needed to download a program on our computers. There’s been several issues because it’s a new platform and the majority of us have been in contact with IT. She’s now texted me 3 separate times in the matter of 2 hours asking for updates on this program.

I didn’t post about it earlier because I felt bad talking about it on this Reddit because I feel it’s not as important as most of the other stories on here, but it’s been bothering me a lot lately and it’s gotten to the point where I need to do something about it but idk what to do.
So a while back a girl I liked asked me to dance with her, so I did. Fast forward a few days, I wanted to talk to her but had no idea how to, do I decided to “accidentally” send her a post on Instagram since that was the only way we could communicate. Well turns out that it was taken the wrong way and caused a whole rumor to be spread about me in my class.
I tried to ask what they thought it was supposed to be and explained that it was only to start a conversation but everyone said I was just begging for attention. 
A few weeks later I really started to notice that no one really wanted to talk to me. I have no clue what to do. I want to talk to everyone again but I am scared to start a conversation with anyone because I don’t want it to be taken the wrong way and make the situation even worse. I feel that I have waited too long and it would be really random to bring anything up. I’m not great at socializing and I’m really stuck. I’m not sure if I’m just being paranoid or over dramatic or if it’s just because I haven’t tried to start something up, but it’s been at least a year since I have talked to anyone at my school.
Due to everything going on, I am currently doing school online so there isn’t really any way for me to bring it up irl without it being taken the wrong way. Does anyone have any advise for me? It would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",18Aug2020,1

I'm not sure if leg rubbing under a blanket in the middle of the night counts as sexual abuse for me since he didn't go as far as to touch my genitals. My dad largely gaslights us since they got away with it all, but once while drunk he admitted he actually remembered and told me he was sorry. He attempted suicide a few years ago and ever since then, we talk pretty regularly. I'm one of the only 2 of my six siblings that still talk to him. My older brother says that I'm enabling him by still having a relationship. But I remember all the good times too and there were definitely opportunities that my father held himself back from sexual and physical abuse with me where he obviously wanted to, including one time where I hugged him from behind as kids do and he slung me away and said to never do that again and essentially ran away. Also, while playfighting a lot, he'd just stop and walk away. I just need advice, for me, even though he was a grown man, he has serious mental health issues and childhood abuse he never dealt with.

Now then, I tore two muscles in the knee. No it, wasn't an arrow. I'm better now, had surgery and everything. I'm home today. I live alone. I have an orthopedic blocker, which prevents my leg from bending. I can't bend my leg for 2 weeks, and after that I gotta start just passive bending.

I guess my jet set lifestyle finally caught up with me, cause I have a very low ""japanese style"" bed. Pretty much just a mattress on the floor, if you didn't know what it was. And I can't think of a way to go to sleep tonight... Nor of a way to get up again, tomorrow.

One option a friend suggested was tying a rope to a door and pull myself up that way. But my door is essentially cardboard, and I'm quite the chubster right now (98kg/216lbs) so that's not an option. Of the sturdy furniture I have is a hardwood coffee table that I can lean on no problem and it will not tip or break, and my comfy chair, but it's bulky, and the arm rests are quite high.

Any and all ideas, of just how would it be possible to get up from the floor with your left leg completely unbendable and not weight bearing, post them please. I will not do anything stupid that would injure me further, don't worry, but your silly idea might give me or someone else a more reasonable one too.

787,"A friend of mine called me on discord and told me that I was her only close friend. She also told me how she would even contemplate suicide because of how lonely she felt and I was the reason why she hasn't. 

The problem is that I didn't see her the same way. I was actually thinking about ways I could distance my self from her and I feel horrible now. I just didn't think we clicked as friends. She's definitely not a bad person but it's just that I don't think we share the same interest and I often felt unhappy (By that I mean, I cant seem to be enjoying my self).  I admit that I'm a fake friend for being this way.  Fyi, I don't mind being  friends but I don't feel like being in a committed close friendship. Obviously I wont say that to her and I'm planning on continuing to be her friend. (Especially because I don't want her to die). But I  feel like I am befriending her out of pity and I genuinely would like to share the same feelings.

793,"So the summer gettogether for the office was planned for this friday. One coworker is on maternity leave, but was really looking forward to coming out for the party. The weather forecast was not good, so we were warned that the party would have to be cancelled, if it would rain, because then we would have to stay inside, and because of COVID,  that would not be an option, because we would be too many people in a small space, and against the restrictions in our country (Denmark). The coworker on leave offered her house as an alternative, because of more space. I have not been to her house, but the rules restrictions are, that you can be up to 100 people if they sit down, and there is 1 meter between them. 26 people has rsvp'ed yes. So that has to be a very big house to have enough space. The boss said no, because we are a state workplace, so it would send a very bad signal, since many meetings and other gatherings are being cancelled. 
So today the party was officially cancelled. Bummer, but it is what it is. 
But later today, I get a text from the coworker on leave, saying she is having a party anyway, and me and my husband are invited (we know her outside of work, through other friends, but not close. This was her first text to me). 
We agreed right away that we would not go. We don't think it's appropriate, for a number of reasons. 
1. You know, corona. 
2. Boss said no party. 
3. I don't know who is invited, but I'm guessing not everyone from the office, which feels a little excluding.

They are the kind of people who believe that family is always there for each other, which to them, means you can treat family like shit but it's fine because ""family is always forgiven."" I've been guilted into doing things I haven't wanted to do, I've been asked for favors and received zero thanks, I've been called countless names, I've never received any apology and I'm typically the person who apologizes first just to make peace, even when I haven't done anything wrong. 

When one of my family members had a baby a few years ago, she still wanted to go out and party all the time and usually asked if I would babysit. I never got thanked for babysitting for free and while I admit that I should've set up boundaries and said no, it was also difficult for me at the time because I used to have a really hard time with saying no.

To my surprise, I did find her, what's even more shocking was that she accepted my friend request. I was so happy, but I was too shy to initiate a conversation. And then she was no longer working at the hospital during my 3rd visit (possibly completed her internship).

To keep it short and sweet, I don’t have a girlfriend and I don’t have a means of getting one, close friends aren’t common for me either, family connections have always been distant and scarce. I suffer from mental health issues and am going to great lengths to mullify those issues by doing intensive counselling and spiritual practicing. Although I have found some inner joy and hope that I can make better connections now that I’m better in the future, I can’t help but still feel distressed right now, as I know that relationships are a key part of living a happy, healthy life. But making friends and meeting girls is incredibly difficult and scarce as I can’t go to school, volunteer or get a job, dating apps aren’t working for me either so how do I succeed right? I read an article that said isolating from others is as unhealthy as smoking 15 cigarettes a day, yet I feel I don’t have a choice in that so I feel an immense sense of frusteration, sadness, and fear as I am worried about the inevitable implications it will have on my health mentally and physically.

813,"So i have this friend. I don’t know if I really feel like she’s my best friend anymore. For a while now I’ve been thinking a lot about our friendship and if it’s really worth every bs I’ve been through with her. I’m gonna call her Emma.

So a little bit about our backstory. We’ve known each other a really long time. (We are both 19) Almost her whole family know almost my whole family. Even tho we’ve known each other since we were kids we didn’t really start talking until middle school. And even then we weren’t the best of friends. But me and her cousin on the other hand were very good friends. Her cousin (let’s call her Maya) was very manipulative and jealous. At first I didn’t understand why she would be like this towards her own family but of course she would never say the things she said to her face. I felt bad so I would talk with Emma behind Maya’s back. 
Emma wasn’t really much at school and I felt bad because she would miss out on so much, and I was also a little worried that she was going through something bad. And I could never forgive myself if something would happen and I didn’t do anything when I had the chance.
But one thing I never understand with Emma was that she would always and I mean always follow her cousin. If Maya wanted to pick a fight with someone Emma would be right behind her ready to back up her cousin. But then about a week later they would bicker and scream at each other because Emma wanted to wear the same type of skirt as Maya. I never said anything about it at first because it wasn’t any of my business. But then Maya manipulated me into starting a fight with Emma on her behalf. After a while of this unnecessary fighting I stopped getting in between them and kind of took Emma under my wing at school. 

When we started high school me and Maya started in the same class, but Emma started on a different school and even ended up dropping out. Me and Maya wasn’t as good friends as we used to be and I took this as an opportunity to make better friends and try to get closer to Emma. It would go weeks without me hearing anything from her sometimes but I still tried. In the beginning of high school me and a couple of other girls I went to school with in middle school became closer friends. I would sometimes ask them if I could bring Emma, but not to much because I didn’t really know if they liked her or not. They would of course always say yeas, but they would never invite her themselves. But whenever they needed something then they would talk to her. I didn’t like this so I tried to include Emma more so she could feel more like that we actually wanted to hang out with her and not because the other girls needed anything. 

Through out almost a year, I would pick up on some stuff Emma would do. These are some of the things that would irritate me:
If I were to spam her on Snapchat or Instagram, she would respond to what was more interesting. But when she spammed me and I did what she did, she would be soooo mad at me. 
If I send her a meme that’s he’s already seen she would just say “yea I’ve already seen that, your late” but again when it’s the other way around she get so damn mad at me. 
She sometimes send me videos and pictures hinting at me about our friends ship
She would copy everything I did or had like my phone, hair style, earrings, piercings, shoes, clothes, glasses and so much more. 
If I started to talk to a guy she would cheer me on, and then a week later she would talk about all the three to five guys she was talking to. Trying to turn the attention on her.
I never said anything because she has a temper and never lets anyone correct her or confront her. So basically I was scared. 

Fast forward to now, I still talk to Emma everyday but not the other girls. I had a fight with one of them and the other girl just stopped talking to me because... honestly I don’t even know why. Almost a whole year passes after me and the girls stop talking. And all of a sudden I see them hanging out with Emma. And the rage in me was i don’t even know how to describe it. They would talk about her and try to force me into talking about her personal issues, use her, purposely not invite her but as soon as I’m out of the group she takes my spot. And the thing that pissed me off the most was that she tried to hide it from me. We ALL used to be friends in middle school so I can’t really be mad, but if she knew what they did behind her back I don’t think she would hang out with them. But I don’t want to be that girl, I don’t want to be the person who ruins friendships and stuff because I’m mad. I guess in some way she’s just like her cousin. And I went through a mental hell with Maya, I don’t want to go through that again. 

So after reading this, what should I do? Suck it up and just hang out with her, or confront her and then cut her off?Does it sound like she’s in the wrong or that I’m in the wrong? Please be honest with me",18Aug2020,1

I would like to have her sleep over, but in my mind, I have a tight schedule. 
My grandmother is coming over around 11:00 to help us make a quilt for my brother’s birthday, and I myself am training for a race, and always do my run before this time, usually at 9:15. I know this might come off as weird, but her sleeping over throws a wrench in my schedule, which freaks me out a lot. Is there any way I can tell her not to sleep over, or should I just suck it up?",18Aug2020,1
815,"I did something really, really bad (though not illegal to the extent that lying is not illegal). I spun a web of lies and am being called out on it. I told my husband that someone did something bad to me, when they in fact did not. I know its a terrible reason, but I believe I did it as a way to get my husbands attention. Husband never acted on this information

I obviously want to come clean and know its the right thing to do, but I'm afraid of the consequences which I think will involve both the end of my marriage (no i did not cheat) and social isolation from my friends (if husband chooses to take this beyond the two of us). I'm an only child and my parents both recently passed away (car accident and covid separately), so I honestly feel like I will lose having a life with even a single person in it when word gets out about what I did which I understand isn't the right reason to not come clean.

I guess here's my question:  how do i get over the crippling anxiety of being all alone in the world in order to meet the deadline of coming clean he has set for me. reading this post, I can see that therapy will help but it doesn't help give me the courage to do the right thing in the next few hours which is husband's deadline.

If there is some reason I should attempt to cover my tracks that I am not seeing, I'm open to that also, but I'm pretty sure that's not the right or productive thing to do in this situation. I'm feeling very confused and can't think straight due to my fears and am hoping something someone says will help.",18Aug2020,1

818,"My(24F) little sister (12F) lives with my mother and two other brothers, and without going too much into detail they’re disadvantaged in a lot of ways, as it was when I lived at home.

I’ve always known she was a bit slow to learn, she has speech and hearing impediments, I’m sure along with other problems. The last time I lived with my sister she was 5, so interacting with her now I see she isn’t developing like she should be. 

She can barely communicate. Her vocabulary is very, very limited as well as her enunciation. 
I can tell she wants to speak her mind, but it’s hard for her. Just basic everyday subjects are hard for her to comprehend. She can’t spell or sound out how to spell, I’d say her reading level isn’t past first or second grade.

I blame my mother for some of our ignorance academically and life wise. 
From my memory, growing up she talked at us rather than teaching us. What she deemed important enough, she’d give a few words on her viewpoint/understanding, and that was it.  She didn’t take much time to help our comprehension or help us form our own opinions. She always speaks in a frustrated way, and has lost a lot of hearing herself. 


Currently my mom and siblings are staying in a hotel. Because of COVID they’ve been doing schoolwork in the room.  I came to visit and saw them all on their school-provided laptops. 
Just seeing her struggle filling out an About Me assignment.. makes me so sad. 
From spelling, to knowing facts about her own family, and not knowing much about her own interests. 

My sister needs help. I can’t do much with my separate life now. And I can’t blame my mother too much because she’s working to support them. 
She just hit puberty too so I know it will get more difficult for her. I want to know if there are any resources to look into, or the best way I can help   her begin to learn the way she needs to. 
My family is poor so any tutors or private teachers are pretty much out of the question. 

She’s starting to become lazy with her learning now and I don’t want her to stagnate or give up on herself.",18Aug2020,1

I'm currently in school for Computer Science with a concentration in Game Design and Programming. I love video games! I know that it is hard to get into making them. However, I'm very passionate about them. But, there are other careers that I really want to do. These are harder than getting into game programming. I would love to open up a doughnut/pastry and tea shop. Baking and tea are two other things that I am very passionate about. During a job interview, I was asked what I would want to do as a career if money was not an option. I hands down said the bakery. 

But, I don't know if that is the type of life I would want. I figure with the game design, I could travel the world. I could get jobs in other countries. I would have the freedom in my life that I desperately want. Growing up poor in a small rural town in the USA, this has also been something I want to do.

822,"I am 17 M and my mom and dad have been married for over 17 years. My dad has an intense job and often times comes home late. My mother just confronted my dad about him coming late at nights.  She says I know what you are up to when you come home late. She tells him he knows who he is talking to when she is in shower. She wants him to show his phone calls and stuff but my dad refuses to show his phone calls, messages and vice versa. Which makes me believe my mother. A

Mother thing is I know he cheated on my mother when I was younger (7-8 years old) but thought he changed since then (and I was scared that they would break up) so I didn't tell my mother. I am sure he was cheating then, because he called his girlfriends (I know they weren't my mom because he spoke in different language which I understood without him knowing I did.) in the next room when my mother wasn't around and I heard him saying romantic things. I won't go into details. I feel responsible for this because I didn't tell my mother then.

Another thing is, before my dad came home 15 minutes ago, my mother called him and asked what he was doing this late ""at work"". At first, my dad didn't tell her anything and kept on saying ""I'm working."". So my mom told him to send his live location, which he didn't. Then my mom asked him who he was with. He didn't tell her but at last he told her he was with a man (Lets call him JACK). We know the guy. He is a coworker of my dad. My mom asked for JACK's number. My dad didn't give it to her. My mom kept on shouting at him, saying she knew what he was doing and told him not to come home. She wouldn't open the door if it weren't for me.

When they sat down, it only got worse. I went into my room and couldn't keep myself from listening to their argument. I didn't know what to do and how to feel, so I seek your advice here.

823,"**TL;DR Question:** My wife thinks I don't care about anyone but myself, how do I cope with the idea that she may be leaving w/ the kids or how do I turn this around?

After 10 years, she says it's obvious to her she can't be the one I need to support my wrong-thinking and bad feelings. She says she doesn't want to be dependent on me anymore and that she'll find someone who will love her.

We've fought a lot the past two weeks, the first time about my anger because I was too rough with my four year old son when I was mad, last night because I'm irresponsible and I'm immature and spent a lot on our credit card this year that needed to be reimbursed or orders that should have been cancelled and weren't because I wasn't paying attention.

I've had a porn addiction for 23 years and have been discovered by her a few times that almost ended us. I went to counseling for two years but when the counselor explained that he couldn't guarantee I'd be porn-free and I told my wife that she signaled that any slip up would send her over the edge, so I assumed the defensive and never talk to her about triggers or followed up any feelings w/ ""I feel the need to consume porn"". Just now I told her I've been struggling and that I didn't trust her enough to tell her the truth earlier.... so she did ever addicts fear and acted exactly how I thought she would, further confirming that I was right to lie.

I've said things to her in the past couple weeks like, ""go crawl into your hole"" whenever she said ""I'll keep living a lie then"", and I lashed out when we were arguing about the money and told that she'd ""never let me hear the end of it"".

She also ""followed her distrustful instincts"" and read my journal and has no regrets because that's the only way she'd ever know my true feelings. My journal entry last night basically said that she was sexless and I couldn't do romantic stuff because it didn't matter... these were wrong feelings that I journaled because I was in distress, but she doesn't care, they're true to her, there are no ""wrong feelings"" or ""bad thinking"" to her.

She came to the conclusion that I just don't care about anything other than myself, which regardless of how I want to feel, it's how I act. It would be great to drop dead and leave her and the three kids for some superman to come and save them; to me the memory of me (for the kids) would be better than the real me to fuck up their lives for the next 20 years. But I know that suicide is just proof of my selfishness. So instead I'm venting to people I don't know who probably give zero fucks about what I have to say just like the real people in my life who give zero fucks. And I'm an idiot that will keep on going.

At this point I don't know how to salvage anything and I'm bracing for a life of regret and shame as a 35 y/o divorced dad of three and have no desire to ever enter into another interpersonal relationship ever again. How do I cope w/ that?",18Aug2020,1

I can't afford to leave/rent somewhere else to live and I can't find a job.

831,"  

My partner (38M) and I (30M) are two technology professionals in NYC. We're college educated and try to stay pretty up-to-date on social and political issues. Even though we wouldn't consider ourselves social activists by any means, my partner still views himself as politically engaged. He donates to political candidates, votes in all levels of elections, posts/reposts on Instagram/Twitter, etc. In 2016, he participated with an NGO and traveled to a swing state by bus to register and help people vote in the election. This year, he wants to write letters to swing voters and encourage them to vote for Biden/Harris (I think), or just vote in general.

I am Canadian by birth and am a permanent resident in the US, but not a citizen, so I can't vote in the upcoming presidential election. I do value the power of democracy, but at the same time, I don't like to share my views on the Internet with people I don't know. I also find echoing the same talking points in my own social media bubble effect quite pointless. I believe voting is a civic duty, but I don't believe convincing others to vote is.

I noticed that my mom don't clean the house, leave the dishes pilling up,  don't cook and when she does is some nasty ass food just so she can say she did something. My mom wasn't the best cook or the best house wife but now is just super obvious that she just don't care anymore.  She started to say that she's depressed,  and has anxiety and panick attacks. I've never seen her had a panic attack and i feel that she use this as a reason for abusing xanax (wich she gets from a friend ). Now,  my mom is uneducated, she stopped going to school at the age of 14, and is so easily influenced, she surrounded herself with a bunch of depressed people, joined some Facebook groups for depressed and anxious people and just spend all the time on those groups reading all kinds of stories from people that are sick for real. The reason why i think that those groups influenced her is that every time she meets someone with a disease she starts telling that she has it. In all fairness,  she had some tough problems, my brother died 22y ago in her arms ( she forced him to take some prescriped pills for and infection and he was crying and cooked with the pill and died), her adoptive parents died, her real mom refuse to tell her who's her father,  my dad spend 2 months in the hospital this year and he was close to death. She always tell us to not leave her alone,  i study in another city,  my brother is in the army and my dad works all day. She always tell us that she would hang herself if we leave.

I decided to keep my mouth shut figuring that it will end soon, she just wanted someone to talk to and he is just some horny pice of shit that will look gor someone younger  ( my mom is 51 and he is 30).

So you could see why I wasn't really motivated. 

My parents stuck me into community college for medical radiography and I kept quiet until I started getting bad grades in a few classes. My motivation was starting to slide down. Things took a turn for the worst when I applied for the radiography program and my application was denied due to a low score on my HESI and low grades in my classes. My parents want me to retake the classes I flunked and apply again next semester but I just don't have the energy to go through all of that again. 

I finally stood up to my parents and told them that I couldn't do it anymore. I never really wanted to work in the medical field. But then they asked me what was I going to do and I just froze up. I never really knew. No job or hobbies interested me. For example, I played guitar for 10 years and never had the urge to learn a new song or make my own song. I just strum it and put it down.

Not one person has paid me to check about you.
You do not know me and you're probably thinking why you are getting this email?
in fact, i actually placed a malware on the adult vids (adult porn) website and you know what, you visited this site to experience fun (you know what i mean).

When you were viewing videos, your browser started out operating as a RDP having a key logger which provided me with accessibility to your display and web cam.
immediately after that, my malware obtained every one of your contacts from your Messenger, FB, as well as email account.
after that i created a double-screen video. 1st part shows the video you were viewing (you have a nice taste omg), and 2nd part displays the recording of your cam, and its you.


Best solution would be to pay me $1059.


We are going to refer to it as a donation. in this situation, i most certainly will without delay remove your video.

if i do not receive the bitcoin;, i definitely will send out your video recording to all of your contacts including friends and family, co-workers, and so on.
Nevertheless, if i do get paid, i will destroy the recording immediately.

The day I decided to break up with him he had been super cranky from working a 12 hour shift. He was being shitty to me even though he had agreed to spend the day with me days ago. He was angry the whole drive and started  driving aggressively and speeding in the rain. it got to the point where I got nervous and asked him to slow down. he didn’t listen to me, and he was being a bit verbally abusive and when I got back to the house I left for my parents. Two days went by and he said nothing to me. So I went back to his place two days later and asked to talk which he replied “I don’t want to talk to you” I have no idea what I did wrong that day to get such treatment. After I collected all my things I went no contact the entire break up. He forwarded me a vet email last month in regards to the pet we had together that I got to keep. But past that he never reached out. The relationship wasn’t all bad, but we had our fair share of fights. I was a different person when I was with him. I was less accepting and forgiving and I could see why he’d get upset with me at times...but not to the degree that he did. His family member whom he was very close with had recently been diagnosed with cancer and he was stressed to the max so I feel his behavior had something to do with that, but still doesn’t excuse the fact that when things go wrong on his life I’m his figurative punching bag. Anyway that was to give you some backstory. Since the breakup I’ve been doing a ton of introspection. I feel like I’m growing as a person and really learning about acceptance and forgiveness. I’m sure me breaking up with him hurt him... we spent two years together. But, even when I told him we were breaking up he still didn’t want to talk to me. I find myself missing him... wondering how his family member is.... wondering how he is. But I’m also afraid if I reach out he’d still be in the same “I don’t want to talk to you” mindset which would hurt. I feel like me waiting for him to reach out to me is futile because wouldn’t he have done that by now? Is it my job as the breaker upper to reach out to him? Any insight would be highly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",18Aug2020,1
848,"My father - an incredibly complicated person. A cocktail of psychological problems that he'll never talk about, with too many depths to unravel...my mother has been on the receiving end of this for the 40 years of their relationship, both verbally and mentally. Despite moments of normality when he's not angry, she's been worn down to a submissive and - more recently - self confessed 'nervous wreck', which includes minimal sleep and non stop chattering (even when it's just me and her) amongst other worrying traits.

I (34,M) live 200 miles away but still remain incredibly close to her - I don't know where to start in trying to make her life a bit more happier and comfortable as she enters the elderly stages of life. She'll never leave him, but at the same time never look after herself properly and is always be on edge waiting to see what kind of mood he'll be in. Whilst my father and I are civil, I find it incredibly difficult to not be drawn into the atmosphere he's created when I visit and if I was to talk to him about it, I think I would completely lose it (I lived at home until I was 22 so was also subjected to his abuse.)",18Aug2020,1

She doesn’t have a car because my uncle is too lazy to buy her one even though he said he is. Also my uncle is sick and I think he has COVID and she is living with him.

it seems my sister in law basically gives in when she wants something, she says no a few times then fine and just gives in. she’s done this many times. she also doesn’t try to correct her behavior much. she’s started to more luckily.

i don’t have kids and am just trying to let them parents their child how they want, and i’m not asking on how to parent her but does anyone have any advice on how to deal with it? she’s loud and screams and hits and kicks, they just moved back into our basement and i work from home. i gave up my apartment in my parents basement so they could have it. it’s hard to work when she’s screaming about god knows what. i hope she grows out of it and won’t become an entitled kid.

851,"My boyfriend (21) and I (21) were recently on a walk around some secluded field areas, where we came to an equally secluded road. At the same time, two cyclists, a younger man and his dog and an older man and his dog arrived at the same crossroad on the path. The younger man's dog walked up to the older man's dog to say hello, to which the younger man responded by shouting and swearing repeatedly at his own dog and sharply kicking it in the side. Even though there were 5 onlookers, none of us did anything and the man passed by before the reality of what had just happened set in. I can't stop thinking about what I saw and am at a loss about what I could have done or what I could do in the future if I witness this again. I am a very small, quiet woman and my instinct around angry, aggressive men is to stay quiet and wait for them to go away. Clearly this man caused the same reaction in all of the onlookers, meaning that poor dog is still presumably under his ownership.

852,"Our place of employment (a large grocery chain) has gone through many managers in the last 6 years. I myself have been here for 5 of them, though I don't remember the first one. The first one I do remember who was here when I started was horrible to his workers. He's gone now, so not the concern. 
 
The manager that replaced him was... considerably better.  He got things moving in this place, got us stuff we needed, got people moved to the right shifts... and then out of nowhere, corporate decided they were taking him and our assistant director and moving them to different stores and replacing them. No idea why but they didn't even have a day in it.

The guys that replaced them are... so horrible. So incompetent. At first, the head honcho (we'll call him Brian)  and the assistant (Howard) was doing great. They helped us in the last few aspects we needed to get fixed, but now... the store is going downhill so fast. And they're so disrespectful. They talk to us bookkeepers like we don't know what we're doing even though we clearly have seniority here. I alone have been here for 5 years, the other has been here for 4 and the last has been here for 22. 

I was setting up an associate on the computer to do an online training module that could only be accessed on a specific computer, and Brian came up to us asking what i was doing. I explained the employee had to do the training module, and he grilled me about if I was sure I was using the right computer. As if I haven't had to set employees up before. This is yearly training as well so we all have to do it every year on that same computer until our IT department gets our filed transferred.

Every time i have tried talking to these managers, they interrupt me in the middle of my sentence and I usually don't get to complete what I was saying. I end up having to leave notes about stuff.

I needed to contact a corporate employee earlier today about an important matter, but Brian told me not to and insisted that he would do it instead.  His shift ended half an hour ago and he didn't contact her, but this is information I need within the next 2-3 days. I can't just go over his head because I'll get written up since he told me not to (even though it's info I need.)

They've started ordering massive loads of freight/items that we don't even need or have room for. It's stuff that's already stocked full and doesn't sell so the rest of it has to go into storage and other places on the shelves go empty because we can't get that product in.  They've actually had our workers start putting items with the same price in the empty spots instead so we can get the items out of storage and make room for other items.  We're getting yelled at that we have too much in storage but we can only do so much.

I work in multiple departments and in all of them you need clear communication with your managers and they are not giving it to us. Instead, they keep going into long tangents about how ""it will get better once we get more people hired"" but they haven't even done the simple task i asked them a month ago- to get us new, safe stools because the ones we have are a work hazard. Every time I step on one, it wobbles like hell because the supports snapped years ago before i even started working here.

Sometimes I'm tempted to order some from online and bring them in because it's absurd.

It's just the same thing with the managers not listening to us and not caring about what we say. I'm at a loss of what to do other than find a new job, but I do -mostly- enjoy where I am and what I do and would like to stay here until I move a year from now. I just don't think it'll happen like this.

I told my mom about that, but what I got back from her was “because you’ve been playing with your phone all day” and when I told her that I’m worried and want to go see a doctor, she just told me to take paracetamol and if I go to the hospital they would just do the same.

860,"I love my boyfriend so much, I really do. He’s great and we’ve been together for more than two years. But I’m becoming increasingly upset over this.

I live with my boyfriend and sister in my parents’ house during uni. It’s a big house with everything we would ever need. The only thing we have to worry about is our food. My parents pay all the bills (water, electricity, garbage, wood for fire burning, sometimes food for us, misc. things for our kitchen, they also bought us a new refrigerator and dishwasher this year). But my boyfriend doesn’t pay anything at all to my parents. Nor do his parents. My boyfriend gets money just for studying from his uni(typical thing here) if I remember it’s like 150€ a month, gets hundreds of euros every couple of months from his mom/step dad, money from grandparents (who give him ~500€ each visit) and now his real dad is going to give him 100€ monthly as well starting this year. 

Idk I don’t want to sound like a bitch but it just really bothers me how my parents have opened the doors for him at their house so that he can live there and that he doesn’t have to hassle with living in a dorm that’s small af. Our second year is starting soon and I just feel like it’s unfair that he hasn’t even offered anything to my parents and neither have his parents.

862,"UK.

I used to work for a retail store in the Sales sector, I was paid minimum wage and earnt comissions on top of it. I was recently made redundant from that position and thus put myself onto Universal Credit; To my luck (in the current climate) I was able to bag myself a new job in under a month with a Call Centre. I have never worked in an office, let alone on telephones, for me it has always been face-to-face. It wasn't ideal but the salary is 18k and was told with on target earnings (OTE) we could earn up to 26k+. 

Sounds a lot better than my retail job! So I went for my first day on Monday. Did all paperwork etc, today we got a chance to go onto the floor where all the callers are, we were paired with an existing employee. I got talking to him and when I mentioned the 26k he laughed in my face and told me that it IS technically an OTE because it's on paper, nobody has ever hit it. I was flawed, I couldn't believe I would have the truth bent like that. I attempted to rationalize it and thought that maybe the guy I was talking too just wasn't very good so I asked another and it was the same thing. 

Not only that, I haven't even signed a contract yet and they are expecting us to get on the Phones on Friday. I felt like crying after seeing the work floor up close. Everyone looked miserable.

When we finished, I told him that he could put the condom in the bin in my bathroom. He responded saying that he took it off (im assuming it happened when we switched positions). He said he thought that i knew because he thought that i would be able to feel the difference.

After this I tried to play down how shocked I was and I tried to act normal with him. I'm just really confused on what is going on, he has continued to act normally around me and wants to see me again. But I just feel kinda strange.

866,"I'm 16F, and I've been interested in Photography for awhile now. Since I was about 9 or 10.

Because I'm 16, I'm too young for my parents to get me an actual camera. They said they might when I graduate/for my 18th birthday, but I asked them not to because it's something I'd like to earn myself. I also would like to put thought into what camera I get, rather than getting one and having to wait years to get a better one (because it would be rude..).

Anyways, I've decided that I'd like to pursue a career in storm/astro photography. I've currently got my eye on the Nikon D850, but the issue is that it's roughly $4,000. 

Because I'm still in school, I have limits. Less because I'm 16, but still some. Minimum wage under 18 is $13.50 so I think it'll take roughly 4-5 months to earn that much. I'd also need more to afford other accessories, like different lenses, filters, tripods, etc.

I don't have an allowance but I do get paid on my birthdays/holidays. I also know that my parents would help pitch in here and there (or let me work to earn money). 

The price may also drop while I earn the money, or I may come across a cheaper camera with similar qualities.

I've also never gotten a job before (didn't really have a reason, and I don't have my drivers) so I image my payment will be a little less for training. On top of that, COVID-19 lessens my chances of even getting a job.

I am trying to do art commissions, but my art isn't that good so it's at most, a few bucks which would help in affording accessories, but that doesn't really work until I get the camera body.

Anyways, I'm wondering what else I could do to maybe speed up the earning process so I can afford the camera.

871,"I apologize if any of this seems unclear. I have so many thoughts and information I want to write down but it's just a lot of things that I need help with and can't figure out on my own.

**Context:**

\- Where I'm At / My Plan: Applied to colleges, got accepted into a decent school out of state but I'm not willing to have my dad help pay tuition for a school that isn't that great (I feel like I could do better), classes are all online too. I don't think it's worth it. Instead, I'd like to do things in the next couple of months to hopefully attend a better school where tuition would also cost significantly less.

\- Education: I graduated HS with a 3.7 GPA and a 1370 SAT, plenty of IB and AP courses, and extracurriculars. 2 Jobs. Accepted into US News &amp; World Report 40-60s ranked colleges, waitlisted at most of the 30s , rejected at the 20s. I want to attend UMich (in-state).

\- Financial Status: Since I've graduated the only significant thing I've done was learn to invest and trade (I have about 10% in a mutual fund, used the other 90% to learn to swingtrade and daytrade ETFs and stocks, made plenty of mistakes but also learned from them.) I collected about 13K in unemployment benefits and invested all of it, now I'm up to around 16-17K. I also do technical analysis for my grandma who has been trading for many years, she's grown her retirement account by 20K with my help.

**What I need help with.**

\- Knowing that I got waitlisted for schools in the ""30s"" UCSB, UCI, UCSD. It might be a pretty big reach to want to attend Umich next year. I really want to go because it's in-state, and I don't want to go to MSU. What can I do this month / in the next couple of months to help me get into UMich? I was thinking some sort of internship(s) but idk where or which ones? Or a job but idk what would best help me for college.

\-I previously applied to colleges intending to major in psychology, because I thought it was a pretty general topic where I can branch off into something I'm more passionate about in the future, but now since I've started trading I've become really focused and passionate about finance. I can find myself looking at charts and stock prices for hours a day. But I feel liked I'd have a harder time applying for business than psychology because in high school I always thought I wanted to pursue a pre-med track or something to do with psychology. (I took 3 years of Biology and 2 years of Psychology) My uncle also works @ Wallstreet and from what I've heard, a career in finance is definitely something I'm interested in.

\- I need to apply to colleges again this fall/winter, and I have almost nothing new since I've graduated. I'm essentially the same candidate as I was when I applied last year, maybe worse? **Would changing my intended major to finance make it harder to get into Umich? What kind of internships and/or jobs should I try to get to help me get into UMich? Can I even get such internships/jobs?** So far I've only applied to the American Red Cross as a phlebotomist/driver but I haven't heard from them. I'm willing to give it my all just to attend UMich, I just don't know how many options I have because my grades and SAT score isn't something I can really improve. 

\- I also need financial advice for an 18 year old. I've watched a lot of youtube videos and read a bunch of stuff on reddit. So far I've applied to get a credit card @ Discover, and plan on getting one @ chase soon to build my credit score. I have like $0 bills a month because I don't buy anything. Once I get a job I plan on maxing out my IRA/Roth IRA idk which yet. What else should I do?

I feel like attending the 60s ranked school is a mistake, I know I can do better and it's not worth the money. I hope I can do something meaningful this year to help me get into a better school. I'm sorry I really suck at writing out my thoughts I use a lot of unnecessary words.",18Aug2020,1

I hate this job lately with all the stress they've added with the additional tickets and chats. But it's not a bad job (flexible schedule, decent pay, full Work From Home during the pandemic, I don't have to directly speak to people) and I'm grateful to have a job in these hard times that works well with my anxiety.

I've been considering quitting up until last night when my Manager called and asked if I would be interested in switching to graveyard shift. Out Graveyard workers called out the past 3 days and so it sounds to me like they've all quit.

Pros of staying would be I get an additional $2/hr which would make my living situation w/ bills much more comfortable, I don't have to take chats anymore, and it's quiet time since our customers are only US based, so it's less stressful even if queues are high.

Cons of staying are that I continue working a dead-end job, the grave schedule causes mild issues with my weekend schedules every other week, and I have a growing feeling that this team is going under sooner rather than later and that I'll end up being let go in a few months anyway.

My primary choices I want to make are either stay and work graves for a time, then jump ship and start school with the extra savings next year, or just quit now and find something else to do until the economy isn't so bad and then go to school. But I also don't know that I honestly believe things are going to get better anytime soon..

875,"So a little back story before. About a year or two ago I cant remember that well, I had an awful birthday. Everyone had forgotten and I was in an awful mood depressed and sad and all that. I was scrolling through twitter when I learned that one of the group members of my favorite youtube group had the same birthday as me. I wished her a happy birthday and mentioned mine was that day as well. The main account for them followed me right then and there and also wished me a happy birthday. It was easily one of the best days of my life and still makes me happy to this day. So yesterday, this story came up in therapy, and my therapist suggested I send them a message to let them know that even though they may not remember it still makes me feel great when I look back on that day. Would that be considered creepy or annoying for me to do it? They're decently famous and I know they tend to get DMs they dont really like?

877,"okay i know i sound absolute bonkers, but just hear me out.

ever since i was a child and i learned birth control was a thing it caused this deep and weird fear that if i took it i would get infertility issues when i did want to have a child. something about how it altars your hormones and after getting off of it one can take a while to get back to a ‘normal’ mensuration cycle, just scared me. 

this fear started around age 13 when sex ed is first introduced and when i first got my period. now i’m 17 and have a boyfriend. i would like to take birth control for two reasons, 1. the obvious so i don’t become a teen mom and 2. to better regulate my periods. 

my sister has taken birth control but stopped after a while because she had no reason to take it anymore. i asked my mother about her experience and she said she took it for a few months but then stopped. when i brought up my fear she said she also has/had this similar fear, but if i want to take it i can. 

now i know for a fact that i do not want to be pregnant right now but the fear of it causing issues in the future scares me. i so badly want to be a mom when i’m older so any issues like miscarriages or infertility are a big fear. i researched a bit and all articles say birth control can’t affect a woman’s body like that but i just wanted to get some advice too.

878,"I know everything going on has taken away a lot more from people than just their primary outlet for stress, but mine has been officially taken away, and I think I need to replace it until it comes back.  

  

For the past ten years I've played rugby. Before that I played other sports, and especially other contact sports. Not only am I used to working out and physical exercise, I'm also used to a good deal of physical contact. I'm ***not*** one of those guys that gets worked up and has to hit people. I don't even hit that hard in rugby compared to other guys. But I've known for a long time that I'm calmer in season than out of season. 

&amp;#x200B;

Previously its always been that I'm a bit more testy in the winters when we're not playing. I can't hit or get hit, and my ability to run/exercise dwindles due to the weather, but also because I generally rely on the structure of playing a sport to stay fit. The fact that I'm doing it with a bunch of people for a shared goal is truly the only reason I've ever worked out, its just been a plus that its better for my health and emotional well being.  

  

Last week we got the official message that this season isn't happening. Meaning I haven't had my normal structure, exercise, fun, and endorphin/stress management since last November. 

I'm fine right now, but I don't think I'll be fine until next March. I haven't replaced rugby with anything, I've put on about 10-20 pounds. I'm looking at joining a gym right now but I'm faced with the reality that I don't work very hard on my own.

881,"I’m female, he was like my best friend I’ve known for 3 years. So me and him used to chill everyday and meet by the side of the building to smoke.

I feel like it’s because he knows I like him now but I told him that wasn’t true because I was scared. Someone asked me if I like him and I said no why would I like someone that doesn’t like me he’s just a friend. 


Anyways now he doesn’t even ask me to link up to smoke anymore and whenever i ask him he’s always too busy to do yet. Yet if I ask him to do other stuff he’s down, by other stuff I mean if I ask him to come out with me and my friends or whatever.

884," I am 22 years old and I have a 4 year-old sister. My parents are not so good at parenting, they raise their voices to my sister, insult her, threaten her... There's no physical violence but they're not ideal parents, that's for sure. They never supported me for anything, they always told me that I am a disappointment et cetera... I don't actually care much right now but I am sure that I am effected by all of this as a child.

For my sister, I love her. She's like the only thing I love in this universe. I wish my parents would think that ""There's something upsetting my child, I wonder what it is and how can I solve her problem?"" when my sister cries instead of raising their voices and telling her to ""shut up"" and threaten her. I want her to begin to learn something (like music or dancing) as a kid. I want her to have a room, where the shelves are filled with things she's interested in. A room is not just four walls you sleep within, it has to reflect your character, it's where you live. I can't tell what my sister's interests, actually my parents doesn't care about that. They don't think that they should find something she will like. I mean, it's so classic but some girls like princesses, right? My sister doesn't know about them, no one sits and watches something with her. I feel really sad.

She doesn't have much friends either. We live in an apartment, we go to parks from time to time and of course my sister finds someone to play with for a couple hours, then the other day, there's probably different kids there. We should get along with our neighbors and find families with kids whose ages are close to my sister's, those kids will be her friends. No one cares, it's okay unless she cries and annoys them. Can't she just play by herself and not bother anyone right?

I called ""Social Services"" once, someone came and talked to me, then they called my mother and asked her to talk but my mother didn't go, then social services were no more. Of course, this led to many more fights and their behavior were even worse.

I am 22, I don't want to fight with my parents anymore, I don't want to live with them. I lived alone for a year, in a different city, for college. I came back because I didn't want to be a teacher. I didn't enjoy school but living alone was really good. My sleep schedule was right, my house was clean, I cooked, lost weight, started to read again... It was peaceful. Now I am a student in History of Arts, I really like it, I enjoy what I am learning. But, I have huge sleeping issues and my discontinuity was high. Anyway, I guess I will quit. I will find a job, I am going to live alone anyway so, what I get will be enough.

I think, my experience with bad parents made me realize what makes a better parent. I think, if I had the opportunities and will, I could make my sister very happy and help her build a better future. Unfortunately there's issues. First of all, of course, financial issues. Maybe I could find a better job if I finished college but, I can't wait 4 more years. And it would be too late for my sister anyway. What I will get won't be enough for me to take care of a child. And I actually don't want to take care of a child.

I always thought having kids is a stupid idea. How much time you can spare, they are your kids, you need to be with them and spend time with them. If you are working, think of the kids, what will they do while you are at work? You need to play with them. Do you know how to entertain little kids? Do you know what they like and what is good for their development? You can't get mad at them, you must think about the reasons behind their acts. You have to sacrifice your life, you will be there with them all the time. You can not just take some time for yourself, you have to play with them or watch them as they play. I don't mention financial side of this. They better take lessons and learn the notes or how to defend themselves at the early stages of their lives. They must have some hobbies and interests. You should always look out, what can you get for them, what can you do for them. Hell, cooking is whole another side of this. Food must look good, food must taste good and it must be healthy. You are going to cook for them everyday and manage make it look pretty. You should make shower a game, you should make everything a game, you should play with them all the time. When you want them to take a shower, you have to make sure that they'll know it will be fun. And if they don't want to get out of the shower, you have to make sure that they know there's more fun waiting outside of the shower, instead of threaten them. You must understand them, you have to be willing to take advice from professionals. ""They're my kids, I'll treat them as I like."" or ""Will I ask someone else to how to raise my child?"" mentality is bad. Hospital visits (just to check up their physical health or just for a small talk for pedagogues) should be routine. You should know that you can't know everything.

This is a big responsibility for me. I never wanted to take care of any child. Yet my parents are not ""parents"" for her. They weren't parents for me as well. I have mental issues, I want to live alone but I don't want to leave my sister behind, knowing she will be just like me. Sometimes I think maybe I should just end it, escaping all the responsibilities, not being able to think or worry about something.

Anyway I am writing this, hoping that there's a way to forget about her. I want to go, find a job and live alone. I know I will think about my sister all the time, will she make it? Will she be a good and sane person? I am hoping that, after a while, since I don't see or hear her anymore, I will forget her. But, will I? Is there a way? How can I cope with this thought if I leave everything behind, including her. I don't know, meditations? Hobbies? Any advice is welcomed.",18Aug2020,1
885,"Okay, I'm just going to admit that I suck at meeting girls, I,m not a hapless loser but most of the girls I have been romantic with recently I've met online. I have a shit ton of social anxieties and often feel clueless how I'm supposed to act in certain situations. 

I got a part time job at this a pizzeria few months back that I've worked at on and off through the years, everyone who works there are friends and we hangout all the time. 

One of the waitress I've known for awhile has shown some interest in me all of a sudden. There is a bit of an age gap (6-7 years, we are both in our 20's)  so I have never really shown much interest in her before.  I don't know if I'm misreading signs but she lights up when we talk and she really opens up to me about her personal life.

Thing is we don't really see each other that much outside of work or at work parties. She messaged me on Instagram a few times but we don't text or anything more then that. I don't know if i should just straight up ask her to hangout, text her out of the blue or just wait to see if thing evolve alittle more before I do anything.",18Aug2020,1
886," Been  dating my GF since the start of July. We clicked from the moment we  met. A lot of the same music taste and sense of humor. Always making  each other laugh. We hung out a lot and would go out and do things  together regularly and then usually come home and have sex. We met each  other's family and her mom seems to like me a lot and my parents like  her a lot. It's been everything I wanted so far until very recently.

She  had a friend from out of state that had been planning to come and stay  at her mom's house since before we met. It's a guy who she says is her  best friend that she has known for two years. It bothered me a bit at  first but she seemed totally open and honest with me about him and  didn't seem like she was hiding anything. She says this guy has a gf  too. She also brought him over to my house and I met him twice so that  built some of my trust in her too along with the fact that she had just  seemed crazy about me the past month and the way things had been going  with us.

The part where it starts  to bother me is that ever since she just doesn't seem as enthusiastic  about me since. They have taken couple-esque pictures and put them  online and she posts ""I love you"" and stuff.  People have commented  ""Y'all are cute"" and stuff on these pictures. She's supposed to go visit  him later in the year. She also posted a song called ""I want the one I  can't have"" which makes me think...

Am  I just being really, really insecure? Was kind of an outcast and didn't  do well with girls when I was a teen so sometimes I think maybe its  some leftover shitty self esteem stuff deep down in my subconscious. Not  sure if I should bring it up because if there's anything that turns  girls off its insecurity but at the same time I feel like I should  establish boundaries and not just allow things that make me  uncomfortable. I have made up narratives in my head in the past before  that looking back probably weren't true. I really like this girl and  want it to last but if she feels this way about another guy better to  end it sooner than later.

Girl is  also very religious and lives with her mom so her mom (who seems to  really like me and is devoutly religious) would be there with them most  of the time. I know being religious doesn't always stop people though.",18Aug2020,1

888,"Several years ago, I was given a sunflower plant. It grew a lot and eventually had a big bud. After we came back from a vacation, the bud was already gone and there were leftovers of the bud by our doorstep. Never wanted to plant sunflowers again after that. 

Fast forward to this year, I decided I want to try again (we moved houses). I got some seeds from Cheerios in the mail and I wanted to try it out. Out of the 9 I planted, only 3 grew. I moved them from the pot to a spot where I thought it would get the most sun and soil. Out of those 3, one grew a bud. Just like last time, the squirrels got to the bud before it could even have a chance to open. They also left some bud particles on the fence.

I'm getting really sick of squirrels ruining my plants. Any tips on how to shoo them away? I have a fake owl outside, but it doesn't seem to scare them away.

893,"I'm not sure if this belongs in r/askdocs because I'm not asking for help from doctors. I just want to know the experiences and advice of others who have gone through this.


For the first time in my life I'm opening up about my mental health and getting professional help, thanks to my awesome, amazing, and loving husband.


Our family doctor referred me to a mental health facility for mothers since we plan on trying to get pregnant by the end of this year, or beginning of next year (depends on how covid-19 goes) 


After about a month, I got a phone call from the facility. It was a man who sounded confused and annoyed. He was looking at the information that my doctor sent him and was basically all, ""I don't understand this. You're pregnant? You have OCD, anxiety, intrusive thoughts?"" 


I told him I wasn't pregnant yet, but planned to be soon. According to their website, they help mothers before, during, and after pregnancy. I fit in the before category. I didn't go into any other detail with anything else because yes, based on what I told my doctor, she wrote all that on my file. I didn't think I'd have to explain it all again. It was extremely hard the first time. Especially since I didn't even know who this guy was or what exactly he wanted from me. 


He proceeded set up an appointment for me, saying it would be an over the phone session (because of covid) and it would be 45 minutes on a certain day and time. I thanked him and hung up. 


The call has left me feeling extremely doubtful. The guy spoke like this isn't what he does on a daily basis. Doctors fill out paperwork and send it to them all the time. Why was he so confused? It's made me feel like my case doesn't belong nor do I deserve help from their counselors. 


I also feel more comfortable speaking with women (due to the trauma I've experienced with my dad). Both our family doctor and her assistant, who helped set this all up, are both women. I felt good after speaking with them about my issues. They were compassionate, understanding, and said things that made me feel like I was doing the right thing. 


I'm pretty sure the person I'm going to be talking to is a man. It might even be the man that called me all confused and annoyed! This is my very first experience with counseling and I already feel like that appointment won't go like I need it to, and I'll be left feeling like a complete idiot for opening up and seeking help. 


It could just be the anxiety talking, but I seriously think that initial phone call is telling of how that facility functions. I don't want to be vulnerable with someone who doesn't help me or makes me feel worse. 


For the most part, I want to go the medication route over the therapy route. My husband's younger sister takes medication for her depression and anxiety, and told me it's made a huge difference in her life. It's more complicated for me, because I have to be careful about what medications I take while pregnant, hence why our doctor referred me to this facility. They should know what medications would be best, send recommendations to my doctor, and my doctor will give me the prescriptions. 


I'm not fully opposed to trying therapy. It's just, I've talked about all my issues so much with my husband that I've pretty much realized why my family are the way that they are and why I am the way that I am. They have unresolved issues, as do I. I will be the only one in my family to seek professional help about it.


I don't want to be told what I already know, how I should think/feel differently, or told to talk it out with my family to mend relationships, set boundaries,  ect. I just want to function like a normal human being again and not be so afraid of everything, which honestly may or may not have anything to do with my family (my issues have developed over several years after moving far away from my family). 


I think it could be a product of my environment and being exposed to a polar opposite way of life. I grew up on the countryside and now live in a big city, in a different country. Instead of getting used to it, I've rejected it and can't learn how to live in this environment. I just need to relax about things and quiet my bad thoughts, which I think medication would work better than therapy. 


Does anyone have a similar situation? Did professional help actually make things worse? What's it like being on medication/having therapy while pregnant?",18Aug2020,1
894,"So there's this person (i'm a guy, she's a girl, we're just friends and i'm pretty sure that's what both of us want; so i'd appreciate if the song was not romantic because that would just make it all meaningless) i used to talk to almost every day and she once told me to send her a song when there's one i really like.

A few months ago we stopped talking (it was kinda my fault because i wasn't putting in enough effort into the conversation).

I don't talk to anyone really so this talking everyday felt like too much at the time and maybe this break was good.

A lot has changed since then,i've realized how important that was and i don't want to lose that and i feel like if i wait longer than i won't do it because i'll think it feels weird (we're both 18 and going to different colleges soon, so i feel like we'll forget about eachother if we don't talk now).

Since she used to ask me to send her songs, i feel like that's a good way to start this ""new chapter"" there are alot of songs i like but i think it would be nice if the song had some kind of relation to the situation.

I think she might want us to talk but is waiting for me to send something, because she sent a few messages a few weeks after we stopped talking and i also didn't put in the effort so she probably thinks i don't want her to talk to me.

Hopefully i've given you enough context for you to be able to answer this.

899,"This is going to be a longer post. Thank You in Advance for your help.

I met a guy. Let’s call him Andrew. Andrew was one of the First Friends I made when I arrived in the new city. He saw that I was struggling and really tried to help me out - making me feel welcome in a new community. We became really good friends and got along great. There was no romantic interest from either side even tho many mutual friends wished we would leave the friend one and give it a shot.

After a year, I was surprisingly forced to move 8.000km away. Andrew and I kept in contact and would text at least once a week. We got along great. But slowly I realized, that our conversations would sometimes become flirty: making fun and teasing one another. Tho it was very subtle. 

After a Year I visited during the summer. We met and spent a quite a bit of time together. Again, as friends and nothing happened. But looking back at those few days I wonder whether or not there might have been more. 

After I left, we discussed, that things felt a bit different in perspective. And then One night, just before Christmas Andrew got drunk. He never did before: He was someone who disliked big parties and stayed away from alcohol in general. 

But That night I received drunken texts from him. Very sweet compliments, that I still think of sometimes today. Nothing cheesy, truly such wonderful things that had me smiling for a week.
He asked me out on a date, in the case we should met again when one or the other was to visit.

That was a Year ago. I planned to met him this summer, but the Pandemic made things impossible. We no longer text as often as we used to. 

And still, I think about him. More and more often. But I wonder whether my feelings are genuinely for the guy I used to know, or the fantasy of the man he might be now.

He does not have a girlfriend. 
It almost feels like we are waiting for one another to cross paths again. 

Is it wrong of me to still believe we may end up one day together?",18Aug2020,1
900,"I need some advice (obviously). 
I’m a recent college graduate and was lucky enough to get the first job I applied for in this pandemic. 
I’ve been there 2 months. It’s way more working from home than I anticipated, and since the original job wasn’t designed to be WFH, I just watch 8 hours of training videos a day at home. 
The pay is pretty decent, but every single day makes me incredibly anxious. 
I don’t have the willpower to actually pay attention to these videos for 8 hours so I just let them play and do other shit in the background. This makes me feel very guilty. 
I could be doing more, but I don’t have the confidence to reach out to clients bc it’s so hard to learn a new job alone at home. 
I want to quit and become an Amazon delivery driver. This would give me structure, a reason to leave the house, I wouldn’t feel like a terrible person who sucks at their job all day long. 
The pay is just about as good, and the schedule would be fine too. I really enjoy driving.
The downside is that my current job is related to my field of study and I want to go back to grad school in a few years, so that would be helpful. 
Amazon would not advance my career per se, but it would make me way happier in this pandemic(that currently has no end in sight).
It’s not a forever gig, so why sit around at a job that makes me unhappy? 
I’ve cried about how unhappy my current job makes me on multiple occasions. 
My parents don’t want me to quit, what do you guys think?",18Aug2020,1

We had him for 2 years but earlier this year we found out that our cat was sick. We had already paid $500 for a procedure, then he started having issues again, they offered a $2,000 surgery and we decided we can’t afford to do that. Plus, what if the issue comes back? They said that there’s a chance that it could.

So we signed papers and gave him to an animal rescue shelter. I didn’t think I would care because it was my girlfriends cat, but I miss him now. My girlfriend is having a hard time, some crying and she feels like a bad person. I have a little more than the $2,000 saved up, but that’s all I have and I’m unemployed rn, not sure when the next job might come. That’s what I was thinking when we gave him away, now I feel terrible and I miss him and I wonder if he’s scared because he doesn’t know what’s happening and we’re not there.

I think I want to see if I can get him back? It’s just so much money, idk if they would even let us get him back because we gave him away. I’m not sure what to do, will I financially regret it if I get him back? Probably, but will I regret giving away our cat more? I think I might. What do you guys think? Should we just get another cat? Try and get him back? Forget about it? Idk what to do",18Aug2020,1
904,"Recently I was in a group were the question was basically 'What's a point in your life where you thought negatively of something?' and I answered with my way of thinking about love and relationships,but am now not sure if my way of thinking is wrong so I figured I'd explain it here and hopefully get some answers in this community.

So,love for the most part has felt like a bit of a C U Next Tuesday to me since I was young,10yo to be exact. Throughout my kid and teen years my siblings and I were separated in foster care due to my dad being a monster to my mom and us(though I wish they/DCFS could've just put a restraining order on him instead,but I digress). Each foster home I was in was just straight up abusive in almost every sense of the word,thus being in and out of homes for a good portion of it. All I wanted was to have a good family and home and being able to grow up and live like everyone else while secretly hoping my siblings and mom and I would be back together someday. My favorite movie as a kid was Sony's Spider-Man starring Tobey Maguire as the web slinger we all love. I remember the first time I saw it on DVD there was one thing that stuck with me for years,and that was the relationship between Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson, specifically the one scene where they're outside at night talking about their futures and all after high school. Right after I saw that scene I was in awe and thought to myself, ""I gotta find me my Mary Jane"".

The first girl I fell for was in middle school,a girl a grade above me named Senaida who also had the same homeroom as me. Like Peter and Mary Jane,we were good friends and would talk and hang around school whenever we weren't busy with work. I wanted to ask her out several times throughout our time there,but never could as she always had a boyfriend at the time. By the time she was single she was in high school already,though would quickly get a boyfriend soon enough who was an 8th grader in our school. She's now married to a different guy with a kid as well. Crazy, I know. Every other year in between after it'd be more of the same with other women,8 more to be accurate,with the last being with a former friend of mine named Nicole. Basically I fell for and was toyed by 9 women. Now I'm at the age of 24,and have come to the conclusion that I don't want to be in a relationship,married,or have kids(that last one was something I've known for years tbh,which I've heard from several is a major ""deal breaker"" with women). But maybe I'm just going about it wrong or something,idk. I am more into Canadian and Aussie women now,as well as females that are like Lexy Panterra and Selena Gomez as far as looks and personality goes,so maybe that has something to do with it. Hence why I'm asking for feedback on this forum,really.

Anyways,sorry this is so long,and I hope can get some answers. Thanks! Will

I’m so grateful to have found her and she’s already expressed that she’s in this journey with me, for as long as it takes, to help support me to my goals.  

My question is, is it acceptable to give her this gift, to show my appreciation? Or would it be weird or cause problems? Is she even allowed to accept it? It’s homemade; I didn’t spend a ton of money on it (just supplies to make it) but I spent hours and hours making it.

I actually just turned 16 a couple weeks ago and a big portion of the money came from that 💞

(Luckily I still have 💸 on Venmo, irl, cashapp, so I didn’t lose it ALL. (and I did get to order my parents stuff on amazon before this happened and they give my monthly payments in cash !so it could have been worse) 
BUT I had almost $2,000 worth of amazon credit before I lost access to my account. 

It happened because I stupidly tried to order an amazon ecard with a prepaid visa gift card that my buddy gave me😢
 
It’s weird. They need a billing statement to prove that I’m the owner of that “credit card” and the last 4 digits,mailing address, etc. I don’t have the billing statement cause it was a GIFT that was paid in cash. 

I’ve called customer service over and over (so have my parents) 

They say to expect an email that will help me get back into my account. And it doesn’t happen !!!

I get losing the $25 gift card, I dont care for that. But my whole account that I’ve had for YEARS along with balance ?? 

it’s not like my friend sent me a fake visa either, I did get to order lipgloss, and essential oils from Walmart with that BUT AHHH ITS SO FRUSTRATING am I out of luck 😳😳😳😳😳😳😳any tips?

Throughout my entire 4 years of college I have worked 2-3 jobs at a time. I’ve worked at a radio station for a few years, a TV studio, worked for multiple companies as a writer, etc. I was always told experience matters more than anything so I made sure I was well-rounded in all media forms.

Right now, I currently work as a marketing manager for a medical clinic and I’m going to school full-time. To be honest, I’m exhausted and I want to explore hobbies and passions of mine NOT related to content creation, writing, radio, etc. 

The issue is, I picked up an internship with a beauty/tech startup (On top of going to school full time and working full-time in marketing). This opportunity could lead me to (one of) my dream job (I want to work as part of a creative team for a makeup company). 

I have 3.5 years experience working as a makeup artist and multiple years of content creation experience for various companies. I don’t think NOT doing the internship would jeopardize my future, but I feel like sucking it up and doing it could lead to great things. 

I feel stuck. Should I push through in hopes of leading me to something I’d love to do long-term, or should I give myself a break and explore other options? I feel like both have a bunch of pros and cons.

My bf (27)and me (27) have been dating for 3 years. He lives with his parents(mom and dad) and I live my mom and stepdad. We live at home because we went back to school. Today, I told him that my stepdad sexually harassed me and called me a cunt. 

He said to tell him that was not correct to say. I told him I can’t because my stepfather might hit me. He told me tell your mother. My mother has always stay out of it and even when I was small always taken my stepfather side. He told me to call the cops if he did but, I am afraid that my mother would blame me and stop talking to me or even get sick so calling the cops is a hard decision.

My bf has told me to married him and he loves me more than anything. 

However, he was not angry or worry or anything when I told him. I was so hurt because when he tells anyone has hurt him, I get angry and I am very protective over him. He is a sweetheart.

I was thinking, he was going to say something like “if your stepfather hits you, I got your back, you are not alone”. But he didn’t, he was not mad that other man try to touch me or anything.

925,"Hi everyone, first post here. Not sure what to expect but I need an outlet or even better advice.

I am 27, finished my master in electrical engineering and decided to go for a PhD abroad. I found a position that seemed perfect and agreed to take it at the beginning of February. I was very happy with my choice and moved to the corresponding city in the mid of March. The hopes I had to quickly meet new people were crushed by Covid19 in full swing upon arrival. Although my roommate was casual and easy-going in the beginning, some stuff happened that made me resent him. Work was a slow starter and meeting colleagues only via web conference did not help to make me feel good in a new working environment. 

So a couple of months has passed and I am feeling more and more depressed and uncomfortable, I still have not found any friends yet. Although the quarantine regulations were loosened I still have troubles going outside and try to start doing things other then to sit at home and work and do research. Its getting harder and harder to get up in the morning and do the stuff I am supposed to do, not even speaking about finding the motivation to do research. I feel alone, I feel like have sacrificed the social circle I had in my old city for nothing but work in an environment I do not feel comfortable in. My GF is my only daily support and although this is great, the distance and my inability to communicate well over text or calls makes it hard, also I do not want to rely solely on her for emotional support. 

More and more I find myself needing drugs (weed and alkohol) to make my evenings bearable. I ran out of weed two days ago and I do not want to buy new stuff while I am in this emotional state but I recognize that I my mind desires it and wants to do nothing but chill and watch stupid youtube videos and movies that I have seen already a couple times... Which in turn makes me feel guilty cause I am supposed to work on my PhD, but everytime I grab a new article or book or try to think about topics that might be thesis-worthy, I just loose all hope and motivation cause of all the work that is in front of me. It feels like I am supposed to climb an 8k mountain with no oxygen, and I have trouble getting above treelevel.

Grad school didn't end up panning out for multiple reasons and now my field has been one of the hardest hit by COVID higher education cuts, and the job market for my field has been absolutely decimated. Since my field is so employment-oriented in general most people do commercial work for a few years between undergrad and grad school to make them more employable by colleges.

I'm wondering if you guys think I'm getting 'gaslighted' by my friends. 

The reason why I think I'm getting 'gaslighted' is cause every time I ask them If I seem like I'm doing alright they say I seem like I'm being weird. 3 days ago they said I was being werid and crazy so I went on 

reddit to ask around and everyone said that my friends were in the wrong.  I only asked in about 4 forums but I felt like that was enough cause it took a while to create a fuckin burner account. So what do you guys think? Basically every time I ask them to describe my mood they use negative connotations and shit like that to make me FEEL as if I'm the one that's being crazy.

Which is the reason why I am exposing myself to reddit by posting about this embarrassing topic.

Thanks for the help.

935,"For a long period of my life, I turned to food to comfort me. I used to binge eat so badly that I just couldn't physically stop until I threw up. Now that I'm unemployed and stuck at home while my boyfriend works, I have all the time in the world to eat. I just order food everyday and eat until I'm sick and I feel most disgusted by the fact that I have to hide it from him. I know its a problem because I have to lie and say that never happened. I'm starting to gain a lot of weight but nothing is deterring me from eating and I don't know what to do.",18Aug2020,1
936,"Hey, thanks for reading this post. I feel so incredibly lost, scared and numb right now. My mother has had alzhemiers since I was 15 and she was 63, now she’s 68 and it’s gotten very bad, she’s not the woman she used to be. Today we got the news that my dad has terminal lung cancer. I have no idea what to do, I don’t live with them anymore and have my own responsibilities but I have to take care of them. How do I deal with this? What would you do in my shoes? Thanks for any advice I really appreciate it.",18Aug2020,1
937,"This may be completely irrational to people reading this but I am still worrying about this lol. This will most likely be long. 

To put it simply, I used to be friends with someone from roughly 10 - 13 (?) years old. We'll call him Billy. We didn't go to the same primary/elementary schools but knew each other from an after school club. We also went to different high schools. 

Billy at the time had a girlfriend which started in high-school, we'll call her Millie. I think it was an okay relationship until they broke up for the first time, I don't remember the reason for the break-up. 

So this is where the tomfoolery happens: While they were already broken up, Billy was talking to another girl who did not go to their school and Millie wanted to get back with Billy. Millie didn't know about Billy's situation with this girl. Since Millie wanted to get back with Billy and he wanted to be with this new girl, he devised a plan to reject her that included me and I naively agreed to it. I thought I was being a good friend but years later I realise that I was being used to doing his dirty work. I also didn't realise how badly what I did would affect her. This took place on Facebook and was public. 

Fast forward to almost 10 years later (2019), I apologised to Millie on Facebook for what I did to her. I stated why I did what I did and how Billy was the person himself who came up with the idea for me to prevent them getting back together. I also told her that I naively agreed to it and should have declined to do so in the first place. It took me this long to apologise to her because I didn't realise how badly I may have hurt her then, she still didn't end up forgiving me but it's whatever. 

The reason I'm paranoid is because I came across Billy's Instagram in 2019 too. I've seen the dude's pictures and the guy looks like what we call a roadman in the UK, someone who's likely to be involved in illegal shit. I also have to mention that I'm from London, where acid attacks and stabbings are an occurrence. I know I'm probably being melodramatic but I'm worried if either of those things happen to me out of revenge. I did run into him again in 2019 too, I only made eye contact with him but we went our separate ways. I'm worried if he finds out from someone in his old school that I told her the truth. I wanted to do the right thing because I felt bad but I don't want my life to be in danger over this situation. 

I don't know, maybe I'm projecting my own ability to feel vengeful regularly onto him? Maybe he won't care since the situation was so long ago? We're all in our early 20's now. 

I also have to mention that the guy was a manipulative and toxic friend. I regret not ditching him sooner but was too naive to see it when I was younger. He may have had some good moments but that doesn't negate the facts. 

I should also mention that I am clinically diagnosed with Paranoia so this could all be in my head but still. 

TL;DR: Ex-friend is in relationship with girl in high school, they break up. Girl wants to get back with him but he comes up with a plan that includes me in it to prevent them from getting back together. I naively agreed to it and sent an apology almost 10 years later telling her the truth. I'm paranoid that he may stab me or splash me in the face with acid out of revenge.",18Aug2020,1
938,"So I (21F) found out a couple months ago that my grandpa(late 60s?) used to “inappropriately touch” my first cousin (his granddaughter). I do not know how physical it got or how long it went on or when it ended, i do know that there was never any sex involved of any sort, but i was otherwise only told “inappropriately touched “. Not that it matters, because it’s disgusting. It was gut wrenching and horrifying and heart breaking because my father(45) and i were so close with him. I haven’t seen him in person since but i have had a few phone interactions with him because after the news broke he attempted to k*** himself and has apologized profusely and i have reminded him more than once through text that i love him and that hopefully some day things can be okay. My grandma hasn’t left him and it’s not my business to worry about. I have my own mental illnesses to handle and the whole topic is so heavy my fragile mind can’t take it, i already have new scars since hearing the news. My dad on the other hand has seen him on occasion only due to taking care of my grandmother and not wanting her to feel stranded. With COVID happening we have no idea how long it will take till any legal action can be made and in the meantime my dad said he looks like he’s aged a hundred years, and i know what it feels like to want to give up on life. My absolute disgust, moral values, and empathy for my cousin has trumped every other emotion I’ve had about him. But sometimes when i think everything’s ok in life i remember my grandpa, who i loved so much and spent so much time with, spending every day crying and hating himself and practically dying... and i want to do something but i don’t know what and i don’t feel morally okay forgiving him for the sake of his well being. It’s just hard... does anyone have any advice?",18Aug2020,1
939,"This first little thing will be a bit of back story type thing of why I want to leave kinda. Also sorry for the length!

 I have been in this community my whole life, I went to the elementary school that feeds into the middle, and now I'm in high school (sophomore). Though, most people do not like me as I am one of the weird kids at school, since I like anime and do cosplay, which people make fun of me for. Plus my school is very small, so it's hard to make new friends, especially when almost everyone knows of everyone. I have a friend circle that has shortened over the years.  Though, now it seems like most of them are getting kinda fake and quite frankly done with me. Over the years I have invited them over to my house to swim, or something along the lines of that and they always have a reason for not coming, which they sometimes tell me the day of. (I've also invented them to go places outside of my home, but still nothing) They also don't invite me to anything other than birthday parties. I went to a homecoming party, we met up and took pictures, then went back to a friends house. First, I was the only person who didn't get ready with a group since no one invited me, then everyone was in a group, so I couldn't invite anyone, but any who the 'planner' decided to move the pictures 30 minutes earlier. Now I didn't have my phone on me because I was getting ready. Though, that may just be bad planning. Now, after the dance, we went to one of the people's house to have a party type thing. It was really fun, though only a couple people really talked to me, and I mainly talked to one of my only friends left. After a few hours, and most of the people leaving, they started talking about having a halloween party. They had talked about having it on a Friday. I told them that didn't work for me since I had marching band on Game nights. They said that was fine and they would change it to Saturday, so I could come. Then they proceeded to not invite me or tell me when it was. I also feel like whenever I join conversations with my 'friends' I ruin the mood or something. Now, I only have about two real friends.

Any who enough about why I want to move because of my friends, here some more reasons. My school is not diverse in the slightest. It's basically all a bunch of racist white kids. Granted I am white, but I like Kpop and anime and stuff like that, which people make fun of me for. We also have a god awful, sexist dress code. Basically, it doesn't matter what the boys wear, but if the girls wear anything that slightly shows their shoulders and stuff, they get in trouble. Not to mention that we (girls) can't wear gym shorts... If boys are going to be distracted by gym shorts there's a big problem. At some other schools, their philosophy is if they can't see your butt, boobs, or bra, its fine, which is very fair! And at another school that my friend goes to, they can basically wear anything. In my state, or at least at my school, we have to have at least 2 language credits (classes). My school offers Spanish, then online Chinese. I don't really have any interest in Spanish, so I would like to do Chinese. I put that on my schedule when I was going into my freshman year, but they said freshman can not take online classes since its stressful. Alright, fair enough. Well, they proceeded to let two boys in my grade and class take online Spanish. And they still (more than likely) won't let me take it. Though, at my friend's school they have Chinese, which they will actually let people take, since there is diversity! My brother went to my friends county at some point, he's a lot older than me, and my parents said he did the best there. I probably will get better opportunities there. 

Now lets talk about why I don't want to move: At my school now we have an amazing band program! I don't really want to leave the band because of how good it is. We have amazing halftime routine and we rock the field. Though, at the other school that I might go to if I switch, they have a pretty good band too. I haven't seen the half time show because they're not in my county. Though, by looking at pictures and stuff they look like they have an amazing time! Another reason I don't want to move is I am on the tennis team. This year I'm basically guaranteed a varsity spot. I'm not like super good or anything, but a bunch of seniors left, so I have a spot. If I move I might not get that. There's also a few teachers that I would miss a lot. Though, theres only four that I would miss a bunch. 

TL;DR: I want to move because I don't have many friends and no one really likes me and my school is quite racist and sexist. Though, my band is awesome and don't really wanna move because of that.

I have no clue what to do, please, any advice would help!!",18Aug2020,1
940,"I need some serious advice here.

To start off, let me just say that I’m not a confrontational person, and I want everyone to be happy. However, I have a strong desire to do what is right, especially when it comes to my friends. In this case though, both parties are friends of mine.

So my fiancé and I had a couple that we are very close with. We went on trips together, hung out together, etc. all through college, and we’ve kept in touch despite having graduating in May and not living close together.

This couple (for the sake of this we’ll call them Betty and Archie) just recently broke up. My fiancé and I found out because we sent a single invitation to Betty, who is one of the bridesmaids, addressed to both of them, since it was assumed they would be coming together as each other’s plus 1. Betty informed my fiancé that they would both be coming, but not as a couple anymore.

We intended to give them both their own plus ones because we felt bad about them having broken up, but we never settled on that decision and didn’t tell them they were allowed a plus 1.

I recently found out that Archie broke up with Betty because he was cheating on Betty with a girl from their friend group (who we’ll call Veronica). Every member of that friend group is aware of the cheating except Betty who is living states away from everyone else. Archie only broke it off because the group threatened to tell Betty if he didn’t end it. However Betty still doesn’t know.

This past weekend, Archie went to visit Veronica who has a roommate we’ll call Cheryl.  Cheryl is a part of their friend group and works with Taylor, another of my fiancé’s bridesmaids, so now through the grapevine, of course, my fiancé is all caught up on what has happened.

Today we were informed by Cheryl that Archie intends to bring Veronica as his plus one to the wedding where Betty is a bridesmaid, still unaware of the whole picture.  We didn’t tell him he got a plus one, but he decided to invite her anyway. Now, I have been tasked with talking to Archie and telling him he isn’t allowed a plus 1 at the wedding, despite the fact that he doesn’t know I’m aware of his infidelity.

How the heck am I supposed to have that conversation? He’s my buddy, but his love life is none of my business.  Yet, How could I not say something when I’m also friends with his ex?  I also feel like I have to say something in order to protect my fiancé and myself from any unnecessary drama at our wedding.",18Aug2020,1

943,"Hi reddit, I'm losing my mind as usual.

So a little backstory: I had a sort of casual relationship with this guy last semester (I'm in college) and things ended really abruptly because we were sent home due to the pandemic. But before things ended, I sort of caught feelings for him and told him about it. He didn't feel the same way, which was whatever. 

But now that we're back on campus, it feels like I'm being watched wherever I go. I know I'm just in my head, but our situation feels so unresolved since we haven't spoken since last semester. I feel so insecure and he's all I can think about. I feel like I'm going crazy. I haven't even seen him yet, but I'm so scared because he's completely taken over my mind.

945,"So probably a specific question, but I’m stuck on what to do. My family got their stimulus checks a few months ago, yet when I keep checking the IRS website with my SSN it says it’s still being processed for many other people and that I’d have to wait to even get a status on it. I’ve been waiting for the past two months, and whenever I call the IRS they just say to be patient because the people who answer the phones don’t have any access to things like people’s accounts or statuses. I’ve tried calling different numbers the IRS call center gives me, but I’m always redirected back to them. They’ve also told me not to include my direct deposit info into my IRS account in case the check is being processed/on its way (so it doesn’t screw it up or something). I have filed my 2019 taxes, so I’m not sure if I need to do something else or contact someone else, or if I should include my direct deposit info anyway, or if I need to keep being patient?

946,"This is kind of embarrassing but here's a little back story...

So I met this girl at work and we hit it off. We've talked about what we're looking for and stuff like that, things are going really well. We had a talk about sex a few days ago and we decided that next time we hang out we could. Today is that day. She's meeting me tonight and we're going straight to her place.

Here's the issue, about a year and a half ago I tried to hookup with a girl on tinder, we were making out and everything and I tried to take it to the next level, she said that next time we would. So next time comes along and I couldn't get my dong up. She said no biggie we'll try next time. Next day comes along and again, dong doesn't go up. More flaccid than ever. She broke things off with me as I simply wasn't able to perform. That really fucked with my head a lot.

Its been over a year and a half since that incident and my mental health has gotten so much better these past few months but I still have the fear I won't be able to get it up again. It should be noted that I'm 18M and a virgin. I have pleasured myself in 6 days (which is pretty good for how often I used to before)
So I'm hoping it'll go up right away this time. I'm more comfortable with this girl than I was with the last and I think I have a better sense of foreplay but I still wanna make sure it goes up.

Are there any strategies I can use to help it go up? If anyone suggests ED meds the issue is I am on other meds that unfortunately prevent me from using any meds to help with ED as comboing them can potentially be harmful. The meds im currently on make my dong hard for a very long time if it does go up. So all I really need to do is just get it up and I should be fine for the rest of the night.

Any advice is appreciated!",18Aug2020,1
947,"My parents don't pay attention to me and are emotionally neglectful. They don't want to spend quality time, or talk, or do anything fun ever. No one takes the initiative to make fun plans. 

I'm starved for affection and love too. They don't say they love me or hug me or kiss me or anything unless I tell them to. Like they're following orders. 

I've subconsciously (but now I'm aware of it) been reinforced with the idea that they will only pay any real attention when I'm in crisis mode.

Now I get worked up over little things easily and go into a panic or into despair. I can't regulate my emotions or be happy on my own. 

I need my parents to fix my mood and pay attention to me. I only feel cared for when they are consoling me or caring for me as if I'm a baby or child.

948,"So I’ve been buddy’s with this dude from around the start of hs, now we are both graduating this year. It seems as though he has changed, increasingly has become smarter(thanks to me) but also more cocky and demanding at the same time because of that. He’s gone down a path of making money without a job(to put it simply) which I’m not bothered with as I myself have dabbled in it aswell, and this isn’t why I want to end our relationship. With his career choice he has tried to become dominating of me/controlling, “when are you doing this?” “When’s the next time you can do that” and as someone who’s never been put in this situation idk what to do. It’s not to the point where it’s alarming or dangerous, but I’m afraid it will end up that way in the future if I don’t do anything rn. So how should I go about this, realistically I end it asap and just move on but this comes with some risks, 1. Him getting mad 2. Him labeling me as back stabber or fake friend and 3. Him wanting to fight me or worse because of the combination of 1 and 2. 
Or continue what I am doing now and slowly distance ourselves(he has noticed I’m doing this and asked why I don’t answer back and I say I’m busy or some shit)

951,"My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 9 years. We’ve had our ups and downs ofcourse but he truly is my best friend. He’s always there for me, is literally the sweetest person ever and treats me with respect, even when we argue. But since I’ve come across his porn habits, things have been a little strange. 

It all started 2 months ago when I accidentally came across his porn. I saw that he had been buying scat porn. We were on a break at the time that he purchased these videos and interacted with this only fans woman so I brushed it off, but was still a bit grossed out. He was extremely embarrassed that I saw his porn and promised to never watch it again, which we all know was utter bullshit. But whatever, we got back together around that time. At first I didn’t want anything to do with him but I thought about it and decided that it wasn’t my business what he looked into on his own time and as long as he wasn’t forcing it onto me it was alright. 

Weeks later, I came across loli porn. For those who don’t know, loli porn is basically the portrayal of small young looking women engaging in sexual acts. The loli porn that I saw was a comic like story that portrayed girls as young as six years old having sex with father figures. I was disturbed by this even more and this is where I drew the line. I told him that he needed to see a therapist. (Before you guys judge me for telling him to see a therapist, I have to tell you that he suffers from ADHD. Porn addiction is pretty common in ADHD and not only did I suspect he was addicted to porn, but he hasn’t been treating his ADHD for YEARSSS. it’s so bad that he loses job after job and can’t even focus enough on submitting his own applications, I usually have to help or even do them for him, but back to the story)

He agreed to see a therapist and this was over a month ago. He still hasn’t seen anyone. Just recently, like today, I found more disturbing porn. This time it was more scat, but this time it was people eating their shit, having messy scat sex, girls vomiting in vases or sucking cock and vomiting all over themselves in the act. I’m becoming extremely worried for him, and our relationship. Maybe I just don’t understand men and their porn habits and should just turn a blind eye whenever it comes up but it truly bothers me. I tried to be understanding of his porn but it worries me. I’m worried that I’m wasting my youth with someone who will have an even worse porn addiction once we live together and have kids, causing further problems once we’re married. 

I really love him...I really do...but I really don’t know how to handle this anymore. I don’t know if I should ignore it because this issue could potentially affect our future together. Or can it? Am I just over thinking it? I don’t wanna have to worry that my bf won’t be able to get hard because I’m not shitting or vomiting on him. I don’t want us to have children and have our child come across his disgusting porn accidentally like I have. Are these porn fetishes something that’s common? Am I just a bit too conservative? 

As I mentioned before, he’s a great guy. My little brother loves and looks up to him, and my mom loves him too. He’s even cut off people in his life that have caused issues for us, no matter how important they were to him our relationship always came first. Is this just simply a guy watching porn and he’s EXTREMELY freaky? Or should I be concerned? What should I do guys? Please help me....",18Aug2020,1

955,"Hello, I'm 21F looking for some advice. Bonus if you have some legal knowledge

I just moved into my new apartment complex (on the 14th) and all was going well and smoothly. We move all our stuff in and finally sat down to relax

Suddenly I'm hearing this loud low bass sounding oscillating pulsating vibration sound. The kind of sound that hits your ear drums in a migraine panic attack enducing way. At first I'm like

Okay
Maybe it'll go off in an hour or so. Nope. I adjust the AC. I turn it off. Nothing works. This vibration will oscillate loud enough to shake the entire apartment. It's so bad that I shoved ear plugs as far down my canal as I could but it's so low pitched that it's just vibrating through my brain and there's nothing I can do to drown it out. Had a noise machine going and everything 

Honestly
I just start crying. I'm breaking down and I can't sleep because I know there's no way I can live like this. In Texas is this hot nearly 6 months out of the year. 

I contact the leasing office, send in a complaint, a maintenance request and an email to my leasing agent. Possibly overkill but I'm panicking at this point. It's miserable. My dad comes over to check it out and turns off every switch on the breaker....and the hum is worse. Like it sounds like we are parked next to an 18 wheeler. 

My dad and I go to the office and thankfully someone talked to us despite them being appointment only. They are very nice. I hadn't had any issue dealing w them signing the lease. She was able to send the emergency maintenance guy to check it out 

And he acknowledges how bad the noise is and goes up on the roof to check

Turns out 25+ ac units for the apartment units surrounding us are directly above me working in full power. He says they are brand new and there is nothing he can do except report back to the complex. 

So now it is a waiting game and I'm just so depressed right now. We have our old apt until the end of the month but my boyfriend and I are living w my parents because everything is moved into the new place.

I've tried to tolerate it but I just end up crying in physical pain because the migraines it enduced. 

My hope is they can have us switch units. It's Sunday so I haven't heard back. But I'm so scared they'll just say to suck it up because we've already signed the lease and I truly cannot live like that. I can't. 

I guess my question is what's y'all's opinions, any legal advice, etc
This is happening all hours of the day.

Update: they've sent multiple people out to the roof and today the leasing agent came to our apartment. She said this: 

We had Pearson's, a professional AC company, come out to inspect your unit and the roof. Pearson's had informed us that all A/C's are working as they should, but they will be putting a rubber plank down in between the A/C units and the roof to help with the noise. Since they need to order the product, this will not be resolved immediately.  As soon as the product comes in, they will let us know and install it. 

And she also told my boyfriend ""well you signed a lease so"" 

I read my lease and nothing mentions what the next steps are if this is an issue. It only mentions construction and how we basically have to put up with that.

But this part could take weeks to come in and they're not giving us an ETA. I can't even live there. Idk what to do.

959,"First proper post, long time lurker. 

I’m 32 years old and grateful for everything I have in my life, but ultimately I’m unhappy. Recently I’ve started feeling the pressure of life passing me by, and needing to make changes to avoid settling for a life I don’t love. 

I have a good university degree which led to a decent career, in a big city. As a recent graduate the job I had meant working long hours, making money for big corporations, and it got me down. I was stressed and felt like my work had no positive impact on society. So, a couple of years ago I moved a ‘socially good’ company to try and give back. It hasn’t changed how I feel. I don’t get satisfaction from my daily work, still remain quite stressed, and ultimately feel we operate to make money so the social mission is just a marketing tag line.

I have conflicts between working up my current career path (or similar), feeling stressed and unhappy, but maybe one day earning enough money to buy a house and start a family, or changing career for a life I would enjoy, but potentially sacrificing those things. I do not come from money, and despite a good job I have always had to be self sufficient so I certainly don’t have enough money now to achieve those goals, or afford to take big risks.

I romanticise the idea of moving out of the city, out of the corporate world, maybe working a farm or bed and breakfast, or teaching whilst travelling the world. Or even trying a different city based job but not having money makes that daunting and I can’t afford to take time out to retrain. I was first in my family to get a degree and they have always put pressure on me to have a particular kind of job and be the ‘successful one’.

I would love to hear from someone who is/was in a similar position and how they started to even identify what to address or what first steps to take? 

Tl;dr: I’m unsatisfied and generally unhappy in my corporate role, and scared to make a significant change. Help!",18Aug2020,1

Though my sister always goes on about herself and lowkey flirts with my brother. My brother got D in his BTECS and hes comparing it to A and my A levels, which i personally know are harder academically than BTECS. My sister put a instagram post up about him, she congratulates him and compliments him everytime she sees him , I get nothing. I hardly get a compliment.

My other sister pays attention, I enjoy spending time with her but its hard to talk to her properly because were basically almost different generations. My dad thinks im miserable because I applied for depression medication 2 years ago and doesnt ask me about my life or push me. He is ALWAYS supporting my brother applying for the army than compared to me getting an Industrial job and working with robots.

Its so biased and I dont know why. I dont want to have to let go of my family but one of the reasons why I want to move away is because of the lack of attention anyone gives me.

973,"
A bit about me I am a 15m and just about to enter my final year of GCSEs I am very into theatre and movies though I can’t act for my life I tend to do backstage but I adore all of drama and can talk for hours about it with the right person. I am also the only one of my “friends” with a clear plan for the future I won’t get into it but it’s to do with writing and directing. I am not Athletic and I think then act (this is the opposite to my friends who tend to act ask questions later) and the final info is that for the past couple weeks I have been chatting and really getting along with a (girl who we will call Elisa) that that 2 of my other friends like.

I will now give an explanation on how the Dynamics of the friendship group works there are 9 people excluding me in the group with 2 outsider and another group of girls that we sometimes hang with this group includes the girl that I like (important later) in the core group there is 3 girls and 6 boys to get one thing out the way I hate the girls I think they are horrible people and they hate me this is not an issue as it’s just a case of we all ignore each other the 6 boys in the group are who I’m going to be focused on below but the 2 that are outsider one of them is a lovely guy but he is not focused on friendship and more on his music and studying the other is disliked by all the group apart from me there are reasons for this that are too deep to get into now but the short of it is that he used to be a really nasty person that’s changed in the last 4 years and he’s now quite nice but very bad at reading the room anyway on with it

I think the best way for me to do this is to create a list and give the issues with that friendship 

My first friend I will call Marcus he is a really nice person I have been friends with Hims for almost 5 years now and me him and one other who has since left the school created the group together. Marcus and my friendship is really difficult as we don’t always see eye to eye  we have completely different interests and personality’s but we never have big fights and it’s coming to the point where there is nothing to talk about anymore our friendship is just dying and I don’t know weather to try and save it or move on 

My second friend we will call Liam he is brash and has a massive ego complex and has proven over and over that he cannot be trusted if telling someone something can get even a small laugh he has destroyed potential relationships by trying to get a laugh out of a crowd. And he never see what he’s done wrong I have been trying to end our friendship for some time but what ever happens he always comes back into my life and I can’t get rid of him 

3 is Cody he is a good person we have different interests but in a good way my problem here is I have messed up with him and he finds me and my personality quite annoying it started with me talking to a Elisa about Hamilton as well as other Theatre on a group chat to be fair it was like upwards of 200 messages which he got understandably annoyed at but from there he has bear witness/ over heard me talk about similar stuff a lot and he thinks I’m obsessed to a point that I can even talk about movies with out him having a go at how I’m obsessed with it. The other problem is my sense of humour is for lack of a better term weird I find random stuff funny as well as I cry a lot I’m I’ve never been afraid to shed a tear and I can tell it’s affected how he views me I really don’t know what I can do here I want to keep this friendship but I fear it’s to damage to repair

4 is brook he is one of the people that likes Elisa witch causes a bit of rivalry between us but the problem is that he is the person I was 2 years ago witch is a version of me im glad is gone as I felt that I was constantly overshadowed by every one around me but the biggest issue is that I’m scared that our mutual crush on Elisa will drive a wedge between us which will leave both of us upset and him angry at me so I don’t know if I should end it now and look back on the fun memories or should I carry on and hope for the best

5 is Logan he is the outsider mentioned above he is also the other friend that likes Elisa me and him get on well despite troubles in the past the issues with him are every one in my current group hates him and Elisa confided in me that he makes her uncomfortable (I won’t get into to it here but I is understandable from her position) so my issue here is I basically have a choice him or the rest of my group they will not Budge on hating him but some wounds are to deep to heal and it’s hard to be around both parties as it’s a constant string of insults towards him and when ever I try to do something nice with him it’s always a chore due to the constant badging of why I’m hanging out with him 

Some final troubles I have 
There is no one I can Confide in they have all at some point or another proven that they don’t care or take seriously my issue and in one case shouted it out to the world to hear 
None of them respects me 
And none of them take seriously my Social issue/ General dislikes

But every game we play together, he just keeps boasting about the plays he makes while I just try to focus on the game itself. It’s becoming irritating and I’m tired of saying “Good job” or “Nice one dude” every 10 seconds. Every win we get, he just takes credit, saying he totally carried us as a support (we play league a lot, if yall know the game) or whatever role he is even though there are other good players on the team that are potentially better than him. Even at times when i try to tell him about a great play, he just brushes it off and says “ Yea, but did you see ME do....”

Basically, how do I deal with him? I’m sick and tired of listening to him, constantly bragging about every small detail, real life too not only in-game. It actually exhausts me, cause he always expects a reaction and makes me not want to play anymore. I don’t want to hurt his feelings though, he is a great friend.

979,"Hello! I'm from Romania. This summer I went to my grandmother for school holidays as usual, because next year I have an important exam, my mother sent me to her Romanian Language teacher from when she was my age. 
The teacher(she) was really kind to me and helped me a lot for the next year's exam, and now, after 2 months I need to go back home to prepare for the new school year.
Now I want to tell you more about my teacher  she was born when the communism started and lost her father at a really young age, then she married in a village approx. 175km from home(they met in collage), she had a bad life with her new relatives, had a single boy that got married to a woman that became mean to her in the past few years. She has two grandchildren, a grandson in second year of college that is approx. 2m tall and a granddaughter in sixth grade. 
Now a few months a knife from her kitchen had disappeared and around the same time her old fridge(just the freezer, the light still works) broke without a reason. After that she started feeling more sick and her legs hurting a lot more, for a few days she berealy walked. She didn't make any connection between the events.
Yesterday she got a new fridge and moved the old one to a storage room. But when she was moving the fridge outside the kitchen, she noticed the knife stabbed into the wooden planks floor, it was there for a long time because  it was pretty dusty. When she saw it she froze for a few seconds.
Today she told me about her discovery and told me she suspects her daughter in law for the knife. She told me that the knife was deep in the floor and that she went thought a lot of trouble to remove it. When I touch the knife I felt a strange feeling like like a gut feeling but more intense. I told her that it might be cured and that she should burry it into the ground (this was the single advice a could think of at the moment and I thought this because I know that the best way to despous of Ouija boards is to burry it into the ground so I thought that this might work for this too). She told me that she made a connection between the events and when she started to feel  sick.
She told me that she thinks the events happened like this: 
First her daughter in law took the knife from the kitchen, then probably or probably not, took it to a witch to curse it.
Second she(the daughter in law) told her son to move the fridge a bit and stab the knife in the wooden planks floor and this is when the fridge broke.
And third she started feeling sick.
And she thinks that the knife is the reason why she felt sick because after she removed it she started to feel better little by little.

I want to ask what you think and if the advice I gave her about burying the knife into the ground was good and what other advice I should give her.

Wish I was joking, that would make this funny for me instead of everyone else.

if I were 12 or 14 and in an LGBT supporting house growing up I would call myself trans, get on hormones and come out looking like my sisters, but it's much too late for that (yes people have told me ""it's never too late"" but that is not really true in my case).

I'm 25, I just figured out 6 months ago that I would have been trans if I caught it in time realized why I never fit, and always felt I was kept form my kind of people.

Part of what cracked that realization open was realizing that I never wanted to have sex as a man, and that had the thought ""I can never have a baby"" and it broke my heart.

Idk if that counts as a perversion, it's not sexual, I just wanna be a mom.

986,"Sorry about formatting, I’m on mobile!

I’m currently 22, I’ve just graduated and I’m soon to be moving 6,000 miles away from my family to start my career abroad and I’ve secured a place with a very reputable company (though nothing is likely to happen for at least half a year given the situation in the world right now!) 

I’ve been fortunate enough to have a family that I love very much. I went to college but I commuted to campus from home as I lived close by, which helped save a lot of money. My sister (who is like my best friend) will be having her first baby at the end of the year. My childhood dog is getting very old, as are my parents.

A part of me just feels so scared and upset to leave home at all. While I’ve just secured my dream job in my dream country, I can’t help but feel all this anxiety. I am terrified that one of my family will die and I will be stuck 6,000 miles away. In my head, this rationalizes as something like: “you’re going to regret ever leaving home, because if something terrible happens, you have just “wasted” all those years abroad that could have been spent with your family.”

Perhaps important to note is that 5 years ago my brother died very suddenly and since then I’ve had a lot of anxiety about my own death and the death of my family. For example, I dread when one of them goes out somewhere, i.e. to get groceries and drives on their own. It’s not crippling and it’s never stopped me doing things, but it isn’t nice to live with. I’ve simply accepted this as a result of my past grief but I’m aware it’s playing a big role in how I feel now.

I’d appreciate any sort of advice. Anyone who has been in a similar situation. I’m sure I’m not the first young person to be anxious and even sad to be leaving home for the first time, but the long distance certainly adds to the impact it’s having on me. I want to be ambitious and successful, chase my dreams and have amazing experiences, but I love my family so much and I don’t want to miss out on the short time we have left on this earth together.

TL;DR: I fear missing out on my family’s lives and get anxiety that they will die, but I’ve landed my dream job and long to live abroad in an incredible new country. I just don’t know which course of action I may come to regret more.",18Aug2020,1

At the 1st trial Judge said ""sorry if I am texting during the case. My daughter is having a hard time."" And he went back to completely ignoring testimony. End of that trial I have all rights as father removed and see her less than someone that sexually assaulted their child.
Fast forward 10 yrs daughter attempts suicide because of the abuse at her mother's house. I take her to Children's hospital where they write a 23 page report on the abuse that she has suffered (also where her mother abducts her again).
Courts in my state issue orders my ex relinquishment of my daughter, and abduction charges as well as contempt of court charges and slew of others. However, apparently all you have to do is cross state lines and then kidnapping becomes legal at least if you cross into inbred dumb fuck States like Nebraska.
Weeks Later at the hearing in my home state the judge throws out the entire report and then sentences me to take parenting classes to reduce conflict.

Take away from all this: if you are a father remember you have no rights ever. The legal system, which is a redundant joke, was created to make lawyers rich. Those lawyers become judges that keep up the rich tradition of shiting on citizens( at least those without a uterus). And those quote-unquote deadbeat dads are actually created by the courts or they just skip the middleman and realized there's no point because you will be crushed by the courts.

990,"Just to preface, I’m Not considering suicide or anything like that, so just bear in mind that my life doesn’t depend on the response this post gets.

I’ve had an issue with intrusive thoughts and a racing brain for about 3 years now. I haven’t been able to turn my brain off and it’s just constantly over analyzing every little thing, to the point where it’s caused me serious emotional stress. I started dating a girl who I have liked for years, who I’ll call “A”. We finally got together and I was so happy, and then once the thought of, “what if I don’t want this?” crept in, it never left. I really enjoyed being with her and she made me happy, but I always had this constant anxiety about being with her. I didn’t know what to do so I told her about it and it led to us breaking up; I just couldn’t deal with it anymore, even thought I still had feelings for her. My brain just constantly made me feel like I didn’t want to be with her, even though I did and still do. This has been going on for a while but this is definitely the worst it’s been. We’re still broken up and she went to college this morning, and now I miss her so greatly and I feel like I may have made the wrong choice. At this point I can’t tell what I’m feeling or if my brain is just fucking with me again. I got a neuropsych about a year and a half ago which chatted that my anxiety levels were clinically significant, and when I try to ask for my parents to try to help me get medication, they are terrified and want me to find another way. I just feel incapable of loving someone and feel like I’m insane. And when I ask for help it never works out. I just don’t know what to do at this point.

991,"Hey Reddit, I’m a 26m who got arrested when I was 19 for having a marijuana pipe on me I’m Arizona. Got charged with a misdemeanor but it was dismissed after I took a class and paid a fine.



I just got hired at a job that is going to pay me 100k a year. HUGE accomplishment for me because I was only making 40k prior. 

It’s not a government job. It’s a job in finance.

I’ve worked for a lawfirm and had multiple
office jobs and this misdemeanor has never been brought up during background checks but I had one job that mentioned I had a dismissed misdemeanor and they asked me about it. Until then, I didn’t know employers could see it.

I smoke weed maybe twice a month so I’m going to have to use fake pee for the drug test which sucks and is nerve wrecking but I’ve done it before and it’s worked.

im currently on vacation i got sick like a week ago 
i couldn’t really eat anything or not much since it made me feel like throwing up
i’m a lot better now 
it’s been almost 4 days since everything stopped and i got “back to normal”
i lost like 3 pounds and that actually made me kind of happy because loosing weight is really hard for me
anyway i now can’t get myself to eat anything and i feel really bad when doing so
my mom is worried but i think that its normal?
she says that i’m starving myself and now i’m not sure
i do only eat when i feel really really hungry and if i do it’s like just a tiny bit of bread but thats because the thought of eating too much makes me sick to my stomach 
isn’t that normal after being sick?

996,"Okay so backstory.....

The summer before 5th grade we moved to a trailer park. There, I met C. I instantly started to like him. Then, the summer before 6th grade we told each other we liked each other. 

My family moved again and me and C were still friends (we never dated)

During 7th grade my sister and I were pulled out of school because we were being bullied. 

C stopped talking to me. A couple months later he told me to die in a hole. After that, I started to hate him.

Okay now for the question....

Sometimes I have dreams about C and I still think about him from time to time. 

I’m honestly confused. I don’t know if I still like him or not. Do I? But I shouldn’t right?  Idk....

999,"Today me and my friend decided to go ride our bikes around our small city and after some time we decided to stop for around 7 minutes because we didn't feel like going home yet. So we stopped, drank some water, took some photos and we went back home.
As we are heading back home we see an ambulance, an emergency car (basically a car that has a doctor and a nurse, that is supost to be faster than an ambulance, only goes on extreme cases) a police car and firefighters just arrive and stop at a big bridge near our houses.
The police starts talking to a man on the street and a crowd is starting to form.
I decide to ask one of the police men what happened and he only had time to say ""a woman"" before rushing to talk to his colleague.
We found out around 1 hour later that a woman that lived in our street tried to commit suicide by jumping off the bridge. I'm saying trying because I don't know if she died or not. Because of the height of the bridge and the small amount of water it has on the side she jumped to, I honestly doubt it.
And now I just can't help but wonder: what would have happened if we didn't stop. Could we have prevented her from jumping? I mean, probably.
Worst case scenario we would have been the ones to see it and call 112 (911 where I live). I can't just shake this feeling off that I could have maybe done something, that woman could still be alive or at least she wouldn't be fighting for her life in a hospital if only we had decided to keep going and not stop because of something as insignificant as ""we don't wanna go home yet"".
So how can I feel better and cope with this? I didn't know the woman personally but she was very nice and we changed a couple of words from time to time, both when I went to her workplace or when I passed by her house.",18Aug2020,1

so the only two representations of people my age that I know are people from school and people on social media, who mostly are all tiktok influencers who all are just on there to show off their looks, and set unrealistic standards for everyone. 

The other type is the teens that go to protests and stuff, now I think this is amazing and a part of my generation that I’m really proud of, however the majority of people I know that go to protests are actually pretty judgy cliquey people that may be “good” but they aren’t actually kind or inclusive day to day.

1032,"Story time!

So I’ve been involved with a guy who’s older than me by about 10 years (I was 21 at the time). Long story short we made a sex tape and I immediately regretted it after the fact. Yes, I did agree to making it at first; but the thing was I knew it was a short fling between us and I didn’t feel comfortable with him holding on to the video forever. So that same night we made it, I practically begged him to delete the video SEVERAL times, to which he kept saying no. I was upset and confused why he wouldn’t listen to me, I didn’t think asking him to delete this was a huge ask. He kept saying that I needed to trust him, that I was overreacting and that he’d never use the video against me. In my mind I believed that he wouldn’t do something like share the video, but now I was just annoyed by his complete refusal to delete the video and ignore my feelings. Before I left he said that I was projecting on to him (based on how men typically behave in these types of scenarios) and that I needed to stop. At this point I felt like I was being gaslighted. 

Fast forward a couple nights, I come over again and we get into a huge argument. After I brought up the situation again he claimed that he wanted to keep it so he could watch it whenever he wanted. I told him that since I was in the video I also had a right to decide if I wanted the video gone or not. We go back and forth a couple times and he says some pretty rude things to me. He then mocks me and says that he’s the one with the video and that he’ll post it online. At this point I left cause I was pissed and crying. 

After this he tried to keep in contact with me but I wasn’t having it. I didn’t speak to him for months and cut him out of my life. He did apologize but tbh it didn’t seem that meaningful.  He claimed that he said he was going to post it online just out of frustration and to point of how ridiculous my fears were (????) He never deleted the vids either but he did share em with me. Anyway long story short I met him up after months and we rekindled. I’m still in contact with him to this day and it kinda makes me feel sick. I know the answer is obvious but I want to hear others opinions. He’s saying that he’s going to be in my city soon and I assume he wants to meet. Should I cut ties with him? What should I tell him? Do you think I was in the wrong by asking him to delete it and getting frustrated by his refusal?",18Aug2020,1
1033,"Hi, for context I am a 26 yo female. I have blonde hair and blue eyes, 5'5"" and overweight. (Hopefully that might give you more of an idea of how I am.) 
Throughout my life I have been having issues with people not taking me seriously/taking advantage of me whenever they can. 
For one example, I went to Las Vegas a few months ago, and there was a serious issue with our room. I went to the front lobby with my boyfriend and kindly asked to be changed rooms. The front desk looked me up and down and told me I'd need to be charged extra. My boyfriend, on the other hand, went up and kindly asked the same way I did, and they immediately listened to him and switched him rooms. He didn't change his tone any differently than I did.
Another example, I took my car into the car dealership for repairs. The mechanic guys, ""listened"" to what happened, kept my car for 5 days, and told me nothing was wrong with it to begin with and they didn't know what I was talking about. I went back into the dealership and showed them, again, in person what was wrong. Basically shoving it in their face to listen to me then they finally did. 

This happens to me constantly wherever I go. These may not be the best examples, but people don't take me seriously, and tend just shrug me off as things go in one ear and out the other. What am I doing wrong?  How do I change? How can I improve myself to appear worth listening to by others?

Is there a general rule of thumb for being taken seriously/appearing intimidating? Please help.",18Aug2020,1
1034,"I have a lump on my neck that my doctor was really worried about and said I’ll need to go get an ultra sound. They took my blood and said they need to verify something ... my blood test? I was confused but anyway they said they would call me back within a day. (I used to go the same day, but I am just guessing things are different because of COVID) 

I called them the next day and the lady was really rude and she said “like we told you, we will call you back once we verify things and let you know when you can go get your ultra sound, we’ll call you tomorrow”

Okay. Well that was 5 days ago. No call. I’m really sad and I think they basically just put me off and I don’t know if I should keep waiting or irritate them more by calling, or just forget them and go to another clinic out of town.

1035,"Hello friends, I am currently trying to not have a panic attack so please bare with me. 

My university is attempting in person courses/hybrid stuff. I’m in grad school so I have to go back. But my concern (beyond teaching and stuff) is dealing with my roommate. 

Since April, I’ve been living with my parents and I’m moving back to my apartment this weekend. I’m super worried about dealing with my roommate. When I had last talked with her, she was sorta over coronavirus stuff. So she was hanging out with friends and her boyfriend (who was going to work - idk if he’s still going or not) was staying over at least twice a week. 

This whole situation makes me super uncomfortable. I don’t want people over our place at all. I know I could ask her to wear masks with guests but I don’t trust her to do that if I’m not around. Or if she goes elsewhere that she’ll wear one. 

I’m freaking out and I don’t know how to deal with this. I wish I could move out because I just don’t know what to do and this is making my introvert self freak out beyond what I can handle. I’m lost please help",18Aug2020,1
1036,"
I’m from Ohio, friend is from Washington, we know each other through our parents who met in high school. Needless to say, we don't see each other a whole lot since we're so far away, but we go on vacation once or twice a year with our families. I've known her my whole life but I became friends with her a couple of years ago and we now text or talk every day. We have been in a mutual friend zone about as strongly as can be and although we are very good friends there has never been anything even close to going beyond that. Also, she is bi, and from what I can tell leans towards liking other girls more than guys.   


We were on a vacation in Montana, a pretty typical outdoorsy 5 day vacation for us. I'll call my friend E. The first three days were typical -- fun but not much to talk about. But for the last two nights we stayed in a hotel that gave us extra rooms because our reservation or something was messed up due to COVID. Anyways, I got my own room and E and her sister, L \[14\], got their own room. Since my room had two beds (well, sort of, a queen bed and a pullout couch that was basically a single bed), they wanted to have a sleepover type thing. This isn't unusual on its own, we're comfortable with each other and whatnot. 

The first night we all played various games and watched some TV for probably about an hour before L fell asleep, and because E and I weren't tired we went to sit on the couch bed. We read through old text conversations (between ourselves) on my phone and at one point she put her elbow on my shoulder like you would put your elbow on the window of a car to rest. This was definitely pretty unusual, as we aren't touchy people and the only physical contact we'd ever had was fake hitting each other or wrestling for something, like a phone. Anyways, at one point we got to some photos that she sent in messages and she tried to take my phone so we wouldn't look at them, but I pulled it away and basically ended up lying down on the bed trying to keep it away. Usually at this point she would just give up or maybe reach around to grab it, but she just laid on top of me with one hand on it and eventually gave up, but didn't move, and rested her head on my shoulder/chest for what was probably half an hour before it was super late and we both decided we should try to get some sleep. We slept for maybe an hour (in separate beds) before someone made a loud noise in the hallway and we both woke up, although her sister somehow slept through it. E came back and sat above the pillows and played with my hair for a while, which was also unusual. Then she said she was tired and crawled down into the bed and just laid next to me for the better part of an hour. Keep in mind that this is an extremely small bed and there was nothing comfortable about this from a needing to sleep perspective. Then her sister started to shuffle around and E jumped up quickly, and at that point we were all up and went about our day. No mention of anything at all, except for one point in the morning where E made some awkward compliments about my hair and eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

The next night was the same situation, except L fell asleep much faster and E came over to my bed again, and this time put her head on my shoulder pretty much right away. We were both very tired since we barely slept the night before, and she laid down again next to me and said she was tired and asked me to put my phone away, which I did. We laid down for a while until she said she was going to go sleep. She also patted the top of my head when she said this which was an interesting gesture and I still don't exactly understand that. Anyways, she sat up and then gave up on standing up and laid back down, and about 10 minutes later she did the exact same thing and eventually got up and went to sleep. Notably, every time her sister kind of shuffled or the door creaked or something, E sat or stood up, so she clearly didn't want other people seeing what was going on... 

&amp;#x200B;

It's been over 3 weeks since the trip, and while we've texted every day as usual since, there has been essentially no mention of these nights except for her saying that she misses the pullout couch bed because ""it was comfortable."" I really cannot stress enough how nothing like this has ever happened between us before, how even a year ago her accidentally brushing my leg made her say ""ew."" Also of note, I didn't really initiate any contact or anything. I went along with it because I didn't mind at all, but she did initiate basically everything. I really just don't know what to do now. The last thing I want to do is jeopardize a good friendship, but I am also curious about why she did what she did those two nights. 

TL;DR: Spent a couple of nights with close friend where she was unusually touchy and close, but there's been no mention about it since, idk why she did what she did or what I should do now.",18Aug2020,1
1037,"I've (F 23) noticed some intense change in my brother's (M 26) behaviour over the last 3 months. He has become increasingly withdrawn and barely speaks to me or our parents. He lives in a different city so I can't visit him as often as I would like. He does come home to visit approximately once or twice a month and for the most part everything was fine, but something changed and he's become extremely withdrawn. He's someone who already isn't much of a talker but when he last came home, he spoke maybe 6 words to our parents. He talked somewhat more comfortably with me but even then the conversation was short (probably lasted less than 2 mins). I'm really concerned his mental health is affected. When I ask him if he's okay or if he ever wants to talk about something I'm always here to listen but he simply brushes it off as ""I'm fine, don't worry"". He says ""don't worry"" a lot which literally does the exact opposite. He's so closed off no matter how many times I ask him if he's okay I always get the same answer. Anytime I call him he pretty much never answers, saying he's either busy with work or was sleeping. He seems lethargic a lot of the times I've spoken to him or seen him.I know he's not out and about doing anything shady because of the whole coronavirus situation but I'm really concerned about him and I don't know to talk to him about this without causing him to completely shut down and never speak of me or our parents.

I also don't have a lot of friends and I'm generally quite anxious and not too social irl, I tend to make serious situations into a joke and laugh them off, I am too afraid to open up to anyone irl, as I frankly do not trust anyone enough..

1043,"I love my mother, recently out of a divorce and living her best life but ive always been wary of the amount of guys she attracts gives attention to. 

Recently she was talking to a man who strangely had perfect Spanish which is very rare considering his background and at first we thought he was a full on catfish, however though his story seemed to line up more and more. He seems really desperate for someone to take care of his daughters and have his items kept safe though.

He was in the military, has two daughters, divorced, and is in Yemen. Seems pretty alright I didn't really care at first but he seems to have gotten my mothers address. 

He sent her a package from Yemen. A ""Trunk Box"" it says on the description. With no warning at all just sent her a tracking number and link. It was addressed to my mother, full name, phone number. However my mother says she hasn't told him her mothers maiden name which he happened to put into the name as well as her address that was never mentioned to him. He said he sent my mother some of his important documents so she could keep them safe. 

This sounds like a really weird almost scam to me (especially at first)? I'm getting very very weird vibes from it all and I will go through my mothers messages soon to look for more red flags onto what he could be trying to do but with how my father was with my mom I do not want this man near my mother and repeating what happened then.

1044,"So yeah, its her birthday , shes turning 25 or 26 (shit, i cant remember her exact age anymore than my own). I tried calling her yesterday and this morning, no answer then. So i called our mom and asked her to tell her happy birthday for me because she wasnt answering her phone (she lives with our parents).
 I assumed they were doing cake and dinner or something today and i wanted to make sure she at least heard from me.  But it turns out that no, they arent doing anything at all. It seems that no one has acknowledged it in any way,  worse yet, apparently dad spent all of yesterday and today drinking, complaining, and generally being a prick. This is not the first of her birthdays hes done this on. Hes a fucking mean drunk, especially on tequila, and he had a bad work day yesterday apparently.  And i know when dad was being a drunk asshole growing up,  my sister always just sorta sat quietly and stared at a wall waiting for silence until she just fell asleep, and then it'd be hard to wake her up again (i would just leave the house as a teen, but she never had anywhere to go). So i assume thats why she wasnt answering my calls before: either asleep, or staring at a wall.

  It would seem that nobody remembers what the date is today, and everyone is just up their own ass. She hasnt gotten a call or text from any of our extended family, or her friends either. Which is extra messed up because she is always the one to put lots of thought and planning into everyone elses day, and always sends our cousins' birthday cards for their bdays (the 17th and 19th, so no way should they be forgetting). Id have given her best friend a pass for forgetting, but i know her too, and even she managed to text my sister real quick a little bit ago, and shes at work helping with bone marrow procedures while pregnant. Idk what the hell my *familys* deal is today though.

I finally got to talk to my sister around 2pm. the call started as pretty normal ""happy birthday"" ""thanks, how are you"" etc. But then the pretending to be happy thing faded and she  started having what sounded like a panic attack, the floodgates opened... shes apparently convinced that shes too old to do anything with her life and shes never gonna be anyone who matters, shes going to die alone and penniless surrounded by worthless junk she spent hours of her life making, and that no one will remember that she ever even existed, that her dreams were dead before she even realized what they were, and so on. She said a LOT of stuff in under a minute... I knew she was depressed, i suspect she has other undiagnosed issues as well,  but all this is new to me. I had no idea she was like this, I've never heard of someone in their 20s having what i can only think to call a mid life crisis... And i have no idea what to say to any of it. I tried to to tell her shes still young and has plenty of time to figure things out. She quickly went back to how she is normally, but i know shes pretending now. I know she doesnt feel any better, i didnt convince her of anything... Shes just pretending to be fine to make *me* feel better,  because she didnt mean to let all that out in the first place. Has anyone else felt the way she does? What can i say or do?

 My first thought when someone is sad is to just buy them something i know they'd like, because im just not good at words, and listening and remembering things they want or like is how I've always shown that i care about them. But even if i had the money to do that right now, this issue is obviously bigger than that, so im kind of at a loss here.",18Aug2020,1

1046,"My best friend (let’s call her Alyssa) and I have been friends for the longest time. Alyssa is my best friend and I am hers. We are both hilarious, intelligent, and beautiful. Alyssa is what you would call traditionally beautiful, while I am not. And that’s where the inequality comes in. She sees no sex appeal in me. Essentially she doesn’t acknowledge that there are people out there that would/do find me attractive and show interest in me. I’m not sure if she doesn’t acknowledge it or she ignores it but it’s straining me and that’s an issue. She’s never said anything to me that would be straight up hurtful and insulting. There is just little statements and things she does that are so clear to me. Here’s some examples:
-If we are together and someone is checking us out, Alyssa sees it as they were checking her out
-I was mentioning something about how I think body counts are stupid and pointless and how I refuse to have my body count define me and Alyssa said “well yours is 1 so it doesn’t even matter” as if it is going to stay 1 and because her’s is 3 so my one body was irrelevant 
-every mildly attractive person is a potential candidate to be HER significant other
And more. I love her to death and her me. But she puts herself on a pedestal and views me less than in these types of situations. And it’s these tiny things that just dig deeper and deeper under my skin. I’m not being insecure because I know my worth. I’m not jealous of Alyssa because she’s my best friend and I know what goes on in her romantic life and I’d rather not deal with half the things she deals with. Overall this is so hard to describe without bashing Alyssa because that’s not the point nor the objective. I view us as equals in this sense because we are literally clueless. 
In all honesty maybe I’m pushing this all to her because literally almost no one in my life views me as a sexual being. My family had no idea that I even could be until I told them in December 2019 that I was molested the prior year. I view Alyssa and I as equals but not my sister and I. I really don’t care about my family acknowledging that people find me attractive but with my best friend I do. I just don’t know how to get her to view me as her equal.

1047,"I'm gonna be a high school senior in a few weeks. About 8 months ago, I was checking out my crush's Insta in school when some dick quietly took a photo of me behind my back. It was an awfully timed pic, with my eyes closed and mouth open. It wounded up spreading (he sent it to someone, he sent it to some ppl, those ppl sent it to someone else, etc), and people laughed at it before forgetting about it. I'm guessing the girl herself also saw it, as she blocked me on all social media sites.

For some odd reason, I saw it as nothing but an embarrassing, cringe moment to shrug off. I was dealing with major stressors like my parents yelling at me about my grades, despite me trying my best, and feelinjg like a loser because of allof my peers' successful lives, and how I just don't quite measure up. Feeling like shit, I searched up suicide, feeling like a loser, and feeling like a failure. That same kid who took the first pic took pics of me searching that stuff up too. He showed them to his close friends, and they all brought it up to guidance. Thx to them I'm in therapy.

 But around March, when the virus came and shut everything down, I spent more time being idle and dwelling on it. As well as dwelling on my past in general. I broke it down to the bone, and realized that someone else had contributed to my embarrassment. Sure, maybe I shouldn't have been laking in public, but that doesn't mean someone could just take a pic of me.

And so I asked roughly 10-15 kids online about it, and they all said it was a joke that no one really cared about in the first place. 

Next I sent an apology letter to the girl through a mutual friend, apologizing what had happened and hoping that we could at the very least be on neutral terms again. She replied back with a ""tell him to text"" and then a phone number to my friend. My friend sent me it, and I tried texting the number and then calling it, just to realize that it was actually a number for a mental health agency. It was a bummer that happened, because I was hoping we could have a chat about what happened. However, I was long over her when that happened, so that part of the situations isn't what bothers me.

I then confronted the photographer directly, and we had a long conversation about why what he did wasn't right. He claimed that his intention was to simply see something funny, and not to cause conflicts. I brought up how even the girl herself saw that, and he said he knew and that he didn't want her to see that. He said that it didn't even spread far. When I brought up how much time I spent over quarantine dwelling over this, he said that he felt really bad, and didn't mean to cause that, and said he wasn't thinking about hurting me, embarrassing me, as well as me and my future thoughts on this. He said sorry, and we came to a closure.

However, I still feel like a victim in life, and I always feel that only some people become victims and others don't even become victims in life, and I felt angry that he would go off and make me a victim like that. And so about a week later I confronted him again, and again I forcefully ripped out an apology from him. I confronted him about 7-8 times about this. I also asked about the other pics, and he said that those ones didn't spread and weren't really funny, and those he just showed to guidance.

I've talked it out with my psychologist about this, and he is saying that I'm overthinking the embarrassment and I need a routine, future goals, and stuff to do that way I can keep myself busy and occupied.

I regret that I didn't confront the kid about it in the moment it happened. For some reason, back then I never saw it as a situation where someone else had done something to me, but rather I embarrassed myself by getting caught laking in school. It was only when I had time to really sit and think and break things down that I realized that someone else had a contribution. Thoughts?",18Aug2020,1

1053,"So some background,

The summer of my 18th year of life was the most difficult time I’ve ever been through. I have epilepsy and depression, and right before summer started, I began a new treatment for my relentless seizures. My psychiatrist also took me off of my depression meds, as I’d been doing well mood-wise. A couple weeks into the treatment, I changed dramatically. While my seizures stopped, the side effects were unbearable. I had a great difficulty speaking coherently and having a normal train of thought. I was exhausted all the time, had no appetite, and often forgot where I was. I basically turned into a zombie. Along with this, my depression came back, and I lost all drive for everything I enjoyed in life. My dog died and my aunt died in the span of a month. Basically, I was a mess, and it all culminated into a suicide attempt towards the end of the summer. 

At the time I also had a long distance boyfriend. I honestly don’t know why, but that summer, I started talking to someone else online. I don’t remember their name. I don’t remember where I met them. I honestly don’t even remember what we talked about. Most of that summer, I don’t even remember, and I don’t know why. The only vague memories I have of that person is him saying “I love you” and him also showing me his genitals. I remember feeling so fazed and out of it, that I just didn’t think before saying “I love you too” back to him. I don’t know why I did. I didn’t love him, and I didn’t even feel anything talking to him. 

It wasn’t long before I stopped talking to them altogether. This coincided with the suicide attempt. After that, I went back on antidepressants and switched epilepsy treatments. Let me tell you, after that, I did a complete 180. I could think, speak, and remember clearly again. I wasn’t depressed anymore and I was slowly working through grieving my aunt and dog in a healthy way. I was still traumatized from everything and was still in a lot of pain, but I started dealing with it in healthy ways. 

I realized, though, that I had cheated. Even though we never met in person or anything, I’d cheated on my boyfriend with that stranger from the internet. I told my boyfriend this, and he forgave me. A few months later we broke up on unrelated terms. Yet, I still can’t seem to forgive myself for what I did. It was despicable. Cheaters are disgusting. And while I know I’m nowhere near the person I was that summer, I still hold on to the guilt and shame of what I did. I’m terrified to tell anyone, even my current boyfriend, for fear of their judgement. I hated who I was that summer. I was weak and in pain and disgusting. I hate myself for who I was, and even though it’s been 5 years, I cannot get over it, or my fear of telling people.

1054,"Hey! So i have a younger sister by 3 years. We are very close with each other and my parent practically treated us like twins. For 4 years now I have been wanting to get a belly button piercing and I finally did a couple of days ago. It was always something that I really wanted - me and my sister always joked around how im a piercing type of a person and she is tattoo type. Now, I hear that she would want one as well in the future. Hearing upon that, my dad has been trying to convince her to get it right away. 
I dont know why it just irks me so much. Like for some reason I dont want her to have it - yes, I do realize how stupid that sounds- its just a piercing. But I just think its because we were treated like twins and had everything together that made me want something just for myself. 
What should I do? I know its very selfish of me but I just cant help with that feeling. Whenever they’re talking about her getting it, I am just getting very annoyed at that. Like I cant even enjoy finally getting it! I dont know what to do. I dont want to feel like this and be this type of a person:(",18Aug2020,1

Today, they were re-organized and the groups ripped apart.  Hundreds of texts today. I’ve offered support and advice and mentorship where I can. Not all of them will thrive. Some will be cast aside. 

I was just hammered with the reality  - they are all employed as I continue to struggle to find employment. I am the person they still go to, and yet I don’t want to burden them or my wife wife with the weight that threatens to crush me into the ground. I feel like I stand tall despite the pressure that drives me into the ground.

1058,"As the title states today is the first anniversary of my mom's death. In an attempt to make a long story short; the main issue is I have not mourned for my mom aside from a few tears at the funeral. I have not broken down. I miss her. I loved her. I knew she loved me. She is better off. 

For every reason  I could give wishing to have her back I could give another valid reason it's best she let go when she did. (ex. COVID) But I'm slightly worried, not that there is something wrong with me. I'm worried at some point it's all going to hit me in some random time and place and I'm just going to lose my sh$#. I cried my eyes out when my dad passed away. But I was just 19, his death was somewhat unexpected. But I DO tend to internalize things. I'm not a people person, easy to meet difficult to know. Part of me feels some guilt for not crying as much for my mom as I did my dad, like it was a contest. 

But the majority of me is wary because I haven't lost my sh$#...yet. Life has been hell the last year, and everyone is on edge. Combining the stress most of humanity is facing right now coupled with my loss, I should be a basket case. I don't know, I feel numb inside. Should I try to force myself to mourn in the near future? Should I take an ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" attitude and just ignoring a major life event? I'm not even sure what I should be feeling.

I decided to change it at that same University, and changed it to Accounting, not wanting to waste the Gen Ed credits I obtained, and I spent my second year on that path. The University I was attending was pretty expensive, so I decided to apply to a University that is closer to my parents to stay with them. When I met with my advisor for that school, I realized that when I transferred, I had lost most of the credits I earned while at the first University, since the University I attend now have specific requirements for Gen Ed classes.

1066,"Posting this on a fresh account.

20 year old college student. I apologize for this being long but this a matter I keep debating myself over.


Ever since I graduated highschool a little over two years ago, I have been thinking about having a conversation with my friend (19, also a college student) about the things he has said and done that have either made me feel frustrated, aggravated, condescended or all the above. 

Just to give examples.

There have been countless situations where he said something to me that made me feel stupid. Times where he plainly called me a dumbass for something I said, despite what I said or did was a small slip up. Times where he would feel authorative and tell me what to do. Times where we would be debating something and it feels like he is just ignoring me and pushing his own opinion and grasping at straws. 

He would always be so quick to give me advice and tell me what to do (Which I'm grateful for, don't get me wrong), yet whenever I offer him advice, he doesn't listen at all. We would be having a conversation about something, I would ask him what were his thoughts while giving my interpretation. He would then immediately tell me, ""That's not what happened"", and go on a long tangent giving his thoughts while blatantly undermining mine.

Our relationship feels so one sided at times.

I always did my best to just move on from these moments. Having played football in high school and being told I needed to grow thick skin, I thought I could just leave those moments in the past. But I can't. It feels like everyday, these moments come back to my head and make me feel terrible and question my own sensitivity/intelligence.

It eats away at me and makes me feel like shit.

It's because of that, I have thought about confronting him about everything. Of course, the conversation doesn't just have to be about him. I'm not a perfect human being and have said and done things that have upset him as well. So I figured we could have a discussion about each other and come to a compromise about how to talk to each other moving forward. Improve our communication skills and be more aware of each other's feelings. 

However, I'm afraid of how the conversation will go. I'm afraid that he will deflect everything I say. Justify his actions. Brush off any sort of responsibility. And tell me to just deal with it.

Do I confront him? If so, how?",18Aug2020,1

1072,"Hey all,

I (23M) graduated last year from my university and have been working consistently at a somewhat decent job not at all related to my prospective career... I wanted to move to another state much further away from where I live which has jobs that are more in line with my degree and had been saving up this entire year for that move. 

I believe I’m at a pretty good amount saved up and figured I would leave at the end of this summer despite all the changes due to corona.. however I have not landed a job yet. This means I also don’t have health insurance as my parents’ won’t extend that far out as it’s more local, and due to corona I don’t think it’s safe so I figured I would postpone my move.

The truth is I’m getting really upset and depressed at home: I’ve been here my whole life, can’t be myself with my family (living at home/am gay and they’re religious), most of my friends have left and I really don’t like my job. I’ve been considering leaving regardless and risking it because I’m thinking my chances to land a job will go up if I’m closer to where I want to live or can even land an “in-between job” just to be making money... but i’m not sure it’s smart to go now. I know everyone’s plans and have been postponed but I still have somewhat of an open opportunity, I just don’t want to find myself dealing with unexpected consequences and want to know if I’m being rash.. any advice? 

TLDR: I want to move further away but I’m scared cause I won’t have health insurance/a job  and this corona stuff is happening... although I have some savings that could last me a couple months. Should I do it or be more careful?",18Aug2020,1
1073,"English is not my native tongue

I (22F) have been with my boyfriend for 4 years now. I have my own apartment since the age of 17 years old and I’m fairly independent since that time. 

I am a neurotic full-time medical sciences student. I volunteer at the hospital, have two jobs and I have a very goal-oriented mindset. 
My boyfriend, on the other side, is calm, passive, and would rather play video games than invest on his future. 

He lives with his parents a couple of hours away from my city. We still see each other every week or every other week. 

So as the title mentions, he has NO intentions to move from his parents house. His choice of staying there at 30 has NOTHING to do with his beliefs, religion, parents health or financial reasons. His sister has been living in Japan for over 5 years now. So it’s nothing about that. 

He stays there because he is _comfortable_ there. He expects me to move in with him WITH HIS PARENTS in the house. 

This has become a huge issue because I’m very independent and no??? I don’t want to move in with his parents??? 

Also, I started feeling VERY uneasy because he is 30 years old and his mom still does his laundry, prepares his lunchbox in the morning. He does not know how to cook (not even a grilled-cheese) either. I tried to teach him since over 2 years, but it is pointless since he does not understand why he should learn this. After all, his mom cooks for him everyday. 

Communication is key so I’ve obviously talked about this issue with him, but he just brushed it off saying it is easier for him to live with his parents. Note that he has no plans to buy a house in the next 5 years. It’s NOT as if he was “saving” for something....

I feel like I’m the evil woman trying to push him away from his family when really I just find it weird for a 30 years old to still live with his parents and not know how to cook or do his own laundry since I do all of those by myself since many years now. He is very serious about being committed with me and even gave me an engagement ring. 

Unfortunately, I am thinking of breaking up soon because I cannot handle this anymore and he does not understand my needs. 

Am I wrong for thinking that 30 years old is a little bit old to still live with the parents if there is no valid reason? 

Anyone in a similar situation?

I care about her tho, i like being around her because she makes me feel like i belong on this world. i am too scared to contact her because of what i said and am afraid she is going to delete me from her life. and even tho i am still mad and upset i don't want things to end between us.",18Aug2020,1
1078,"There is something very messed up about me that has been a problem for a good few years now that I am gradually working towards talking about in therapy but, as weird as it sounds, I otherwise consider myself to be a pretty nice person. Flawed sure, but I try to be sincere and make sure when I do a good thing I'm not just doing it to feel like a good person (if that makes sense). So I'd say I have three friend groups, plus some individual friends as well as one group I have very recently cut off. The thing is, there are only two people in my life I feel a connection to, one of which was in the cut off group and one who is in one of the other two groups. Everyone else I feel like I don't give a fuck about. Like, I know my mum is a good person and I appreciate the things she does for me and I think I do love her but there's always this weird disconnect. Like, I try not to be mean to her but I seem to like only get an emotional reaction when she does things that piss me off. Same with a lot of my other friends. Another of my groups includes a friend of 20 years who I've always called my best friend who I just feel nothing for sometimes. Again, I try to like... pay people back for being good to me by being good to them; listening to their problems, getting them presents they like, that kind of thing. But it's like I don't care. I've always had this weird thing of enjoying giving advice because it makes me feel useful in the friendship and I feel closer to people when we have serious conversations whether it's about them or me, but now I'm starting to feel like that gratification of feeling good at giving advice and being considered a friend is all that's there. There's no real warmth. I think the messed up thing may be part of it, but then several people in my life know about it and some of them I still feel that disconnect with. It's slowly been happening over the last few years on and off but I'd say the last year is where it's been at it's worst. I've taken anti depressants before and I think I've went through depressed periods in the past but this somehow feels like... worse?

1079,"So I have a huge crush on my history teacher, she’s just so beautiful and smart, and I’m hormonal. However this teacher has became someone I can confide in, like a therapist of sorts. After school we talk sometimes and she tries to help me with some of my at home (as well as in school) problems, and we have a sort of mentor/apprentice relationship. At this point, I’m not sure if she knows but I don’t think so. I of course will not attempt to tell her or try to pursue a romantic relationship because that is illegal and unprofessional. I am nervous that she may know I have a crush on her due to the following
-I confide in her
-when we talk one on one I break eye contact a lot (which I’ve heard can show you have a crush? I just am socially awkward tbh)
-I seek validation without realizing at the time
-during winter holidays and end of the year I give her a small appropriate gift like cookies (as I do with all my teachers)

I've talked to only a couple of people so far but it hasn't really gone anywhere and I don't have a roommate because of covid, which doesn't help. They've also canceled most of the freshman ""meet other people"" type of events due to covid.

1084,"backstory: i started seeing this guy in april and we lasted until june. things were going really great. he constantly wanted to hang out, told me he missed me when we hadn't seen each other for a few days, told me how cute his friends said we were, told me how cute one of his brothers thought we were, constantly made ""we"" and ""us"" statements, wanted to meet my family and wanted me to meet his.

things ended because one night, i asked him what we were. he ended things a week later with ""i don't think we would work"". i had a feeling after things ended that there was something more going on and it didn't completely have to do with me asking what we are. we didn't talked for a month or so until a few days ago when i texted him asking if he wanted to smoke and hang out and watch a movie (his favorite movie too). he said yes and told me he missed me and was glad that i texted him. we talked and he opened up and explained to me that we was in a funk already because around the time i had asked that question was going to be 2 years since his ex broke up with him and he was just going through a rough time. 

we talked, he realized that he didn't comminucate these things well to me (he basically ghosted me until i confronted him over snapchat to which things ended) and he asked if i was interested in starting things again. i told him yes, but that we should hold off on having sex again until he figures out what he wants. he was honest and told me that he still doesn't know what he wants.
 
we made out &amp; watched a movie. we ended up having sex that night too. after he left, he texted me ""hey I’m going to be thinking a few things over, i’ll text ya in a bit about when we should hang next:). on my way home rn"". i texted him the next day asking if he still wanted to go hiking after i got off of work (we had talked about it, but nothing set in stone obviously) and he responded ""nah, i'm def not feeling that today"" i asked if he was okay and he responded ""yea I’m fine, kinda like I said i need some thinking time and I’ll get back to you"" and we just kinda left it at that.

i'm gonna give him time and space of course, but i'm still am gonna continue to live my life while he does that. i'm glad he's at least communicating that he needs time instead of just ghosting next like last time.

Anyway, I made my therapist a gift. I’ve only been seeing her for about 2 months, but I literally searched for over a decade to find a therapist I finally clicked with. I’m so grateful to have found her and she’s already expressed that she’s in this journey with me, for as long as it takes, to help support me to my goals.  

My question is, is it acceptable to give her this gift, to show my appreciation? Or would it be weird or cause problems? Is she even allowed to accept it? It’s homemade; I didn’t spend a ton of money on it (just supplies to make it) but I spent hours and hours making it. 

Thoughts please? TIA!",18Aug2020,1
1089,"Hello everyone, this is going to be a long one so thanks for the patience in advance. 

Living in a 3 bedroom house, 3 occupants renting by room. Housemate number 3 left in November and housemate number 2 didn't want to backfill the room due to anxiety. I advised her that we could do a few months but will need to refill the space after that. 

I approached the topic in February, same response. Then lockdown happened. We have been paying rent 50/50 on the house up to this point. Housemate begins using bedroom number 3 as a WFH office and even began calling it her office. I pushed the subject of a third housemate a few times until finally, this week, I advised her she needed to pay more to occupy two rooms as it was costing me money, including during a period in which I was temporarily laid off. 

This weekend her boyfriend was here. This guy has this complex where he needs to get even about things or needs to be scheming. Our neighbour is in politics and housemates boyfriend tried to politically assassinate him in social media for having a late party during lockdown. Having the party is wrong but knocking on a door is a better first port of call in my opinion. Plus he has no involvement with the house beyond being a guest so this wasn't his place to do. 

I could tell he was peeved with me this weekend, likely due to the rent situation. Saturday evening I found pubic hair in my toothbrush. It was well in the bristles, like it had been rubbed in there. I must note I also store my toothbrush on a light fitting that's about 6.5-7 foot high. When confronted (matched his colouring) housemate said it must have come off his head. Housemates boyfriend said he didn't do it but that I had no proof so that was it. He admitted that he was annoyed regarding the rent situation but denied getting involved saying house issues were between me and housemate (his track record shows otherwise). When I had left the room after the confrontation be shouted ""see you later"". Not exactly what would be expected from someone who was innocent in my opinion. 

Wondering what you guys think I should do with this situation. I have no idea how I didn't lose my temper to be honest. Housemate hasn't been here for a few days but was hysterical, saying I was making things up. Any help is appreciated. My name is the only one on the lease we have both lived here for nearly 5 years.

TL:DR: Found pubic hair on my toothbrush matching my housemates boyfriends colouring. This comes days after I increased housemates rent due to her unwillingness to fill the third room, and her use of the same room.",18Aug2020,1
1090,"I have known about this since I was about 11. I have been ashamed of it for a while and unsure what caused it. I tend to get aroused at the sight of overweight or obese women, and have been since puberty started for me. Not women who are morbidly obese, just larger women. My girlfriend of 2 months (16F) is a bit chubby herself, and a little insecure about it, especially when I am kinda skinny.

1096,"Sorry, this is a long one:

So, my gf (25) and I (26) broke up near the end of June after dating long-distance (across the USA) for a year and then, due to the pandemic, living together for a few months. We had our arguments, but overall our relationship wasn't toxic, and we both really enjoyed our time together.

However, one topic that has always divided us was my career. I'm switching career paths from something I've dreamed of doing since I was nine to something completely different (I still plan on keeping the old career as a hobby). Anyway, the reason why we broke up essentially came down to her wanting to me to pick a path, but me wanting to keep the option of going back to my old career in case I hate my new career). It was NOT due to us not liking our relationship. I feel like we could've overcome this.

Anyway, what's frustrating is she wants to stay friends. I do too, but to her, this means contacting me once a week or more, as if nothing ever happened between us. She also, when we broke up, mentioned that she didn't want to let go of the possibility of us getting back together (if I figured out my career stuff, which might take a few years to know for certain what my path is). Today, though, she just told me that is starting to date someone new, and if we saw each other in person, we would ONLY be friends.

I don't know what to do. I want to stay friends with her (she's an amazing human being, and we connect on a really deep level), but I don't want to have a feeling that if I stick around long enough, we can reconcile. Should I stop being friends with her and move on? Should I suck it up and be happy to stay friends with her (but come to the fact that's all we'll be)?",18Aug2020,1
1097,"My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 9 years. I’m 24 and he’s 25. We’ve had our ups and downs ofcourse but he truly is my best friend. He’s always there for me, is literally the sweetest person ever and treats me with respect, even when we argue. But since I’ve come across his porn habits, things have been a little strange. 

It all started 2 months ago when I accidentally came across his porn. I saw that he had been buying scat porn. We were on a break at the time that he purchased these videos and interacted with this only fans woman so I brushed it off, but was still a bit grossed out. He was extremely embarrassed that I saw his porn and promised to never watch it again, which we all know was utter bullshit. But whatever, we got back together around that time. At first I didn’t want anything to do with him but I thought about it and decided that it wasn’t my business what he looked into on his own time and as long as he wasn’t forcing it onto me it was alright. 

Weeks later, I came across loli porn. For those who don’t know, loli porn is basically the portrayal of small young looking women engaging in sexual acts. The loli porn that I saw was a comic like story that portrayed girls as young as six years old having sex with father figures. I was disturbed by this even more and this is where I drew the line. I told him that he needed to see a therapist. (Before you guys judge me for telling him to see a therapist, I have to tell you that he suffers from ADHD. Porn addiction is pretty common in ADHD and not only did I suspect he was addicted to porn, but he hasn’t been treating his ADHD for YEARSSS. it’s so bad that he loses job after job and can’t even focus enough on submitting his own applications, I usually have to help or even do them for him, but back to the story)

He agreed to see a therapist and this was over a month ago. He still hasn’t seen anyone. Just recently, like today, I found more disturbing porn. This time it was more scat, but this time it was people eating their shit, having messy scat sex, girls vomiting in vases or sucking cock and vomiting all over themselves in the act. I’m becoming extremely worried for him, and our relationship. Maybe I just don’t understand men and their porn habits and should just turn a blind eye whenever it comes up but it truly bothers me. I tried to be understanding of his porn but it worries me. I’m worried that I’m wasting my youth with someone who will have an even worse porn addiction once we live together and have kids, causing further problems once we’re married. 

I recently told him that his porn is his business and that as long as it doesn’t interfere with our relationship then it’s fine. But this was before I saw all that other disgusting shit he was looking at.

I really love him...I really do...but I really don’t know how to handle this anymore. I don’t know if I should ignore it because this issue could potentially affect our future together. Or can it? Am I just over thinking it? I don’t wanna have to worry that my bf won’t be able to get hard because I’m not shitting or vomiting on him. I don’t want us to have children and have our child come across his disgusting porn accidentally like I have. Are these porn fetishes something that’s common? Am I just a bit too conservative? 

As I mentioned before, he’s a great guy. My little brother loves and looks up to him, and my mom loves him too. He’s even cut off people in his life that have caused issues for us, no matter how important they were to him our relationship always came first. Is this just simply a guy watching porn and he’s EXTREMELY freaky? Or should I be concerned? What should I do guys? Please help me....",18Aug2020,1

1099,"My nextdoor neighbor has a large amount of property. On that property he has geese, chickens and two big friendly dogs that are all allowed to roam free on the fenced in property. Last night I was awoken to panicked screeching by one of the geese. I looked out my window to see the two dogs playing with it. Each dog had a wing in its mouth and were pulling it apart. This went on for 20 minutes and then I did not hear any more screeching, so I assume the bird passed away. The whole thing was pretty traumatic to witness. Should I approach my neighbors and tell them what I saw? I am not close with them but will wave hello if I see them looking in my direction. Overall they're nice folks and I want to be able to tell them to lock up either the birds or the dogs because the dogs are capable of killing the other animals.

1101,"So for some background, I'm high risk for covid because of an autoimmune disorder. My mom doesnt take it seriously and I'm nervous about living with her during this time. So I decided that I wanted to move out so that I dont have to keep being stressed about it (which has started to take a toll on my health).

I started asking around for a place to rent. My boyfriend's dad calls him (my boyfriend) 2 days later and says that a lady from our church has a mother-in-law avaliable and that I should call her right away so that I dont get my spot taken. Called her and it sounded perfect, something I could afford by myself and move into quickly. I felt so lucky that something opened up right when I needed it and I would feel safe being there. 

Next day my boyfriend's mom texts me and says that they will be taking the aparment because ""their needs were greater than mine"" and they ""wouldnt be able to find anything else"". Even though they have a double income plus a side business (I make about the same as just his dad). So I'll have to now live in something more expensive, making less money and have to keep looking even though I'm more in a rush to move out. They also did this all behind my back and just decided I had no say and they were taking it (not to mention the text was just rude and insensitive).

1103,"My brother was recently accepted into Pratt Institute in NYC from the waitlist about a week ago. The thing is our parents live in Mexico and make less than $18k a year. We all got really excited when he received his financial aid awards because it seemed that he was going to be able to cover everything with grants and loans. However today, less than a week before classes start, he received an email saying he wasn’t elegible to receive his Federal Direct PLUS loan award because our parents don’t have a SSN. This loan of $29k per year accounted for a big chunk of the cost of attendance, as tuition is about $56k, room and board $5k (plus $3k meal plan). The loss of this loan means he has to pursue private loans. However after making the math for his 5 years, the loan interests end up being too much, almost doubling his debt. On top of this, he had just sent a letter to cancel his registration from his safe school in Texas, where everything was covered and he wouldn’t even have to use loans. 

My question is, should he make an effort to get private loans in the next few days (he’s gotta pay $9k before classes start) and possibly go into a huge debt? He seemed very unhappy and depressed these past few weeks when he thought he was going to have to stay in his hometown for college, in a major he didn’t like. We had never seen him this happy, and it got taken away in a heartbeat. What would be your advice on approaching this situation?

I live in a house with 5 other people, and our new roommate has a 4 month old puppy brought onto the lease. I was a bit skeptical and originally did NOT want to live with 5 girls and a dog (not a big dog person, I’ve got a very lazy cat). Well...as luck has it, we’re on day 2 and the whole house (including myself) love this dog. Heres the issues:
-The dog is 4 months old and is going to be an enormous herding breed. Think 100lbs+. He is limited to the downstairs since he’s not potty trained
-She locks him in a crate 12-15 hours a day. I don’t raise dogs and I don’t want to be a dick, but even my other roommates are on edge
-She doesn’t take him out long, so he’s full of energy coming into the house and gets destructive. W/e, he’s a puppy
-She often leaves him without water. We’ve had to refill it four times today because she just forgets.
-He has fleas that she didn’t tell us about. I’m out $40 to get treatment for my cat. Also has ringworm
-Doesn’t have shots
-She smacks him for stupid shit. Like jumping on the couch or humping his toy (he’s a puppy, he doesn’t get it?)
-Wants to neuter at 5 months; he’s gonna be a huge dog who will possibly have growth issues already due to crating. 

We have tried to talk to her about how she wants us to be around the dog but she’s almost flippant; its nearly neglectful.
