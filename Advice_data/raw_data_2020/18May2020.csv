1,"A few years ago my brother got a dog after complaining that he wanted one for a very long time. When asked, I said I didn't want the dog cause I am allergic to dogs, but my mother caved in and bought him one. He took care of him, as in he fed him. I didn't help because I cannot get near him without getting itchy and having respiratory problems. Years pass and my brother and I leave for university, and eventually he graduates. I had assume he would take the dog when he left, but no, he left him with my dad. Present day and I go outside to fix the backyard fence when I see the doggo. He is a little chubby and you can see that he is getting older. What caught my attention is that it looks like he has not been bathed since I left for university, his teeth look like they need cleaning, and his nails are so long that his paws kinda spread out and look painful to walk on. It kinda hit me that this doggo has been left alone even if he lives with us. So I decided that the least i can do is make the rest of his life comfortable. Here's the problem, I don't know were to start. Any advice?",18May2020,1

5,So I just read that plucking nose hairs is bad and I had plucked a few long ones out of my nose before I read up on it so I probably plucked about 10-15 hairs in each nostril and I was wondering if I’d be okay or if it’s going to effect me.,18May2020,1
6,"So every 2-3 weeks, I try to stay asleep for one whole night to reset my sleeping patterns but never seem to be able to do it. However for me, its quite difficult. All I have is my phone. My PC and XB are in another room, my ipad gets taken and I cant leave my room. Currently it is 1am. I need to be awake, in bed till 7am before I can get up and it not be suspicious. What is the best way to do this with only a phone, without scaring myself so much that I dont sleep for the whole 2-3 weeks. Thanks.",18May2020,1
7,"Hi, I am a final year university student and my assignment is due three days. I realised that I am not able to finish it by time and I told my friend/housemate that I would most probably fail and have to retake for a year. My friend is a 1st class student and he kept encouraging me to do my best and not give up. The problem is it is utterly impossible for me to finish my work on time even if I didn't sleep for three days straight. He told me things like not to give up yet and if I fail my parents would be disappointed in me because they funded me for my tuition fees. I talked to my dad about it and he seems fine. I have mental health complications and he thinks they are excuses for me being lazy. He really loves me, cares about me and sees the best in me but now he is totally disappointed in me and won't talk to me. I believe in second chances and I am not afraid of failure. But I can't deal with his look of disappointment in me. We used to talk about how we will graduate together, but now it is close to impossible. 

What should I do? Am I supposed to say anything? I don't want to lose my best friend.",18May2020,1
8,"Without putting too much info because it will just drive up my rage even more, we are 2-3 days away from the deadline of our project and we're about 5% done. As far as we decided the roles, I was on documentation (Im always the fucking secretary for some reason). The report is due on Wednesday and the defence is on Thursday. I have exams on both mornings, as I've told my team. One member is doing okay, although he's a bit lost. He's a good programmer though and I'm confident in his skills. The other one has gone MIA despite reading our texts. We've tried calling him, going to his room, texting his friends, nothing. The other guy reached him once to confirm a meeting and he said yes but then didnt show up.

It's not my job nor role to do the development, in fact I'm not supposed to be on campus doing it, but I have to step in at this point. And on top of that, I would still need to do the report and all of the documentation. Of a full, integrated system. In two days max. With 2 exams this week. I threw out my own senior project for which i have the defence next week so i could focus on this one and sacrificed my study time for the exams.

I'm so sick of being my team's punching bag because its aways been like this. I've always had to do the proposal, the design, the reports, etc. And when people ditch the project, Im the one who has to salvage it to save my own ass -- and yet they still get a grade anyway even when I've told and shown my advisors AND my dean that I was doing all the work. I've been doing this since my freshman year and its taken a toll on me. I told myself last semester that i was done babysitting my teammates who have all been older/my seniors, and yet it's happening again.

It's always, ""Oh we have a group project or assignment? Beedott will take care of it! She has to!"" And I do have to, for my own grade.

I'm this close to blowing my top and unleashing 3.5 years worth of kept-in shit about groupwork in our project defence. Honestly, if I see the deadweight today at our project meeting, I might just chuck a computer at him or kick him out. Likely not, because I'm not good at confrontation, but last week I finally did yell at a guy for not doing his bit at our class and trying to mooch off of me during our final. It only took me 4 semesters of holding it in.

It doesn't help that I'm barely 9 weeks sober at this point. I might actually break sobriety from the stress.

Idk. What do I do?",18May2020,1
9,"Hey first of all.. I'm 21 male and bisexuall.

So okay uhm I just fell in love with my best friend who is straight. 
I told him so and we said that it's okay and.. that nothing will change.
But somehow he's looking for distance now.
Back in the days we met like everyday, and played videogames while relaxin on our Discordserver.
But now he always says he has no time, ignores me, or tells me that I'm just looking for his attention.

I don't want to lose him, hes my best friend after all.
We went from meeting everyday, to seein/hearing each other twice a month.
He's also getting his first girlfriend now.. and tbh I kinda feel jealous.
But it's okay for me, I mean I can't change it.
And I want him to be happy.
But I also don't want to lose him.
I'm getting really depressed, smokin weed and lie in bed all the time.

I need help. How can I manage to fix all that?
I just want it to be the way it was, as I didnt tell him that I was into him..
I want my best friend back.. I only have him as my friend.
Since I don't have any other..

He also told me that it's alright for him that I am bisexuall. 
So.. what should I do? :(",18May2020,1
10,"I really need help on this and I’m growing more anxious about it by the day. 

My dad (60yo) moved out of state to Calfornia a few years ago with the intention to find his dream home, while most of our extended remained back home or scattered across nearby states. He recently found out that a family friend of ours has a terminal illness and only has a few more weeks to live. He plans on coming back to my home state regardless of COVID-19 (which he never really thought was a big deal in the first place, go figure) and he’s already talking about how he refuses to wear a mask and still wants to visit me, especially since this is the first time he’ll be back home for five years. I tried to talk him out of it, but no dice. I know he loves his family and will be there to say goodbye no matter the risk. That’s his choice.

 I miss him terribly and I want to see him, but I’m afraid he might pick up the virus at the airport or at some point on his way here. He’s stubborn as a mule and thus far has written off common practices like social distancing and face covering. His body is his choice, I suppose, but I don’t want to run the risk of getting sick myself or passing a sickness to friends and family. Is there a way for me to see him while I protect myself? How do I handle this if I agree to meet him and he still throws a fit about health guidelines?",18May2020,1
11,"So I just finished technical school a year ago, graduated in may, moved out in june, started a new job with contract for 5 years worth of work in july, and got married in August. Well it's been a year now, a fantastic year. We are so happy. Were moving into a rental house my friend gutted and restored. Were paying off debt, we kept our jobs through this covid stuff, were both getting raises in june and were gonna save a ton of money per month at this rental house compared to this overpriced apartment. But I've gotta decision to make in about a year to two years. So I live in illinois near St. Louis but work at a plant in Missouri. I am a machinist. In illinois, there are tons of shops, but they dont pay well and any overtime you do here they tax the crap out of it to the point it's not worth working the overtime. They jobs herr in illinois also dont pay as well because the big aerospace stuff happens in St. Louis. The jobs over there are much better for what I do. The problem is i am tired of driving hours a day to work and back home. I know I signed up for it, the job I was offered was too good to pass up. So it would make sense to move there right? But I'm struggling to leave where we are at because we have no friends over there, no family over there, we dont know the area. We love it here. We have shopping and restaurants close but we can also dissappear into the back countries and enjoy the peace and quiet. We have so much family here so we are finding it hard to leave. So I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. Go where the career field is rich and prosperous, or stay here where we know the area, love it amd have our family and friends. Hard decision especially since this is my birthplace. Were not sure what to do.",18May2020,1
12,"Hello.  I’m 30 years old and have my own apartment.  It’s not a shithole but it’s certainly not going to wow anybody.  I’d call it decent for the market at $800 a month.  I own my car (2008 Civic Si), and I have a pet cat.  I’m a high school graduate with a few college credits, but I’ve never been a great student.  

I’ve worked at the same company for 7 years (anniversary was last week) and I feel like I’m not making proportionately enough money.  I’m making $5 more an hour than when I started )I’m at $18.75 now) and I’m just feeling stuck.  I am a Customer Support Supervisor (NOT manager) and I feel embarrassed for 1) having worked in CS for so long/not really seeing a way out of it and 2) I feel like as a 30 year old I should be making more money than I am.  

Perhaps these are first world problems and I should be happy (especially now) with my situation - certainly I am aware things could be much, much worse (maybe this post belongs in AITA).  But I haven’t been able to shake the sense of complacency and I think that’s compounded by the idea that due to current events, my wages will likely be stagnant for the foreseeable future.",18May2020,1

He does not want me and i understand that but he claims that he still loves me but also says that it's not possible that we can be together. Morever he says that he's not ready for seeing me with another guy. He just doesn't care at all. Most of these years i was trying to not feel sad about it. He does not show his love, he doesn't say anything nice also. But he's depressed. I just can't keep going on;however., i have hope for us. I lost myself in this fucking situation. Whenever i feel sad i talk to him. Now i can't because when i talk to him, i got hurt due to his reckless acts. He also says that i have problems, I'm crazy. I don't know we were young and we argue a lot. But  for several months we barely speak with each other. I don't know he talks to anyone. He says he only sleeps and eats like a vegetable. Guys I'm fed up with waiting to be loved and I'm waiting him for a long time. He just can't see, i don't know. He just don't write to me couple of days, if he writes it's like 1 sentence. He says i can ask anything for my classes. But he does not read, he leaves me on read. I don't know, i see people who love and care each other. Do i deserve this? I change myself for him to not getting him angry. It's not enough and not permanent he says. We have been know each other since we are 14 and we are 23years old. For 3 years it goes like that but the big part of change in myself happened last year. I don't drink when he does not around. But when i ask him to come with me to cinema or dinner or something he always says no. He does not do anything for himself and for me.

17,"I want to do everything I can to make my parents happy, but I don’t know where to start. I’ll give some contextual info for starters:

-Me=20 year old man
-third youngest of 5 kids. Others are 13F, 17M, 22F, 30M
-My parents are together, but have some marriage problems. 
-Dad is 54, quick to anger, a mechanic of a 1-person auto shop. Has moments of tenderness and peace, most of his stress and anger is work/alcohol related. Minor heart issues.
-Mom is 52, very sweet and understanding, but puts me on a pedestal as her most put-together child, which is a lot of stress to handle. She helps run logistics for shop, does taxes and handles schedules. 
- we are a low income family in Massachusetts, and make approximately $50,000 a year,
before expenses.
- they’ve raised all of us really well. Take us on vacations to Maine every summer, baseball games when our friends score us tickets, hiking trips. Nothing big though. We’ve never been out of the northeast as a family before. 
-Both very tolerant liberals, but my dad makes the occasional gay joke. 


I just really appreciate them, and I want to do something good for them before they get sick (most likely my dad).

22,"Long story short, I had gone to college a couple of years ago to pursue a degree that would in end, help me help people. I had not realized how bad / failing the program was in the beginning of my studies. Then once I had, the college was being extremely stingy, and saying that the program was fine, and pretty much dragged me along in an effort to “make things better”. BUT they didn’t, even though I gave them the try to make things better. Once I finally realized that they were just using me for money, plus the ability to say that they are still offering the program (I was pretty much the only one left), as well as myself having integrity on the matter (felt like if I graduated, it would have meant nothing, due to the quality of the courses. I’d be able to say I “had a degree”, but pretty much not even knowing the basics of the field), I left the school. Wasn’t able to attend anywhere else, due to not being able to afford it (had to put myself through college if I wanted to attend). I was used by the college, and now I have this shadow of debt hanging over my head. Obviously many of us are struggling with the financial burden of going to college, but hopefully you actually got a degree out of it and a quality education.

I got kicked out of the house May 6, over my mom trying to guilt me over my grandparents’ immoral actions on me. I stayed at my ex’s house (17) and I am (16). We made up over a lot and ended up getting back together. Probably the worst mistake in my life because we ended our relationship for a reason. Anyways for a whole week straight, we were being reckless, drank a lot and had too much sex. One of the times the condom broke and I was able to get plan b. But there were multiple times after that where we had unprotected sex. a few days later, it finally hit us and we realized what was going to happen. The last day I had with him, I just told him I can’t be with him. Given the circumstances of his mental state and drug abuse. I got home 4 days ago... My close friend died 2 days ago and I’ve been in the worst state of my life. I cant eat properly and if I even do I’ll just throw it all up.

I hate to say it but I’m hoping it’s a miscarriage. I am not ready for that at all.

26,"I moved in with my partner almost as soon as we started dating. I love them a lot and we have been together almost 4 years now. This hasn't always been a problem and started happening most notably around the year and a half mark or a little later into the relationship. They will smell, and I'll ask them to take a shower (which I would only do if I genuinely thought that I wouldn't be able to be around them bc of the smell) and they get offended. 

I've went about it multiple ways in the past, just trying to make it sound nicer, but they always get offended by it. Then they just get defensive and rude back. Saying things like: ""Well you smell sometimes too and I never say anything!"" I just say, ""Yeah, okay. But I'd want you to if it was bothering you.""

Like I said, it's happened multiple times in the past and I just feel like I can't even bring it up or I'll get yelled at for not wanting to smell it? I've just come to the end of my rope about it. There's other things going on as well that just add to it, so I know it'll all blow up at some point.

I met them when I was 14. That was one of the happiest I’ve been in my entire life.

I’m 20 now. We (me &amp; two other girls) stayed close until the recent year or two, the two of them grew a lot closer because they go clubbing together. I never joined them because it triggers my depression episode. 

Soooo I got left out. They’re so close without me, even closer when the three of us were a group, and I feel like absolute crap. They know how much it hurts me but I think they don’t care enough to do anything.

I wanna cut them off bc they’re making my anxiety worse. But in a way I feel like I own them my life because they were the ones that helped me get over my depression when my mind was at a really dark place. And it’s really not their fault that I don’t go clubbing??

I feel like least I could do is to not throw a tantrum. I don’t want to talk to them about this bc it’ll be out of pity if they decide to include me again, instead of genuinely want me to be with them.

31,"I (22M) finally got to see my boyfriend (21M) after 2 months of not seeing him due to quarantine. Our state is allowing some counties to operate at “phase yellow” meaning stay at home restrictions have been lifted. We agreed to meet at a location that was roughly a 1-hour drive for both of us to go on a hike. The night before we hung out BF was drinking at work and then proceeded to continue at home with his aunt who he also hasn’t seen in a few months. I didn’t say anything but, I was concerned about him being hungover the next day. 

The day of arrives and he tells me we can only meet for a few hours because he had alternate plans to help a friend. I was aware of this, but I didn’t think they would cut into the day as much before he sent the text. Reluctantly, I still agree to meetup with him because I want to see him. After we arrive, we are excited to see each other and have quick sex in a stall. We walk around for a while, but his stomach is bothering him. I ask if he wants to use a bathroom but everytime we start a new trail; he assures me he is ok and that his pain has subsided. After 2 hours of this he finally alleviates himself using a restroom, but still feels no better. We get in his car to say goodbye even earlier now because of his pain. I am upset at this point, but I don’t vocalize too much of my frustration other than I just wish we had more time together.

After we get to our homes, he showers and relieves himself, only to be out hanging out with a different friend that wasn’t the one who needed help. I at this point am a little angered because, I feel like our plans were ruined for no reason. He’s seen both of the friends plenty of times since quarantine because they are all in the same city. I barely hear any word from him the rest of the night other than, he is with his friend and he will be unable to talk. (BF is not out of the closet yet so he has a rule where we can’t talk much when he is with others). My breaking point was when I wake up the next morning to see his snapchat location is at a hotel in his hometown. This was something he told me we could do, because his mother is not allowing guests for sleepovers during the pandemic. I questioned why he had to stay in a hotel for the night and blow over $100 in room fees when both of them lived in the same town? The only explanation he gave me was because his friends car stunk? (I am uncertain if his friend is able to have overnight guests.) I just don’t know what to do, anymore. We are not currently communicating, and he has removed me from seeing him on the snapmap. I am writing this because I assume, he is still with his friend and we can’t talk at the moment.

43,"so i dated this boy for a year (a bit on and off at the end, broke up and got back three times). we started dating our senior year of high school and everything was lovely. we were two *kids,* just in love. with college, we went to two colleges two hours apart. we had gotten into the relationship thinking we were breaking up the summer before moving to college because neither of us wanted to do LDR, but ended up trying. it went well for awhile, but he hated (still does hate) his college and i loved mine. i was surrounded by high school friends, made a bunch of new ones. i went out to drink, party, and do lots of things while he sulked in his room. i spent my time at parties texting him, checking on him and he would be upset with me. i loved him but the distance was too much and his sadness brought a lot of harm in my life. we would fight a lot more, and it would always end with me crying.

i was in a very toxic relationship before him (19M), verbally and emotionally abused for a year and a half. it brought a lot of moment of insecurities and sadness in my next relationship. however, i tried to not let this harm my current one. but, it kinda did. i blame myself. but he put me through a lot of shit: controlled me to the max, made me cut out and block all my guy friends and even some girls, i was drawn away from my families, i couldn't wear what i wanted, i was called slut, whore, etc.

with this boyfriend, we tried to be friends. it worked decently well but now we have been arguing again and again. over stupid things too. he would feel entitled to know things about my life and about me and why im doing things but i didn't want to tell him because he was no longer my boyfriend. he would had a really bad attitude with me and would be rude to me and leave me on read, but when i did it, it was somehow my fault.

the last text me sent me was tuesday and it said, ""instead of just saying hey please don’t do this it bothers me or something, you’ve turned to being a self-righteous dick who thinks they’re better than everyone else. either get off your high horse or don’t i don’t care. I honestly don’t know how to talk to you.""

i didn't like this because i have told him SO MUCH what bothered me and hurt me and he never made any changes or even tried. but somehow, when i did the same, i was the dick. i haven't replied and i'm very upset. am i overreacting? what do i do? should i take some space?

the fact that she hates my boyfriend for absolutely no reason is very hurtful to me. for example, my boyfriend gave me one of his hoodies so i can wear it when i miss him and my mom got really mad when she saw me wearing it and she pulled on the hood and (accidentally or not idk) pulled my hair really bad through it. she always yells really bad like she’s on drugs or something. once, we recieved a fine for disturbing public silence or something because of her. she also used to fatshame me really bad (i’m 168 cm and 61kg) and made me starve myself by yelling really bad at me when i wanted to eat someting. i cannot live like this anymore, i have to study for getting into college and for my finals and i really cant because of my mental state because of her. what can i do? i’m devastated",18May2020,1
46,"So basically I went through my first breakup. I basically had the same thoughts everyone has. Y'know, wishing I could've done something different, dwelling on it, checking my phone everytime I got a notification, thinking about how pathetic I was, wishing she didn't leave, trying to get her back only to be met with the harsh reality that she moved on the day she broke up with me and was finding other guys/girls, the whole shabang.

I've been good during quarantine and because I'm 16 and about to graduate I'm hopeful for the future. Today has been one of those days where I thought about her a lot and it hurt again. It still always hurts but it's more intense. 

I also listened to a bit of the Joe Rogan Podcast episode he did with Jocko Willink. Hearing him talk about how bad people, kids, have it in countries like Iraq made me think about how lucky I am. Yeah the breakup really fucking sucked and part of me still is doubtful that I'll find someone better but, it made me realise that I'm pretty lucky to be in the position I'm in.

That being said, that is only temporary, how can I permanently change my perspective so that I have a better outlook on life and hopefully become happier?

Hi, so I have a 3.11 GPA as stated above with a double major in accounting and business as-well as a concentration in legal studies. I would like to acquire a business administration masters in tech or Heath care I believe. I am thinking that may be the best idea with what is going on right now. I would like to have my own business one day and that having a masters in this field may be beneficial. In regards to my undergrad, I had a really rough time in college medically, in turn had to leave a semester to get spinal surgery.  However, I did on transcript graduate early in 3.5 years instead of 4. I had to rather significant internships as well within a law firm and a start up firm. I was also in a abusive relationship that took a lot of my time so not to say that’s why my GPA is rather low but it definitely impacted my work. I’m wondering with my majors, concentration, and graduating early, also considering my GPA and internships, what schools would I have a chance with and would anyone recommend any other masters? If I’m going to get a masters I would like to get a salary in the 90s hopefully. I would really love the feedback if anyone has any advice. Thank you!",18May2020,1

I haven’t made the appointment yet because Ive realised I need to actually tell her I lost one of them. I told her I don’t wear them because I’m scared to lose them, and the first pair I had was too small for me and I didn’t want them to fall out.

52,"So I(24f) love my mom(60+f) very much, but she is a lot to deal with. Some backstory: we've never had our own house and we were homeless mutiple times, and I was excited when I left college to be away from her, as she could be emotionally, physically and verbally abusive as well. Unfortunately I had to drop out after 1 semester. Unfortunately, home didnt exist anymore because my mom never got her own place and the person she was living with had moved out. I had no friends to stay with because i was kept on a tight string through high school, and middle school sucked since i started public school in 6th grade (been homeschooled til then). So i lived in a car with her for months working and going to school while she found church friends to stay with, then a shelter. This continued until one of my older friends graduated from college invited me to stay with her, which I did, but my mom would frequently discourage me from going, guilt trip me into staying with her, or show up where I was and then keep me out until I missed the bus to take me home and refuse to drop me off.
Eventually i met a guy who coerced me into moving with him but he was abusive and was arrested and month later i find out im pregnant. Amazingly my mom finds an apartment (an efficiency) less than 2 weeks later and puts the deposit down and has me put the lease in my name saying she will not be staying with me for long. The next 17 months i spent being verbally abused, (even though i am paying rent) she says she is helping me take care of the baby because i dont know what Im doing. Then we have to move out because the county changed regulations that the apt had to meet.  
I save funds and start doing Lyft to make extra money so we can be in a hotel and start classes again so I can get my degree. My mother doesnt agree and i foot the bill, and when i cant, we are sleeping in the car. After being questioned by cops multiple time she begins contributing to the hotel fund so we arent in the car overnight mid-winter. She claimed both me and my child on her taxes and gave me $1000 out of it each year to take care of my bills (she got $5000+), but that year i claimed myself and my son and gave her the $1000 which she resented me for and guilted me into paying her owed taxes, leaving me with less than enough to put a deposit anywhere. 
We couldnt find a 2 bedroom in our price range so she told me to go ahead and get a place for my child and me and she would be ok. 
So i moved to a one bedroom and let her know she could keep some of her stuff in my place till she got on her feet. She then managed to pull a back muscle and had to stay with me, but she never left, despite me telling her multiple times. She brought more stuff in and has taken over but still defers to me on some things (sarcastically) because its my place. She got pissed at me for paying the electric bill and started taking the mail so she could pay. She's given me money for rent once and it was $300. 
She undermines my parenting, disrespects me, has abused my child (in my eyes), has filled my place (she hoards)so I cant have guests i cant even fit my childs bed down and we are 3 sharing a bed. I hate having her here, but i feel wrong kicking her out because of the pandemic, she is an essential worker but doesnt get paid much, and is at risk due to her age.

53,"I'll give a little background before asking some questions.

I was raised by a single poor mother with multiple siblings. Mostly because we're dirt broke with only one vehicle that we can't afford to have wrecked by me, I've never been behind the wheel before. I have developed some serious anxiety towards driving, and I really have no idea about anything to do with it. If I got in a car right now, I'd probably mix up the gas and brake pedals. So obviously, I'm extremely nervous about this driver's ed thing.

I have some questions that have haunted me for a while.

Do most people go into Driver's Ed knowing how to drive? Am I basically fated to fail and waste my parent's mom's money? Or will they actually teach me everything, even the fundamentals that I don't know? Am I worrying over nothing or am I fucked?",18May2020,1

Anyways, the issue is a rift that seems to be getting wider and wider between one friend, lets call him Nick, and me. The group and I were introduced to Nick later on as he's cousins with one of the guys in the group. For many years we all got along great and had a lot of good memories together. Over the past 2-3 years though, Nick has been, for lack of better word, a massive cunt. 

He's constantly trying to put me down and make me feel bad. It started off as small things like changing my name to tiny dick in our group chat. Once I changed it back he would keep doing it even after I told him it's not funny anymore. It then turned to him inviting people in the group to things privately so that I wouldn't get the invite. From there it turned to him straight up insulting me and tearing me down in person in front of others. It eventually boiled over when he told his cousin he wouldn't go to a music festival with him because I'm going too and he just doesn't enjoy festivals and concerts when I'm there. 

I've decided I no longer need to be friends with someone that won't respect me. The issue is both Nick and I are very ingrained in our group. We've all known each other for years. It's not like I can just say I don't want to go to things with Nick there because then I'd rarely get to go to things.",18May2020,1

So to start, I don't have many friends, and the friends I do have are online friends. I did something that I thought would be a funny joke to my friend but it went pretty badly. I beat myself up over the fact I didn't see how it could go so badly and only saw it as going good, making me feel like I am insensitive and that I messed up everything and now feel pretty bad and upset. It feels like such a simple thing but it seems to have spiraled out of control. We normally have talked every day for many months and now it just feels weird to talk anymore and I have just been avoiding it. I feel that I want it to back to normal but that I messed up too badly for that to happen. I just keep thinking about the situation and it makes me want to just hide. I have only talked to them once since the incident within 72 hours. They said they were worried about me and I told them I have some issues and these issues sort of made me have an irrational emotional response to what happened. But now that I talked to them once after the incident and opened up about my problems I just feel like I don't know how to talk to them anymore even though previous to this we talked every day for many months. I feel that it is just all in my head and I don't really know what to do.

62,"Dear fellow redditors, I seek you’re advice.

My inner group of friends have always been a creative gang, and we usually give each other various tasks for get-togethers such as creating a video, writing a song, making a quiz etc as entertainment. We used to be in a show group (did paid events) together back in college so it has been like this for years.

These songs, poems, videos etc usually end up in making fun of each other and that kind of banter. Rants about old romances, drunk mistakes, personality traits, and so on. I usually just think it’s fun, but in the beginning of our friendship a verse in a song about me being a boring and anonymous guy became a «thing», and it became a thing and has stuck with me since. Nearly everytime I am mentioned in one of these creative contributions, it usually is about me being boring.

I feel it’s important to mention that when I first met these guys, I was a bit of an outsider. I come from the countryside and they are all from the capital city, so they had more in common. I am also younger than many of them, so when I came into the group I was a bit shy and observing before I broke out of my shell and started being me.

I am not boring. I know that. I have a lot of energy, I am witty, outgoing and I have a lot of friends. I was one of the best performers in our group. I am a great cook. I have a good job, a fantastic girlfriend and mant hobbies. However, being constantly reminded of how «boring» I am has gotten a hold of me, and it is killing my motivation for contributing socially with these friends, as I over time have started worrying if they actually are finding me boring. I feel kind of surpessed when I am around them, as I feel a pressure to perform well socially. It chokes me, I get quiet and - boring. I don’t feel like this around any other friend groups. It’s been a lot on my mind lately, and it’s a difficult situation to be in. I feel like there’s really no way out of it once you get labeled and branded as boring. I can deliver the funniest material ever and tell hundreds of jokes during dinner, but I will still be «boring». Once tou’re in the boring hole, it seems like you’re never getting out. It may seem ridicolous, I know.

Any advice on how to deal with this? I like them very much apart from this one thing, and they are an important part of my life. We have been friends for years and do a lot of things together. I don’t want to cut them out.

I 23(m) recently got my heart broken by my ex 20(f). We had a bit of a rough 2-year relationship. We moved in together and have spent every day together since we started dating. Last year she cheated on me in my bed while I was at work with a girl. I was upset and my gut told me that it happened before I even went through her phone. I wanted to be the cool guy who was okay with it but it just didn't sit well with me as she lied about it when I already saw the sex videos on her phone from it. I moved out and later forgave her and moved back in. I was in love I hated to say it but she was pretty. Brownskin, Curly hair, Nipple piercings, tattoos in the right spots, all around just sexy and sexual she was amazing. I'd never had someone like that before she made me explore to keep up and I loved it. Fast forward after a lot of me catching her talking to her ex, lying about it and etc. We broke the lease and she basically went homeless and stayed with a few friends. I helped her through it no matter what I fed her at my mom's house, gas in her car, took her out to eat, movie dates, etc. I don't make a lot only 1600 a month from Walmart and My internship while also full-time college. I gave her my last without telling her because I was in love with her. She eventually moved in with me and my family and I'm not gonna lie I grew resentment towards her which led me to be verbally abusive during heated arguments. Everything just went really sour when I found out in October she gave me HSV2(Genital Herpes). I was broken I cried for weeks and slept for weeks. She supported me and swore she didn't know. We broke up a couple of times before she went to the military(national guard) she left in February for basic and was supposed to return in June/July. She wrote me and talked about starting our life together and fixing everything and she mentioned how she missed me and etc. Then i received a letter about how she was upset I did write her and It hurt me because I didn't mean to do that. I recently found out she had been talking to another girl(stud) and they had been talking since march. before she left she planned to come back and we would move away. She said I hurt her by not writing her enough in basic. I didn't write her often but me and my mom sent her a care package with necessities and I picked up every call in between each letter. I was working overtime to have enough money for us to move away, I told her I didn't mean any harm and I was sorry. She posted a tweet referring to How she been about someone since she met them and I instantly knew it wasn't about me. I confronted her about it and she told me the girl's name and sent me a video of them on facetime with each other brushing their teeth in AIT getting ready for the day. This was bold and It hurt me that she would even tell me and show me, she had no respect for my feelings after all I did. I begged her for a second chance to make things better and I told her I would fix everything. She basically said she'd think about it. I was miserable for those two days until I just flat out decided I wasn't gonna wait. I told her don't hurt me like she did last time and I asked her did she like her. 

She told me yes she did and told me they started talking In basic and that's why she said she'll think about it. She told me that she'd rather have a girlfriend and that she told me this once we started dating that she liked women more. Why lead me on? on top of this, she asked me to buy her some items right before she said this. shortly after that she got mad at me and hung up on me for trying to change her mind. she blocked me on all social media and she blocked my number. My mom talked to her and she said she didn't want to hurt again and that she was sorry. My mom felt she just blatantly disrespected me and she could've handled it differently. I did everything for someone who did nothing for me and she doesn't care she rubs it in my face with happy snaps and she watches all of mine too. I don't know where to go from here I really gave her all I had. I also know that she's dishonest and isn't disclosing her HSV status. I kinda want to join the military too now I'm stuck in rural Alabama and I want to experience that feeling of getting away as she did. I'm not currently in college I don't have a car and I have 10k saved up. Is this a bad move? She also told me she was going active duty which inspired me to want to join and marry her so we could station together. Even though it's over I still want to join somewhat I'm 24 and life hasn't given me much. where do I go from here?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: My ex gave me herpes, used me, lead me on, and cheated every chance she got. Now I want to join Military too",18May2020,1
65,"The text, paraphrased: We used to absolutely vibe! We totally gotta talk more often tbh

The context: I used to agree with everything they said and used to be EXTREMELY friendly because I was socially anxious and afraid of people- including them hating me. When I realized I didnt actually like this person and there was no reason I should *want* them to like me, I sort of peaced out and stopped talking to them as often..

Now they want to talk more because we used to have such nice conversations, but I only ever held those conversations because I felt sick to my stomach with guilt if I didn't!!

I don't want to continue to be a fake bitch and lead them on but saying ""Yeah, we should!"" Because thats just an invitation to start the cycle all over again....

But I also dont want to overexplain and be like ""ya sorry but i dont wanna I was an overly anxious son of a bitch and thats why I was always so nice to you, I was only ever replying with the things I thought you *wanted* me to say so thats why we ""vibed"" and when I realized that I stopped talking to you!""  Because that would come out of literally NOWHERE

So.. what can I say? 

I dont want to lie and make them think everything is ok and lead on this friendship even more but I also dont want to be too blunt and blindside them so.. :,)

66,"My bf and I are 5,000+ miles long distance. We’ve been together on/off for 15 months now. It’s undeniable that we have an authentic connection - we have a deep emotional and mental connection, like we are on the same wavelength. I know he loves me deeply and he considers me “the one.” He wants to move here permanently to be with me and is already taking steps to trying to make it happen. He truly cares for me and is very emotionally available for me. I feel emotionally fulfilled in the relationship.

However, I question whether or not I actually love him... 

I feel a lot of resentment because he had a promiscuous past before meeting me. I’m the first woman he says he’s ever loved and his first real girlfriend (he’s had friends with benefits &amp; one night stands in the past). However he told me he only had a promiscuous past because he couldn’t find anyone to love, and he was trying to fill a void, but each encounter had a “diminishing return.” 

Then he found me and once he met the one he wanted, BAM, he didn’t want anyone else. 

I grew up very religious until age 24 when I deconverted (I had been “saving” myself for marriage), which is coincidentally when I also met my bf and lost my virginity to him. All was amazing — he truly made love to me and I could feel it with every ounce of my being that this man loved me. He told me it was his first time ever making love, because he never loved anyone before.

I know my bf loves me to death but I can’t get over his past. I feel it’s unfair he’s had experience with multiple women, while I’ve only been with him and one other person (during one of our breakups initiated by me, I actually slept with and dated someone else. It was super fun but I didn’t feel the deep emotional connection I had with him, so I ended things and went back to my now bf. My bf knows all this and he was super hurt but accepted me back. He hasn’t been with anyone else during our breaks.) i know this is unfair but I almost feel betrayed by him. I waited for my soulmate and he didn’t. So I want to explore. If I sleep with someone else, I won’t feel the “betrayal” because I didn’t wait for that person either. 

I want to explore. I want to be with other people, whether it’s just casual sex or dating. When I think of a future with my bf, I feel suffocated and resentful. Like he had his fun and now is ready to settle down with “the one,” while I am now ready to explore life after breaking free from oppressive religion that made me forfeit a lot in life... but now I’m being constricted in a LDR. 

Idk. I just feel so clouded. 

Tbh I have had advances from a guy I find extremely attractive and he basically wants to hook up. We’ve already hung out a week ago and things got sexual, yet we didn’t have sex. (I know, I was basically cheating already). But now we both want to actually sleep together. Now I’m conflicted. 

I find myself wanting my bf as an emotional “security blanket” while I also “explore,” but this is morally wrong right? 

I have tried breaking up with my bf but he never lets me go (I know I don’t need his permission but he guilt trips me a lot every time I try to end things). I feel confused as well too, because I do like him for “emotional security” purposes.. I feel like I almost see him as a best friend, more than a bf. But yeah, he always holds on, says casual sex will make me depressed, that love is worth more, etc. 

Tldr: I want to explore with other people and explore in life in general, while my LDR boyfriend wants a committed relationship and wants to marry me. I am also conflicted because I love the “emotional security blanket” he provides me, yet I also want to be with other people simultaneously. I’ve tried breaking up using this reason exactly, but he tries to convince me otherwise and doesn’t let me go. So something I’m thinking is to just sleep with someone else while I am not broken up with him yet, aka cheating. This is wrong right? Can somebody please give me some advice, I can take harsh criticism and truth. Thank you",18May2020,1
67,"Hi, I’m a 15 year old kid and I don’t know what to do. You see, my dad goes around the house talking to himself and it’s kinda creepy. He doesn’t talk in a “pep-talk” way, he talks to himself in a more insane type of way, it almost sounds like he has full on conversations with himself. He only ever does this when I’m in my room and my little brother isn’t here, or when he’s in privacy like the bathroom or in his room playing music louder than normal. I can’t really make out what he’s saying, but every-once in a while he gets louder and gets a tone in his voice almost as if he gets angry. The stuff he says that I can make out is bizarre. “Do you really call that talent?”, “I have 2 kids, a drug addict mother... is she really cheating?” That’s all I can remember, if I remember more, I’ll edit and post and the bottom. He seems to try and cover the fact that’s he’s talking to himself too. When I walk out of my room when I hear him he goes quiet. When ever he asks me something before or right after he finished talking, he talks in a light-hearted tone that sounds really fake... which it is. As long as I can remember my dad has always had a bad temper. (He yells random words in his room from time to time, i.e. Fuck, Moron, Why, etc.) I remember one time I was pretending to be a DJ but I didn’t know what turntables and mixer panels were at the time, so I got an old dusty keyboard from the garage, my beats speaker, and I pretended to be a DJ. But the cord on the old keyboard was getting in the way, so I cut it off. Oh lord my dad went berserk when he found out. He got all up in my face yelling “wanna break my things, imma break all of yours!”(I was like 6 at the time). He then proceeded to break all my toy lightsabers over his knee which still traumatizes me to this day. I have another vivid memory when I was in the 1st grade I got up for school and I was really tired. I wasn’t putting on my clothes because I kept on falling back asleep. I remember my dad putting a fist up to me backing me up into the corner of our L-couch. He never hit me, but I never felt safe. Fast forward 10 years later, my parents are split up and my dad is still the same. My dad goes batshit crazy at stuff still. When our pets pee on the couch, when my little brother lost the TV remote...  and I don’t know if he remembers his past of being like this and that’s why he talks to himself, but it scares me a little inside.

I've been feeling pretty low these last few weeks. I get frustrated at almost anything and am constantly stressed out. 

My frustration gets to a point where I feel like I'm overloaded, this leads me to do things like biting the inside of my mouth hard enough until it bleeds while tensing my neck muscles. Sometimes I'll smash my head against a wall, or just punch my arm until it goes numb.

78,"

Me and My friend have been friends since we was 13 (Both 18 now) and have been through a lot of good and bad things. I first met him at secondary school where he was a very bubbly and “nerdy” character. At first we never spoke that much but we both had a mutual friend so we would text occasionally and talk in school.

Then my friend was introduced to weed when he was 14, he has minor mental problems but nothing which could stop him from living an decent life, but ever since he started to smoke weed he started to mix with shady people who would use him to do things. By the age of 15 he had his girlfriend living with him and she was making him worse by always pressuring him to get more weed and to drop out of school so she could control him. He started to hang around with older people and carry weapons often. I would always keep my distance to these things but stupid 14 year old me thought it was cool to have a friend as a troublemaker. 

Anyway 2 years go on and he is still very immature and has very little respect for his mom, but I start to see him more and eventually he got me into weed, I’ve never been a massive smoker but every time I saw him we would smoke. 

One night when we are 16 we try our look at the local corner shop to try booze for the first time and we managed to get a bottle of white cider, from that day on all he has cared about is alcohol, he went through a stage of being super violent when drunk and would get arrested and pepper sprayed but thankfully it has stopped. 

But now a days he is drinking more then ever drinking at least 16 cans a night, every time I go over he pressures me to drink and says we might as-well drink. He calls me lucky because I go to college yet he doesn’t even bother to do anything with his life and if anyone challenges that then he gives them a sob story about how mental he is, he tells me ‘ roll on mental health benefits ‘ when he is out of money. 

- I have to go to his house to meet him 
- he spent his child allowance savings on drink then pleads poverty 
- he wants me to drink every time I see him 
- he has put me in dangerous situations what he has caused
- my mom and dad hate him because he effects me 
- no one else wants to know him because of how he acts
- he uses his mom to buy him beer 
- whenever he is drunk it’s always a feel sorry for me story 
- he is always complaining 
- he always tells me not to do things and to not speak to certain people.
The list can go on and on and on.....

But yet all this and can’t get rid off him, I always feel sorry for him because he has no one but I have no friends as well because I am the only person who talks to him. I suppose in my head a feel like I have to be loyal to him really he drags me down. 

Does anyone have any wise words for me, hoe to go about this because I want to get on with my life and not feel guilty for cutting him out. Thank you for listening",18May2020,1

93,"My bf and I dated for 5 years and broke up a few months ago. When he broke up with me, he was severely mentally unwell. Over the years, it's been a pattern where he would fall deeply into a mentally unwell space, become very distant towards me, breakup, then a week later, get back together. It sucked every time.

I expected the same this time, but later came to accept that it was over. I spent the next few months (and still trying now) to get myself together and move on, up until a few weeks ago, when he asked if we could get back together.

I still have strong feelings for him and I do miss him but dealing with a mentally ill person is so tiring. He would get very suicidal, then later when he snaps out of it, he acts like it was nothing and it makes me seem like I was overreacting. 

Over the years, I can say I've tried my very best to help and support him, to encouraged him to see someone, but every time I reach out, I always get shut down. I would feel so emotionally and mentally exhausted and so incredibly drained, enough to warrant my close friends' concerns with how distressed I seemed. 

One time after our breakup, he went into that space where he wanted to kill himself. I just turned off my phone. When I turned it back on the next day, I felt (and still do feel) absolutely horrible not being there for someone who needed support, but I honestly couldn't handle it. I felt so overwhelmed.

Since our breakup, we still have been talking regularly, despite me wanting to cease talking so I can properly move on. One reason being that I was/am his only support (abusive immediate family and his friends think it's a joke), and he won't talk to professionals. He has been asking why I'm willing to throw all these years away because of one mistake (mistake being that he broke up with me when he was mentally ill).

94,"CW: mention of trauma from being molested, I do not go into detail.

Hi reddit,

I have a dilemma, but first, a little context. Since last September I’ve been in a band with 4 other friends and they are all great people. I love them all to death. I’m a very physically affectionate guy; I hug all my friends a lot, I give them high 5’s and fist bumps, and if we’re sitting next to each other, I don’t give a fuck if they want to cuddle or anything in that platonic realm. But one of my bandmates looks like a guy who groomed and molested me when I was a young teen. This makes me uncomfortable, as I have yet to completely work through that trauma. He’s also a very physically affectionate guy, and I love that in my male friends. But his affection, although always with innocent intentions, gives me intense anxiety. I’ve asked him multiple times to ask before he touches me in any way (non-sexual) but he has ignored my requests. This has, quite frankly, frustrated and pissed me off and I’ve been cold to him for the past 4 months or so. There are a couple other things too, like how he constantly tries to be funny by speaking with a higher pitched voice and saying “yass queen” in a very inauthentic feminine gay man’s voice, and this also frustrates me (I’m gay, he’s straight) but it’s not the root of my uncomfortableness around him. 

I am seeing him next week and I plan on talking to him about this stuff and more because I love him and our relationship is essential to our success as a band. I’m conflicted though on if I should tell him he looks like someone who molested me and that THAT’s partly why I’ve been cold to him, or if I should just tell him his  insensitivity to my requests for consent is why I’ve been cold. The reason why I’m hesitant to mention the guy from my past is b/c I don’t want him to feel weird about it all when he’s around me, but at the same time I can’t just give everyone else around me except him a free pass to hug me and touch me and shit.

96,"(Quick background - about 10-15yrs ago I had an agoraphobic episode and was house bound for about 2ish years. I have since improved but every day is a struggle, I also have major depression and anxiety.)

I’m a school cleaner have been for 3 years now.  I applied for this job because I knew I would be working alone and that I could work outside school hours. 

My manager called me and told me that I now have to do a separate clean in between recess and lunch every day because of the corona virus. 

I told him straight that I was unable to do 2 of the 5 days because I’m not in town but I’m struggling to bring myself to do it. 

I’m now in a constant state of high anxiety and tears because I just can’t bring myself to leave my house to do what needs to be done. 

I need to call my manager and let him know I’m not doing it/can’t do it because I don’t want to be paid for something I’m not doing but I’m terrified about the impending conversation and the thought of loosing my job over it just make things worse in my head. 

I feel like I will be letting everyone down because we are very rural and from looking at past paperwork, the teachers had to take turns doing the cleaning back when they were in between cleaners. 

But I feel like I need to stand up for myself and my limitations. 

Can he just lump these extra shifts on me?",18May2020,1
97,"Mobile and long post, so. double sorry.

So when I was 12 (now 17)  this girl rode on the same bus as me and we lived near each other so, as kids do, we were immediate best friends. I'm calling the girl S.

S was amazing and my best friend for years. She came to my house everyday for dinner, called my mom ""mama"", and was overall adopted into the family. Shes a lot different than I am, though. She was always into partying and had new boy problems every week, but that's just how she was and I loved her for it.

A little over two years ago her house caught on fire and she moved in with us. It was a dream to live with my sister, until she got with a new guy (C). I thought C was just like every other dude and he'd be gone in a month, until S started changing. She pretended to have pneumonia for weeks to skip school and once my mom called her on it, she asked if she could cyber school. My mom is really against home schooling so she said no. S didnt like that and decided to move out with her sister to cyber school, but she ended up dropping out in the 3rd quarter of her senior year. 

We still talked and she was still my best friend. I was at a nearby school park with some friends when she texted to ask where I was because she had news. I was the first person she told when she found out she was pregnant at 17 with C's kid. I was wary, but excited for her because she always wanted a family and C didnt seem to be going anywhere. Then she all but disappeared out of my life. 

While she was pregnant I worked with one of her sisters so I got regular updates. C abused S in every form even while she was pregnant, got her into meth (apparently she started that before she was pregnant), and when she gave birth C wasnt there. S ended up getting a PFA against him soon after having her daughter. Of course, that didnt last long, and she violated the PFA pretty quick to start seeing him again. 

Now, S is 19 and C is in prison for multiple charges (including violating the PFA, drug charges, and the physical abuse to S) and S is not hiding her her intention to get back with him as soon as hes out. Her mother currently has custody of her daughter and despite everything, S is better now than she has been in months. Sober, at least, trying to get her kid back, and shes once again a part of my life. I know that as soon a C get out shes gonna revert back to how she was and its eating me. 

I love her so much but it's so incredibly infuriating to see her post about him constantly. Her family, friends, and I have collectively told her hundreds of times that if she gets back with C she'll be endangering her daughter and lucky if he doesnt kill one of them during a drug bender. We've given her advice, heard her out, and now were all just shitting our mouths and waiting for the shoe to drop. 

I dont know what to do. I dont have it in me to watch her collapse again, especially since this time her daughter will likely be in the crossfire, but I also cant abandon her right now while she seems to be bettering herself. It's like sitting in a car going 5mph towards a bridge under construction. Theres a chance that by the time we get to the bridge it will be finished and we'll be fine, but theres also a chance the whole thing will collapse. I dont know if I should just get out of the car before we reach the bridge, or take the chance.

I really could use any advice offered and I'll answer any questions. Thank you on advance.",18May2020,1
98,"My aunt has had a variety of health issues throughout her life, mostly stemming from a childhood case Leukemia and its long term effects. Sometime in 2013 she had a series of seizures that left her unable to take care of herself, leading to her having spent the past 7 years in an assisted living facility. Recently, her condition has deteriorated further, and she has been put on morphine to make the inevitable as painless as possible. This leaves me pretty confused as to how I'm supposed to act/feel right now. Her seizures had a huge negative effect on her mental abilities, and since then she has rarely been able to maintain a conversation or really interact with people beyond basic yes/no questions. I have very few memories of her before her health started to decline like my older brother and cousins do. (I'm 16) Because of all this, it's been difficult for me to really have a connection (or even memories of one) with her and I don't really know how her death will affect me.

So its going to be my 2year anniversary with my wife. I'm trying to get her quencinera pics and I finally found the guy and he still had them from 7/8 years back. She never got them because at the time her mom had no money to get them. And she always brings them up that she always wanted them. 

The guy is charging 380 for all the pics in a USB(300 pics) and 5 printouts. Is that a good price? I don't mind paying but I also don't know if the guy is taking advantage at the fact that I'll pay whatever price for them.

100,"Hi. I work in construction and real estate developments. Obviously no one is buying apartments right now and the finances of the place I work are looking gloomy. There is a risk of the business falling apart. So all of us employees are getting our salaries reduced, this is to adjust to the current situation and no one loses their job. I know the director personally (he’s my relative) and I know he cut his salary too. 

I am currently working 40 hours a week however my salary got cut 35%, so I would like to renegotiate with my boss a 35% reduction of working hours. This is so I can pursue freelancing and odd jobs to make ends meet. My husband is currently unemployed but we have savings so it’s not like we’re starving but if I get these odd jobs the financial impact on our savings (long term) will not be as bad. Yesterday I went to an ultrasound and now to top it all off, I find out I have some health issues, will possibly need surgery...

I love my job! I really do. And I love my workplace, I am also one of the top 3 employees.  Seriously I wish I could work there forever so I obviously don’t want to see the business fail. But 35% is just too much. I’m getting paid minimum wage right now...

101,"I'm really bad at making good cohesive posts, so please ask for details if I don't explain anything well.

Basically, my emotions are incredibly overwhelming. Its almost abnormal how strongly I feel about things.
Here's some examples:

Good feelings:

When I take interest in something new, like an anime or a video game, I get an overwhelming urge to change my personality, hair colour and style to match certain characters. It's even gone as far as self harming after I see my favourite character self harm. It's bad.

I get so excited that it makes me upset. It's like an anxious fluttery bubbly feeling. It's so powerful that it makes me avoid doing things I love so I won't have to feel it. When I get this excited my body trembles, I hiccup, I accidentally make noises, I twitch violently and occasionally cry.

I get very over excited. I dance around and squeal with no shame and everyone always makes fun of me. I never realize at the time that I'm doing something embarrassing.

Bad feelings:

I have depression, and while it's never good, I do have months that are especially horrible to deal with. But I don't do what would be best for me in those times. I don't cheer myself up with music and shows I like, I do the opposite. I purposefully make myself sadder by looking at triggering content. This has always ended in huge bursts of self harm, an eating disorder relapse, and even suicide attempts. But for some reason, I think I take pleasure in being this sad.

I feel at home when I feel bad. Part of me weirdly enjoys constantly being distraught, and I find that very confusing.

I get really happy when I hurt myself. I love bruises and scars on me, and I don't know why. I want to know why because I feel like that's wrong.


I know this has been ranty, and maybe gone off topic, but I would really like some help. I want to just be excited normally, and be sad in a way that doesn't damage me. Please help me.

I hate how this post comes off. I do obviously find a weird enjoyment in being consistently sad, but I don't want that for myself. I think if I pushed past it I wouldn't miss it.

Me (17) and my boyfriend (18) have almost been together for a year and a half, so Im trying to figure out something to do for him. We can't go out to eat, given the COVID-19 situation, but that's not really something we'd usually do anyways. When we hang out, we sometimes drive around in his car and listen to music, or we cook food together. We used to watch movies and tv-series, but given the fact that he is now a carpenter apprentice, he wakes up at 4.30am - so he's tired during the weekdays. Which is totally understandable! But given that this next week he is off on Wednesday, thursday, friday + the weekend (a bunch of holidays coming up where I live,) it's perfect timing for me to do something!

I don't feel like giving him a gift. He buys the things he wants, so there's not anything on his wishlist. I don't want to do a picture collage thingy either... We're not really that type of couple, if that makes sense?

I've been thinking about just ordering some sushi, having us be home alone, maybe give him a massage while we watch a movie. I really just want to treat him the same way he makes me feel. I also somehow feel like this isn't really enough, given that we cuddle a lot anyways. I just would like to make this day special for him, so he can feel appreciated the same way I do.

I'm a 21f and I have been lying to people ever since I was a child.
It started because I had a very abusive childhood, and I would make up happier stories to people around me as to not have to face my reality.

Eventually I stopped doing that and started being honest to people, but I guess the sympathy that that got made me feel a bit better somehow. And the lying continued. I started telling tall tales, little lies for no reason (could even be something like what I had for breakfast) and got deeper and deeper.

Over the years I've dealt with alot of the hurt from my childhood, and have dropped alot of the lies I told, I moved country a few times and managed to ""start over"" but for some reason I kept doing it, I keep doing it.
I want to stop, I really do. It makes no sense, there Is no point to it at all. But it just shoots out of my mouth (I have adhd and often find it hard to think before I speak in general) . Its not even a conscious thought, it's never been a ""I'm going to deceive this person now"", but it just comes out. I've been embarrassed to go to a therapist. 

In half a year I'm moving country again (alone) to the other side of the world. I do NOT want to tell any lies to anyone I meet, it can be a fresh start and I want it to be. But this has become such a subconscious habbit, I don't know how to stop.

My parents told us that they were getting a divorce about a year ago. Since then, my dad has moved an hour away to a new town. My mom has been there for me all my life, raising me, homeschooling my sisters and I, and making me the person I am today. My dad has always been at work. I would see him for maybe an hour a day, over dinner or while watching a show. Now that my dad has transferred to a new armory (he is national guard) he has become the only person in the building, and is able to shrug off some of his work for the weeks we are at my moms', so he can come home when we usually get done with school. I would not mind spending time with him, but we just don't do anything, and he doesn't make any efforts to get to know my sisters and I. he usually sits on the other side of the room on his phone, while I play on the Xbox, and my sisters hide in their rooms. my dad and I are in the same room, but we don't talk, or do anything together. 

&amp;#x200B;

The judge decided that custody would be split 50/50. One week at my moms, one week at my dads. Only my dad wanted this. My mom was used to us all the time, as she homeschooled us (we do it all online now, so she doesnt have to help much) and now sees us less than half the time.                                                                                                     
   My older sister (17) has depression and severe anxiety. she has stated multiple times that she doesn't want to go to his house, he wasn't there for her entire childhood, why should he just be able to hop in now?

My little sister (12) is easily stressed, has also stated she doesn't like the long car rides (motion sickness) and his house in general. 

I (16m)  prefer to keep to myself. I have to share a room with my father because of the size of the house, that is annoying and i get it. But also means I get no privacy. 

We have told him multiple times how we feel, and how we don't want to be at his house for this long. But he insists that we stay and get used to staying with him because it is only fair he sees us half the time.

He has never (physically) abused us, but ignores us, and doesn't care for our opinions. One we decided to have a sit-in, where we merely state ""we want to go home"" and all stayed in my sisters' room. Coming out to eat and use the bathroom.  He was enraged, and ""talked to us"" for two hours (aka he lectured us, and told us how we are only kids, we don't know where we want to be). He changed the wifi password daily so that once we were done with school, we cannot talk to friends online. My sisters yielded after three days, so so did I. The rest of the week he was a bit pissy, but didn't do anything with the wifi, or take anything else away.  (note, we did nothing destructive, nothing ""bad"" at all besides saying ""we want to go home"" and hid from him.)  

Today before he picked us up, I asked him (over text) if we could stay at my moms' house for a few more days and come later in the week. The ideal amount of time we want to spend at his house is about three days max, every two weeks. When I asked, he said no, and flat out ignored my compromise (four or five days, rather than seven) saying ""see you at 6"" 

We are now at his house, and I am awaiting the impending lecture he will give when he can solo me out, and try to manipulate me. What is your advice for me to be able to convince him to let us do what we want, rather than what he wants?

When I do say something, it feels like i'm just saying something to give an answer and i'm not being myself. 

It seems like when I act less awkward people still point it out. Last month I was at my friend's house and 2 of her friends were there. I basically made sure I looked calm and I made a couple observations instead of being completely silent. During an awkward silence she pointed out that im so awkward. I don't understand why she pointed it out to me instead of her other friend who was just about as quiet as I was. 

It also seems like people somehow can tell that im shy when they first meet me, even when in my mind i'm outgoing to people I first meet. 

When people point this out to me it makes me feel like shit. So many people have basically told me to stop being like this, being the way that I am. It makes me feel like no one accepts me and I don't belong anywhere.

Now, as for the reasons she stoped being friends with me: she said that I didn't support her (which isn't true but I can see why she would think that), she said I teased her too much (but I asked if it was ok and if she was fine with what I was teasing her about), she said that I was trying to cure her anxiety (which isn't true I just showed her a video of how to manage anxiety from a therapist) and she said I made her feel bad about needing time (i do admit I kind of pressured her) among a few other reasons I shouldn't mention

Now, me and her were best friends and I loved her with all of my heart. She helped me get through a lot but I didnt know I hurt her this much. I apologized to her countless times but it hasn't worked. This all happened 2 weeks ago. I feel like I've changed a little bit and now that I know what to look out for, I feel like I can be a genuinely good friend towards her but I don't know if I should try. 

So now I ask you. Should I try to reconcile with my friend or just leave the friendship as it is and learn from it. (Its also probably important to mention that I've been thinking about her every day and thinking about what I lost and feeling so so so guilty)

121,"Due to the pandemic, my university shut down housing and I’ve since come home to live with my parents. Everything has been pretty good so far — I get along with them pretty well and they’ve done a great job of respecting my space and the independence I’ve developed since leaving home 3 years ago. 

However, a few weeks ago, I stumbled across something that I probably shouldn’t have. My parents have a guest bedroom in their house that also purposes as my mother and my shared crafting room. We have our sewing machines set up and we store various fabric and crafting supplies in the closet and under the bed in there. My dad has sleep apnea and because of his snoring, my mom usually ends up sleeping most of the night in the guest/craft room, or sometimes my room when I’m off at school. 

Anyway, I was looking under the bed for a box of embroidery thread when I found the first sex toy. It’s one of those vibrating wands that you plug into the wall. It was plugged into the outlet next to the guest bed and was laying under the bed, not even hidden or anything! I was mostly surprised at first. It’s no shock to me that my mom masturbates, I mean everyone does right? But the fact that it was basically out in the open was a little disturbing to me, as it should be!

A week or so later, I was looking around the room to find some safety pins when I opened a desk drawer and found another one — a blue latex dildo that almost looks like it was given out as a souvenir at a sex convention. It even had a weird logo on the side that was mostly faded off. I just closed the drawer and tried to forget I saw it, but the fact that it was in one of our shared crafting drawers kind of pissed me off. Does she have no hesitation, no fear that I might happen to find it, given that I use that space frequently when I’m home? 

Today was the final straw. I was changing out my sheets and rearranging some things under my bed when I found a third sex toy UNDER MY BED. This ones an old fashioned cream colored vibrator that looks like it was made in the 80s. It’s under me right now as I type this out on my bed. As I mentioned before, my mom tends to migrate around to different rooms since she can’t stand my dad’s snoring. She must have brought it in when I was at college and forgot about it. 

Guys, I have no idea what to do in this situation. My mom is careless with her sex toys, specifically in spaces where her daughter might find them. And I just so happen to have stumbled across THREE over the last month. 

Should I confront her about this? Part of me thinks I should let her know that she should try to keep these things a little more private. After all, sex toys are not something that you should leave in spaces that you share with your child. On the other hand, the very thought of telling my mom I found even ONE of her sex toys makes me want to fucking kill myself. 

What do you guys think I should do?",18May2020,1
122,"I want to shave it all off, but at the same time I'm hesitant. I always really liked my hair. Also a few people in my family have told me not to which makes me second guess myself. My hair (what's left of it) is the longest it's ever been at this point, I just never got around to spending the $20 to have it cut (I don't usually have $20 to spend) and now all of the barbers are closed. I can actually put it up in a man bun so that the bald spot is hidden, but then I would have a man bun, which isn't really the look I want.

I've looked into the various products and chemicals that people use, and it seems like they just stop the balding without actually regrowing the hair that was lost. On top of that, I'd probably have to use them for the rest of my life, which doesn't sound very appealing.

And I know the surgical options are getting better every year, I just don't have that kind of money.

Can anyone relate to this? Or at least give me some sort of direction or confidence? This sucks.",18May2020,1

129,"I apologize if this post is not appropriate here (if there are better subs for this, please let me know). 

With that said, I was recently informed of a 2-3 minute speech I have to write and present for my high school’s zoom graduation livestream. Having been out of school for almost 3 months now, my headspace has been past graduation for a while now. The last thing I want to do is the cliche “reflecting on my last years of high school” speech; trust me, it has not been a fun experience. Instead, I decided I wanted to take an approach involving progressive politics, something I usually keep private but am nonetheless passionate about. 

My speech has to be reviewed by my school beforehand, so I doubt I can go all “eat the rich” and whatnot (it will be prerecorded so can't go off script either). Besides, I don’t want to make it too edgy/polarizing. I was hoping you guys could help provide me with specific “talking points” if you will that I can relate to the typical themes of a graduation speech (education, growing up, entering the workforce, etc.). Stuff like the link between graduation rates and the prison-industrial complex: it’s not too radical, and I can still connect to the lives of the people I’m speaking to. Most importantly, I want to criticize the system while still making it somewhat inspirational/positive. For context, I go to an inner-city school that is majority African-American but has students from a lot of different backgrounds.

130,"I (19M) grew up in the south surrounded by people with very traditional world views. I was raised by my grandparents because my dad was always either drunk or in jail and my mom was always running around with whatever drug addicted, abusive guy she was with at the time. From as early as I can remember I was always fed racist and homophobic beliefs by my grandparents and parents and I just accepted them as facts. (My family is white) This led to me surrounding myself with the wrong type people starting in middle school and well into high school, where the real problems began. I could go into detail but I’ll just say that in high school I said many racist and homophobic things that I know hurt people and made them uncomfortable and held certain beliefs that I now look back at and am just completely ashamed of. I’m now away from home and am almost completely no contact with my family and have a radically different worldview than they do and I’ve never been happier, but there’s not a day that goes by without me thinking about the type of person I was and the things I said and did or who I could’ve ended up as if I stayed with them and I have no idea how to move on or forgive myself because I know there are people out there that I made a very negative impression on.

134,"I'm very much sick of the shit they do, I guess the first thing that happened that led me to this point was last year when my mom found out I had social media, she took my phone and ransacked my room, and made me clean it up, and grounded me for 6 months. During that time she took my door off its hinges and constantly searched my room and questioned me on everything to the point where even when she isn't around I'm paranoid of people breaking my privacy, even if I have absolutely nothing to hide. Then, during this time, she literally called me evil, in her own words ""your not my son, your some evil replacing him"" and she was screaming it too just so the whole family could hear it. Then, much more recently I decided I wanted to paint my nails, just black, because I wanted to and felt as though it looked good, I still do to be honest. She called it ""disturbing and obnoxious"" and told me she would ground me if I didn't take it off. Not only this but when I ask her why I can't do it if it makes me happy she and my stepdad say it looks stupid and I can't do it because they don't like it. Another thing they do constantly is drink, which wouldn't be much of a problem usually, but the thing is my biological dad was a fucking alcoholic and it killed him, and there isn't a day that goes by in which my mom doesn't have a drink in hand, same with my step dad. Once when they were drinking my stepdad decided to ask me about my future plans, as I'm 17 and getting ready to go to college, and I told him that I wanted to go to school for engineer design or music production, to which he said ""your a man, you need something that will bring in the money so you can raise a family"", which led to a long and drawn out argument about how I plan to do what makes me happy regardless of how much I get paid, of course it ended with my parents saying ""we say no, it doesn't matter what you have to say, we make the rules and you don't"" simply because they pay for everything, so we kids must worship them as gods and obey their every command. But not too far from the end of that argument my step dad decided to say he gets to choose my college major, to which I said no, so he said ""I do, fuck you, your an asshole, I don't like you, kiss my ass"". Then of course, as usual for my family, the next morning they pretend like none of that ever happened and they start their day as if nothing happened.

135,"Hey all, posting this to see if there’s anyone with the same situation as me. 
I’m 22 this Friday (yay me) , and my boyfriend (21m) , invited me to go with him to Florida to see his mom/ have our first vacation alone. I’ve been in a relationship with him for over 7 years , he’s my first boyfriend &amp; im his first girlfriend. I’ve had to hide my relationship with him since we started dating because of how strict my mom is all the way until she found out herself when I was 18 that I had a boyfriend. She was pissed beyond belief , found some love letters he wrote to me( in which one of them hinted we had sex when she was on vacation.) but she continued and still continue to let me see him and pursue the relationship freely. 

Now my problem is that when I bring things of this nature up to her, she’s adamant about me not being a “whore”, however she herself had me at 21, albeit she lived alone , was in the military , etc. she claims it’s because she was “grown” already, with her own things. Which is slightly unfair given the circumstances these days to get a degree, full time job, etc. 

I’ve always been afraid of her and what she would say, and she tends to over react and get mad easily - which doesn’t help calm down my anxieties from childhood. She has already said no , but I’m wondering how I can approach things maturely and make her see that this is something normal for a 22 year old to do with their partner ? What can I say or do to help change her already stubborn mind. I’m not a bad kid, I don’t do drugs or alcohol- not even behind her back, and I’ve been genuinely well behaved and never hang out. But this is getting on my nerves with how controlling she is with my life. Thanks much!",18May2020,1

J doesn't have many friends and even before the virus he didn't go out much. J tends to be very immature and he will often pout and throw temper tantrums. He dislikes being away from me, which can be nice since I love him a lot and I'm lucky enough to work from home, but I need space too sometimes. J has had several online relationships (he's gay) with questionable guys and ends up getting his heart broken over and over. He exhibits many symptoms of depression. There are some days where he genuinely behaves like a 5 year old. I've tried doing some research online but nothing yields any answers that fit his situation. I don't think he's developmentally disabled. I've tried asking him to go to counseling with me but he always refuses (he had a bad experience with a CPS social worker and now refuses to talk to anyone except me about deep stuff).

151,"Hello there! I think I am going crazy.

To explain what is going on in my head, I need to first talk about the fact that I am young and also that I used to be overweight a few years ago. I got bullied for it and I learned a lot and worked hard to change that, I did, and now I have an average physique; but I want to be fit.

Now this is not really the main problem, instead it's the fact that I discovered self help 2 years ago.

It was mind blowing, I first started with the ""7 habits of highly effective people"" and I could genuinely feel my life changing, I quickly began learning about the many things I could do to change my life for the better and started applying them: meditation, working out, eating clean, you name it. I have been doing this for months now and I feel great when I do them. But only when I do them.

You see, although I have managed to make some of these habits a reality, it just doesn't happen with all of them. And I tend to break them as soon as I start them. I could have three weeks of clean meditation, clean eating and perfect training but then three weeks of poor eating, no meditation and barely any training. And that's when it gets me, because I not only go back to where I was (which affects me especially in the weightloss department), but also because I feel like I failed myself. But the sense of reward I get from acting productively is so strong that I get back again on this infinite loop that I mostly end up breaking because I get sick of it.

How is this even possible? I enjoy doing all those habits but I can't seem to stick with them, and when I go back to the other stuff I feel bad. And then I end up being hard on myself, by restricting my computer usage and facilitating a well sleep to then break that pattern later.

I want to thank you for taking the time to read that, I know some people are struggling with way bigger problems here but this is a tough one for me and it's affecting my happiness.

152,"This has been a situation my family have been trying to deal with for the past 4/5 years.

My grandfather is 80 years old, and over the past 4/5 years his shot term memory has deteriorated. My family suspect this is due to his alcohol addiction (he drinks 1-2 bottles of wine a day), but he has never gone to hospital for it. In fact, he has never gone to hospital for anything in his life, he's always believed that any of his problems will just ""heal naturally"".

Over the past 1/2 years, his health has deteriorated rapidly, with blood in his urine, not being stable on his feet, not making it to the bathroom during the night and being incredibly prone to cuts and bruises. He will not go to hospital. Not only because he doesn't remember any issues due to his memory loss, but he refuses to go to get any check ups or anything because of his stubborn nature.

My grandmother cares for him - she is also 80, and has her own fleet of medical issues, but she is of complete sound mind, in fact she is probably sharper than most people half her age. This situation is taking the biggest toll on her life. She is constantly looking after him, washing his blooded sheets, trying to limit his alcohol intake, controling his medication, cleaning up the mess he makes on the way to the bathroom, washing his clothes, all alongside caring for her own issues. 

There was a situation last year where my grandfather fell down the stairs, and started bleeding very badly. My grandmother called an ambulance, which arrived swiftly, but my grandfather refused any treatment from the paramedics, and refused their advice to come back with them to the hospital to be checked over. Obviously paramedics can't force someone to come to hospital (except when they believe someone doesn't have the mental capacity to make good decisions for themselves, which I think should have applied in this situation due to his intoxication, but I wasn't there to say this), so there was nothing they could do. Then, of course, the next morning he did not remember a thing.

Reddit, I honestly don't know what to do. I don't even know if there is anything I should do. It's clear he doesn't have all that long left, but the most frustrating thing is the impact he is having on my grandmother - who, by the way, would never complain about anything.
It also doesn't help that he is absolutely my hero, and I truly believe the only reason I am where I am in life right now is from his influence - he was the kindest, most generous, thoughtful man before the memory loss. I can't stress how dearly loved this man is in our family, it makes this situation so much more difficult.

We have plans of moving into the house in October. My problem is I come from a conservative Christian family that does not believe I should move in with my bf until we are married.

160,"For backstory, I was working at her family's restaurant at the time. I genuinely loved them and said I'd help as much as I could because they just opened. I only worked there for 4 days for  10 - 12 hours. This is relevant because we agreed I'd get paid even though it wouldn't be much. 

On what turned out to be my last day her dad started coming onto me. I was left alone with him for about 5 hours and he was pushing boundaries because he knows it's hard for me to speak up. There have been incidents before but I made myself forget about it because I didn't want to lose them. 

He grabbed my face and told me how sexy the color and shape of my lips are. Telling me I have beautiful eyes and I could see he was going to try and kiss me. Later on, he put his hand on my lower back and sliding it down on my butt and kept it there even when I tried to move away. He told me the pants I wear are too tight and my butt is big. I just wore normal jeans and joggers. There's a lot more that happened that day, I'm just putting this in so you get an idea. Anyway, it triggered my PTSD because I went through sexual abuse as a child and her family kinda knew about it. Especially her because I told her a lot of details and she saw the effect it had on me. 

I was taken home that day around 9:30 and I got home and collapsed from the floor. I slept for 16 hours. Long story short I stood up for myself and she didn't believe me and cut me off. 

I didn't get paid except after the first day and I left some things that are very personal to me at her house. My mom knows everything that happened and said she'd get it for me. I know it seems like it's obviously not worth it but I left a journal my first therapist bought me because none of my family and friends remembered my 15th birthday. She wrote in it and made me feel someone cared. I left a t-shirt my cousin gifted me that meant a lot to me. And honestly after what they put me through, bringing up my trauma I deserve my fucking money.

I'm afraid that I'll become out of touch, that I'll become decrepit and senile, that everything will change. I loved the culture that was present in the early 2010s and I'm struggling to deal with the end of many things I always thought would be with me forever. There will be kids who grow up not experiencing the events, books, shows, movies, and culture that I did. If I die any legacy I leave behind will inevitably be forgotten. I don't want to just die and lose the memories of the amazing things I've experienced. I want to keep my memories and personality while continuing to make more. I want all the people I know and love to last along with me. Sometimes I'm comforted by religion but I end up doubting its feasibility eventually. As a kid I hoped that we would somehow find a cure to aging within the next few years but seeing how long things have taken so far, I fear that a good portion of the people I value will have passed by then. And if we were somehow do develop eternal life, we would have to deal with overpopulation and a radical redefining of traditions, social norms, and the way death is depicted in media. And even if we do somehow solve those we would have to deal with preventing boredom for all of eternity. After a few thousand, million, or even billion years we would probably run out of things to do or see even with the constant invention of new fields and areas of interest. There are only so many skills to develop and so many stories to make. Dying then would mean the loss of countless memories. If the afterlife did exist a similar dilemma would occur. And if the afterlife is just existence and eternal bliss then what's the point? That would be no different from being high on drugs 24/7.

162,"I am a grad student (23F) who lives alone in a rented apartment. I am generally satisfied with this situation and I don't really get bored because I always have something to do. When the government announced that there would be lockdown, my mom begged me to leave my apartment and quarantine with my older brother and his family in the meantime. It has been two months now and school requirements have been piling up because I haven't done anything in my brother's house. I just couldn't find my drive to do anything productive. I feel like it has something to do with adjusting my schedule to fit theirs. I usually wake up at 6 or 7 and that's when I get a lot of things done. In here, people wake up at 11 or 12 am and we eat breakfast at 1 which basically means I already lost half of my day. We do everything together because it is a small house and every activity that makes even the tiniest noise would wake up everyone which I don't want to happen because I don't really live here. It would be embarrassing to cause any inconvenience.

Now that my professors are setting deadlines for school requirements, I'm getting anxious because I haven't done anything. This is really important for me because if I failed to finish these requirements, I would have to repeat the whole semester, adding another year in grad school. I feel like I would be much more productive if I go back to my apartment but I'm scared that this pandemic would last longer and I would be stuck in my apartment alone for the next couple months or more. I couldn't just go back here after finishing my requirements because that would be risking the health of my brother's family. He has two babies in the house so that would be really dangerous.

163,"A little backstory: 

My brother and his two kids (4F &amp; 16F) have been living with us for about 3 years now and since then he, along with his kids have managed to destroy my moms house little by little. The carpets needs to be redone, walls painted, and plumbing fixed. I have been away at University for the past 3 years (back during semester breaks) so I haven't had the chance to witness all that was done over the years first hand. However, now with COVID-19 and social distancing I have spent a little more time at home than I would like to in this environment.

Aside from that, my mom decided it was necessary for him to pay rent each month for the upkeep of the house, especially since she does the shopping for groceries, and also has to pay for any of the maintenance done to the house. After that deal was implemented my brother has barely paid her and when he is confronted about it, he will get mad and say she's overbearing or asking of too much. Personally, I think it is very reasonable but that's just my two cents.

Well today (about 30 minutes ago) she told him he had to move out and gave him a 30 day notice. After she told him, he went downstairs to the basement where he sleeps and started slamming a bunch of doors and cursing at my mom about how she is going to go to hell and the family hates her etc. etc. (we don't btw). But my concern is that with his bad temper and a 30 day window, I fear for my mom's safety. I am home all the time and I can fight my brother if need be, especially if he lays a finger on our mom but, I know that is not the best way to go about the situation. I texted my mom as soon as he started his episode that I should call the cops but she said no because ""he will get in trouble"". I told her to at least put her pride aside and lock her door as well as put something in front of it tonight just to be safe.

I don't know when he's going to move out but this safety precaution damn sure can't go on every night, and I am not going to wait for things to escalate and my brother do physical harm to my mom. What should I do in this situation? Calling the cops would mean that something would need to happen but I don't want to be reactive I want to be proactive. Please help!",18May2020,1
164,"He (32M) stopped giving my parents allowance since 2018. He lets my parents use his credit card for groceries only when he feels like it. My parents (64F) (67M) are both retired. He has a sizable income (6K+) but he does not contribute financially to the family.

Recently he went crazy and started throwing his temper around the house. Meaning no credit card for groceries because he took it back. He slams his door entering/exiting his room. He throws his temper around the house and makes our lives miserable.

My parents give in and cater to his whims because he is their son but I cannot stand him. They continue to provide food for him even though they are eating into their retirement fund at this point. In my eyes he is a useless piece of crap. He has nothing to his name at his age. He has switched between multiple girlfriends already because he cannot maintain a long term relationship.

He says he is in another relationship now and he is earning a proper income. Since he is so unhappy at home, why does he not move out? He has the ability to rent outside but he continues to leech of my parents. When he wants to spend time with his girlfriend, she stays over every weekend from Friday to Sunday FOR FREE. 

I hear no plans from him at all to move out or to get his own place. I fear that he does not plan to leave at all and he wants to stay till my parents die so he can get the house for free. The thing is my parents belong to the generation where they are resource rich but capital poor. They need to sell the house and downgrade if they want to have enough funds for retirement. If they continue to wait for their useless son to grow up and move out, I fear it will be futile and when I move out to start my own family, my parents will be left at the mercy of their temperamental son.

I (27F) give my parents steady allowance since I started working. I am saving up for my own home and I am making plans for my future family already. But the useless piece of crap contributes nothing and acts all entitled to my parents only asset. What can I do?

He frequently attacks me very violently whenever we have disagreements. For example, the incident that sparked this was that I’ve been doing yardwork to make our front lawn look nice,  me and my mom finished today and earlier my brother marched over to me to whine about the neighbours standing on our property. ( They are two siblings about our age.) I essentially told them that if they weren’t breaking or taking anything I couldn’t care less if they want to play on our lawn. He reacted to this by yelling at me to shut up, and mashing my nose and jaw together until I started to have a nose bleed. 

There are similar incidents almost everyday, and every time he does this and I go to my parents they say “ that’s normal for a young boy.” And “ he’s only 12.” Or they site the fact that he is homeschooled and has anxiety. I am sympathetic to this but I sometimes worry about the way that he solves all his problems with violence. I mean, it works ok when your opponent is a 16 year old girl who’s half your weight, but I worry he’s going to get himself pummelled one day.

I want to approach my parents about him being so violent—And I know for a fact that I wouldn’t have gotten away with his behaviour at 12.

Using a throwaway for reasons that will become obvious

I'll try keep it short but it might take a bit of explaining so I'll put a TLDR at the end

So I lived in a different country as a teenager, won't say which one to keep anonymity but it's a pretty corrupt country - I got involved in the drug trade, pretty low-level but it's the kind of place where any drugs are super illegal. I ended up getting arrested and after searching my phone the police also arrested the guy above me. The guy saw me in prison and since then I've always worried about retribution.

Recently my gf's phone was seemingly hacked, with someone sending a friend of her's a load of complete gibberish through instagram DM's, and a photograph of me that her friend said was just my face in the corner then the rest of the photo was just a glitched out screen - said it looked like a photo from her phone that had been glitched. Obviously this was pretty unnerving considering my past.

So my question is - is it possible for this be a bot or something along those lines? Like would a bot have capacity to access instagram and send gibberish to a person, and send a photo from the account owner's phone? We were out when this happened and my girlfriend didn't have mobile data on so I'm confused as to how a hacker/bot could have accessed her camera roll and instagram.

I'm not very technically knowledgeable in these matters so if there's anything important I've left out just give me a shout

If this was a deliberate hack then it seems like a very complex method to maybe scare me

TLDR: People may be after me, GF's phone was hacked by bot or hacker, but can a bot access phone camera roll and instagram DM'S?",18May2020,1

175,"I joined a startup consulting firm with a friend of mine.  Signed on as ""employee number one"".  I didn't get a paycheck until 6 months in, basically paid on a contingency basis so far (percentage of profit) but due to my own naivete did not demand equity from the start.  

About a year or so in, the firm is doing decently okay but I have made slightly less than I was at my old job.  I contributed to about half of the firm's sales so far this year, but the owner is only willing to give me a 15% company stake now, with more coming next year.  Meanwhile, I am track to make more than I did last year, but not necessarily more than I would in the industry (and again its all contingency and based on profit, so I share with him on the expenses and payroll for any support staff).  I think there's still a possibility of making a lot of money over the next year, but I also feel I should push for 35-40% equity once and for all, too, since I am really a co-founder in principle.  

However, I am also concerned that his ""assumptions"" of how many projects our firm could handle without hiring staff was wildly unrealistic.  This affects my pay directly as it is a portion of the overall firm profit, and the pathway to getting to where I wanted us to be appears to be a lot further down the road.

All through my last weeks of high school, till now almost a sophomore at university, I have been biting that spot. Its become slightly inflated, the inside cheek  having bumps and a scar that I can feel. When I bite it, I shift my jaw to press the part of the cheek between my teeth and squeeze, the pressure isn’t painful but gives the feeling of relief from the constant annoying feeling that I need to bite it. 

I have started to keep a dog tag in my mouth between my teeth and my cheek to keep from doing this, and it barely works. I chew on bottle caps to distract my mouth, and have torn apart hundreds at this point. I kept a quarter in my mouth at one point because it seemed to work. However I feel I will damage my teeth if I keep doing this.

The house that holds all the memories of their intense arguments and the awful name calling and the time my big sister and I had to call the cops on my dad for escalating to physical violence against my mom when she finally gained the strength to demand a divorce.

It happens about every 4 months, I’ll be driving late for one reason or another and it’s like i go into autopilot and before I know it I’m driving down my old street. I look at the now nicely manicured lawn with the beautiful fake wishing well and the new family’s cars parked in our old driveway. It just looks so surreal. 
And what’s worse is that I get the urge to go up to the door and knock and come up with some excuse to come in. I just want to see it, see what they’ve done, see if the house still has the same energy or if this new happy family was able to cleanse it. I want to see what they did with my old room and the door frame that my dog would claw at to go outside— after 11 years, he made a smooth “N” shape in the wood (I always liked to think it’s because his name is Neko; N for Neko). 
They definitely threw it out. They definitely got rid of those god awful floor to ceiling wood panels. Fuck, I hated those wood panels with everything in me. 
But I still want to go back. I still need to know who’s living in my house that really isn’t my house and never even actually felt like a home. It eats me up whenever I think about how I’ll never be able to take my future children to see my mom at the old place. I wonder if we had more time in the house, if my mom, my sister, and I could have made bigger happier memories to replace the shitty ones maybe it would have been home.

For those unfamiliar, it’s about 10 min from Manhattan by taking a Path train (ultimately looks / feels like a subway.)

The thing is though, my aparment is a steal for a one bedroom at $1425 a month. To put it in perspective, a place that size is usually $2k easily. So, do I keep it and waste the money or give it up and save til this thing passes? I'm curios what you would do. I LOVE my apartment and had so many good memories there. It truly is my pride and joy and I poured my heart into decorating it. But I don’t want to live there alone with nowhere to go and at least at my parents there’s plenty of room and human interaction.

It was super understandable. He actually showed me a lot like how I really should be treated while I'm with someone, I've been treated poorly in past relationships. 

Anyway. I should be delighted that I just graduated and happy that I passed and everything but I'm just...not. I'm just kind of thinking about what I don't have..like a partner. And I know it all. It will happen when its meant to. I should make myself happy first. All of that. 

I just don't know how to be happy for myself anymore. How can I do that? I know of thats a big question. Please help me

191,"Okay, this is embarrassing. 

So the frenulum of my penis seems to extend a few centimeters down the shaft of my penis, rather than just connecting my foreskin to the head of my penis. 

Also, this area is quite sore (my underwear causes some irritation.) 

I masturbate maybe once a day (sometimes twice) but never more. I don't do it anywhere near as much as I used to. 

Is this what's causing it? Is this serious? Has anyone had this?

194,"I'm familiar with eBay and usually know what to do.

2 days ago, I ordered from someone who's in China but has warehouses in US. I asked if I can cancel the order. Last night, the seller replied in broken English that they actually don't have the item in stock, they would cancel the order, and give me a refund. The seller officially has not cancelled the order, but few minutes ago, I got an email notification that the item shipped.

Also for the context, the item cost $150 and weighs at least 20 lbs so it's smart to include the tracking. It doesn't include the tracking. (If the shipping label is printed from eBay or PayPal, then the tracking number is automatically uploaded. They manually marked the item as shipped.) Also if they cancel the order and give me a refund, they don't have to pay eBay fees. If they mark it as shipped, then they have to pay for the fees.

I'm not sure why they would ship the item out when 1) they don't have the item and 2) they said they'll cancel the order. I contacted the seller just now so I'm hoping they'll respond before the item is ""shipped out.""

From what I can see nothing of value was taken or touched.

There are some little holes around it from either the dog chewing on it(pit bull type) or the cat popping her claws on it


It’s just suspicious that it is such a perfectly cut rectangle shape.

Even more so that at the bottom of the hole, the “slice” in the material still on the couch extends slightly past the hole it’s self. This indicates to me that it was cut, rather than ripped off my the dog.


There was some stuffing pulled out on the floor, but I do believe 100% that was our animals as BOTH of thems favorite toys are stuffed animals because they like pulling the stuffing/fluff out from inside.


There are no teeth parks/poked holes in the strip that’s been removed from the couch.

206,"Hello! I was looking to complete a summer internship/co-op this year for experience before my senior year in college. I had a few interviews with places that offered experience in corporate finance and investments, which is what I’m going to school for. However, with everything going on with COVID-19, most opportunities cut positions, cut the programs, or just never got back to me. It’s been really defeating. I’ve gotten 1 internship offer: A retail banking position. Basically, I’ll be doing customer service and counting cash and coin. Here’s the thing, it’s going to give me any relevant experience. On top of that, pay is only $11/HR (which is minimum wage in my state), when most real finance internships in my location are $15/HR or more. The only benefit I see from this is that I add something new to my resume, and I say I worked at a bank, just without the wrong experience.
The other option I have is keep getting unemployment. While it sounds lazy, I am currently making DOUBLE off of unemployment than I would at the internship, with possibly no end in sight if Congress passes a new relief bill. So I don’t really know what I should do. Working will get me out of the house, maybe meet new people, and will let future employers know I worked at a financial institution, but it’s not relevant experience, I’ll have to spend money on gas/food, and I’ll make more than $5,000 more getting money from the government than I would working.",18May2020,1

209,"Hello. 

This is going to be a long post, and it's probably going to be very rambly, so please hang in there. 

To begin, I'm 16. My state has no legal emancipation laws. I struggle with mental health on a daily basis,  and I feel lost. I'm beginning to feel really hopeless, like there's no way out of this. 

My parents both have what I believe to be narcissistic tendencies. When I was little, they used to fight a lot with each other, full on screaming and yelling. If it wasn't with each other, it was with my sister or me. 

When I was five, I was in ballet. I was being silly during a rehearsal in front of all the parents, so I was making faces during the dance and after a while I didn't like the way one of the older folks were looking at me, for some reason it made me really upset so I didn't dance from that point on. It was stupid, and it was wrong, but my parents' reactions were unreasonable.

After getting back to the car, I remember my father screaming at me, asking me if I wanted to be a, ""Fucking clown,"" and if I'd rather go off to clown college. They were angry I had embarrassed them, so they screamed at me on the way home. 

Around the same age, when my sister and I shared a room, we weren't the best at keeping it picked up. In order to teach us to pick up our room, (which had already been messy,) my mother trashed it more and walked in, telling us to pick it up and yelling at me and my sister. 

As I got older, these patterns of behavior continued. My parents would fight with each other, scream at each other, sometimes even in the middle of the night on the phone. My mother has this pattern where she says something to aggravate someone, and then teases them for their reactions. When someone gets genuinely upset, she plays the victim and calls them 'sensitive,' and makes a big deal of how the other person is in the wrong. At the end of it, she'll try to get an apology from whoever she's fighting with.

My father sometimes blows up. When my sister and I were seven, she threw a lot of fits. Of course, instead of trying to understand her feelings and explain to her in a calm way what she could do to manage her feelings, they would yell at her in return. There was this one night my father made a big, elaborate way to teach her why lying was bad, (She lied a lot when she was younger,) through yelling and mocking her. He eventually said, ""Well, guess what? I love you too,"" in a sarcastic manner, and she cried herself to sleep. 

I've witnessed this kind of behavior time and time again. 

I tried confronting my mother about her emotional and verbal abuse, and she's always told me the same thing. I'm the only one who has an issue with it. It's my fault I feel this way. I have no right to have the feelings I do, because she had it worse when she was a child. 

My parents have also physically hurt my siblings and my dog. I never instigate fights, so I never got hit, but I still had nightmares that they would hurt me, beat me, or kill me if I stepped out of line. 

My mom hit my sister once in supposed 'self defense,' (technically it was because she believed my sister was going to hit her,) and she also hit my brother when it clearly *wasn't* self defense and cried and played the victim about it. 

My dad smashed the family dog's face into the floor twice after she broke a few ornaments off the Christmas tree. He also hit her in the ribs after she peed on the basement floor. Nothing has happened since, and maybe I'm being a little 'sensitive,' but I can't. 

I can't stay here anymore. 

I want to leave, I've told my grandmother about some of this and I've asked my grandparents about staying with them. They said it's an option, but I still need to get my license (I'm behind,) so I have to live here for at least a couple more months and even then there's no legal process that could allow me to leave home. If they don't consent to it, they could report me as a runaway teen and I might be returned home; if they did, I wouldn't want to get my grandparents involved in anything like that. I'm thinking it would be better for everyone if I just disappeared and ran away quietly, but I wouldn't know how to live on my own if I were on the streets. 

I've thought of just leaving, living on my own, but I know it's impractical. I still need a license and even if I had a job, not many places, (if any,) rent out to minors. The law states that I need a legal adult to co-own a bank account with me, so my parents could literally just withdraw all my funds if I left and I'd be left without money. I know the pandemic makes things more difficult, too. For now, I'm thinking I could work on getting my license, (I already am,) while maintaining a job under my parent's knowledge, but the issue then would be the same. They have access to my bank account, so if I tried to leave or withdraw cash (which I don't think I legally can,) they could just withhold all the money. 

I don't think they'd willingly allow me to leave, but if they did I know that my grandparents have a lot on their plates and I don't want to burden them with my presence, but I also don't know what option is left. 

I can, 1) Run away and be homeless, and be reported as a runaway kid, 

I can 2) Live with my grandparents, (if my parents 'allowed' it,) at their expense, or

I can 3) Wait it out roughly another two miserable years. 

I don't know if it's worth it anymore. I don't know if any of this is worth it anymore. I just need help.",18May2020,1
210,"**TL;DR** I am a digital marketer for a start up who is freaking busy with work. We have different sites with different business models and different social media accounts.

Well, we just launched another site that's connected to our company with different branding, but with that comes all the stuff I've mentioned above but double time because the two sites cater to different audiences completely... I AM SWAMPED.

The founder of the company has been understanding and offered for his wife to help me with the social media stuff. She is helpful and enjoys social media so I figured sure why not she will have fun anyway.

211,"I started my current role as a health related project coordinator in NYC back in sept. I had my reservations starting this job because of the many, consistent negative reviews on Glassdoor but had no other job offers at the time (I had just graduated so hadn’t been working ft).

In March everyone was furloughed because of the virus, so I applied to other health related jobs in the meantime. The past week my job opened back up &amp; had us start working again &amp; the day after I got accepted for a contact tracer position to help with the virus. 

The contact tracer is broken into two levels - lvl 1 is a remote call center type position &amp; pays 57k; lvl 2 pays 62k but involves going out in the community and interacting with people who may have been in contact with the virus. Both levels are temporary (but since the virus will be around for awhile, I imagine this job lasting at least another 10-12mo).  

The pros of my current job is that it’s “stable” (Altho I’ve had a handful of incidences there that have shown me that it’s not rly stable, including being paid late 2x,  an audit into company finances, an eviction notice for our center, and obviously the furlough); other pros include good coworkers, a 401k, &amp; that I’m already back at work. Cons = toxic work environment w management, no room for growth, and pays the least.

Pros of the contact tracing: both levels pay more, has great health insurance, I’d be working for the city gov (which is something I’ve been wanting to get I to) which may lead to a foot in the door for other gov positions, no fieldwork if I do lvl 1, and it’s a unionized position 

Cons: the potential for fieldwork if I take the lvl 2 position; it’s temporary, may or may not offer much for new skills, &amp; no benefits outside health insurance

Is it better to take a chance and do something different &amp; leave my toxic workplace, or stick it out there and keep looking elsewhere? I think my biggest concern is that the contact tracing is temporary but I also dunno how long I can keep working at my current job either",18May2020,1

214," Thanks for opening this post.

Normally this age gap wouldn’t bug me, but there’s a few other things that need to be added to the story.

So a month ago I ended things with my ex. That was fine, I’m doing ok. My ex didn’t take things as well, and rebounded to a different guy.

I was debating making this post because I didn’t want to seem like the ‘jealous ex’, but I legitimately think this man is dangerous so I wanted to hear other opinions. Essentially, when she was in high school (17 at the time), she met up with this man through their church (he was 26 at the time) and they started hooking up. Note: he was her youth group leader. When I learned about this I found the situation odd because it seemed like he was using someone significantly younger than him for sexual gain while he was in a position of power. However, I didn’t know about this until college started, which was when we started dating.

He would occasionally message her throughout college and it would kind of mess with me but she agreed that because it bothered me, she would stop. We dated for roughly 1.5 years before we split. During this time, the man got transferred to a church in Georgia, and got removed for having sexual relations with another member of that church which ended up causing an affair. He ended up back near her. I believe he is working with that church again.

I started talking to her again last week to see how she was doing and I found out that she was seeing this guy again. My initial reaction was shock. She had told me that she found the power dynamic creepy after the fact. I am kinda worried for her because I know she was in a bad state after the break up, and I am worried that he is using her bad emotional state to manipulate her.

Am I being crazy? I’m just trying to look out for her own well-being. Any thoughts? Thanks.",18May2020,1

224,"This is my first post. I'm not good at explaining things so I'll try my best. Sorry if it's a bit all over the place and more of a rant/venting secession but I don't know what to do. 
Also I'm on mobile. 

Some backstory: my dad and his ex were only together a few months before he moved into her house. About a year or so later they broke up and he moved out. They remain friends but she did seem very controlling so that comes into play here. 
Also, he is a diabetic I believe type 2.
I don't talk to him very often because he moved kind of far away. I don't want to speak badly of him but I think it might matter in this case. He has treated my mom poorly (I could go on and on about this because there's a lot of things he's done/said but I digress) and doesn't talk to his family. He could, he just doesn't want to or try. But I know he loves my sister and I and we love him. Even though he never asks to see my sisters kids. However, since my mom and I moved out of the house we lived in with him, he doesn't really communicate with me much. And cut off communication with my mom. I wish it wasn't like this. Since he has moved though, I get basically weekly texts from him asking how we are. He's lonely.

Onto the situation. 
My dad went to the hospital on Friday. He told us he was having chest pains for months but he thought it was just from him going on daily long walk with his/our dog. Well turns out they were small heart attacks so he was transferred to another hospital. Later that night I asked him about the dog. He said his ex has her and she's the one who brought him to the hospital. 

The next day he had a catheter procedure thing because they wanted to put stents in his clogged arteries. So after that his ex called on his phone and told me he needed quadruple bypass surgery. I briefly spoke to my dad because he was out of it. My sister and I told him we're heading to the hospital and we messaged our aunt on fb, which we haven't spoken to her or my uncle (dads brother) since our grandma passed 3 years ago, about what was going on. She told us they knew and my uncle was at the hospital because his ex called them. So because of the pandemic only one person a day can visit him. We didn't know that until we arrived at the hospital yesterday and they informed us. His ex had already been there and his brother. They only let his brother in because he is a pastor. We told him this but he wasn't answering. Just after we left the hospital yesterday my aunt called my sister, after my sister had texted her we weren't allowed in, and she said his ex told her she would be the one there the day of the surgery and would keep us updated. Wtf this was never discussed so we were shocked to say the least. I tried calling my dad but no answer.

Came home and told my mom and she was, like us, angry and confused. Later she talked to my aunt about the situation and my aunt suggested maybe having my uncle talk to the ex. But she texted my mom after talking with him and he didn't want to get in the middle of it. 

So today, she went there again knowing we couldn't go if someone already had. Didn't ask if we were going/wanting to see him. (What a bitch but as I said she's controlling) My dad called me and was pretty adamant on her being there because she's a retired surgical nurse and can keep us better informed. I tried explaining that we thought one of us should be there but he just said I know you're my daughters but ex knows about this stuff, knows what to ask ect ect. And said we would be waiting in the parking lot in the car and she'd give us updates. I tried to get him to talk to my mom he said he didn't want to. I tried again and I think I heard his ex the background say no so I said (he had me speaker) I want to talk to you alone. She left and I said I heard her say no and he says she didn't but I don't know for sure. He just kept saying how it would be better for her to be there. I then asked about what the doctors said about his condition because he didn't tell us much. He said it is very serious and they said he had a small heart attack probably a few years ago and it damaged his heart and because all the arteries are clogged he shouldn't be alive. He said it's a high risk surgery and keeping blood sugar in control after surgery is difficult and given the damage from the attacks it doesn't look good. At this point, I start to cry. I try to hide as he explains they told him to get his affairs on order. I know they do this for all surgeries but it still scared me. He doesn't have a will or anything but said his assets will be going to us and our half-brother. To whom he never talks to but that's not our brothers fault though. I have no problem with him sharing any inheritance if god forbid something happens to our dad. He goes to say about if he dies he wants to be cremated ect ect. I cry a bit harder and I said I love him. I don't really hear what he's saying at that point because I'm trying to control my tears. I'm sure he could hear it at that point because he almost immediately says he had to go and I could hear his voice crack and start to cry. Then he hung up. He, like me, doesn't do well with emotions. I just went to my room and cry. 

I don't want to fight with him about it nor do I want my sister to. It will only make things worse and I don't want to stress/upset him more than he already is before he has major surgery. I told my mom and sister this. It what he wants. I think it's also because he's afraid something will happen and doesn't want us to be there for it. But also because of his ex's controlling ways. I just don't know what to do. I'm concerned she will go to the hospital before we can get there and we won't get to see him much. The recovery for this surgery is 6-12 weeks. I think she might try to get him to stay with her while recovering. Which will lead to her telling us when we can and can't see him. I don't think she's a mean person but this is ridiculous. Should she be there instead of one of us because she knows more? I do not want her to be the one to tell us if the worst happens. His surgery is tomorrow. I don't want to upset him more. I don't want anymore stress on him or us during time already extremely difficult time. But my sister is furious and I'm trying to reason with her. This all happened so fast and I don't know what to do.  Is his ex trying to control the whole situation? I want to be able to see my dad after surgery but I don't think that's going to happen... 

Sorry if this is a lot or hard to understand. I'm very stressed and upset.

Nothing happened, besides some cuddling. Recently told me that he wants to play an online game with her long distance, just the two of them, and for 6 hours, ending at 2:00 am. I told him that I'm uncomfortable with that, because of the history and the idea of him staying awake late into the night alone with another girl on a call. He says he wants me to feel comfortable, but doesn't really understand my concern very much. I asked for him to end at midnight and call me to make me feel better, and he was hesitant and said yes but wants another compromise.

229,"I'm currently only 19 and I'm not one to resort to this sort of thing however I'm having a bit of an issue as far as work and study goes. I'm currently employed full time, working 38-40 hours a week and make just enough to keep up on expenses. I have no debts, but my insurance is through the roof, vehicle registration is getting pricier and living expenses are going up steadily. I'm able to make little savings, but not enough to make a huge impact into my life.  


I'm looking to enroll into completing my Diploma in Business and I cannot apply for any form of student loan (or HECS) due to my employment status, my only choice is to pay it out through the colleges' internal payments system which will leave me somewhat financially stressed. I can make the repayments however that will not leave me with a whole lot at the end of the week.   


The study courses I need to complete the DiP are a recommended 28 hours for the Diploma and supporting courses have a recommendation of 30 hours combined to complete within the 2 year period, if it's not completed I fail and have to pay forward all fee costs and start again. I'm unsure as to whether I'm able to keep my full time job in order to pay my expenses and still study a full 58 hours a week. I have no doubt, based on my last attainment that I will manage to finish the study week in less time, just more so the worry about supporting myself emotionally and mentally through it.  


Should I look at holding off on formal education until I know I can be in affordance of the training without putting myself in financial stress or should I go for it and get my education sorted out first thing? It is, in a sense the investment of my future. It's more so as to when I should seek to take the route I want to in order to achieve what I need earlier on in life.

and me and this other girl have been talking a lot and i have feelings for her and i think she still likes me. but, i’m almost certain my friend likes her. and it wouldn’t be cool if i dated my friends crush and she introduced me to her. like that would be absolutely terrible.

232,"For those who may not be aware, you should not call the drink consisting of Guinness into which one drops a shot of half Baileys Irish Cream and half Irish Whiskey an ""Irish Carbomb"". It's a very offensive reference to events in recent memory (most Irish over 30 or so will remember them) where domestic violence claimed the lives of many people. It's like going into a bar in New York City and ordering a ""Tipsy Trade Center"" or to one in Columbine, CO and ordering a ""School Shooter"". You'd expect the people there to be very upset. It's the same with Irish people and calling the drink a ""Carbomb"".

Question is: what to call the drink instead? I'm a bartender in a college campus ""Irish Pub"", and so people do come in and order these. It's not as though the combination of drinks is offensive in and of itself. It's just the name that's problematic. I'm not looking to scold them, but if there were some other name I could recommend people use that would be great.

So, I guess I have two questions:

1. What should the drink be called instead of the current offensive term?
2. As a tipped worker and an employee who has a duty to be nice to the patrons, how should I word a suggestion that the patron avoid using the offensive name?",18May2020,1

234,"I've always had a good relationship with my mom in the sense that we get along well and I know that she is always there for me. That being said, I am a 34 year old woman and I can't handle her mothering me anymore. I am looking to have an actual relationship with my mom. I have been living on my own since I was 18, I have been with my husband for 13 years, married for 4, I have my own business, I have my own savings, I'm ready to have children (finally) and I think it's safe to say that I have been a self sufficient adult for a long time.  


My mom however still treats me like a child and I am no longer interested in having that sort of relationship with her. I am not looking for advice of ""moms will always be moms."" I want to have a GOOD relationship with my mom for a long time, and to me that means having a predominately peer to peer relationship. She can't have a conversation with me that has any real depth or meaning in the way that she can with her friends. Which means our conversations are mainly about logistics, if I took care of this or that, and the weather. Every now and then we'll have a normal adult conversation about a topic that's not child/parent related, but it's like she doesn't know how to do it.

235,"I'm desperate here, please help me. I'm 19 and have been with my boyfriend (21) for almost a year now. We're long distance, originally met online, so of course trust is a key component to making it work. 

He's always been a really confident and social person, and occasionally talks to other girls online. That's how we met, and I'm well aware he strictly just wants to make friends, so I've always tried to ignore my jealousy issues and be okay with it.

I'm a VERY insecure person. My boyfriend befriended another online girl a couple months ago and we had multiple fights about her. He described her as super special and it really hurt my feelings. I tried expressing how upset I was and it took him months to understand and resolve the issue. 

We've been really good the past couple weeks until tonight. He's thinking about adopting a dog and messaged some random girl, who he's mentioned once before, on Instagram. Apparently she lives in his area and follows him through mutual friends, and he's seen her around his town a couple times but claims they've never talked in person. Apparently this girl he messaged adopted 2 dogs and always posts pictures of them. So instead of googling dog shelters, he decides to message this random girl and ask for dog adoption advice. I immediately was jealous and was like ""why are you messaging this random girl when you could just google it?"" I figured he wanted to use it as an excuse to talk with her or make friends or something. Again, he's quite a social person, especially with females. And she's pretty and it seems like they would have common interests.

I do agree that I was overreacting, but sometimes it's hard to trust my own boyfriend. There's been a couple instances in the past where I've had trouble trusting him. On top of that, I'm an insecure person and I get super jealous when he even talks to other girls. He's the only person I have in my life that truly cares about me and I'm really scared of him leaving.

Any advice?",18May2020,1

242,"****I'm writing this on mobile. Sorry for any mistakes or formatting.****

I'm 17 M, I should theoretically be almost, if not, at my prime. Being in quarantine, I've been trying to make the best of my time. I've started running about 2 miles everyday with my dog, which also consists of a mile walk to the road to run and a mile walk back. I also have started doing daily ab workouts to coincide with my mostly daily regular workouts (biceps, triceps, chest, legs, back, and shoulders). Alongside this, I try to do meditation/stretches - this may be classified as yoga now that I think of it - as well. As for the rest of my day, I have been doing schoolwork and studying for my 4 ap tests. With the remainder of my day, much of it is taken up by chores, the daily basics, and the occasional freetime where I try to learn more about space and constellations (it's becoming a hobby), a small amount of social media time (maybe 40ish minutes, which personally, I think is quite little for a teenager in quarantine), and watching a couple episodes of anime before bed.

However, this routine has been exhausting me. With my workouts and run I've been increasingly tired and finding trouble eating enough; this is becoming an increasing cycle. Not only this, but with my studying and homework, I don't have much freetime to do much else. I have taken a semi-break from the physical aspect a couple weeks ago when I moved houses, got stitches in my lip, and got a foot injury. But since then, I've healed, moved, and resumed my regular schedule. I'm starting to think that perhaps I should take a step back. This evening when I was completing my ab workout, I found myself throwing up in my mouth and getting light headed. I've been very tired, nearly falling asleep standing up, which makes going to bed easier, but doesn't help when studying or doing school work. Essentially, I believe I'm overworking myself. This is frustrating because at the young age of 17, I should be doing the most, right? 

Anyways, I didn't want to make this post because I felt I lacked the time, but I also believe its best if I received some outside advice and wrote down my feelings and experiences. Does anyone have some advice on how to better manage my time or spread things out?

249,"Hi all,
I'm on the fence about an internship I've been offered. I (25F) currently live in NJ with my family, but I've been offered an internship in rural Texas. It's an animal care position, about 2 hours out of Dallas, lasting anywhere from 3-6 months (I can stay an additional 3 months after the first 3 if I desire). I was excited to accept, but then COVID happened. I'm worried about travelling and the living situation. The facility will be hiring up to 7 other interns for the summer, and we would all be living in one house. It'll be tight quarters, and I'm sure other interns will have to travel/fly to get there too. The welcome email I recieved also said the interns do most of their shopping at a Walmart, which I'm not too thrilled about.

Normally I'd be ecstatic about doing what I love and living away from home, but I have this horrible vision of all the interns coming down with the virus. I'd be very far from home, in a tiny town where the closest hospital is at least 10 miles away. So far, my friends and family say I should go, but I'm still not 100% sure of what to do. I am not immunocompromised, but of course I'm still worried. Any thoughts?",18May2020,1
250,"Basically what the title reads. I am 15 and it feels like my childhood is almost gone and in no time I am going to be a 9 to 5 drone without any social life and no identity. I feel like most, if not, part, of my childhood was maybe ruined by my parents. I knows it’s a big accusation and they probably have a reason for the stuff they do, but hear me out:
My family lives in Connecticut in the sticks. We don’t have WiFi and have to use our neighbors just to watch a comedy video on YouTube. My dad “makes” me work in his business for “points”. A little context here, by “makes”, I mean he tells me to do it and I do it, because I don’t want to get him angry ands it normally ends up in someone crying or something broken. And by points I mean he doesn’t pay me in cash as he feels I will spend on something frivolous, which is a good reason, but I am pretty responsible and I save every penny. When I go out on job sites, I get paid $5 an hour. No harm there, the work is fun, but I never actually get money in hand, which kind of ticks me off. Next on the list in the no Wi-Fi situation. We have one computer in the whole house and it taken up 99% of the time for the family business (septic, sewer and drain water). We don’t have a webcam or mic on our computer so our Zoom chats with our classmates are useless and embarrassing (more on this later). My dads reasoning is that me and my brother (17 yrs old) will be on it all the time. (Not true as I have plenty of hobbies like Chess, Reading, Art, Music, YT). 

I was in public school up until 7th grade when my parents decided to homeschool me. When people hear that I am homeschooled they say “Good for you” and “Homeschooling is great”, which in theory it is, but not for me. I hate homeschooling because my mom is always too busy to help either of us with our work and my brother never does any work. (He is a senior in high school and can’t spell for crap or do algebra or anything) For my brother I am not really worried as he is a genius with mechanical stuff so he had a future more or less and homeschooling seems to help him a lot. For me though, I need a social connection to people and having 0 friends with homeschooling makes me feel, you know, shut out from all of life’s adventures. Having no mic or webcam on our Zoom meetings was super embarrassing and just shows how behind the times we are. I want to talk to my dad about going to public school but I can never seem to work up the nerve because I am scared of getting him angry. He isn’t abusive physically, but he is a complete monster when he is pissed. I also want to play high school football, but being 5’4” 115 lbs, it would be a challenge but I at least want to try. 

Now let’s get to my dad. He is nice and all, but he is a complete loon, which I mean both nice and sad at the same time. He is self-made, which is why he is no nonsense, completely fine. He gets angry a lot and says a lot of stuff he shouldn’t. If you have ever seen Dukes of Hazzard, he is Sheev. He is so paranoid about outsiders and stuff that he won’t even let us have a tag sale to get rid of some of the crap in our house (more on THIS later) because he is scared people will look at his machines and stuff. 

Last thing I want to talk about is our house. My dad and his mother never cleaned when my mom moved in with him, as she said there was a 1/4 inch of grime on the floors and his white curtains were grey and the windows were all dirty. I try to clean the house as best I can, but every time I clean something it gets dirty in a day because people are messy and my dads’ employees walk through the house and get everything dirty. We literally have stuff piled up everywhere and it looks like a hoarders wet dream. The outside of our house looks worse. We have garbage everywhere and it looks like our yard is a junkyard. I feel like I am trapped here and there is nothing I can do.
I am trying to take matters in my own hands by working my ass off every day (almost every day it’s all in vain) and trying to make this house and my life better, but it never seems to work. I have started to eat healthy and work out, and wake up at 5:30am and go to bed at 8pm and get my life on track to a degree.

In summary, I feel like I am going to grow up to be a typical homeschooled kid, a shut-in who has 0 real world experience, 0 people skills and 0 childhood memories (the only memory I can remember from more than 5 years back is my mom screaming at me because I accidentally let the dog outside). I want to go to college but my parents say it is a waste (maybe it is academically, but I don’t know). I just can’t live with this anymore, every day I wake up and say “it’s gonna get better, just deal with it” and it never does, I have no more options besides suicide. I am not joking, either, at times I literally feel one step away from taking my life.

I moved to a new city right before lockdown and live alone while they all live with friends or family. I know they all have their own problems. I try not to bother them too much but have been needing them more right now and am starting to have a really hard time being alone through this. We zoomed once about a month ago and I asked to do it again a few times, finally we did again yesterday but it didn't last long and only 2 of my friends showed up. I know one of them feels similarly and is always happy to talk. But the others are always somehow busy. It makes me feel like I'm not worth making the time or effort for.

Maybe it's unfair but it's starting to make me feel pretty hurt. I don't think I'm asking for much, I just want to spend some time with them occassionally. Never voicing these feelings makes me feel totally alone so I want to bring it up but am not sure how to word it without sounding accusatory.",18May2020,1

253,"Growing up i was always sexually assaulted and abused, by family members, friends, seemed as if almost everyone. For years i made myself either forget for some cases, or make myself believe that i wanted it. I was 5-12. I have struggled with opening up about my past because it hurts, and i can not face it. My freshman year of high school is when i completly broke down, everything just resurfaced, all at once. i scrubbed lysol wipes on every inch of my body because i wanted to get the feeling of their hands off of me. i just cried and rubbed until i found a razor and just slashed my thigh several times. i carried and still carry these memories and secrets with me everyday. i still cry at night knowing that my body was tossed around before i even got the chance to know it. my past has made it difficult to love myself and allow myself to be loved.

Today, my youngest sister told me that our half brother used to rape her. no better ways to put it. he would rape her, perform oral sex, lay on top of her, grope her, everything. when she told me i cried, and i held her. she did not seem bothered by what she told me, but i knew inside it hurt like hell. i love my little sister a lot. but i don’t know how to help her. i don’t know what to do. i can’t tell my mom because she doesn’t want her to know. i don’t know where to turn. i just want her to be okay, i don’t want her to reach her breaking point like i did. i can’t bear the thought of her crying for hours and self harming. i’m only 17, i have my past that i have not dealt with so i don’t even know where to start. i don’t want to force her to open up about it more because i know how awkward and horrible that feels. i just want to make sure she’s okay. i just want to help her. so please, please if anyone can point me in the slightest direction.

254,"I am 15, I still have roughly 3 years to chose what to study in university, but I have just come to the realization that I am not so sure as I previously seemed to be. Ever since I was around 10, I decided that I wanted to study physics. But, now it is not so obvious to me anymore, I have many interests beyond physics, primarily art, philosophy and history. I have an unprecedented amount of uncertainty regarding what to prioritize, I feel as if I am going astray, and might ultimately get to far from what I want to study, making the later unfeasible. I mean, I am good at physics, and I love it, but I have never been the best at math, or the most disciplined, I am not sure if the stress and effort that physics requires is going to make me happy. I don't know if I am even capable of going through a physics degree, or even being accepted into one. I don't know what I enjoy the most, and that is really the only thing I put in question, I don't care about the money all that much, out  of all of the fields I have mentioned, they would provide enough. I really enjoy philosophy too, I often find myself reading Camus or Nietzsche, or just pacing in my room for hours on end, thinking about metaphysics or aesthetics. I love history too, specially 15th century Europe, or the industrial revolution, though I don't see myself studying history, out of the four I have mentioned, it is the least enjoyable to me. Art is another subject I love, I draw a lot with ink, and paint once or twice a month, though it is not enough on its own, I would have to mix it with another discipline. I mean I could double major on something like art and philosophy. I also know that I would like to emigrate to somewhere in Europe, I live in Colombia, and am in the process of getting a Portuguese citizenship due to my direct lineage, if it all goes well I could study relatively cheaply anywhere in the European union, if that doesn't work, I could easily afford the best universities in Colombia. I would not like to study in the U.S, I am not a fan of their educational system. What I want out of life is to be free, that value I hold fundamentally, I would like to live somewhere in Europe, and travel more often than not, I do not want to focus entirely on my job, or my education, I want a life outside of that. I suppose my biggest worry is that studying physics would not allow me to live a life where I am partly free from my job, I want the least responsibility possible, I want to enjoy culture and knowledge, no matter what I end up study, I know for sure that I would not want to leave those other fields behind. I am leaning towards doing a double major in art and physics, but again I am afraid that the added stress will make me unhappy. I suppose that I ought to focus on the present, and bumping my grades up, since they are not the greatest, after all that is what Camus would have said, but I feel like I need some broad sense of direction of what will be with my life.

255,"I’ve 22f been talking to 22m for about two years. Off and on but mostly on. You could call it a fwb situation. 
I like him a lot. I’m pretty sure that I love him. About a year ago I told him that I wanted more and he said he did not want to be in a relationship but he’d essentially do whatever I wanted. He cooks me food. Brings me little gifts. We spend time together that doesn’t involve sex. He still lives at home. And he said a relationship with me would be something he’d want to devote a lot of energy into and he’s not in a place where he can do that right now. 
I decided that this was ok because I have other people I talk to. I’ve had sex with other people. Other people have expressed a desire to be in a relationship with me and I’ve declined. 
Mostly due to the fact that I don’t feel ready for a relationship and that I compare him to everyone I date. 
But if he asked me to be his girlfriend I’m very certain that I would say yes in a heartbeat. 
But I sometimes wonder if this is incredibly unhealthy for me.

263,"backstory: I'm f16, my brother is m23. hes been living with us for a few years, since he moved out of his dads house. my brother is a freeloader who manipulates my mom into letting him stay. 

he used to tell my mom that no one cares about his mental health so he could get out of working and so she'll house him. 

hes attempted s*icide a few times in the past, and knows my moms afraid she'll find him dead in his room one day. he uses that to get what he wants. 

he doesn't have to pay bills, he doesn't contribute to anything. he doesn't clean, he will literally watch you put the dishes in the dishwasher and then put his dish in the sink. he has to be first to get dinner, and stands there near the food eating obnoxiously loud. he only drinks milk, multiple glasses a day, so we buy a new gallon or 2 every single day. he buys the chocolate syrup for the milk but that's it. 

all he does is work, smoke weed, and loudly call his friends/play xbox. him smoking gives me migraines because his room is right across from mine. 

I recently had oral surgery, and I couldnt mention the medication they gave me around him because he has a past of drug abuse too. he would down multiple bottles of robitussin and be higher than a kite. he would ask my sister for her prescription pain pills and she would refuse, he would get mad and storm off. he would drink an entire bottle of wine in my room, or get so drunk hes vomiting everywhere. 

he wont get professional help for his illness, but he complains how no one cares for his mental health and how working effects his mental health. he was also convinced by a patient in the hospital he was in that he could get disability, even though hes physically fine.

I've asked my therapist what to do, and she said talk to my parents about my concerns. but my mom refused to listen to anything we have to say about him up until recently. the only reason she listens now is because her grandkids (they're not his kids) and dogs are receiving his attitude and entitlement. but she wont ever kick him out. 

my dad is his step dad, so he really has no say. hes been kicked out once for physically harming our younger brother, but my mom let him back in because his dad made him do chores and (possibly, I dont remember) a s*icide attempt.

I'm getting fed up with his behavior and I dont know what to do. he has attitude with everyone recently. I cant go to my parents when I'm feeling s*icidal or when my mental health is being affected because he uses that card too much. I'm getting worse because my moms afraid to give him consequences for his actions because she doesn't want to find him dead.

264,"Hey reddit. 

I’m on mobile and this my first post, so here’s an obligatory apology on my part. Sorry if I’m doing this wrong. 

I have a past history of being sexually abused and due to that, I have PTSD. Usually I’m able to cope pretty well, but lately things have been rough. I’m living with family, and they’ve made fast friends with a convicted sex offender. I won’t go into what his offenses were, but they were very similar to what had happened to me (some of them even worse) and that fact has become triggering to me. I avoid him as much as possible, but have to share a bathroom and sleep just a few doors down since he stays here for extended periods of time when he visits. 

I’m not sure that I’m necessarily afraid he’ll do anything, but every time I see him I just feel like I’m looking at the people hurt me. I have panic attacks when I know he’s going to show up, but sometimes my family doesn’t even tell me when he’s coming.

273,"I guess I'd like to preface this post with a trigger warning for sexual assault.

So I (20F) didn't know quite where to post this, originally I was thinking about r/DreamInterpretation but I felt like I kinda know what the dreams mean and I just wanted advice from people on if I should maybe consult a professional to help me with this or if anyone had any other steps they think I could take.

So the last 2 nights I've been having dreams about unwanted touching from men which I think could be classified as sexual assault. The first one was the night before last and I don't remember the context too well but I remember that an older man (maybe 30s/early 40s) stood behind me and grabbed my hips and kept me in place for a bit while his back was pressed to me and he squeezed my hips. The second one was my dream last night where a (fictional) professor at my university was telling me about his department and course as I was going to be taking his class and towards the end of the discussion he held my thigh and grabbed my hands (he wouldn't let me go). It didn't go beyond that and in the dream afterwards I felt really gross and just sought comfort from my boyfriend but didn't tell him what happened. I'm pretty sure in the other dream I moved on from the groping incident much quicker.

For context I've had 3 incidents that could possibly be why I have these dreams happen to me since October last year.

The first of which being at a party my boyfriend and his friend from high school had at said friend's house. A lot of their friends from high school came to this party and they all seemed fine, none of them were creepy or anything, but mostly it was our close friends from college who attended. Much later on in the night (the very end of the party) I was very drunk and my boyfriend led me to his friend's bedroom to lie down while he was getting everyone to leave. One of his friends from home (not the one who owned the apartment) was also passed out on the bed. I don't know how much later it was but my boyfriend came back to wake us up so we could also head home and I don't have the clearest memory of this but from what he told me later his friend woke up and started touching me. I remember being touched and it was like the front of my body (stomach and breasts) as well as my waist a bit. My boyfriend got him off immediately and was apparently very angry but after that we went home in separate Ubers and my boyfriend put me to sleep in my apartment and stayed the night. I forgot about it by the next morning but my boyfriend talked to me about it and honestly at first I didn't think it was that bad. I thought his friend was just drunk and had maybe mistaken me for someone else or was trying to help me up or something but after talking to more friends about it (specifically people who don't know my boyfriend or his friends well) I think I've come to realise it was probably assault. It put a definite strain on my boyfriend's friendship with his friend and also some of his other friends from home, 1) because when he confronted the friend about it he initially brushed it off since he blacked and couldn't remember it (""That doesn't sound like me"") and 2) because my boyfriend didn't attend a friend meet up when he went home for Thanksgiving. He went home for winter too and hung out with them all that time and specifically the friend told him he wanted to apologise to me but didn't know how. I don't think about it much except when the friend is suggested to me on social media. I don't know the extent to which my boyfriend has reconnected with that specific friend other than that they are in group chats together with other friends from home.

The other two are less complicated. In November or December I had a 1 on 1 office hours meeting with a trusted professor. He's in his 60s or 70s I think. At some point he showed me a sculpture of a female saint (my project we were discussing was about a different female saint) and said something along the lines of ""doesn't it look like she's orgasming?"" and told me he thought of me when he had come across it. He also briefly put a hand on my bare thigh during this meeting and touched my shoulder.

And then in February I was working on a student film set and while I was getting food at the snack table a guy from the camera department walked behind me while no one else was around and got very close to being pressed up behind me when there was plenty of space behind him and around me and also touched my butt. He was gone very quickly after that. If it's important I think he's also younger than me as he is a freshman and I'm a sophomore. It was a situation where I wasn't sure if it was intentional but it made me uncomfortable (other than the touching of course) that we were alone when it happened and that he didn't apologise.

Both the last two incident I've spoken to my friends and boyfriend about so it's not like I'm keeping them to myself and bottling everything up. I hardly think about these instances but I will admit that thinking about the dreams and the real life incidents was very difficult for me to do and write about without crying. Even this morning when I was casually recounting the dream to my boyfriend over text I teared up. I guess I don't have a super specific question to ask but I would just like some advice on how I can cope with this. Maybe also if anyone has any more insight to the dreams than ""You were touched unconsensually and you didn't like it"" I'd be grateful to hear that too. You can also be super brutal and tell me if I'm overthinking things if you think that's the case!

TL;DR I've had 2 dreams about unwanted somewhat sexual touching by older men which I think could be linked to 3 real incidents of such touching that happened to me relatively recently. How do cope with this, what could the dreams mean, and am I overthinking it?",18May2020,1

279,"Today I (18f) quit my job of almost 2.5 years. This was my first job and I love a lot of things about it, but have come to dislike it more and more over the years. It's a small family restaurant, so there is constant drama and people yelling at each other. I get paid under minimum wage (and under the table), and the commute is almost 45 minutes every morning. I just don't enjoy my time there anymore and think it's time for a change.

Yesterday, I was talking with my coworker and good friend and flipped her off right as my boss's wife walked by. My boss's wife and I have always been close and talk about a lot and can joke with each other. I guess she thought that I had flipped her off but didn't say anything and seemed completely fine. I know it isn't much of a believable story that it wasn't aimed at her but it's what happened.

This morning I got a call from my boss saying that he didn't want me to come in for 2 weeks because I flipped her off. I tried to explain to him what really happened but he didn't let me get a single word in before he hung up.

I decided right then and there I was sick of working there, I already have another job opportunity lined up and this is a perfect time to put in my two weeks (I wasn't supposed to be there for two weeks anyway). I sent my boss's wife an apology, told her that it was not aimed at her, but that I would be putting in my two weeks today (she handles most of the scheduling and hiring things so she seemed like the right person to tell). I said if she doesn't want to see me I can have my coworker bring my key back and bring me my last paycheck. She said that she was happy to see me and I can bring my key back myself.

I really don't want to see them right now. It's very tense between the three of us and I feel like I left on kind of a bitter note. My question is, would it be rude if I were to ask my coworker to do these things for me anyway? I feel like it would be rude not to bring it myself and face them in person, but I don't think they want to see me and I really don't want to see them.",18May2020,1

Just today, I told my parents that I’m excited to go to college and leave home, not in a rude way you might think just hopeful to experience college life away from this bubble I’ve been trapped in here at home. I’ve never been allowed to date or go out with friends/parties. So as you can see I want to start “living” not just for the social aspect but I also want to pursue a career in health more specifically either nutrition/dietetics or medical research. When expressing my hopes for the future my mom tells my dad “she’s so excited to leave” and my dad replies with “Shes just a kid, she’s dumb right now and doesn’t know how the real world works. All the bills she’ll have to pay and how she’s going to have to get a job.” I said to him that I already know that that is going to happen but he said I’m being too naive. I plan to take full advantage of the resources available at the uni I attend to come out of it with a job/internship. I understand and hear that life after high school will be hard, but I meant to be optimistic about the future. I don’t understand why my dad feels the need to bring me down. I know he’s trying to make me aware of how hard the real world can be, but part of me is hurt that he doesn’t believe I can achieve much more than what they ever did or than what my older siblings did. Just a side note my mom never finishes college and my dad got his GED a few years ago as an adult to officially finish his high school education. In essence, I’m a first generation latina student currently living in California in the U.S..

He then continues to make me feel even worse about wanting to grow up by saying, “Your older siblings already told you that once they move out it was hard for them. Why don’t you listen?” I consistently hear how “hard” it will be, but it more so feels so shitty that they can’t allow me to be happy or optimistic for the future. Like sorry I’m not a fucking pessimistic, I’ve worked my fucking ass off at school to make sure I have an actual chance at going to a good university. Also I’d like to include that none of my older siblings (3 of them) went to a 4 year university. Two of them went to community college and the other started working as a car mechanic. Of course going off that way with nothing would be hard but I’m not planning to take that route. I’m relying on the tuition that’ll pay for my rent, food, and classes. 

My point is, is it crazy of me to be excited to leave my family home? I already get that at some point growing up will be difficult. I know college academic life will be brutal but I’m fully willing to hassle through if it means I get to achieve my goals.",18May2020,1

283,"I recently (about a month ago) moved into a new apartment, it's my first one. It's a cheap one and you can hear the neighbors very easily. I am a very quiet person, mainly lay around on my bed all day with headphones on (quiet by the way).

Anyway, the neighbors always stomp. Sometimes it's when I'm doing something, sometimes I'm laying here quietly. I assumed they were dropping stuff or something else was happening. Wellll, I did start noticing a pattern. It happened more whenever I was in the kitchen. Whether I was opening the fridge, or turned the sink on (not even talking about dishes, just to wash my hands or something really quick), they would stomp. Okay, maybe I just noticed it more because I was right under where they spent most of their time (I don't think the upstairs apartment extends over my bedroom).

Fastforward to today, I am using the microwave at around 11pm. It was a last snack for tonight, and I was going to go to bed soon after (but now I'm still up at nearly 12:30 because of what happened). I don't let the end beep of the microwave go off, so the maximum they hear is the light beep of typing numbers in (only two by the way). The microwave came with the apartment. Apart from that, I made no noise. Well, the upstairs neighbor decides to start stomping like crazy and yelling at me to be quiet (and some other nonsense I couldn't make out because it was too muffled). I honestly rarely use the microwave this late, and have mainly been using the oven.

They have made a hell of a lot more noise than I have. My 2 microwave beeps do not compare to their stomping nearly all day long.

Right now I am unemployed, and am waiting to head back to work (as self-employed, my dad and I work together and we're just waiting for this to be over). I can't stand living with my dad though, and there aren't many options for apartments here, especially in the price range of this one, there are very rarely any ever. I also am in a long distance relationship, and I am the only one with an apartment. Basically I am very reliant on this apartment. But I'm close to breaking the lease. I'm sick of hearing the neighbors snore so loudly, I'm sick of smelling cigarette smoke in the bathroom, I'm sick of the three spiders I kill a day in here. I'm sick of the brown streaks the water leaves behind in the toilet and sink. I'm sick of hearing my neighbor cough constantly. I'm sick of hearing the dog playing with a toy that squeaks all day. I really am tempted to break my lease. But that would mean moving back to my dads house. It means my girlfriend can't stay with me. It means I probably can't get my own place again for a long while. I'm miserable both places, but moreso at my dads house. What do I do? Stay here or leave? Am I the asshole for using the microwave or cleaning my dishes? I mean, maybe I really am in the wrong. Can they give me a bed time or complain about me using a microwave that the landlord put in here? They really shouldn't be living in an apartment with neighbors if they want a silent apartment.",18May2020,1

285,"Hello, my names Ryan and I'm 17 and about to turn 18 in late June. I'll give you my whole sob story and I'll move on. So basically for my entire time in highschool I wanted to become an accountant. It was one of the things that I wasn't impulsive about. But now since the Cortana virus has canceled school for good and I'm not learning anything in my accounting class I've kinda lost the strive to become one. 

In all honestly, becoming an accountant was probably a stretch. I'm in no way a trouble maker or anything in school but I was really lazy about my grades, and I would usually get either C's or D's, sometimes B's and A's. I got an 810 on my Sats and never took the opportunity to retake them. So yeah I'm not the greatest at school, I like it, but I suck at it lol. 

So my most recent thoughts for a few weeks now are to join the Army. It's a big decision that I definitely need time to research about in terms of occupations and stuff like that. 

But heres my two problems. 1. I got excepted into a community college, and was given a grant, my dad says I should take advantage of the grant I received, and do general classes. The problem with that is that I don't really wanna goddamn do that, I just dont really have any interest in doing that. Also i dont wanna argue with my dad over it and shit. 

My second problem is my health. Now heres the thing, I'm a big kid. I'm 6,2 and weigh 223 pounds. I've gained about 20lbs since my last checkup which was in august. I want to become fitter. By the way I'm really sorry about how bad my sentence writing, I'm all over the place here. Anyway, I know how I can become healthier with a good diet and exercise. What I lack is self discipline. If there are any veterans or fitness people on here that can give some advice through own experience that would be extremely helpful. 

So basically I only really need advice about self discipline, but I can use some help on this whole grant community college thing to. Should I sit with my dad and talk to him about or just wait until I turn 18 and discuss it with him then?

If you have any questions feel free to ask I'll try to my best to answer them. 

Thank you.",18May2020,1

291,"Can't believe I've become desperate enough to ask for advice on Reddit, but I just need some outside views on my life right now. 

For years I've been trapped in my city. I had a bad relationship that sucked a lot out of me here, made me delay my studies for way too long. Got trapped in a bad business I couldn't get myself out of. Trapped by debt because of that. For the last 3 years I've been finally finishing my 1st degree. My plan since I was a child was to move overseas, to Italy, and I had planned to do that as soon as I graduate. Well, I'm about to graduate and only have a few thousand in the bank, no job prospects here or in Italy, and I guess covid-19 has made it kind of impossible for the next 6-12 months anyway.  
I find myself stuck again and again thinking ""I could be in Florence right now"" whenever I get to these points in my life, but always unable to go. Some nights I can't sleep, I have constant anxiety about how long it's going to keep taking, and honestly I feel like I am losing hope. I know it sounds cliche and dumb but I'm honest when I say that I don't feel at home here, I have only felt true happiness over there and I am really lost without being there.   
So my options at this point seem to be:

1. Begin another degree here in a city I dislike. Any of the degrees I'd be interested in are minimum 3 years however.
2. Find work here and continue to save up enough to manage studying in Italy for a few years- this sounds like an easier option and a middle point, however I have been without work for 5 years now, I am with a job centre and apply for work constantly however I am constantly rejected. 
3. Try to find something to change in my situation, maybe changing track and studying something different that can almost guarantee I could find work overseas with it. The list of these jobs seems to be all pretty highly qualified though, and absolutely nothing at all I'd enjoy or be good at.
4. Take the small amount of money I have saved, go to Italy once it's reopened and spend all my money staying there as long as I can and trying to find work with it. I will say, I did actually attempt this for only 1 month last year, I had one interview and that was it.

296,"So my upstairs neighbour renovated a couple weeks ago, and ever since them, his footsteps became so clear that it’s unbearable. When he walks, I can hear him. When he pulls a chair, I can hear him. It’s so loud. I can tell when he’s in the living room or bedroom. Sometimes when he run for like three steps, my apartment feels like it’s shaking. When he drops something, I can hear it. I tried to drown out his noise by putting on music, but I can still hear him and feel my apartment vibrating.

I never used to be able to hear him. Noises were nonexistent before. It’s the same upstairs neighbour as before, he has lived above me for years. I think he changed the material of the floors during his renovation. 

What should I do? It’s horrible to hear the loud noises through the whole day. It was only after the renovation that his noises get through to my apartment. Should I approach him?

298,"**serious**

I'm a 19 year assigned female at birth person from India. This should explain my situation a bit, that I'm a queer.  

It all started when  it was clear my dad took too many debts. We had to sell our house at marginal rate to pay off the debtor, I was 9ish back then. My mom started working more and my dad became drunker and drunker, lying constantly about his whereabouts. At this point I was solely with my grandma, the only person who cared about my wishes. My parents being Asians were busy trying to force their ""ideal daughter"" bs down my throat and wanted me to be a lawyer like my dad.  Especially when it was clear I was a supposedly ""genius"" Kid.  

Here is the drill: I used to hate school. I was always bullied for one reason or the other, especially by the teachers because I asked to many questions. After my grandma's death things escalated and loneliness plunged me into Great Depression. I was 13, and since one year back my neighbor started sexually abusing me each chance he got.  I was so scared that most of the time I would freeze and vomit after he was done.  Since my parents were barely home (my mom worked hard to bring food to the table and pay for school) it became easier for him to target me. 

Knowing the financial constraints, I started looking for jobs. I found some freelancing shitty article writing website where I worked for a year before finding some other job.  I had to juggle school life, my own failing health, my mental health, extra tuition classes and my abusive drunk dad who Kept cheating on my mom (and didn't pay for my hospital bill) and my mind was getting hazy.  

There were days where I feel into panic attack at the thought of going to school . My mom took me to psychologist at the government hospital because I wasn't ""studying"".  She wasn't good but talking helped a little and she assigned me a lot of meds....considering my mom told her I'm lying about family situation

(I still have those meds) 

Fast forwarded someone who accessed my alt fb account outed my queer status without my consent to a few teachers.  My school was Catholic and it ended up being hell for me. Teachers didn't let me sit with girls. The started giving me lesser marks and other students bullied me into doing their projects knowing very well I was good in those subjects.  I remembered vividly being pushed into an empty class room before two teachers demanded me to strip to see my genitals.

My dad would frankly abuse me but it didn't hurt considering he barely has strength. Worse is that my mother never injected. Which I do, if he ever tries to abuse my mom. I have no support system and my maternal relatives blame me for everything my dad does. Each and every action is compared with my dad's and my mom stays silent 

When I finally dropped out to continue homeschooling, considering I was getting more ill the more I was in school, my mom didn't support my decision and didn't even stand up for me when I talked with my principal about the bullying.  My principal treated me like a wild animal. 

Each and every day since then has been a little better in terms of education. I took way too many course but I also learned a lot, the exams I had taken a had a nominally high score (my SAT was 1400 in my first try). But I kept working harder knowing the financial situation isn't good, still.  

Now coming back, when I was 15 my neighbor finally had enough and thought of penetrating me.  While for the past 2-3 years it was just sexual abuse, it turned into a whole more traumatic experience for me after that. I still cannot stand in the presence of older men and cant stand touching at all.  

Two years ago my mother became good friends with this guy who lived alone after his mom died. He is a nice guy  and who became family..excpect he constantly beats me up and my mom thinks he is being playful. I don't know if being hit so badly that your thighs start to quiver and won't stop shaking for hours is playful. The one time I tried to tell mom to stop it she stopped talking to me instead and preferred to spend time with that dude. Not only that but for years both of them have done nothing but mocked my existentence, try to egg me on by saying stupid homophobic or sexist stuffs.  I stopped engaging with them which made my mom... spend only 5 minutes a day with me. If I complain that only has favorites were being cooked,  my dad esp did that considering he was very childish, my mom would throw a fit because ""I didn't contribute to the family"". As if I didn't just pay off her emis and electricity bill, and also bought her meds. 

For years I have constantly worked to bring my mom a little relief. I even bought my own phone and didn't let my mom pay for it. I even paid off my father's debt sometimes 

Now my dad isn't a good person. His debtors and clients who's work he hadn't done come and threaten us while he runs off. I got kidnapped once for that. My image in front of few friends is already shattered because of how they saw my dad crawling up-to me and begging me not to open the door. 

One day I tried to defend myself when my dad was beating me after he was drunk by kicking him. Now he is pretty thin. My mom came running after he acted like he was having seizures. My mom called me a monster and pushed me out of the house knowing very well a) i had a fever b) it was well past 12. I got too angry and walked off until a police man bought me back. Turns out my dad was acting like he always does. 

The thing is that my mom tries to integrate her friend as a family but I...cant. 1 cant trust a older man anymore (my parents don't know about the rape esp after my mom concluded I was lying about my abuse) . Due to quarantine, I have been living 24/7 with the 3 of them.  Oh they also broke my room's door so I cant close it if I want to control my emotions. For almost 3 months they keep mocking, piling their frustration and everything on me.  Yesterday night after having enough I told my mom she was hurting me. That I'm not useless.  That I work each and every day to earn money If I every needed to remove my tumor (which appears to be beign,) but my mom instead became passive aggressive and won't talk of acknowledge me.  Today morning after working till 5 am (I had art commission) I couldn't open my eyes due to migraine. I asked for meds repeteadly. Three hours later my mom threw it on the floor and walked away. 

I just.. I can't stay like this anymore.  I applied to study abroad and got into two unis with My essay,even got one full ride and one full tuition. The money I saved up for visa and passport however...disappeared from my mom's bank (since I don't have a card I can't use online payment transfer etc) and parents refused to let me go because of a) the pandemic b) my tumor c) the money my grandpa saved for Me is for my marriage only. 

Now... I don't know what to do. I really still want to be a psychologist but I don't want to stay here either. I can't. I want to complete writing my second book.  I want to live. But being in a society where you're expected to live with your parents is. .. Hard.  Besides everytime I think about leaving my mom's crying face appears before my eyes.

I haven't slept in a while either. Or eaten properly. I just need to start all over. I really need to degree to get anywhere I and I *want* to study psychology. I literally already know about everything they teach in bachelors and masters courses, I just need a proof that I know which is a degree.  We don't have a lot of unis with that subject over here or anyone who could look past my homeschooling status. I really want to know where I should start",18May2020,1

However they are both very obsessed with acting like they “made it”? It’s very annoying and has gotten increasingly worse. Ex: (They both moved to a small town an hr from where they grew up.) However any chance they get they go on how they grew up in the “ghetto”. ? Let me mention, they had a VERY nice house. There was never an issue. It’s still very nice!! The neighborhood isn’t though.

306,"I created this account just because reddit was suggested to get some opinions. Honestly I don't even have any other reason to be here so hopefully I don't regret it.

Also some info, we are all 17, with my gf being the oldest, best friend middle and me youngest. Gf is bi-curious and im bisexual

~•~

I'm in a relationship going on 1 1/2  years now. She is very kinda and we both get along well. Our only problem is she isn't quite sure of herself while I am completely aware. My friend tells me not to push myself onto her but I have the tendency to be impatient. I'm trying to wait for her but then this problem came up and I kinda made it worse.

We both share a best friend who is such a sweet heart. Late last year right around Christmas he admitted his feelings for me. Now I honestly wasn't shocked as pretty much all our friends knew, he didn't try to hide it, but I had already gotten over him. I had fallen for him while dating his asshole of a best friend but since I hate to cause drama I got over my feelings and had buried them deep when I met my gf. It was like love at first site and after three years of hiding it and acting like it was just me being supportive,  I finally admitted, (more like our other friend told her and I just sat in the bg nervously) and turns out she liked me too. 

So we start dating and before long we are around Christmas and our best friend (male btw) admits he liked me even while I was dating my ex. Like I said before, no surprise as we all knew, but it kinda caught me off guard when he told me. Me and my gf had just hit our 4 month anniversary so I was busy on that then this gets thrown at me. 

Now little info before I continue. Our friend groups are connected but kinda split in half. I have one side which are mostly her close friends I because friends with when we met, then we have the total opposite, my friends. They have contact through others but honestly don't mix much. So my friend didn't have any idea I had a girlfriend, as she told me to keep quiet as she figured herself out.

So that is thrown in my path, and I brush it off. But the days go by and he gets a little pushy, as I still hadn't told him I had a gf and he wanted to know how I felt. Now I feel really guilty because I don't wanna betray her but I don't wanna leave him hanging. The more I think about him the more my feelings start to resurface and now I actually have to choose. Then I do something I am not proud of. Him being horny asks to touch my butt, and after a lot of thinking I just tell him yes. But I actually enjoy it and keep letting it progress further (nothing without clothes on*) and now I can't even do my own thing without him coming to mind. I can't ask my gf to help with my issue because one we are still young in my opinion, and two, she's still figuring out herself. And then I still feel guilty because he's still my ex's best friend and even tho my ex has told him it's ok if it did happen I just don't feel comfortable with that. 

So idk what to do. I love them both with all my heart and me and him have even had a convo about this but I honestly can't figure out how to have a convo with my gf about it, she's kinda laid back and doesn't take well to seriousness. Any advice on what to do???",18May2020,1
307,"After being in a fucking toxic ass friend group I've basically cut them all off. They still bug me and act like they want to be around my but they only enjoy me being around them so they can basically just laugh at me and piss me off cause they find it entertaining. They find every possible way to piss me off or embarrass me around other people cause they find it entertaining.

I've been trying to make new friends but it's very hard because every time I try to make a new group of friends they think I'm ditching them and roast me for it.

The worst part is if it's just me and one of my other ""friends"" they are nice and I enjoy being around them but the second it's 2 or more people they just start going back to pissing me off.

I’m depressed and stuck at home with no motivation to do anything but I’m shamed for showing symptoms of that. I just feel horrible whenever she’s near me which is almost all day every day.

311,"So we matched on a dating app and we seemed to connect right off the bat (verified user) . We spent a few days talking, had so much in common with perspectives of different topics, values, ideas, theories of life and so much more... Communication was super consistent and sincere on both sides.. Kept it interesting and This eventually evolved into witty banter and flirtatious multiple texts.. I caught strong vibes that I KNOW came from the bottom of her heart... She said she was ‘impatient’ and bummed because she wanted to hang out with me so bad. She even mentioned she “wants to do things right away when she likes something whether it’s hobbies or just be with “someone”  and spend time together. She even sent me a couple good morning/have a good night, late night texts.. Then out of no where she dead’s me! Her last text I received was “good morning love” If you’ve made it this far I REALLY appreciate you taking time to read this and offer perspective if you get a chance.

Do you think she’ll ever message me again?

Well today my husband dropped a fry on the side of the seat and went to grab it and instead grabbed a piece of foil. Me being the curious wife I am grabbed it because it looked rolled up almost like a joint (I know nothing about drugs so I was obviously wrong). I unrolled it expecting to find weed. Instead I found a black(burnt), brown, clear thickish liquidy substance. Still being an idiot and confused I smelt it and it smelt like chemicals. I called my dad who is a cop out of state and he confirmed it was most likely meth. Now I’m pissed because my husband is in the military and drives this car to work and if they would have done the random car search and had a k-9 my husband would have lost his whole job. How should I go about this? The dealership claimed to have done a detailing before hand but did a shitty job and missed this meth pipe.

318,"So last Tuesday a new girl came into my work(Subway) for a interview. She introduced herself to me and asked for my manager. My manager gave her the job and asked her to come in tomorrow same time as me in the morning. When she got to work it was pretty busy as it always is during lunch and the afternoon. We talked only for a little bit here and there, helping her with what to do etc. Job related blah blah.
By the time our shifts ended we waited for our rides to pick us up and I asked her how her first day was. She said it was stressful and we laughed and playfully talked for a while until my ride arrived so I left and said bye. The next day I had work from 4pm to 9 pm so I didn’t see her because she has work from 11am to 4pm. The day after that I had the morning shift with her, I got there did my job etc. I saw her but didn’t say anything because well I’m a bit scared to say anything and I thought I’d wait until our shifts ended to say anything again. 
Surprisingly she approached me and asked how my shift went yesterday and we talked for a bit joking and we got back to work. Unfortunately you the time we finished our shifts it was raining pretty hard so her ride got there early to pick her up so we weren’t able to talk much.

320,"Hi, I had asked about this issue I'm going to mention before and I feel bad to again.. but I'm here so, onwards. 
I had a friend who was struggling with life and they wanted to die. I tried to help them but also found that they were just.. not a great person. The few other people who knew what happened said that they were a toxic friend and it was the right choice for me to cut things off in the end because I was beginning to suffer along with them and that wouldn't have helped anyone. But it didn't change the fact that I left this person who had no one else's support and was at their lowest and I still feel so conflicted. I feel guilty, hate that person, miss that person, and I don't know what to do.
Recently, my closest friend has been feeling the same way, they don't want to live but this person is trying their best to survive because they know that I and others will miss them too much if they were gone. I'm trying to be there for them but I don't feel like it's ok to. I'm scared. What if I can't help them, what if I'll choose to leave them to, what if I'm just a bad friend who can't help them or be there for them like they need. All these what ifs keep popping back up. All these fears and somehow, even though that person is gone from my life, I feel just as scared as when I was with them. We have mutual friends so sometimes on a game or at some event where they're gathered I'll see this person and when I do my stomach drops and I'm terrified but also have the urge to go to them and it scares me that I can even think that. I miss them so much and I don't know if that's ok or how to stop it. Yet I'm also so very guilty because they were hurt by my actions as well. So hurt that they felt it might be ok to stop living and I wouldn't be able to forgive myself if they did so. But I'm not angry. I want them to be ok they deserve to be like anyone else. I don't understand why after almost a year that I feel nearly the same as when things had ended between us.

323,"I’m just going to get into it 

My cousin and I have been best friends for a while. Sense then I moved half way across the country from her and this has been difficult on both of us. For the sakes of this post I’m going to refer to her as C for cousin. 

So this happened yesterday, so I texted C asking her if she wanted to play Minecraft. She said that she was at a friends house and would play later tonight . I did my online homework for a while waiting for her. This was a rough day for me because I had forgot to take my anti depressants for like a week (I’ve really been trying to get better at that) but I was just having a bad day, it wasn’t for any particular reason it’s just hard to explain and I was really excited to play with my cousin. She called me in the middle of the day and hung up immediately then C texted me “that was a mistake one sec” and how I took that was that she would call me in the minute. I don’t know if that is how it is seen by most. So I waited and like four hours later she texted me that she was tired and she didn’t want to play. I honestly wouldn’t be upset about this if this didn’t happen all of the time. She makes plans with me and then says later that she can’t. She never asks to play with me first it is always me. I know that this isn’t that big of a deal but I adore her and I just feel like I put more into keeping our relationship good than her. I just feel unwanted. Every time she calls me after I ask her to play earlier In the day I stop everything I’m doing to spend time with her. I just want to talk to her. So after this she texted me she didn’t want me to be mad at her and I just said okay because I was upset. (Texts from now on will be copy and pasted because the other messages were on snap) 

So today at the end of the day she texted me without me texting her first and told me 

“Hi so I rly wanna play today but I threw up twice this morning and still not feeling very well but promise I will play with you tonight. I hope u forgave me from last night.🥺”

After this I told her to 

“just go to bed “

because she was not feeling good and we could talk in the morning. Then she sent 

“Uh so I’m not tired at all because I got 13 hours of sleep so if you don’t wanna play with me that’s fine I’m just trying to be a good cousin and I want to play with you I don’t know what I did wrong.”

After that I called her because I was pissed, I had told her multiple times that upsets me and to please only make plans with me if she knows that she can show up. If she didn’t know then she can just call me at the time. 

When we called I told her that she made me upset because of what she did and she said (not quoted)

C said something about how she is worried every time she cancels plans that I’ll get upset. She also said something about how it was toxic.

Then we just got into a screaming match about how I felt like I was putting more into the relationship and she didn’t think so and then she hung up the call. 

I just feel like this is a constant thing of where I’m putting myself out there by asking her to play and she just keeps letting me down.

I feel like I could have handled it better and I feel like a shit bag for telling her how I felt. She blocked me on Instagram so I don’t think she wants to make up after I saw that I texted her 

When you want to talk lmk I love you so much even when we are fighting sooo... good night 

I still love her I just wish I didn’t say anything because it doesn’t matter, though it makes me upset if rather just be upset and still be her friend.

328,"Idk where to start. I need to get this all of my chest. I will put a TLDR but please consider giving me your advice.

So to start, around march, everyone besides my pre-existing CLOSE friends just completely cut me off. No snaps, texts, calls, offers to hang out. And it's dragged on till now. Still not any contact from any of my peers except my close friends. Just completely stopped talking to me. And I'm just realizing how much it really hurts. And on top of that, people have always seen me as weird. Additionally, in my 2 years of living in this new small town of 1,000, not one person has invited me to a party or function. And more, one of my best friends has been not talking to anyone. Not his friends of 8 years, not me, no one. Now this is characteristic of him, to isolate himself completely for days at a time. He's done this before, but usually only 2-4 days. But its been a week and no ones heard from him and I'm worried. Now moving on, my next friend suffers from aspergers syndrome and is not exactly all that social, and has grown up shielded by his mom and in private schools, so he doesn't have the social experience I have, so I can't vent to him about my problems, and he is always playing on his laptop and I have no desire to get mine out to talk to him. My next friend is always talking to someone who is quite mean and annoying to me so I try to avoid that but I can talk to him when he's alone. But he doesn't have any advice or sympathy that much, usually responding dryly or shallow which hurts since we have history. And my next close friend is the only one who actively talks to people and isn't always busy but he offers lots of sympathy and love and he is a great friend to talk to, but his parents are very strict and read his phone, so I cant hang out with him very much since his parents are strict and can't voice the full extent of my problems to him without his step-dad asking me about it when I go to his house. I cant make anymore friends because I've been just cut off by the popilar or socially higher people so everyone else does the same like sheep, and the older kids think they're superior to us. I have some more issues that are a bit more personal so if you would like to give a bit of advice I can post about or pm about if someone asks.

TLDR: I've been completely cut off/socially rejected by %90 of my peers for no reason, and the little friends I have it seems i can't talk to for specific reasons. I can't make anymore friends due to our towns population of 1000. 

If there are any details I need to fill in please ask.

Anyways, when the lockdowns started and our store hours got cut we all lost at least 10 hours a week.

I want to bring all this up with my manager tomorrow if she’s at work but I don’t know the best way to do so. Imo she’s not the best manager and usually things run less smoothly when she’s in control lol which is what makes me kind of unsure of how to deal with this because I don’t want to tick her off and get scheduled even less. I was thinking of just asking to talk to her for a second and then asking when my hours will start to go back to what they were before the lockdown. She has always acted like I’m one of her favorites for the position I work in which is what makes this even more confusing to me. Would there be a better way to phrase it or bring it up in general?

337,"My friend ""C"" said ""Might be pregnant or my period is late lmao""

Of course, My friends and I ask her if she used protection and she admitted they didn't (condom wouldn't stop breaking). C had sex with no protection on the 2 of May  (he pulled out, but prec\*m), had sex on the 6th with no protection (he didn't finish), and then lastly had sex on the 8th (he DID .... inside this time) and she took plan b. Her period is late and tried to fight back by saying she was on birth control. Problem is...she started taking birth control on the 9th LOL

This morning she said that she wasn't entirely serious (she called it a joke but it wasn't lol) and ""didn't need to be lectured"" about how hard taking care of a baby is and how physically/mentally expensive abortion is. Despite the fact she also did this was a guy who was sleeping with 4 other people at the same time, DURING A PANDEMIC !!! She ended up blocking us, removing herself from all our socials and left all our group chats. I know eww teenager complaining about her friends unfollowing her. But I feel kind of bad because I know she's scared. Even though, chances are she's not pregnant. We still told her to take a test in about a week just in case. But I think she had no right to get mad at **us** for trying to help her. We understand it's her f\*\*\* up, but it also affects the people she purposely involves. Especially when we're the first people she tells. I'm seriously torn about this because I have no experience dealing with teenage pregnancy, let alone just scares. C was already pi\*\*ed off that we critiqued her for violating social distancing and sleeping with an idiot college student. 

I was just wondering if I should apologize. Even though I was trying to help, the best way I knew. I feel like she kind of deserved someone to tell her she's seriously effing up right now. But my teenage feelings are always contradicting themselves.",18May2020,1

I told them if they’re not willing to make an improvement, then it’s time to end it all. They hit me up with thats it just how they are and that they cannot change it.

Sorry in advanced, I'm very emotional at the moment so I know this post is messy and all over the place....

So, I'm extremely conflicted. My father was arrested around my 1st birthday (I'm 27 now) and has been in prison ever since. He has tried to reach out to me a few over the years. He has sent me gifts for Christmas when I was little, he sent me a card with $50 on my 17th birthday, and the last thing he sent me was a pillow with a drawing on it for my 21st. Not even sure if he drew it or another inmate. I've been wanting to respond, but I don't know how or what to even say. He is a stranger to me, but he is still my dad. I also feel guilty for even wanting to reach out to him because of everything he did. My grandmother (mothers side) had always said she thought he wasn't guilty and didn't have a fair trial(even though the news article seemed to be pretty straight forward), so hearing that over and over all these years also makes me even more confused on how to feel. I don't know what to do and my emotions are all over the place. I haven't seen him or spoke to him since I was 6 years old. I looked up info about him and how to contact him and seeing pictures (one very recent) just made me break down since I didn't even remember what he looked like and now that I do... it makes everything real. Should I reach out, should I just leave it alone... Any opinions would be helpful please...",18May2020,1

341,"Basic synopsis: Met on tinder, talked a bit, noticed red flags, cut ties respectfully as I could, blocked, and all that Jazz. Well, they found out where I worked and sent me roses and chocolates with his number and said “I’m sorry”. Manager and coworkers (loving support) were prepared to fight and the manager allowed me to call on the work phone so I didn’t give this person my number. Screamed in a voice mail threatening police exposure. I then got harassed after. I set my Facebook to private prior since I had a gut feeling. They still sound my Facebook and proceeded to harass me. The last thing that was said (after I threaten police) was “wow you’re really mad”. 

It felt as if my feelings didn’t matter. He was so unaware of his actions and how they made me feel. I am scared; but I’m ready to fight. I have a great support, but I’m not sure if I should get police involved. I’m really not sure how to go about it. My gut feeling is this would prolong. I mean, I’m glad I cut ties after a couple of days, because I can only imagine if I prolong the flirtation. 

I’m dealing with manipulation, too. I’m convincing myself that I didn’t use him, but I was trying to give it a chance. He took it too far. I don’t want to fall for those tricks. I feel violated.

I don't know if this is the right subreddit for the help I'm looking for but I'll give it a try.

So 2,5 years ago me and my family moved into a small house and it isn't whay I expected. I can hear almost everything that is going on in this house. I can hear the shower, people 'doing their business on the toilett', walking, putting objects down, etc. I sometimes even hear when someone is moving in their bed or louder breathing when it comes from the rooms next to mine.

I really have problems coping with it, and now that we all have to stay at home because of corona, my 10 year old brother plays the whole day on his ps4 in his room and I can hear every single word he says.

Problem is, her phone was on 3% and the data connection was slow, which I didn't realize until I had queued quite a few pictures to send. I unsent the ones that had sent already, and deleted the chat history, which cancelled the rest of the images sending.

352,"When I first got hired, I got along with everyone, except one coworker who completely hated me right off the bat for no reason. I was the new youngest woman in the office, the only one with a degree (excluding only my boss), got paid a little more than my coworkers, and from the jump, everyone clicked with my personality — and this coworker hated me for all of these reasons. She eventually warmed up to me because I simply asked her why she had it out for me and we talked through it. A year and a half later and we are actually very friendly at work.


Well, over that year and a half, that coworker kissed our Boss and our Lead’s ass. She would buy them gifts and food frequently and quickly became their favorite. *(Honestly I thought that was against HR, but I never reported it)*. They (coworker, Boss, Lead) gossiped about everyone in the office. I never fed in to that kind of stuff: gossip or kissing ass. I steered far from it all. 


But I quickly came to realize my Lead (one position lower than my boss) started to not like me. How do I know this? She stopped speaking to me when she would relieve me from my shifts. She bought everyone Christmas gifts except for me. When I came back from my surgery after being gone a month, she didn’t say a word to me. She makes a lot of little gifts for my coworker (the one that used to not like me), and gives gifts to other coworkers as well except me. When people do things wrong, she tells them privately and corrects them. When I do things wrong, she puts me on blast *in all caps* on the public work forum and addresses me by my position, not even by my first name. (example: *Accountant MAKE SURE YOU ARE blah blah blah). Even when she sees me in person, she will refuse to speak to me and instead post it on the forum. She‘ll assign me random tedious tasks like shredding everyone else’s paperwork for no reason at all. The list goes on. 


I am a very hard worker and enjoy coming to work. I never gossip or complain. Cover shifts whenever needed and work overtime whenever needed. Just confused as to where all this animosity is coming from. 


So I was just wondering, is it appropriate to ask my Lead why she does not like me and why she treats me differently than everyone else? Or is this something I go to HR or my Boss to? I should mention my Boss and my Lead are very close. Or the last option, should I just ignore it and continue to work hard, while scouting for jobs on the side? Thanks for any advice!

I'm now 23 years old and have been wanting to attend college. I have a few concerns. First off, I feel like I'm too far behind to jump right into college. I never even passed geometry before taking the GED test. What would I do? Would it be alright to jump into the required courses at a community College? Or would it be impossible to keep up? Secondly, because I've been in the adult industry I don't have a steady job to list on an application. Would this raise issues considering I already don't have a diploma?

354,"How do I tell my wife she is being a privileged brat? 

Three years ago, I got out of the military and we moved to a new state. Neither of us are from this new state, but we moved here because my job in IT could carry the family household while she stayed at home with our children. That is what she wanted, it wasn’t me forcing her to “fulfill the role of a woman” or anything like that. About a year and a half ago, I got a promotion and we were able to afford to buy a house! We were excited and bought the house that was at the top of our budget. Our budget allowed us to remain comfortable while still having the house we loved. Then, COVID-19 happened. Furloughs have happened at my company that have reached 30% of the force so far. The damage has also taken its toll on my job. While I haven’t been furloughed, I was cut from my previous position and sent back to the position I held before. This has caused our mortgage payment to be a little too high for us. 

Tonight she asked me how long I thought this was going to last. I told her that I don’t know. She then brought up the fact that we bought the house to be comfortable with my old salary. I replied that I know. That was followed by her asking me what we were going to do, that we can’t afford for me to make less money. So to that, I responded that the only solution is probably for her to get a job.

That’s when she freaked out. She told me it wasn’t fair that she has to get a job because we moved here so that she wouldn’t have to. I told her that I know it isn’t fair, because it’s not what I promised, but things have changed dramatically. We are very lucky during this time to still be able to probably live off of my income alone, but that she should probably start looking for a job to make sure we don’t get caught too bad off guard.

She is now in our room crying loudly to make sure that I hear her. I was really nice to her, even though I didn’t want to be and still don’t want to be because I think she is being a brat.

362,"So my brother has a kid who is I think 18 months old. Being around him I am concerned for his wellbeing. There’s a lot, as I previously lived with them for several months, so I saw a lot. 

• He does not say a single word. Not one. Nothing. He babbles but that’s it. I suspect this is because his parents do not really talk to him. When my daughter was that age she could at least say simple sentences, which is why I’m wondering what’s up. 

• My brother constantly yells at him, and calls him r*tard, f*ggot, bitch, the works. He will yell and spank him rather than trying to discipline him in any other way. If he stands in front of the TV while brother is playing video games, he loses his shit and yells at him calling him every name in the book. 

• His mom still breastfeeds him. Only problem is that she is a heavy smoker of both cigarettes and weed. She also was taking a hardcore pain med for her teeth awhile ago (don’t remember which one), while still breastfeeding. They feed him solid food on occasion, which my brother will often throw pieces of on the floor for the kid to pick up and eat like a dog. I distinctly remember my brother tossing goldfish crackers on the dirty kitchen floor and the kid bent down and ate them off the floor with his mouth. Brother was laughing. 

• Brother and his wife smoke weed (dabs) in the house around the kid. 

• Brother and wife allow kid to play in the litter box (and put cat litter in his mouth) and in/around the toilet. Many times when I lived there he would walk out of the bathroom with the plunger and would try to put it in his mouth. Somewhat related- they gave him a haircut while he was in his high chair. His hair was falling all over the try and they kept putting crackers on it for him to eat, essentially causing him to eat his own hair, over and over. That’s just weird to me. 

• He has absolutely no sleep schedule. I’ve moved out now but I will play video games with my brother and it’ll be 3am and the kid is still awake. Often he will take a nap at 10pm and wake up at around 11pm, and stay up all night. 

• He is underweight. While I was living there, they would feed him 2 grapes sliced up and a few pieces of fruit for breakfast, no lunch, and then for dinner a few bites of whatever we were eating that night. They took him to the doctor for his 1 year check up and they told me that the doctor said he’s underweight and needs to eat more and especially more carbs. They continued feeding him the same little amount. And they never gave him water or anything to drink. Ever. Literally. Not once. Even though he does breastfeed, it’s only like once a day. So that’s not making up for the food they aren’t giving him. 

• He has strange behaviors. When I lived there I was making dinner and he came into the kitchen and poked his eye on the corner of a drawer (intentionally) several times. He also recently learned how to open the dishwasher and grab knives out of it and run over to his parents and stab their feet. Not kidding. 

• A few months ago kid got a fever. Brother told me he had a fever of 102 for 3 days. I told him to take him to the doctor and he said no and said it’s fine because they are putting him to sleep in just a diaper and putting the fan and AC on (in December. In NW US. It was about 15-30° at night) and then giving him “Super hot” baths when he woke up. 

• They never change his diaper. Constantly he would be walking around (in again, 10-30° weather at the time I saw it, meanwhile parents were wearing sweatshirts and pants etc) in just a diaper, clearly full of urine and feces. It was unmistakable. Plus you could easily smell it. He got rashes very often.

363,"For a few years now I haven’t been able to do things like flirt, hold hands, kiss, or even think about any sexual activity without getting sick, nervous, guilty, ashamed, or just terrified. Mostly I’ll feel guilty and nervous thinking about any affection, but I feel all of those things when considering sexual interaction with someone I love. I know I don’t need to make myself do anything since I’m young but I want to be able to in the future. I keep telling the people I date that I believe in waiting till marriage, and while I do believe in that, I don’t know if I’ll even be able to after words. When I think about things like kissing, sex, hand holding, hugging, cuddling, making out, or any other physical affections I just get nervous (and feel the other emotions i listed before) but when I think about sex I get terrified almost to the point of a panic attack, I feel vulnerable like I have no control and enter a fight or flight mode, like anyone who even touches me is going to try and take advantage of me in some way. I don’t know what to do because I want to be able to have kids, and I used to long for the day I’d be able to have a baby, but now I’m even considering adopting because I’m so scared of physical affection and contact.

I like this guy “M”. M has a gf “K”. M and K have been dating since February but I feel as if M flirts with me. 

One time, we were sharing papers for a class and when I submitted mine it came back as 55% plagiarism. When I told him he drove 80mph to check his papers and then told me “I wouldn’t do that to a..... good friend like you”. 

Another time when I helped him in another class we were in he said “(My name), if I was single I would kiss you right now”. We then spent 50 minutes on the phone just talking and laughing late at night. 

M doesn’t talk much about his gf but the one time I asked about her he sighed and said “she doesn’t give good head. I can honestly go without it.” He then changed the subject to something else. 

I’m moving from my apartment to another in the area and he offered to drive 30 minutes out to help me move. He also said he owes me a 12 pack of beer for helping me this semester.

So a few minutes ago my good friend of 4 years just told me she has a crush on another girl. My friend EE is best friends with a girl called A. I used to be friends with A but we had a falling out and we hate each other now(sorta relevant). 
But anyways EE and I have a mutual friend F and F has been feeling left out in their friend group so I talked to EE and she tried to explain why F felt left out and I didn't want to hear it bc I was always left out. Well I eventually just let EE talk bc she seemed really sad so that's when she said she's liked A since December. I was speechless and still am. I once thought I liked A but it was nothing. And it's crazy bc EE has always been so ""I'm not anti-gay but I am SOO straight"" and my gaydar is never EVER off and I always thought she was a little too straight if that makes sense. And I always thought maybe my gaydar was finally off but now she says she might like another girl and I'm just confused and kind of concerned. A is not a good person or friend and I don't want EE to get hurt but I'm scared to tell her my real thoughts. I honestly don't 100% think EE is gay, I think she's questioning like every teenager.

377,"My friend is in need of help, and I need advice to give to him to help him after what went down today.

My friend's younger brother is a ticking timebomb, he's violent and throws temper tantrums when he doesn't get his way. He has pulled a knife on the family on multiple occasions, punched holes in doors and walls, screams every day when things don't go his way, and just today he locked their cat in the bathroom drawer for 2 hours because the cat pooped on his bed. The cat has been shedding and throwing up constantly after the incident; this was the breaking point for my friend as he told me he just wants to beat the ever living shit out of him for what he did, even though he knows that's wrong.

My friend feels extremely powerless, because there's nothing he can do to him about any of this all because **he's under the age of 18**. They're currently living in an apartment and have gotten constant noise complaints because of him, and if they try to get on his ass about his actions he knows that he has the power to kick them all out of the apartment. My friend, his stepdad, and his mom will be rendered homeless while the abusive brother legally has to move in with his biological father who he ALREADY WANTS TO LIVE WITH but can't atm because his biological father doesn't want him.

They've tried bringing him to therapy and it didn't work, they tried talking to him but he always screams back in their faces, they're tried to punish him and he couldn't give less of a shit. They can't do anything to him significantly or else they get kicked out of the apartment by him.

Is there ANY WAY they can get him out of there, for their own safety? My friend is terrified to be in that apartment, and because we're all in quarantine he's stuck with him all day every day. I want to help my friend, but I have no knowledge of what to do that might help.

I really want to make sure my friend and his family are safe, I need some advice.

**TLDR:** My friend's younger brother (around 14 years old) is an abusive person that has shown signs of hostility and violence toward the family. They're living in an apartment and will be kicked out by him if they try to do anything against him for his actions as he knows getting the family kicked out and homeless means he legally has to live with his biological father, which is exactly what he wants.

Funny enough, we celebrated our one year anniversary yesterday. He’s been great but also inconsistent. Sometimes he’ll send the sweetest message ever, then he won’t call or text for days with no explanation. The real issue lies in what happened today. He’s been talking about this one online friend a lot for months and her name is Sam. Ive always been wary of this because she’s super hot, my boyfriend’s type, and they seem to talk way more than we do. She snapchats him multiple times every single time I’m over my boyfriend’s place. He also this past week forgot to call me twice (I asked me to call me after work) because I’ve been really struggling lately and he “forgot” and was playing games with her instead. Even when I was venting about my problems, he wasn’t being too responsive over the phone and said “oh sorry I’m playing games with Sam.”  

Today, I had his phone and accidentally opened a Snapchat she sent. It was some stupid message but then I see a message sent from my boyfriend to her “you’re so adorable” and her reply “your face is betterrrr”. Then I see a selfie of her and his comment “TOO CUTE”. my stomach dropped. I also see he sent her a lot of pictures...not sure which kind. I’m sorry I know it’s wrong to snoop but I couldn’t look away. I put him phone down, panicked and ran to the bathroom. Then I came out and said to him “hey let’s have a conversation about something please.” And asked why he sent her those messages that was basically flirting. He said those photos looked like she had a “baby filter” on so he thought it was adorable because of that reason...then he apologizing starting asking me if I’m “really that insecure” and bringing up the gifts he bought me for our one year. Yes I appreciate the gifts but i felt manipulated. He said “I only care about you, why would I spend hundreds of dollars on you if I didn’t? I don’t spend money on her.” His actions don’t seem to reflect that though. I didn’t get mad, I didn’t yell, I tried to talk to him rationally. I don’t know what to do. If he has anymore to hide, I guarantee it’s gone because he deleted it. Who knows if he even told her he has a gf. Everything was going so great. Is this as big of a deal as I think it is? He didn’t seem to think so. He said I was overthinking and told me I talk to my guy friends that way, to which I strongly said “no I definitely do not call my male friends adorable.” Thanks for the help guys.",18May2020,1

385,"This is a really really difficult topic and I don’t know what to do about it. 

Basically, I’ve always struggled to form connections to people. I don’t ‘love’ many people, only ever felt genuine love for my parents, and siblings. Felt close to a couple of friends, and to my partners, but I wouldn’t take a bullet for them. Weirdly, I’m able to feel a really strong love for animals, that tends to override any human connection. I don’t know what’s wrong with me

Saying this, I always wanted children. I think kids are adorable, and enjoy spending time with them. I was absolutely CONVINCED that when I had a child I would feel this all encompassing love, and it didn’t even cross my mind that this might not happen. I thought human instinct would take over, but it didn’t.

I got pregnant last year, aged 31. I was single, but I’m financially very well off and thought I was able to give my baby a good life. Throughout the pregnancy I felt excited, but I never felt any feelings of love, to my disappointment. I tried to force these feelings but they just wouldn’t come. I assumed it would happen once my daughter was born, it didn’t. I don’t think I have post natal depression, I don’t have any other symptoms.

My daughter is well cared for, I enjoy looking after her and spending time with her. I would never want her to be uncomfortable, in pain, or sad. I believe I could give her a very good life, with a good education and lots of attention. However, I’m worried that this will be based on a lie. 

I’ve started to find my lack of feelings quite distressing, as i feel that the maternal love should of kicked in by now (my daughter is 8 months old.) Should I keep going, hope it comes with time, and give my daughter a good life regardless. Or should I give my daughter up for adoption so she can be brought up be people who have that motherly love I’m incapable of feeling.

388,"

I have never felt like anyone has ever cared if I am around or not, my family included. I feel like I’m pretty socially aware and I always keep people laughing but I am never good enough for people to keep around. Even my best friends from campus have been extremely short with me when I have tried to talk to them and are happy to leave me on read for days. Genuinely the most I’ve felt loved in months is when my plug invited me to smoke with him the other day.

I feel so ugly every day, I’m literally reduced to tears when I think about how i look. It’ll never matter how much love I want to give to somebody because no girl is ever going to want to settle for somebody as ugly as myself. My mom and sister have both told me that they rank me as a 2/10. This was after I lost 80 pounds, after I bought a car, after I bought new clothes, I have done everything I can think of to try to fix myself and after all of that I’m still a 2/10. I just feel such a genuine and pure hatred for myself, I hate that I have to be such a genuinely disgusting and unlovable person.

I would do anything to feel like somebody loved me. I’m definitely the definition of what people call a “simp” If I had the opportunity to be one. I’ve thought about it a lot and I’d do anything, I would drop out of college, I’d sell my computer and all my game systems/games I own, I’d quit my jobs, I’d sell my car, I don’t care what I would have to give up at this point because anything is worth having that feeling. 

I feel like there’s nothing to look forward to anymore, or doesn’t matter what I do or what I achieve I will never be good enough. I have no motivation for anything, I couldn’t give a fuck less about my job, my degree, or my hobbies. The only things I live for anymore is going to work, drinking/getting high, and going to sleep. I feel like I have no reason to live, the only aspirations I had were to find somebody to want to spend my life with and make enough money to live somewhat comfortably. Now that just feels like a joke, like I was kidding myself throughout my childhood when I felt like there would be a day when somebody treated me like I mattered, I’m such a loser.

I don’t know what specific advice I’m looking for but I’d appreciate any that you could give me, thanks.",18May2020,1
389,"Okay so this is a little weird but bear with me. I am too feminist, as my title clearly states. It is getting in the way of my relationships, and overall happiness and I would really like some advice on how to curb this a bit. Also, on mobile, pardon my formatting.   
  So I want to start by saying that I am a young adult (24f) that was raised in an incredibly toxic Christian household. I was taught through my entire childhood about the roles a woman should serve, such as cooking, cleaning, pleasing her husband, always smiling, never being a slut, but be desirable to men, find a man that will be able to “put proper reigns on me,” etc. And I have a distinct memory of being told during “the talk” at age 10(my mother literally checked out the sex ed tape the night before the first lesson so that we could watch it together and she could stipulate every statement firsthand, which was also really embarrassing because I had to return it day of and everyone knew) that, if I have sex before marriage then I would be stretched out and my husband wouldn’t be able to love me as much. I was also incredibly sheltered until I moved out, to the extent that if a show or movie had kissing in it, my mother would use her hand to literally cover my eyes and then change the channel.  
  Fast forward to now. I have spent time away from home, in college, on the internet, etc, and now I am in the exact opposite position. I find myself bitter towards Christians, and men, and hypersensitive towards anything that I deem potentially “sexist,” even simple things like television romances or a man explaining something to a woman. When I think about certain things, from the fact that a woman has never been president to the very idea of rape, I will either cry or it will ruin my attitude for the rest of the day. This is a particular nuisance when I try and watch movies, because if there is any depiction of a woman that I find derogatory (and the bar is admittedly low) I will have a legitimate panic attack. I will try and fight it off because i hate this about myself and in groups it is embarrassing, but the hyperventilation and vomiting is so physical that even if my mind tries to fight it, my body can’t.  
  I hate all of this though. I don’t want it. I want to be able to be easygoing. To laugh at things, even if they aren’t the most savory, because it’s better than crumpling. Sure I am on the liberal side, but I don’t want to be radical. I don’t want hate. I don’t want fear or sadness. There are so many great men, and they’re only getting better, and the fact that by default I assume the worst in their intentions disturbs me. And on top of that, there are lots of shitty women. I know them when I see them, but the disgust when I have isn’t as much as it is for men, and anyone being Christian makes it worse.  
  I will say that I was assaulted by a Christian man. And that’s when my mindset really began deteriorating. And after that I was with a guy that my parents liked, so when I broke up with him (three times) my parents would text him without my knowledge saying that I didn’t know what I wanted and he should just wait until I “healed,” then when I got a new boyfriend everyone accused me of cheating, since they didn’t accept my autonomy during the breakup. After that I was with an “upstanding” looking man that beat the shit out of me, and my parents turned a blind eye despite police documentation.   
  I don’t want to hate men. I don’t want to feel anger towards the whole world. I don’t want to fly into panic attacks when I see sexual things on tv. I really don’t even think these things, I just feel them so physically when they happen that it’s so hard to pull myself out of it. Where should I even start?",18May2020,1

That kept him in the house tonight, however I want to find another way to settle this with him without resorting to our parents for authority. Any advice?",18May2020,1

395,"She always seems so bored, she just sits there on the couch all day just staring at a wall or laying down, she occasionally watched TV but that's it. She's been like this before covid. She's from a different country but she's staying with us, she speaks no English. 

Also, no one in my family likes her, and she has no friends. I could go on a very long rant, but to keep it short, she's psychopath (she's been like this for a very long time, it's not an old age thing). 

So anyone have any ideas on how to keep her busy without having to spend time with her? I every time I see her she's like a sad little puppy just sitting there the whole time.",18May2020,1

Its definitely not one of those things where they are the same, as they are both pretty much opposite in almost every sense.

398,"I'm 21, live in Germany, enrolled in university last year and I hate it. When I first got there everything seemed to be going fine. Move out of my parents house, was hype for my courses (English and Philosophy) but got quickly overwhelmed with the amount of work. First semester I failed every single one of my courses. Second semester I missed the deadline to enroll in any so I basically just spend half a year in my apartment, doing nothing. Now a couple weeks ago the third semester began, I enrolled in all courses that I needed AND... I'm still miserable, hate everything and completly overwhelmed with the workload.   
Even going into uni I didn't really know what I want to do after my degree beyond having a vague interest in the english language and linguistics broadly but thought I'll figure it out along the way. My fear of failure and my future got so bad that I was seriously considering comitting suicide. Two weeks ago I kinda had a complete breakdown while on the phone with my mom about everything and have basically moved back in with them since. Still enrolled at university. I told them that I wanted to stay in uni and just had to change my courses and everything will be finde. But I think it won't and the only reason I told them that is because I don't know what else to do. On the other hand I feel like that I'm just throwing away this great opportunity that my parents have allowed me to have and that I might regret dropping out for the rest of my life.

I have no real interests or skills besides playing video games, haven't worked a single job in my life and the thought of the future terrifies me so much that I'm still thinking about ending my life like every day now.

TL;DR Uni is killing me but so is the thought of dropping out (I should propably go see a therapist too.)",18May2020,1
399,When I was a  sophomore in college 20 years ago I got sick. My stomach started hurting and I began to do strange things. I had a girl I liked we were friends basically she told me she didn’t like me and I dropped out of school. When I got home I was still sick and still acting strange I couldn’t walk or talk and I couldn’t eat . I stopped changing my clothes stopped working. All I did was hang out. I started praying everyday and I thought god was trying to tell me something and I was doing my best to listen. One day I was watching the news magazine 20/20 . The we’re doing a show about a religious phenomenon called stigmata. This is when you’re hands and feet feel other bruises of Christ when he was hung on the cross. I had been feeling these tingly sensations in my hands and feet for about a year before I saw that episode. When I saw what she was going through I thought to myself “ that’s the exact same feeling I feel” so from that moment on I beloved god was telling me something. About 7 months later I tried to rekindle and old flame I had. I call the girl I hadn’t seen in 3 years and told her I loved her . She said I’m flatter . Truth was she no longer knew me and we had never even kissed. After I told her this I said “ this is what god is trying to tell it has something to do with her . So I searched my brain and sure enough I realized I was Jesus . I also started hallucinating around this time seeing things . So I called back and told her this . She hung up on me. I didn’t give up I kept calling and calling and calling until one day she shows up at my house and hits me in the head with a bottle . This did not deter me . During this time I had began telling others I was god and telling my friend they were apostles. I then thought to my self god has 7 wives where and who are the other 6 . So I picked 6 other girls I had known in my life and began calling them and telling them if they lived I my city I would go to there house if they lice far away I would call and search and send messages etc . This is when the retraining orders started to pile up . But again this did not deter me . For the next five years I send thousands apon thousands of letter to these women got beat up twice go a couple guns pull on me but still this did not deter me . Over the my hallucinations got worst o would sit around talking to voices in my head all day . I would stare at thing that no one but I could see ( I thought everyone could see it) eventually after about 4 years I stopped worrying bout the women . I had become so engulfed in my hallucinations that Nothing matter but the voices in my head . One day about 7 years in to this 3 years of talking to myself the voice told me to kill myself . I went got a knife and stabbed myself in the throat a few times . I was taken to the hospital and lived . When I got out of recovery I was put in the mental health ward and diagnosed with schizophrenia bipolar disorder . I spent years in and out of hospitals not just the little ones but the state wards too. Attempted suicide a few more times and lived the life of someone stuffing from extreme mental illness . Today I’m doing better mainly because my last suicide attempts was almost my last suicide attempts ... I almost died . I was still in deep mental illness but I told myself fro now on when you here voices you have to go to the hospital and I did . Sometimes I would go 15 times in a year but it worked I haven’t attempted suicide since and I doing much Better . But now I am feeling like I’m a loser . Which brings me to my question. Am I a loser? I’m poor I never had a job I’m on disability I get food stamps I don’t have anything and have never done anything of value in my life. Is this ok cause I have schizophrenia or am I a loser who has what he deserves in life nothing cause I’ve done nothing . Can I sit back and waste away and say “ I’m schizophrenic “ or do I have to do something. My family and friends tell me to get a job or go back to college and I’m wondering if they are right to expect more from me.  Am I a loser or am I schizophrenic,18May2020,1

403,"I’m not a child, and I have no reason for this fear it kind of exists and wanted advice on how to become more use to showering.

I at my young ages never was taught to shower and instead would take baths and wash hair in the sink, I was forced to do it this way for medical safety for my ears since water in my ear isn’t the best, my family finally got over it since it’s become better and doesn’t pose a threat  and decided to get my ear plugs.

I had my first ever shower in my life a week ago or so and it was the most traumatic experiences ever. The water pressure and high pressure through the small holes felt so hard on my body like I was being prickled hundreds of times, I couldn’t see whatsoever and worse of all my earplugs fell out which caused me to freak out and fall, a ton of water got in apparently and it rang my ears and I had to put ear drops in, I ended up crying a ton from the pain of falling and the ears ringing and being plugged really bad.

Honestly this could be a TIFU post, but I’m not posting it for karma on that sub since I wanna learn, I don’t wanna be scared of the shower and this honestly may seem like the most childish thing ever but I don’t know what to do I couldn’t see, the water pressure just felt weird like prickly and obviously the water in the ears won’t happen all the time but it made it feel like the worse experience again, my family is pushing me to try it again but I don’t know what to do there isn’t a shower tutorial for young adults because your parents are suppose to teach normal kids at a young age.",18May2020,1

405,"Ex Girlfriend stole my car ! Help

Me and my ex were together for about 10 months. I had know her for about 10 years in life though. And had been with her in the past.  California United States  

We always ended up fighting and breaking up throughout the years but this last time we got together things moved quickly and we ended up living together and I had jobs but no driver license. 

I know I should get one and I really do want to I just have put it off many times in life because nobody wanted to help show me how. It’s one of my goals. Anyways back to the story. (I was living at here moms house this past while and was paying her large sums of rent) 

She ended up saying that because her car was breaking down she would need to get us a good car and she Said since I have the good job and work lots of hours I have to buy it if I expect to keep getting to work... recluntalty she takes me to car store and has me drop 2k down payment of my savings.. and then has me pay 300 payment every month to a car that is both of our names. But now about a week ago we broke up.

So now I’m not living with her anymore and she has my car. She refuses to give me the key to the car. Even though I have made all the car payments and down payments. She also mind you has 2 other cars so she doesn’t even need this car I have 0 she has 3 now. And with Corana and everything I doubt courts can help. What can I do??? She told me she’s just gonna to take over car payments even though her job can. Barely support her bills without my help.  She insists it’s fine and that because the one bill she was paying for it was the insurance and that since she pays the insurance she can’t risk letting anyone drive it that’s her excuse.. what do I do???",18May2020,1

410,"hi!! i’m a 17 y/o lesbian and i live with a controlling, homophobic father. let’s just say, he doesn’t really respect me and in the past he used to get mad at me and throw a huge temper over minor inconveniences i made (not closing a door, accidentally leaving something out, etc) and i think it has affected me to this day. deep down, i still love him and i know he loves me too and he just wants me to grow up with thick skin. ironically, it has done the opposite. so, in my freshman year of high school (age 15) i decided to seek help. 

i was going through a rough time. many things at the moment weren’t going well for me and it was hard for me to think straight. i told my high school counselor my smaller problems, to see if she was somebody i could trust. i told her specifically i wasn’t suicidal, i wasn’t going to hurt anyone, i just felt out of place and alone. she told me about a service that provides free therapy at school but told me i had to get my fathers permission. (i was 15... i found out later that my parent’s signature is unnecessary for people over the age of 14 and i still don’t understand why she did this). for some reason, she took it the wrong way and she told my parents everything after i left. i came home to them freaking out because she told them i was going to kill myself, my mom mocking me, and my dad getting really concerned and he would barge into my room multiple times throughout the day and act extremely clingy and it scared me. i understand that they cared about me, but it made how i feel a lot worse especially after telling her i didn’t want my parents knowing. however, i went to the service (at the building, not the school) and i attempted to schedule an appointment. they never got back to me LOL

in junior year of high school (age 17), i realized that my problems are bigger than me and i need professional help. i went to a different counselor (same school, different person) to send a form/referral to the same service (this time at school, not the building) and i was on a waitlist. i told her i had family problems, trauma, etc and i didn’t want my parents knowing and they told me i was going to be on there until after spring break ended (but corona cancelled our school oops) and i had no response until i contacted them two weeks after they were supposed to contact me. i understand that there were many people before me but i would at least like an update or a heads up about what’s going on. turns out, they called my father. he did not allow them to talk to me and told them he was going to the school to report this error because there was a referral two years ago. yikes.

i don’t want to tell my father that i sought help again because i feel like he will take it the wrong way and accuse me of hiding things from him. i know that online sources exist but i am a bit skeptical and i cant pay for anything. i don’t know if i should tell him? look more into online sources? try again with this service?

435,"Over the last few months, I have noticed that I don't enjoy the things I used to enjoy anymore. Everything seems pointless and I can't bring myself to learn. I've been playing with the idea of quit studying and starting something new, problem is, I don't have any idea of what to do. If anyone has any suggestions, please help me. I'm going to list some things I usually enjoy below:

I don't mind repetitive work, as long as it is not the same thing. Working excel lists all day, just doing maintenance? No problem, if I can sort dice the next. (just random examples with no connection other than both being repetitive tasks)

I don't mind working alone nor do I dislike company. Being alone for too long isn't good for me, because I don't really like myself that much, but I need time to work on just that.

I don't mind working with kids. I don't mind getting dirty. I am quite fit and don't mind training or physical work in general. 

I have been playing with the idea of becoming a programmer, but I'm still unsure. 


The things I don't like, are mostly having nothing to do, high end mathematics, mechanics and electronics. I can't bring myself to enjoy these subjects. Mathematics is somewhat special, I don't mind anything that I can remotely visualise, but as soon as I need to find the 6th vector subspace (not native English speaker) or some other vague idea that I will never ever get to use, my brain just refuses to work.


To everyone still reading, thank you for your time. If you have any idea, no matter the pay, please share it. I want to feel like myself again and I want to enjoy Hobbys again.

Tldr: Don't like current study, need advice and suggestions",18May2020,1
436,"I am only attracted to girls who are slim, but of course with the obesity epidemic, women who are slim are the vast minority. I have been this way my whole life and I don't see any way it will ever change.

As I have gotten older, I tried to do everything everyone tells you to self improve. I became confident, funny, sociable, successful, learned many talents, built up female friends. Unfortunately nothing changed. I even learned PUA in desperation for a few years.

I became a doctor because it's what I wanted to do. Everyone said women would love me then. Well sort of. My female patients love me (they tell me all the time) and I have 5 star ratings on ratemds. Everyone tells me how wonderful I am. But in the dating world I'm still completely invisible to anyone I'd like to date.

I have worked out for years (most of my life) and I intermittent fast most days. I have 11% body fat right now but I'm small. It will take years more for me to gain clean muscle as I tend to gain fat easily if I eat a calorie surplus. I even tried steroids for a brief period but they caused my hair to start falling out so I stopped. It's a continual effort to get buff but it seems without a Magic Mike physique it is also meaningless.

I have gone years without looking for female attention and years of pursuing it. On online dating sites I am ignored by any girl I'd like to date. I even most recently tried going on seeking arrangement thinking maybe that would help. I was willing to buy thousands of dollars worth of gifts and pay tuition for a girl and I still couldn't get one. Either they ignored me from the start or they stopped replying once they saw my picture, as is usually the case for me.

I even had some facial surgeries to fix some flaws and while it helped I'm still not objectively good looking, as I can't get matches with my best photos that friends and family tell me ""look great.""

In my entire life I can think of maybe 3-4 slim girls who have ever been attracted to me in any obvious way. 

If you aren't born white or tall or handsome as a man, is there any hope? Can you get a physically attractive girl in the modern dating market if you weren't born with any of those three things? It feels like nothing I do has ever mattered. Is there anything else I should be doing that might actually work?",18May2020,1
437,"I recently signed a lease to my first apartment and got everything in order to move. I have driven a car for 2 years, but never a 17 foot box truck.

(All structural parts look fine and the truck only has a few inches scratched) I scraped together everything I had to afford the move in. Is the complex going to kick me out?

441,"and it's not just talking about it, it's consistently talking about ""attempting"" and discussing suicidality in an extremely casual way. last night he said ""is tonight a good night to commit?"" and then said he should wait because he ordered a new t-shirt in the mail. and then 15 mins later said he tried to but the belt broke. this is not the first time (or second, or third) that he has said he has unsuccessfully attempted suicide. and i hate to say it but if he truly wanted to kill himself i think he would have done it. he's obviously struggling, but it is disgustingly triggering to hear someone talk about suicide in such a casual way when i've struggled with suicidality and lost people to it. 

i'm not extremely close to him, but the relationship we have is very much centered around kind of venting and offering emotional support. probably 80-90% me offering support. i don't know if i should be upfront and tell him he's fucking with my head. i know how it feels to feel like a burden, and i don't want to cause someone who is struggling with mental illness to feel that way. but it's also like what the fuck am i supposed to do.",18May2020,1
443,"Let’s call him Ryan. He has been at our store for a month now, and he is temporarily transfer from another store. With the whole Covid thing, we don’t know when the temporary workers will be going back and how long they will be staying at our store. Seriously hope they leave soon. Could be a week, a month or longer until they go back. No one knows. 

I’ve always never really bothered to talk to him, I am personally not a social person. Something was always off, but he would joke around with me and I went along with it. I never started conversations with him though because honestly I could care less. One day, he asked why I was so “shy” and I told him I’m the biggest introvert. He then said I must live a boring life. I laughed it off but thought it was odd for him to say that.

Two(ish?) weeks ago, my other coworker (call her Emma), him and I were talking and this kid ran up to us and started asking us questions. I’m not a kid person, and Emma is so she was all bubbly with the child and helped them. Emma came back and we laughed about the kid. Emma said the kid was so cute and said she can’t wait to have kids of her own. We started talking about the topic and when I mention my kids were gonna be cats, Ryan looked at me weird. I laughed and said “I know I’m a crazy cat lady”.

His reply was “you don’t want kids? Why?” And I told him I’m not a kid person, and that I’m not mother material or have the desire. I said that once I get older that might change but right now I find it hard to see my future with children. Ryans exact words were “If you are not going to have children then what’s the point of life?”

I was taken back, and before I could say anything Emma defended me and said that it was my personal choice. That many people now don’t have kids. Ryan went on a tangent about how boring life would be without them. We kind of went back and forth for a while until I just said it was my choice and walked away. After that happened Emma said she felt sorry I had to deal with that and I said I’d get over it. However, over the work periods he kept making comments about it and every time he did I turned down the conversation. Emma said that I should bring it to my manager and tell her what happened. So that what I did (last week ish) and I went for a meeting with my manager. I explained the situation and said I felt uncomfortable. My manager said that it wasn’t work related and she couldn’t change anything because it was his opinion (or something like that). I told her that if she could at least schedule me at slightly different times if possible so I wouldn’t have the same breaks as him. She agreed but nothing actually changed. I asked her the process of filing a complaint if things went on and she kind of told me how, but depending on the situation it might not be deemed as an valid complaint. It would be best to go to my head boss before making that decision. I have no clue what she was trying to say but that’s what I got out of it basically. 

Other things kept happening too...

Few days ago, I was done work and I changed clothes so I could shop for groceries. I was walking down an isle when he saw me and he laughed. I asked what was funny and he said something along the lines of “why are you dressed like a guy? You know that people will think you are gay.”

I was literally wearing joggers and a sweater. Yes the outfit might look more masculine to some but I don’t know why it offended him so much. I told him that my clothes don’t define my sexuality and that I was in fact straight. Even if I was gay there shouldn’t be an issue. He said that it was “weird” and we just left it at that. 

Yesterday, it was hotter out so I changed out of my work clothes and had shorts and a cute shirt on. It made me feel good about myself especially cause I have no where to go, might as well dress up for fun. Ryan saw and said that it was a dramatic difference from the last time he saw me. He told me I’m either really girly or gay. I ignored him this time and kept walking away. Ryan caught up to me and asked why I was so rude to him ever since he came to the store. He said that I talked to every other coworker but him, and I said it’s because I felt comfortable around them. before we got into an argument I just left.

I want to bring it to HR but I’m nervous. He is from a different store and he seems to be very defensive when it comes to his actions. I know that he will twist the story and make me look like the bad person (most likely, he’s told my coworkers I’m a “bitch” to him apparently). I’m really frustrated over it and extremely uncomfortable around him. My manager didn’t seem to care when I talked to her, and even if it wasn’t “work related” it still happened at work. Should I be able to file a complaint or am I over thinking it? Like I said he is temporary so I’m don’t know how that process goes through or if I should just suck it up and let it go until he leaves the store?

Even with the process with filing a complaint I have no clue how to deal with him at work. He always there and there is no way of avoiding him cause we work together. I’m really upset and lost, honestly just need advice with dealing with this guy on a daily basis.

444,"I feel like this is something I repressed and realized about now in quarantine. When I was like 10-11 years old I would abuse my aunts dog. I would put him in his little carrier cage and shake it. He was a small dog and he would cry... I even threw him down the stairs once in his cage. 

I feel so psycho writing this. I feel very guilty and also confused at my past behavior. I’m not a perfect person, but generally I don’t want to hurt others. I don’t want to hurt people. I am not a violent person, at least now i’m not. 

Something to add that makes this situation even weirder to me is that I love animals. When i was little i always wanted a dog. Because of like disney movies and cartoons I always wanted one. When i eventually got a dog of my own i treated him with love and never hurt him. Yet during this timeline where I had my dog and my aunts dog... I continued to hurt my aunts dog.

445,"Recently I’ve been having vivid, horrifying dreams that cause me to be physically upset even after I wake up. It’s always either those or I just don’t dream at all. They get so bad that I’ve begun to fear sleeping (even though I do it a lot). There are three dreams in specific that I remember especially well.

This one happened last week(?) while I was having a midday nap. I was in a hotel like building on the bottom floor. All the rooms had giant windows that completely exposed the inside of the suite. The dining room was right in front of the window. I was eating dinner with my family when I saw another family in the building parallel to ours, also eating dinner. After dinner I was still looking into their home and I saw a dead body in their laundry room. It was in a clothes basket. The grandmother of that family was standing over it with a knife. She saw me see her and we made eye contact. After that I just tried to stay hidden in the kitchen, the only area with privacy. I looked outside and saw the other family walking up to our window, all of them armed with some kind of weapon. I told my family to arm themselves with whatever they could find. We attempted to fend them off with chairs, but that obviously did nothing. My dad took a knife out of the drawer and began to stab each of them. We piled the bodies in the kitchen and walked outside to get away from the sight. When I looked into the window I could see some of them were still twitching. The son of the family began to scream in agony, and so did the daughter. Soon the whole family was screaming in pain because they weren’t dead, just injured horribly. My dad went inside and finished them off. I woke up from that dream sweating.

The second one was also during a midday nap. I got into a knife fight with my older brother while my mom stood an watched. I kept begging her for help but she just stared at me without talking. We just kept taking stabs at each other. He was doing it because it was entertaining for him but I was scared for my life. I woke up crying and sweating.

The third one happened to me yesterday. It was an overnight dream. There was this.. stalker(?) like being. He was invisible, but could show himself when he wanted to. He had the power to possess people in order to talk to me. He pretended to be my boyfriend but at some point I figured out it was the stalker. I can’t remember how but I remember feeling actual stress from it. Then the stalker blackmailed me with photos of myself (you know what kinda photos I’m talking about) to get me to date the “real” him. I also remember running around my house with a laptop while trying to find somewhere private I could videochat with him. He would keep texting me telling me I needed to hurry up. I felt genuine panic because I didn’t want him to show up in my house. My family was home and I was so scared he’d hurt them. I finally found a place in a closet but it was too late. All I could do was sit there while I watched from an arial view as he walked around my house trying to find me. I woke up from that dream sweating (again) and feeling violated and scared.

I need to know if there is anything I can do about these. How do I stop the nightmares? It’s getting too much and I’d do literally anything to make them go away.",18May2020,1
446,"My question has more to do with feelings and stuff than anything moral here.

Personally, I think that the way I feel about him shouting in the building has nothing to do with him. Just has people getting angry in the traffic has nothing to do with the traffic.

So my unofficial stance is that I should put up with it, he is probably in a lot more pain than we all are so who am I to complain.


But then there are also people who can't put up with it, they can't ignore it and some told me it makes them feel crazy when there is people shouting. 


On a similar note, think about the neighbour who doesn't want parties in the building. People get angry about stuff but really they could live with it for a night, get some ear plugs and get on with it.

So 2 different course of action

Mine: you all learn to put up with it
the group: he needs to go the clinic, or any environnement where he won't bother us.


But here again, am I just discrediting the feelings of bothered people?

I feel like I could be saying in a way that their feelings don't matter because they should learn to put up with things.

450,"I’m really not as sure as I was a few days ago about the depth of my feelings


I’ve known this person for a while 

I asked them out and was 100% sure I had feelings for them, I think I do because I **really** care for them and find them attractive 


But days after them kind of saying yes  they asked me about whether I’m really liking them or just experiencing lust 



I’ve never been in a relationship to know how they exactly differentiate 


When I’m with him, the only thing I can think about for the most part is us making out and doing sexual stuff. I’m constantly trying to get us to start doing stuff when we’re alone together which he eventually gives into cuz he likes me too. if we’re watching a movie for instance I’m touching him, which i honestly would probably be annoyed by if I was him cuz I’m like a fly with him being honey


But like even when he’s speaking about emotional stuff I should be giving a lot of thought to what’s in the front of my head is “touch him, we need to do stuff” which I honestly feel REALLY guilty about 



The cuddling feels awesome but if we’re doing that for like 3 minutes and haven’t done any other stuff yet I feel like I have to do more and start initiating cuz it’s not enough almost ( even tho I love it especially after we do stuff 



It’s like his skin is a drug and when we’re together I absolutely can’t get it out of my head. Whenever we’re doing stuff he’s the one that stops it because if it was up to me we wouldn’t be going to sleep, even if we’re doing something other than having sex  


I also have never done this type of stuff as consistently with anyone and definitley with no one ever that I was this comfortable with 




I worry that I’m confusing my feelings and am not going to realize till later on 


What do you think? Any questions you have to help me figure it out?


Edit: we were friends before this and I REALLY care about their physical and emotional well-being


Tl;dr: Asked guy out, they said yes. Not sure if I’m feeling lust or more. When with them sexual activities is likely what I’m thinking about, even during menial tasks or emotional talks. I care about them a lot though, mentally and physically.",18May2020,1

A group of students from the choir (including me) were asked to come in to school tomorrow after school, and record ourselves singing songs in our school uniform etc. so that it could be played for the online mass on Thursday. 

Now for the actual dilemma:

I'm going to have to leave my online classes early and come back an hour later than when I finish, shave and attempt to style my hair (very long right now) in order to record this and look presentable - to my school's standards. Although it is a bit inconvenient, there weren't too many people putting their hands up to do it so I decided I should do it; to help out and because I'm in Year 11 and a leader in my school  (just turned 17 so junior year for Americans?). Despite it being a bit annoying I wasn't too stressed about doing it.

When I told my mum and brother basically exactly what I said above, my mum and brother both said that I should've just not put my hand up. I know it would just be easier to say I can't do it and stay home however my gut (although originally against it) is telling me that I shouldn't just take the easy way out that my mum and brother are suggesting.

my job is to keep an eye over inmates on CCTV, previously, the job description entailed clean up cell after the person is released, so I used to clean down the matts mop the floors, blankets in laundry, pick up garbage, but with this new COVID-19 pandemic, for the safety of officers and other guarding staff, Iam not allowed to go into cells, only professional cleaners are. 

The problem ive encountered is there is a notice in the camera room stating please do not do the above\^ and occasionally an officer will tell me to stop being lazy or gives me that look or just in general ""Oh not this guy hes the worst guard"" I take pride in any job I do and it seems as if not one officer is aware that cleaning staff come in and do so. So my problem is 

My reputation around the office here is slowly going down and I have good relationships with some of these officers and now they are beginning to think Iam lazy, and I have explained to a few of them the notice and said ""Oh my bad then"" but iam still being told to ""check the cells before I leave"" I said ""Sorry man! I was just told not too from this person"" ""Oh well I saw another guard cleaning down the cell yesterday"" and that just makes it look so much worse for me, and so great for them. Should I just not listen to the notice? or keep refraining. I have told like 4 officers, even incorporated it into conversations ""Isnt it weird how we have to get cleaners now?"" ""Huh?

465,"So for work, there’s quite a bit of activity in the whole lifting holding chopping things department, being a cook. I’m always running around and am often getting bruises and small cuts and burns on my hands and arms. Arms less so, but when I’m moving sauce or sliding buckets in and out of my arms they tend to get hurt. I’ve gotten a bruise in this area before, if I remember correctly, and I recently got another. It’s about... An inch and a half long to an inch wide. No problem, I just kept living. It got pretty bad, dark and stuff but still, I’ve had worse. Recently it’s gotten a white spot in the lower middle, which is weird, but maybe healing. But in the last couple days I felt it, because who wouldn’t. In the middle of the white spot, there’s a little bump. A little hard bit, I don’t know what it is but I’m scared.

I’m a crazy hypochondriac so I’m worried to all hell about it. I’m going to the doctor soon, even if I REALLY don’t want to, with all this stuff happening but I’m too scared not too. Idk why I posted this, probably to rant. But what does reddit think? Should I maybe act faster? Cancel my tomorrow and go in ASAP? I need to get my cat into the vet soon too...",18May2020,1
466,"So a little bit of background: I have a chronic disease, which requires me to take immun suppression. I’ve been really well the past years and only was ill, so apparently my immun system is quite strong. 
Yesterday the best friend of my gf had bd (18th) and my gf went over. Apparently about 7 others were there at the same time(don’t know if planned or not, but I assume so) and then stayed for a few hours. We planned to meet on 29th of May, which is less than 2 weeks from now. We both have hard times atm, she is in her A-Levels and needs my support, I have my exams at university. 
I can’t decide, whether I should let her visit me or not, as its not certain, whether she caught corona over at her friends bd. She came over a few times already, but with at least 2 weeks of rare social contact. My parents made it clear that it’s my responsibility and that I have to decide for myself, whether I let her visit me or not. My family is quite strict about the rules due to my medications as they increase the risk. 
Should I let her visit me?
Should I tell her already or wait till after her exams so that she doesn’t have to think about not seeing me as soon as we thought?

467,"I’m 17 and I’ve been in a on and off relationship for the past 3 years. During one of our “breaks” I was upset and got intimate with another guy. This may sound weird but I promise it has something to do with all of this, on the regular I’d get horny as every teen does and I’d get wet enough to seep through my underwear just from being horny. Anyways, while I was getting intimate with this other guy he used coconut oil as lube + he wore a condom. This seemed safe at the time but ever since then I haven’t been able to self lubricate as well as I used to although I can get wet during sex I’m not as wet as I used to be. My boyfriend of 3 years hasn’t complained but while master-bating I’ve noticed. So my question is, could the coconut oil have done this? If so, how do I fix it?

468,"I have had my little parrot for about a year now, and he used to have a problem with biting, but the bird store said to just tap him lightly on the head when he bites and he’ll stop doing it.  That worked for a while and he didn’t bite me.  Then he started to bite again, not sure why, and I tried the head-tap thing, and now he just stops for a second, looks at me, and goes, “CHEEEP”, and then returns to biting me again.  He’s very sassy.

What’s odd is that I don’t know why he bites.  Sometimes it’s obvious that he’s upset with me because I don’t do what he wants me to (like giving him a treat, or putting him on someone’s shoulder who doesn’t want him on their shoulder), so I understand those and don’t fault him for it.  But sometimes I swear he’s like, “Ooo, squishy!” and then bites people’s arms and fingers.  Kind of like how children put everything in their mouths to explore things, almost. 

He is small, but his beak is sharp at times and he has amazing jaw strength, so his bites hurt and can leave bruises, if not break skin, so I’d like it if he understood that biting people isn’t nice.  He also likes ripping the hair out of men’s knuckles, he finds that entertaining.  I also have a vocalization that I do when he’s doing something naughty, and I think he knows what it means, since I used it when I would tap his head to discourage him from biting, but even if I do that, he just stops, yells, “CHEEP” in a, “DON’T TELL ME WHAT TO DO!”, sort of manner and returns to being naughty.

So, bird owners of sassy birds, how do I convince my very opinionated boy to not bite people and to listen to me when I say not to do something?  Is this perhaps a phase since he is a young bird, and he will mature over time?  Thank you",18May2020,1

473," 

I want to make a few disclaimers before i get into the shit show this is .

\- this might get long since it's a span of months. i'll do my best to summarize.

\- it's a sensitive topic- sex and feeling uncomfortable, rape? (this is what i need help figuring out)

\- i truly don't want to trigger anyone so i felt that was necessary \^ . alright so,

i dated this guy, kinda an off-and-on again until we made things ""official"". we were both pretty young, 15. though he was a couple of months older than me. we had the cutesy shit, you know the flowers, gifts, he got me a ring even at some point. all of the cheesy teen stuff.

everything seemed normal, i overlooked the obvious signs of him cheating and being a player.

he mentions the topic of sex a couple months into this relationship, and me being as young as i was, i denied the idea almost immediately. i have been touched as a child and the topic of sex always made me uncomfortable. it took him a good while, i'd say a month to butter me up and convince me to have sex with him. he would make remarks on having sex in public, a movie theater? i declined all of them and his response was ""well, doesn't matter where it is, i'm still going to fuck you"". i should have just left then.

the day comes around that my mom would be out the whole day and he essentially invited himself when i told him that. he came over and almost immediately went for it. pulling me to sit on him and just making out. i was down for that so i reciprocated. this went on for about 2 mins and he starts taking my shirt off, i froze from then on and he asked me if had a condom and i had (my friend jokingly had given it to me a few weeks before) i just gave it to him. we were on this small couch and he tried going in and i had been very tense so it wasn't happening. he asked me then, the only time he ever did, if i was okay. i don't remember saying anything. definitely not yes. i was just quiet. once he saw he couldn't go in with me laying down, he carried me almost and plopped me on top of him and sat me on him. it hurt pretty bad. the pressure that girls get. but because i was on top, it just felt more painful. he went at it. i whispered to him to slow down and he didn't listen. he slapped my butt and started asking me to dirty talk, i didn't say much, i don't remember what i said. i just looked out the window that was facing the other buildings and just stared out. i remember just looking at the stars.

he stands up and takes me from the back, still hitting and dirty talking. this is not at all what he said it would be like, and i said nothing. i let him finish. once he was done, the first thing he said was ''so this is what the future will be like"".

i mentioned to him that i was scared of becoming pregnant, he got his friend to get me plan b and told me to take it. i didn't think twice and did. it became so often that i'd have pregnancy scares that i considered ending my life twice because i couldn't bear the thought of carrying his child.

all the other times he had sex with me, (couldn't have been more than 10 x), he made me bleed. not the initial first time, but every other time. i bled a lot, sometimes for days. it wasn't my period because i would bleed several times a month. he would call me disgusting and say i ruin everything by bleeding, now i've talked to girls because for the longest, i thought that was normal, and came to the conclusion that was him hurting me.

i never stopped him. i did whatever he wanted due to the fear of him leaving me. i thought i loved him. my mom found out about me losing my virginity and kicked me out. i told him this and did not care at all, demanding pictures of me.

i've gone to therapy and mentioned this to the therapist and she looked at me and said "".. so you've never actually been raped right?""

and yeah, i don't know what to call it. was it rape if i just let him or was it just the wrong person? just listened to him and did whatever he wanted? it bothers me almost everyday and i want to know what others think, to help me find a name for it. i truly want to get out of this confusion.",18May2020,1

To sum it all up I have always wanted to be a pilot but currently being forced through college at the moment for a path my parents want.

479,"I'm 18M and living with my nan (dad's side) A large amount of context. I hold alot of resentment towards my father due to how he pissed off with his wife and my 2 half siblings for 7 months, barely contacted me, didn't say anything to me when I graduate highschool or got an award for top of a class. He got all the emails from my school, so it's not as if he didn't know.

 I suffer from depression and anxiety and in the first few months I expected him to fly me over to England so I can travel a bit with them. I live in Australia and they went to England and traveled Europe, they went to 20 different countries by the end of it and then proceeded to go to Egypt at the end of it.

They cried poor the whole time saying they couldn't afford it, but they are pretty affluent. Wife is a doctor, father is a software developer. My dad supposedly wasn't working during this time, they went over for his wife's job. Meanwhile my mum was struggling to pay TAFE (which he refused to help with and refused to let me do when I was living with him because you of the Price yet my mum who earns less than half of what he does can) and my school fees. The child support barely covered it.

Ever since I moved to live with my mum it's almost as if they don't see me as family anymore. They've been together for 10 years and I hate his wife. She forced me to do things I didn't want to do like girl guides when I wanted to do Navy cadets or scouts. she said no because it was a 2 day a week thing and too expensive and there wouldn't be enough 'family time's except they never did anything the weekends I was with them( we alternated weekends). My mum said she would be paying because I really wanted to do it so she had zero reason to refuse. she treated me as if I was her kid and did some pretty awful things that I won't go into here. I despised her she also forced me to get ugly haircuts and tried to tell me she knows everything about me therefore she has a right to say whatever to me?? Her and my dad are perfect for each other the way I see it.

I got sick of it and I moved out for the last year and a half of highschool to live with my mum, something I've wanted to do since I was 8 and it was the best decision ever. Except no one on my dad's wife side really likes me anymore. These people have known me since I was 8 and it's as if they don't want anything to do with me anymore. No happy birthday for my 18th they didn't even come to my birthday dinners since I moved out.. it's all a little heartbreaking.

My boyfriend however has supported me and has done so much for me, he's been taking me to doctors and getting the help I need for other medical and mental stuff (I'm trans he's been taking me to a gender psychiatrist and I'll be on hormones in less than a month thanks to him.) He's fantastic, he loves me for my weird side and puts up with my bird who hates him (this will change with treats) he's been especially awesome with helping me with my anxiety, which he also suffers from. In return I do what I can for him. 
Here is the kicker, I live with my nan(my dad's mum) and she had them over a few nights ago for a late mother's Day dinner. I'd been saying I was going to be busy  throughout the week with my boyfriend and his mate, just a drive and some dinner and drinks after. Something we've been looking forward to since the beginning on covid-19. 
We suck at planning though and we only finalized the plans the night before. in the end I told my nan I'm not going to be here and she got angry. She was upset because I'd been over a year since all of us were here, but my thought was well... I'm not their family anymore so why should I be here. My boyfriend did encourage me to stay but my nan threw a bit of a tantrum and made me definitely not want to stay, huffing and going off to her room even when I tried to talk to her she refused. She deflected her frustration to my bird who is in heat at the moment so he's a bit screamy but I'm doing what I can to curb it, new toys, lots of attention ECT.. his screaming causes alot of stress for me also, but I love him to death and I know it's temporary and he'll be back to his cute, chattering self soon. And I also think she is exaggerating it. She seems to forget he's a living thing with natural tendencies and not a toy I can turn on and off.
 But in this whole mess of crap this isn't even half of it. Idk if I should just cut my dad and his wife off but the issue is I love my siblings and don't want to not see them. I did text my dad sorry and offered to come for dinner at their house with my boyfriend (for support) but got no response. I tried. I don't know how to tell my nan I don't forgive them for leaving for so long and she refuses to see how it messed me up at told me to just let it go.. I can't idk if I can or want to though, not without and apology that's sincere at the least.
thank you if anyone who reads this far any advice is awesome",18May2020,1
480,"I started in mid February, and there's only the owner, boss and me that work FT. It can get quite busy at times and summer is the busiest, so I've been told 

The hours pre-quarentine were 9-6, an old employee wanted to skip traffic so they'd stay until 6. The lady that they hired shortly before me worked those hours and took a lunch. (The few times I did stay that late, practically nothing happened)

She quit a bit after shelter in place orders  went into effect (mid-March), so I started 9-5. I don't usually take lunch. While I enjoy the job, I'd much rather get it out of the way in one chunk.

Things are starting to go back to normal, and boss is trying to get us to stay open until 6 again. I had told him right after he initially suggested that I would rather start at 8 and I am not a morning person. He seemed on board and I think went in at that time to judge how busy it'd be. 

But last week he'd asked again if I was staying until 6. I told him I'd really rather not and he very reluctantly said let's leave at 5. 

I'd honestly despise working until 6. I need the evening to relax from the day, and between food, exercise and hygiene, I would not have enough time to unwind.

He's a live-to-work sort of person and is always out on the weekends doing company work. Easily 50+ hour weeks and I am not about that life.

I would just like advice on how to word that? I want the (more assertive) language to say ""I am not staying until 6. I want to work 8-4, or work 4-10 hour days and hire another person if you want that 4-6 time covered and because we are so short-staffed""",18May2020,1
481,"When I say cheating, I don’t mean she has physically done anything to another person. This is what happened:

One day in the kitchen, while she was on her phone (we show each other things on our phones all the time so I instinctively just glanced over) I noticed she had an unopened message from a guy we both know. She had been sleeping with him on and off for a year before we were together. They had had a big fallout, and so I thought that would be that (she told me all this while we were seeing each other because she wanted to tell me rather than me finding out.

When I saw the unopened message, you can imagine a few thoughts started swimming around my head. She definitely noticed that I saw it because she started acting overly affectionate to me for the next few minutes which just heightened my suspicions.

I told myself to forget it, to think nothing of it and just enjoy our ‘near-perfect’ relationship. After all, it’s better not knowing things right?

The next day, after a very restless night, my gf was still fast asleep and the phone was just lying next to me on charge. So I did the unthinkable. I looked at the messages. Let me say right now that this kind of behaviour is very unlike me and I’m not one to peer into other people’s private lives and I’m disgusted at myself for doing that. The thing is I’ve been cheated on in a previous relationship before and it’s probably the thing I’m most terrified of.

I looked at the messages from her previous lover and saw she had replied since I last saw her phone. She had replied something very sexual in response to his sexual message. But I think the most hurtful thing was the fact she had messaged him first saying ‘she probs shouldn’t be checking up, but lockdown is making me nostalgic.’ There were also a few other sexual messages that were sent during our relationship.

At that moment, I felt so sick and betrayed and it reminded me what it felt like the first tim I was cheated on. I didn’t know what to do, so I just carried on that day like usual, and we had such an amazing day. We went a small adventure, had a picnic, spoke for hours with each other talking about the future and that the lockdown has allowed us to spend all this time together (we don’t live together), had a delicious meal,and we had our usual really good sex at the end of the day. This is how most of our days have been spent.

The next day, I decided that if she ever messaged him inappropriately again, then I’m gone. While she was in the shower, her phone was left on the bed. I quickly checked it (again, disgusted at myself) and she had deleted her most recent message sent to him. Currently, I’m not really sure if that’s because she’s scared I’ll see it (which I doubt) or she feels guilty.

That was a few days ago now, and things have been great... except the messages which float into my head every so often.

Do I just carry on and pretend nothing has happened? Or do I confront her about it? Or confront if he messages again? I’m clueless.

Don’t LMGTFY, because obviously I have already done it, I’ve been looking at online stores and amazon. Every item that has even 5 star reviews  also has reviews stating that people had a terrible experience with it, such as that it broke right away or was just of very low quality. Thats what’s brought me here. I’m looking for personal experiences with or knowledge of brands or places to find medical and health related items that are actually of high quality and function properly.  One is an automatic blood pressure cuff, the other is a shower seat for my wife who sometimes loses control of her ankle because of a medical condition. SO...the problem here is, finding decent medical items online is a mess!!! Bad reviews, inaccurate readings, sketchy companies...I can’t buy a shower seat that will break in a few weeks or collapse while my wife is trying to use it. Likewise a blood pressure monitor that tells me my bp is normal when it’s actually high is useless to me. 
Suggestions of brands, websites, etc to find these items, preferably both within the 50-100 dollar range is great appreciated. Again, it needs to be high quality, it is a medical supply after all, but I don’t want to waste my money or be fighting with companies trying to return this crap, I don’t have the time or quite honestly the patience. I just want to purchase two very simple items, which I need, and not worry that they’re going to become non functional after a months. Basically I’m looking for a way to buy directly from suppliers who only sell reliable equipment to healthcare providers. I’m willing to pay a little extra for something that will last, within reason.

486,"Gonna go on a rant, and I'm not looking for help for me, just the person I will be talking about

I have the full story on r/heartbreak, but here's a summary:

I met this girl through Kik, she's depressed and I've been there to try and help her. She helped me a lot and I began to get feelings. I only want to be there to help her, but there's only so much I can do because she lives in Canada (and I, the us).

(Slight ramble, not needed for what I need advice for)
I am at the point now where I would probably move to Canada. Because I am happy when I talk to her. That's all, only happy. I've never felt this way before and I'm sure it's just my brain saying I love her. We talk on Skype, pretty much all day. We fall asleep on the phone together almost every night, and have had multiple days where we talk for more than 24 hours straight.

Now the advice I need, is how do I get her to trust that u am only looking to help her. She often says she doesn't deserve help and that she isn't loved by anyone (wish I could confess, but I'd only fuck things up more). It's an emotional toll knowing that I'm not appearing to help. Knowing that even my BEST can't even help her. And I wish I could cut things off, but I'd hurt too much, and me leaving is the last thing she needs right now. She only sees me as a supporting force. Is there ANYTHING I can do to help her? And at this point, I mean anything.

You can pm/dm me for any other additional information you may need or anything else.

I appreciate any real suggestions.",18May2020,1

Ok so, about 5 days ago. My mom met this guy on Facebook. Let's call him Boris

My mom has messaged him. Boris said he works in Manchester on a oil company. I look at his profile, he seems like a rich dude with a daughter. I've reversed image his photos and found no result.

Now, one day, Boris said that he wants to send a package to our house and wants to visit us because he wants to buy a property here. (For context, my homecity has a lot of factories. Many foreigners have property here, but it's usually from Singapore or China)

Boris also said that he wants to send us a package containing some money and 'gifts' with a fricking Iphone, a expensive bag, etc. But, Boris said that the money is for business purposes, not for my mom.

At first my mom doesn't believe that guy. But, one day after, my mom got a call from the 'airport'. They said they got a package for her. She started to believe that this is real. 

Is this a regular scam? I've traced the 'airport' phone number through HLR search online. It's from a compeletely different far away city. But, I can't rely on it.

488,"Call me weird, but most of the time im thinking something out of nowhere or something impossible things that you can only see in the movies, I've seeing this guy (my bf) for now 3 years. having relationship with him 8 months, half of the time was LDR. I love him so much, and i care about him so much knowing that  he has a lot of issues in his life, including family as the main reason of sometimes he is not fine and depressed. I want to take care of him, to nourish him, to give him a good future. I would give the whole world to him if i could. I am the only one he got. So that is why maybe i don't want to disappoint him in any matter, but to give him everything and to make this guy happy i need to be more strong as he taking the strength from me. Plus this covid19 turns his up and down, and even our relationship got affected. So he came here in UAE month of february to see me, before the covid19 gets worsen, We never expect things that we are experiencing right now, the locked down, the curfew, and all of the things which have connected to the pandemic. But i am so happy that he have the thought of visiting me throughout the situation. He is allowed to stay here for 1 month as what stated to his visa, but until now he is here, due to airport was closed and not allowed to go anywhere. One of the factors of his problems was this. So, as his girl and his partner's in crime the last time we meet while having a coffee, i proposed him my plans. I told him im gonna marry soon, im gonna marry someone for him to fulfill his dreams. I told him i will marry someone and i will send him back to university. ( 1 man proposed marriage to me in awhile and met his family already). But this gone wrong and lead to breakup, he said no, he doesn't want me to get married to this man. And if im going to get married i go marry someone for myself and not for him, if i get married he want me to be happy and not for this things, I told him that i don't want to see him like this, that i don't want to see him stressed that makes me sad and devastated. He is my world. I told him to finish his degree and it will probably take several years, i won't leave him i will wait him.

I grew some balls and talked her, the conversation was going great, but then she left me on read. I don’t know if she got busy, then forgot to answer, but she just didn’t answer back. I don’t know if I should take the chance again and message her. We talked, then I sent a picture of her to one of my friends and she was the one who told me that she is Jays ex. I have no idea if Faith (Jays ex) knows that Jay and I “dated”.

You know what you did and what you did is already done! After that he start telling me don’t panic?? And I asked him if he’s robbing me he said no and if he wants money he said no m. After that he start telling me to calm down and handed me his gun told me it’s empty! Handed it to me after that he start telling me that I can do it again and again! and I was wondering what he exactly he wants or means by telling me that. Until I asked him you mean call the cops? And he said exactly and left while gun was with me while I was calling the cops he left and never came back! It’s Very strange thing as I never been involved in any drug dealing or did bad to anybody. Honestly I had no clue what he was talking about. And until today I have wierdos coming to my apartment in middle of the night to check my place. Does anyone know what could be going on? And what y’all should advice me to do. Police didn’t take me serious and I believe they we’re thinking that I was lying. I smoke weed and I know couple of drug dealers, but I never fuck with any of them in bad way.

508,"Ahhh I don’t even know where to start but let’s just start with the basics. I’m an openly gay male that recently got close with an acquaintance I’ve known for years. He’s straight. Up until a few days in of hanging out (we’ve both isolated for a month before), he didn’t know i was gay but said he didn’t want to assume. Long story short. He told me he was straight and has gay friends and doesn’t like it when guys come on to him. K. Cool. I respect that and that wasn’t even on my radar. Now, we’re hanging out every single day and night. The thing is, he flirts with me all the time. Everything he says is a sexual innuendo. There are just TOO many instances, him caressing my neck telling me he’s my bf, slapping my ass, he once shoved his hand up my ass like it was a joke, that was weird. One day he kept calling me an ass eater and then i was like “don’t threaten me with a good time” and he was like “ewww”. Then later that evening told me he wants us to go get OUR ASSES WAXED TOGETHER WHEN THE LOCKDOWN is finished. He then proceeds to tell me that he loves to get his ass eaten. Wtf. K so now I’m all confused. Then I start looking into things deeper and us spending every moment together for the last three weeks, I started to have feelings for him. Being completely respectful to his sexuality, I would just laugh it off, or brush his hand off my leg when I’m driving or just act “cool”, inside I was dying lol. Then I just thought I needed a distraction. So I started going on a dating app online and chatted with this guy intermittently. We thought it would be cool to go for a social distancing walk, didn’t know how that would work. However, he asked me who I had been texting and I just said oh some guy i was chatting to and he got super inquisitive, wanted to see a picture of him and then told me to go meet him. I didn’t want to, not because he told me to but because I didn’t feel comfortable and true to my feelings. So i stayed. He then bragged for the next few days about how I chose him over this online date. He would joke and say “you’re my bf now”. Anyhow... fast forward. Suddenly he’s talking to a girl, online and they’re sending voice notes, I’m over here like cool. Here’s the awkward part. The girl is my friend. Like wtf. Lmao. Anyhow, I’m cool with it. We’re friends. He still continues to flirt with me and I laugh it off. Then he told me that he feels like they’ve made a soul connection like him and I. Mind you at this point we’ve been together every single day and night for a month. He’s never even met her. I got jealous. I couldn’t hold it. So I told him how I felt. He said “ok, cool, you like me, I’m straight”. He then said “he was joking”, k cool. So I set my boundaries and told him it wasn’t cool to flirt with me. He then proceeds to tell me the next day “I’m not gonna talk to that girl because i realize I’m in love with you”. I can’t tell if he’s joking and I’m going a little crazy lol. So i just laughed it off and said “haha just joking right”? Nothing has changed since. And now when he flirts with me, I tell him to put his money where his mouth is. He still continues to flirt with me. He came out of the shower in his towel and twerked for me. I mean i know this sounds crazy but this is a MONTH and a half of this going on. Yesterday, he asked me to comb his beard. I sat on the couch and ran my fingers through his beard and his hair. It was super gay and i was super confused. I’m not sure what to do. I mean I think it’s obvious as day but I don’t want to make a move on him. I just respect our friendship too much. Also i fear rejection and what if he just loves the attention? Or what if he’s in the closet?",18May2020,1

Hi, those are some of my OC and I would like to know what you think about them. I will add here both their physical appearance and personality.

1. Esair: he is a 25 years old guy he is very tall and sturdy, he has long light brown wavy hair ( shoulders length) and a sparse beard, blue eyes and pale skin (he is a human).He is very kind and selfless, a joker is ready to die for another person and is very protective, that kind of person that will stand out for you without even know you or that will do anything to make someone feel better even if he is a mess too. Sometimes he can say something he shouldn't without thinking it or make is anger take the best of him. He is a soldier but before that, he was a joiner.
2. Vaugan: he is 23, tall but shorter than Esair whit long straight black hair ( middle back length), light green skin (he is a half-goblin) he had big amber eyes, ""vampire teeth"" and he has a lot of scars especially on his torso and his back. He is also selfless but is also quiet, smart and humble he is also sarcastic had very low self-worth and he doesn't even believe that someone can love him because of this he can become very close and defensive. He can be very afraid of doing something wrong and lose his only friend (Esair) but when is calm (rarely)he is very talkative

516,"Long post. Sorry.

Here me out here, I just need some outside perspectives from people who aren't emotionally involved in my life so my friends or family.

I'm avoiding names just incase so I'll be referring to the people involved rather coldly/clinically.

My partner and I own our own home together. After some discussion we got a dog. Our dog isnt even a year old yet and very firmly in the puppy stage so they're naughty and cheeky and still need training to behave, naturally.

Unfortunately... our dog is also scared of strangers and some dogs. He gets over excited by everything. I'm working very hard to get him through his troubles but it's hard. It's my first dog and having one who's reactive and scared just isnt what I imagined. Walking him is a nightmare and stressful and I envy those who can just take their dog for a walk to the park without a mental breakdown.

My partner appears to be very deep into a depression / anxiety episode they wont seek help for.
One minute they're fine then the next they're so cold towards me.
I can tell they're fed up of dealing with the dog's issues.
They use words like: cant see a way it gets better. That they're never happy. They constantly mutter under their breath about 'that fucking dog' I'm a bit hard of hearing so I don't catch the full sentence but I've heard him say stuff like 'only 16 more years' (dog's av lifespan).

Every little thing the dog does seems to wind them up. They get frustrated angry and I dont know how much more I can take.

He's been improving slowly I've invested time money and effort into the dogs rehabilitation every time I comment on how I feel the dog improved even slightly I get shot down. ""Sure. Whatever."" Comes the sarcasm or worse yet that slight head nod and eye roll without saying anything.

I'm trying to deal with the dogs issues and my partners attitude and I'm not coping any more. I can't deal with the constant sighing, huffing, silence and attitude towards me and the dog.

I want the best for both of them but I feel like the only way to lift this dark cloud from my partner is to give my dog up for adoption. Just writing that hurts more than I can deal with but I feel I'm running out of options. I'm someone who can never have kids nor do I want them but I've always wanted a dog but now I just dont know. I love my dog to death but I can't keep doing something if it's hurting my partner too.

I may be being blind but I can only see a few options:

1. Stick with them both try and keep the peace, train the dog as best I can and get them back into their puppy school once lockdown ends see I'd that helps everyone achieve balance and stability but risk my partner's attitude getting worse before then.

2. Give my dog up for adoption to another loving home and hope that it removes the stress my partner is under. But then if it doesn't I'll have just given up my dog for nothing and I will never forgive myself.

I've cried so much these past few months about this and I can't see a way out any more. Either choice I feel I'm letting one of them or both of them down.

What would you do?

Now I'm writing this while crying and emotionally charged and reading back I've pained my SO out to be a monster. They aren't at all. They're depressed and anxious and scared and this is how they're (not) coping with it all.
So please don't assume they're a bad person they aren't it's just a stressful time and I don't know what to do for the best.",18May2020,1

She was one of my best friends but she and two other girls kinda spilt of from our friendship group. I don’t have much in common with them and my friend started to become more interested in the same things as them. That group went through a lot of drama and we’re kind of shitty to us but my friend was never rude to me. She might have been mean to one of my best friends who is the nicest person I’ve ever meet. Anyway at the end of the year they got into a huge fight, I talked to her and made sure was okay (she has anxiety so I just wanted to be a calming voice for her), she said she was done with them. However, a few weeks later they were all good again. I told if she ever need anything she talk to me. That was the last we spoke, because we finished school and didn’t have mutual friends anymore we haven’t seen each other since. I have never been in a romantic relationship but it’s the closest I’ve come to heart break. I see her posting online occasionally and I miss her.

523,"Before I go on about what is wrong I’m just going to say it might make me look like I’m the problem and that’s okay, we can’t all be good people, I’m really just trying to figure out what I should do next. 

So here’s what’s up, I’ve been dating a guy I’ve know since high school for about 6 years and I love him very much. Our relationship is great and we are usually pretty open about our feelings and interests, and I say usually because I’ve been keeping some things to myself and I’ll get to that in a bit. Right now I just want to emphasize that the relationship is perfect in my opinion. 

Let’s get to the problems now shall we, for the past year or so I’ve found myself very interested in women but not in a sexual way, more like a romantic way. Something about the idea of me having intercourse with someone with the same junk as me just doesn’t rub me the right way (if you know what I mean). Men though I find attractive both sexually and romantically but that could be because I these feelings are new and I haven’t dated somebody of the same sex. Now I don’t plan to end my relationship with my boyfriend because of my sexuality, that’s a silly reason to since right now I feel like I can swing both ways, I’m really just curious about what my sexuality even is anymore. Am I bisexual, is there something more specific for my case, or am still just straight, I’m not too sure really. I’ve talked about this with my boyfriend and he’s told me that whatever I feel I am he’d support me as a lover or as a friend and I thank him for that. 

So the next problem, and this is the one where I’m keeping secrets from my boyfriend. My boyfriend has a very strong detest against drug use, and what do you know for about half a year Ive been smoking, you guessed it, the deviled lettuce, Mary J, the green goddess herself, marijuana. The use of marijuana in Texas is kinda mixed right now, it’s not quite legal unless you get cabs from a pharmacy so there’s that, and my boyfriend believes that people who use drugs are dependent, tainted, and lesser than people who don’t. He is especially against smoking and drinking, vaping gets a little more leeway since it doesn’t really smell too much. To him drugs that you get from a prescription is all a person should use, even painkillers or off the counter cold medicine is a big no no to him. I’ve know this about him since before we started dating, and he’s know that I’ve always had an interest in the wild world of drugs. I’ve told him before all the things I wanted to try (nothing crazy of course, I’m aware that there’s things that can mess a person up). If I even bring up the thought of wanting to try any substance at all I get lectured about it and treated like a little kid, my favorite line that he says often when I bring up the subject is how he would see me as   “tainted” in his eyes. I guess I just said screw it and started smoking and baking edibles for myself. I enjoy it very much and I don’t do it often, only when he’s not around or when I’m out with friends so he doesn’t know, I also don’t come home smelling like weed and I make sure I smoke outside so the apartment doesn’t smell either. I’m not sure how to tell him or if I should tell him at all, I know the longer I wait the bigger it’s going to blow up in my face. 

This is where the help of all you wonderful people comes into play, if you can’t tell I’m a mess, I keep secrets and I don’t know my own sexuality. I’m hoping that all of you kind internet strangers can give me advise on my sexuality and how or if I should tell my boyfriend about my secret sessions with dona Juanita, all comments are appreciated even if they are just for calling me out. 

TLDR: I like men romantically/sexually and I like women just romantically, what’s my sexually?
How or should I tell my boyfriend that I smoke weed.",18May2020,1
524,"I have been studying in California for 2 years under my GI BILL. This whole covid 19 hit and I decided to go back to my moms house since the classes were changed to online format. Mom lives in Phoenix, while my stay here my mom told me she was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer. At the same time San Francisco State University finally accepted me for Fall 2020. I really want to graduate at 29 but If I go for Spring 2021 I will be almost 30. Time is precious for me since I plan on going to the police academy right after graduation then to have my Degree and my Police academy certificate at 30yo. 

The downside of leaving for fall 2020 is leaving my mother. She lives alone in Phoenix. She wants me go go to school, but I feel so bad not being there for her during her battle with breast cancer.

(I cant join in on bigger activities with friends since they are usually planned to take place during breaks)

I feel left out and that im missing out and I often get extremly anxious over longer breaks since ut becomes a lot and there is a lot of change

I have tried talking to her and I have talked to my dad who have also talked to her

Dad is on my side but my mom says its bullshit that m dad is trying to push onto me

526,"So,today at almost 6am my mom come into my room (i had waken up already) and gave me the news...And either i dont feel a thing or im confused.

For context,this is the third time that someone from my family line has died,the first one was my uncle which passed away when i was around 4,the second was my other grandma who passed away when i was 9,and i'll sound like sociopath or something,but if i remember well,on her funeral,i made myself cry instead of spotaneously crying in a situation like that.

And then there is my grandma who just passed away today,and im 18 now.

And for a little more context,they all have something in common,which is the fact that i didn't have a strong connection with them,i can barely remember my uncle,i only visited my grandma on the weekends and with the one who just passed away,i have a few memories with her,but still.

I would like some advice on this situation,to know if there is something wrong with me or it's just the context.

532,"I'm a second year uni student that's dreading going home to an abusive mother. My dad passed away when I was younger and after that my relationship with my mum just got worse and worse. I wasn't ever a bad kid, I was and still am pretty nerdy but nothing ever seemed to make her happy. During one of her outbursts she once said ""all you ever care about is those exams!"" After I received my GCSE (UK high school qualifications for those who are unsure) exam results she didn't even bother to ask me about them and just continued chatting to her boyfriend. She frequently used to call me the C word, useless and evil, which is still a common occurrence whenever I have to see her now. She also would repeatedly tell me how I'm just like my evil c\*\*t father and that she hated him.

A couple of years ago we found out she had stage 1 breast cancer, which was around the same time I had to leave for uni. I would call her everyday to ask how she was and my older brother looked after her all the time. After a couple of months my brother (who has mental health problems) couldn't handle it anymore as it was putting a strain on his mental health and job. At this point my mum was much better but she was still acting as if she was dying. She would still ring me everyday and cry down the phone at me. I cant imagine what its like to be diagnosed with cancer but I don't think it warrants manipulating and treating your kids like shit. She even 'attempted' to kill herself by overdosing, we later found out that she had taken 6 pain killers. She managed to call me from the hospital though to tell me what she had done.

However, when I started to come home for the holidays she started to become even more aggressive and the name calling became worse and more frequent. In summer 2019, I was staying at home until uni started again and was working. I would come home everyday and she would shout abuse, accuse me of turning my brothers against her (even though she was the one calling them useless c\*\*ts) and once she hit me round the head causing me to have a panic attack. I honestly felt so bad and came close to committing suicide during those months, I met my girlfriend at uni and she is the only thing that keeps me going. During this period, my mum would lay on the floor and repeatedly tell me to call an ambulance, even though when she was offered mental health help she turned it down. People such as my brothers and my girlfriend have witnessed this behaviour, she's even been abusive to them previously. She is an alcoholic and has been caught smelling of drink at work, I don't think she'll be able to keep her job for much longer.

In February I said I would visit home for the weekend as I missed my brothers and pets. While I was there she got drunk and shouted abuse at my brothers, her boyfriend and I. My brother tried telling her how bad it was making him feel but she wouldn't listen, I had to leave after the first day because I couldn't take it. She was also ring me up to tell me she was going to try to put our cat down herself (our cat is old but not in pain) and she was asking people at work how to do it. I'm just so worried that she is going to hurt our pets.

I have to return home in July as my rental agreement is up, which means that I'll have to self isolate with her for a couple of months and I honestly have no idea what I'm gonna do. I've been seeing a mental health advisor at uni as things surrounding her have been so bad. I've never really been able to talk to anyone about this apart from my brothers and girlfriend. I've never opened up to close friends about it. I guess I just need to know if Im the one in the wrong or if anyone else has experienced a parent like this and what to do. Thank you for reading this post, even though its so long!",18May2020,1

There are many hygiene rules being enforced, but still, I can't help but feel uneasy. I fear that the setting might be depressing or unsafe. 

   My mother works in a health center and I know for a fact cases seem to be increasing again. This will make it less advisable for me to meet him in person, which I was hoping could happen in about a month or so, with due precautions recommended by the government. I guess I'm just having a hard time dealing with the fact that he might get sick or that we won't be able to be together. Even more so because after this he'll be going to college, which means that when it might be finally acceptable for us to meet, he'll most likely be less available. I'm really starting to miss him a lot and I don't quite know how to accept the possibility that it might get harder and harder to overcome that in the next few months.

536,"Hello r/advice, I never thought this would happen. The age were you can have sex is 15. So its legal. We used a condom properly and we got unlucky. Well, we think so. We didn't do a test yet. But my gf hasn't had her period for 12 days. We both agree that we think she is pregnant. She will buy a pregnancy test. So she and I want an abortion. She is very sad and me too. We decided to go with medical abortion. We dont want our parents to know about this. I know that we should. And most replies will be to tell our parents, no matter the consequences. But we really don't. What do we need to do to get the pills. I have bitcoin, Paypal, Visa, bank transfers. Is it possible to buy them on the surface web, or is the only possible way in a pharmacy? 

Oh and btw- Im not happy with the idea of abortions. I have a very conservative mindset about it. I don't want debates on whether or not Abortions are good or bad. Nothing is changing my/her mind. We don't want early pregnancy. And that's that.

539,"I’ve (16 M) been dealing with sleeping issues for about 4 years now and have had trouble eating for maybe a year. I either sleep for most of the day or will get next to no sleep for a week, and I’ve been forcing myself to eat, often getting sick afterwards. I’ve been exhausted and malnourished so consistently I’ve kinda accepted it as a part of my routine. I know it’s harmful and I’m not happy with it and I’ve been looking for treatment for a while now with no luck. I’m usually really good at keeping it to myself and occasionally a small group of friends because I never want to be a burden on anybody, but with quarantine keeping me and my family in close quarters all day long it’s become impossible to keep it under the radar. I try to be quiet when I’m awake at early hours in the morning and if I get sick after eating I do my best to not draw attention to myself, but they’ve noticed. My mother (being a light sleeper) has been telling me off about keeping her up when I’m throwing up at night for the last few days, with little comments here and there since quarantine started. People expressing concern is one thing, but it’s not that. Now that my problems are a nuisance to my family they’ve taken notice and just complain about it. When I go downstairs to interact with them, they always seem pretty cold and bothered by me because I’ve been ‘keeping them up’. Tonight my mother came downstairs when I was throwing up in the sink and yelled at me because the kitchen is closed between 12 and 7. I haven’t ever really been close to my immediate family, and have never felt comfortable talking about these problems with them and anytimes that I would try I was met with disinterest or an eyeroll. I don’t want it to seem like I’m just bashing my family because I know people whose situations are much worse than mine, but their recent observation and reaction to these things have been really weighing me down. More than ever I feel ashamed, guilty, and embarrassed about it and I don’t know how much more I can take before I have an outburst and isolate myself further away from them. Any advice about how to approach them about it or deal with the situation in general would be greatly appreciated.",18May2020,1
540," honestly i've always been like that

its like i attract negativity

im 18 M

and obviously its mostly guys from the same age group

now, one on one, i lowkey dominate anyone, some people don't even look me in the eye

but if its a group of guys, i always avoid them. honestly, im not scared, but god knows how it could end up

i don't really show any signs of nervousness whatsoever, cuz i know that many people say that if you show that you're weak they will come for you, blah blah

honestly, its the opposite, people who aren't a threat are just ignored

but again, yes my heartbeat does go a bit high, but isn't it natural? like even in animals, the same things happen.

but anyways.

is there anything i could avoid it?

one of the ways is to have a predatory attitude, and honestly, i do. i always have a ""ill stab you in the neck if you talk to me"" type expression, but again if its 1 on 10 it wont work. but like even back then when i had a relaxed attitude, honestly, that used to cause even more tension. like the angrier i look the more respect i get almost.

and i've honestly always been like that. like in school, people only were cool if i was quiet (which i wasn't btw) they gripped on any word i said, and paid extra attention to it. its like other people got away with doing stupid stuff, but in my case, like if i was clowning around, it would probably end up with a confrontation, cuz someone would be like oh look at this dick, and then i would respond. but again. no one else got the same treatment.

honestly, why does this happen?

now, dont give me wrong, again, i walk erect, heads up, prideful. is it what they don't like? should i look scared??

its actually tiring and kinda scary sometimes, like there's literally no one i know who gets the same reaction as me. is there anything weird about me? is there anything i should change? cuz again i might literally get stabbed, stares some dudes give me are intense as hell. they want to kill me literally. i really don't get how i trigger and provoke them by just walking past them.",18May2020,1
541,"So I(20/M) work at a fast food restaurant for minimum wage and have been doing so for almost a couple years now. Over that time I started working along side a 16 year old who eventually became someone I see as more family than just a simple coworker. She'd tell me about how the other workers would constantly hit on her and such and despite how much I told her to report them she refused. Now the child doesn't exactly have the best family life to the point where her parents no longer have custody over her, they lost it a few months back. While this was going on she was talking to another co-worker of mine (M/25) and venting to him about how depressed and stressed the whole process was making her feel. Apparently one thing lead to another and he started showing her dick pics and she felt she needed to return the same energy and took nude pictures of herself to send to him. He and I had a confrontation about her before and he said he'd never be interested in a child yet not even a few months ago he was getting nudes from the very same 16 year old little girl. I'm just so angry that he took advantage of that child when she was in such a vulnerable state and had the gall to lie to my face and even admit he shouldn't have any type of feelings for her.

So basically, a little backstory. My dad had 2 siblings. He had an older brother and sister (both who have now passed). My dads brother passed away when my dad was 5 years old. (My uncle was a senior in highschool when he died) and so my dad doesn’t remember him at all. Growing up, my family never mentioned it either so when I found out a few years ago that my dad had a brother, i didn’t believe it at first but I obviously wanted to know who he was what he was like. From what I know, he passed from working on the family car.... but that’s all I know. I know his name, how he died, and the high school he went to. That’s it. 

I have tried to talk to anyone I can about him, but nobody wants to talk about him so I don’t know what really happened and I want to know. (There are technically a few relatives I could try to talk to but with covid going on right now it’s unlikely) 

But anyways my question, or advice is really how do i do this. I tried reaching out to the highschool he went to, they only have yearbooks in the archive but with covid I can’t go and look through yearbooks hoping to find him in a club and go through Facebook to find someone that was his friend or something. So I tried to go online and see if there was a death certificate or something but nothing. 

I’m stumped, I know it’s going to take a while to find answers but I’m trying to do anything I can. If anyone knows of a community that helps with this or anything similar I just really want to know what my uncle was like. Does anyone have next step advice? Anything will be appreciated",18May2020,1

550,"Pre-covid, I was a freelancer/gig worker. I kept a lot of different hustles going all at once. Depending on how you're counting, I had 7 or 8 ongoing jobs last year. I had w-4s through 4 of those jobs, but the vast majority of my income was through 1099 or some other version of self-employment/independent contractor. With the 4 w-4s that I had on file, I was able to qualify for a very base level of UI, but add on the $600, and it's sufficient to live off of for now without having to go through the extra hassles of PUA. 

However, one of my jobs is starting up again next month. The rest of them are gone for the foreseeable future. They're pretty much all related to concerts, conventions, and sporting events in some way. I won't get enough hours to pay my bills at this one job, but I will earn enough to knock me off UI. On top of that, this job involves working closely with immune-compromised people and we've been given no information about their covid status. They say we will have protective gear, but I think we are doing this much much too soon. I am terrified of this disease. I have had repertory problems my whole life and I have barely left my house in over two months. 

So, they're asking for my availability in June. If I tell them I'm unavailable, I can no longer claim unemployment. If I go in to work, I won't make enough to pay my bills and I'm certain I'll have a panic attack. 

I'm open to creative solutions here. Or just straightforward stuff I may have forgotten about. How little availability can I give them while still claiming that I'm available on UI? Can I just say that I don't feel comfortable with the level of exposure and just continue to claim?",18May2020,1

557,"Backstory: So Tinder was doing this free limited time Passport thing where you could swipe on anyone in the world. I don’t really use Tinder to meet people, but it is fun to swipe around and look and randomly talk for brief time.

So I changed my location in the Europe content (not saying which country) and swiped around, matched, briefly spoke to some people, it ended, etc.

BUT, there’s this one guy — To put it simply, I’m very smitten. He’s intellectually stimulating, and we connect easy and we seem so well molded together.

We’ve been talking for several weeks now. 

Biggest downside is that he’s over 7,000 miles away from me and he’s 11 hours ahead. 

Now, I still live with my asian helicopter mom. Atm, we live in home shared with another family — meaning we share a room and the common space isn’t the type of place you can simply hang out in.

Anyway, eventually I’ll have to be on the phone with him when I’m at home. I’ve only spoken to him while I was out. And I don’t want my mom to know HOW I met this guy. She’s the type who shames people who go on dating sites. When I was in high school, she questioned if I was trying to be a slut for wearing a denim skirt. And she’ll even go as far as to yelling. It’s that bad. 

Do I say I met him at my college when he was an exchange student? Do I say he’s a mutual friend of mine?

558,"Hello reddit, 24yo Asian here and I'm considering moving out a few months to 1 year after everything calms down. Currently, I'm unemployed but recent graduate who is applying for jobs within my field (annual US income about $50K-90K depending on and if I get a job). I do want to spend some time saving up and I've been looking through reddit for tips and such but as I said before, I'm very nervous about the aspect of moving out.

For one, my mental health isn't that great and though I've lived with family up until now, I've had near crisis episodes where the worst of it was refusing to eat due to self wallowing. I'm a little afraid that things would get worse when I'm on my own.

I'm also afraid that maybe I'm not grown enough. Growing up it was always the whole ""oh how mature for your age you are!"" but now I get people telling me that I ""have the heart of a child"".

559,"We dated briefly 2 years ago and then we reconciled with each other in the beginning of the year and then we started dating again for a month maybe in a long distance relationship and then she ghosted me so I stopped talking to her and then after that we didn't talk for 1-2 month at all and when the lockdown started she asked me out and told me that she would never do this again to me and will tell me whatever is happening. Since few days she started communicating less and less. Last night she blocked me on Instagram and removed her dp from WhatsApp I asked her about this she told me she deleted her Instagram but if you delete the Instagram the user name wouldn't show and she told me she wants to be alone for sometime and I told her if she wants space I will give her some space and won't bother her. And since long I have been feeling this relationship is not going to last and it will eventually break so I am not that sad.

And then since she didn't deleted the Instagram I thought of checking up her profile from my sister's phone and then I saw that she has changed her dp with his ex best friend. A Little context here she told me about him that he had been pursuing her to get into relationship with him and would constantly talk about getting into relationship and nothing else and she stopped talking to him but the thing is just after she blocked me, she changed her dp with him and I am confused here that should I confront about this to her or just leave her alone as she told. Can you guys give me some suggestions as what to do as far as I know these relationship is over but I just can't sit here and wonder what actually happened.",18May2020,1
560,"Hello reddit, 24yo Asian here and I'm considering moving out a few months to 1 year after everything calms down. Currently, I'm unemployed but recent graduate who is looking at and applying for jobs within my field (annual US income about $50K-90K depending on and if I get a job). I do want to spend some time saving up and I've been looking through reddit for tips and such but as I said before, I'm very nervous about the aspect of moving out.

For one, my mental health isn't that great and though I've lived with family up until now, I've had near crisis episodes where the worst of it was refusing to eat due to self wallowing. I'm a little afraid that things would get worse when I'm on my own.

I'm also afraid that maybe I'm not grown enough. Growing up it was always the whole ""oh how mature for your age you are!"" but now I get people telling me that I ""have the heart of a child"".

566,"I’ve been trying to figure out how to phrase this but I’m seeking advice or even experiences that contradict my negative view on life

My opinion on it is that the way we’ve built our society crushes the average person. And without the human desire to remain living and the societal view we’ve grown accustomed too that suicide would be common place. I just see that for most people there is no benefit from living, and I agree that friends and families are indeed something to cherish in of itself and is a contradiction to my very own point, but are years of emotional staleness and boredom worth living for just because of friends and family? 
My main issue, I believe stems from the sheer amount of escapism that most of the population relies on just to make it through the week. The idea of continuing to work and be a cog in the machine until the day we drop dead with the only relief of escaping into television, video games, drugs, sex etc. All seems so bleak in my perspective. I’m personally stuck in this thought of I cannot become magically happy, I’ll remain this way even with medication and therapy until I pass away, which is completely fine but what is the point of waiting until I’m an old man? If all my life will consist of is working, escaping into some form of altered reality and being around people who I love but don’t bring me any joy then why would I do that? What would be the benefit of struggling through life chasing even the slightest increase of happiness. And without people is the only happiness I’ll feel in my life when I’m escaping it? 
That was a personal kind of message and I know my question is for the population on a whole but I’m concerned that many people feel the same as I do, but have just accepted it. And if that’s true then it’s even darker then I had envisioned. The idea of a society that has just accepted a life of unhappiness with the sole exception of being able to escape and not live their dole lives. 

Unfortunately I ramble quite a bit and make very little sense half the time so I’ll attempt to have a concise question. 
Does anybody have any advice or experiences that contradict my belief? 
Oh and don’t worry I’m not gonna kill my self or anything I’m super vocal with my family about all this. They just can’t prove me wrong or offer any sliver linings on living, i just figures the General population should be able too.

568,"I recently turned up 18. During all of my life I have no companion other that myself. I never had meaningful relationships. I never engaged with people. I never had the common experiences of a teen, I never gained independence, I barely went out of the house during the past eleven years. To the point that all I experience is in my head, or inside my house; everything I have come in contact with comes from thoughts or information sources such as books or internet, despite having great sensitivity towards it, I don't physically nor socially interact with the world, I only think about it , to the point I yearn the sensory experience of it. I sometimes think about a place I visited during my childhood and catch myself wondering on wheter it was a dream or an invention of my daydreaming. During the few instances I go out, I reach the point of crying on the beauty of the outside world, and on its immensity, and on how frightful it is.
I induce sensory stimulation, with visualization, daydreaming, meditation, art,  poetry and the like, but I feel I should probably interact with the world. I actually desperately need to. 
I quited school a few years ago. That place made me terribly unhappy. I was constantly paralized, almost catatonic. It didn't provide any meaningful education, it proved itself completely ineffective an lacking of all objectivity. 
During the few years I been alive I desperately attempted to understand everything. I lived trying to gain an extensive knowledge of the surroundings. Sadly, despite my efforts I still know nothing. 
I never connected aptly with people, not even my family. My social network, apart from my relatives, is completely empty: I don't know amybody, and nobody knows me.
I'm asynchronous. I always seeked an understanding uncommon for my age, though I never developed a common sense, a practical dynamics for the everyday living. The second is not a consequence of the first, I wouldn't replace the scarce rationality I struggled to acquire. But still, I'm dysfunctional and abnormal.
I live with my parents. They genuinely never understood me, they disregard the essentials. I don't resent them, but it urges me to get away. I live posturing in such a way to avoid conflict, for years everything remained the same, rejecting anything that might stir this unbearable dull environment, this basic enclosure of irrelevant things. They don't understand me, their complacency with superfluous understanding kept them from giving me  positive inferences; you shouldn't stablish formal emotional relationships with people you don't thoroughly know, people comment this as being ""too intense"" but, how can someone conform with knowing but a miserable portion of a loving one? Even worse, with no portion but a  malformed perception. They had always treated anything I proposed as the childish hogwash of a brat, even now.
So, they don't comprehend what I envision. They sometimes suggest I go for such or such life, but they couldn't imagine they kind of things I want to do. I cannot keep myself alive for the mere sake of being alive tomorrow, living a pleasing life. An ordinary thing. I seek grandeur for my actions, not for the sake of my ego, but because of a strange feeling of responsibility.
In order to achieve such a thing I was planning to dedicate this whole year to cultivate my performance in the everyday world, to develop basic social abilities. One might think this is exaggerated, but I thought this to be necessary, as I seriously lack any real world functionality. 
But I also need to get free myself from my home life. So I thought I should try and get a work. I don't know anything about that, anything. In that regard, I don't know how to proceed. 
So it might be better to try and make it through university. I desire to find people to talk about reality, and I really need social company. But again, I'm fearing that might be too much for me and I would end failing it because of my social incapacity. This has happened before, I gained an extensive knowledge of a certain thing, bit when the exam arrived I was unable to perform. If I went for that path, I would stay with my parents for several years to come, which, would probably would end up happening despite the suffering. It would be hard to survive by my own, I have no means, neither social means or connections, I'm alone. 
The only thing that kept me alive was this necessity understand and the feeling of responsability, but I might as well just go ahead and commit suicide.
However, how should I introduce myself to the world?",18May2020,1

I've been so stressed the past 3 months more so than I usually am, been thru loss of relationship and baby, having issues with my 8 year old boys extreme behaviour in general, home schooling and lockdown.. there's more but these are the major issues going on now..

I am not a huge drinker at all, and when I do drink it's not high volume. 6 cans max of Canadian club or vodka pre mix. Usually I'm  completely fine.
I hadn't been drinking due to pregnancy and only recent since losing baby ( 8th May) Ive had a bottle of wine or 2 and maybe a couple cans of CC once or twice ...
I was feeling depressed about what has happened I guess as to why I was drinking more often.
Smoking cigarettes alot too and drinking caffeine.

This weekend just past, I was visiting my mum. I drank 6 cans of CC pretty much from 12.30pm - 7pm. I had eaten dinner and very shortly after I stood outside in front of the fire pit and suddenly I felt dizzy and my hearing went muffled.. I felt very nauseated instantly...
The next second I wake up on the ground , my friend holding me and repeating my name over and over. I had fallen unconscious and into the fire, my arm is burnt and bandaged up.
I have never blacked out before this...
That was Saturday night, it's now Monday night and my blood pressure is high ish 165/ 97 and I feel lightheaded and nausea .
I'm scared it's going to happen again...

I want to go to the doctor, but I've been told that if I tell doc I blacked out, they will suspend my license until they find a diagnosis...
I simply can't have that happen.

I'm at a loss what to do, I feel my blood boiling sometimes where I want to scream and cry at the same time. I'm always so frustrated and on edge. My son's behaviour makes me furious and helpless at the same time. I feel like I'm emotionally struggling and hurting from my losses.

I'm an international, first gen student and I was supposed to be graduating this December; however, I failed my science core class by around 7%. 

 I did have documentation that was submitted for the class, and furthermore I did email her numerous times saying I was having panic attacks etc, even going up to her in class in attendance halfway through (when I was near tears and had already had a panic attack in her class and said I needed to be excused)  


She had said over zoom she thought it was “funny” that I had missed her class on a specific day and then had seen me in a class that same day in the evening- I went up to her and said hello and she had told me she was going to email me back (as I wrote a lengthy email explaining why I had missed class that day) but she never did, and she had said she had found it odd I was able to attend the later class and not hers. I honestly didn’t know how to explain this to her, and found it rather hurtful, I didn’t want to try and explain that attending one class is better than none during the day, and that I know the professor who taught that class since sophomore year and he knew about my condition and was very supportive but I don’t know what to do.  


She never responded to my emails and I felt totally emotionally unsupported in her class, however I didn’t really want to bring this up with her as I didn’t think there would be much point or value in the discussion. I’m trying to figure out what to do and I’d appreciate any advice, I feel like a crybaby but the only evidence I would have is that I felt emotionally unsupported in her class, she didn't accept the documentation from SDS as it was submitted late (there was a new system i wasn't aware of in place) anyway...please what are my chances?

I have never got a major achievement/award in my life except acadmics.And I have started feeling depressed because of this. Maybe it's because I have too much pressure on me rn because I have to prepare for JEE exam (in which I have started to loose my interest completely) but I have no choice but to take  to get a good college in India for computer science (which I love and never get tired of learning).I just want to study and invest my time in something that interests me and not something that is forced upon me to do and if I don't do it It will have  an impact on my career(Shitty Indian education system) .My ultimate wish was to go to the US for college but I don't think it would be possible to do so because of this covid-19 situation anywhere soon in the future.

Since quarantine, my team and VP have been scheduling almost daily 8am meetings. It’s usually on topics that I’m only minority involved in, but they’ll request me to join multiple times if I decline.


Today i flipped-Monday morning, as of last night my first meeting on my calendar was for 9am, I planned to sleep in until 8. At 8, I check my phone and a meeting was scheduled for 730am and I was late. 

There’s something about constant meetings when I first wake up that makes me go crazy and ruins my day. 

Am I over reacting? Do I just have to deal with it? I just feel like meetings before 830am are really an invasion of personal time-this isn’t an issue I’m having, but some folks have a hard time with this meeting time because they’re getting their kids set up",18May2020,1

I loved her so much and she did so much for me.

Because you cannot predict your own death right?

I'm not sure if its really useful for everyone, but I think there are some special people that you often think/remember and our families don't know about it and you might want to send something like secrets,  accounts, regrets... ( I will leave it to your imagination).

In the future if it gains popularity I might add money transfer as other option.

I would like to charge for SMS due to different countries but free for 5 emails. (It's not going to be expensive  just like 5$ for full package + multiple people)

For curious people in how I'm going to detect if you are dead there is currently 2 options:

1 - Continuous refresh of status on the app (once every week or possibly month , optional for the user)

2 - I or in the future a team personally check your friends social media/news if you are famous. if you are dead. (optional for the user.)

613," As some foundational background, my family could be considered generally dysfunctional. Firstly, I have never had contact with my father, I grew up in a single parent household and my mother and I have never had what would be considered a connected relationship because she has always kept me distant, and has mental health problems which caused her some serious anger issues in which she released upon me growing up. This made me terrified of her as a kid and years later I'm still anxious around her because I think she's going to explode at any second, and this kind of conditioning, on top of her lack of effort, has lead us to become completely disconnected. But despite all this, she has given me a roof to live under, given me an education, food to eat and tons of gifts at holidays (gaming consoles, etc.) so I am super grateful and I hold nothing against her.

The problem arises in the fact that my mother is still very dependent on her parents. We live a 10 minute drive from her parents house and she visits them every day. She is a single mother to me and my little brother (although I'm fully independent except not having a place to live) with no SO and she hangs out with her mother to fill her social life. She also calls her father whenever she has a problem, to which he always comes to sort out. This also includes any maternal responsibility that she has, it's always passed onto him. For one example, I will ask for a lift from my uni accommodation to home, to which she will tell me to just contact her dad instead. When i ask her why she wont pick me up herself, she says ""cos I'm working."" even though she works 9-3pm mon-fri. There has been countless events of the ""just let my parents do it"" behavior throughout my life.

The main problem is that my grandfather has a serious form of NPD. He is extremely controlling and aggressive. For example, he doesn't let my 50 year old mother drive to certain places over a certain distance without him taking the wheel. Everything is always made out to be a competition, I can not just have a normal conversation with him, he will talk you down and turn it into a competition and start talking about something he did 10 years ago. He also has hateful tendencies, such that he is openly racist, homophobic, sexist, and in the past he has picked physical fights with strangers over petty little things in the past. He is manipulative and will make sly comments towards you thinking you never notice. There have also been numerous episodes of his that resulted in him openly punching my grandmother in the arm when the family was around (which went ignored by the way). My grandmother goes along with everything my grandfather says or does, he basically controls her it seems like. My mother is just clueless, and she is basically an adult-child. They both ignore my grandfathers toxic personality and behaviours.

I started University last year, meaning that for the first time I was away from my family. I decided to start distancing myself from my grandfather whilst I was away. I ghosted all of his messages and muted him on messenger. This is where I think I may be TA... Initially my plan was that I wanted my time at uni to be away from my family, then when I return home in the holidays I will just just persevere through the toxic behaviour again, and repeat until I was able enough to move out to my own place after graduation. Since COVID-19 started I have had to move back to my mothers house and I haven't visited my grandparents house for obvious reasons... since a kid me, my mother and my little brother visit their house on sundays for dinner, and that was taken as fact, my mother would never let me make my own decision on whether I want to go or not, and still doesn't.

But now it seems like somethings been happening in the background. My mother has still been going to visit them still and there's been a recent weird pattern of behavior where yesterday my 8 year old brother returned home from my grandparents house (who I have a great relationship with) and started making fun of me out of nowhere about how I never leave my room and how I'm useless and this and that, which he has never done before. I told him to stop, and my first guess was that they've been talking behind my back and he's picked it up. Then today my grandfather visited my mum to do some housework, and before leaving he came in to my room and said ""suffering away are you?"" and I said what... then he said ""when are you going to come to ours then?"" and I replied ""I don't know really"" and before I could finish my sentence he then became aggressive and said ""do you want me to draw you a map then?"" and then left. I've also found out that they have made a group chat without me in it, and the one that I am in has had no activity in months.

Now, my mum is treating me weirdly too. She pushed my little brother when I was playing with him in the garden, and had patronizing behavior towards me. The kind of behavior you see from kids when their friend is playing with someone that they don't like... now, it isn't unusual for my mum to portray child-like behavior, but this was just straight up bullying towards my little brother and blatantly aimed towards me.

616," 

I recently met a person on Reddit. We started talking and she revealed some very disturbing things about her life. I don't want to get into it since it's private information, but she was doing things that she definitely shouldn't be doing at her age. I requested to help her, but at this point we had talked for almost 6 hours and it was 5 a.m, so we both went to bed. Today I found out that her account has been deleted. I'm very sure that she didn't do this herself. My main theories as to why her account is deleted are: 1. Her parents may have deleted it. She told me that she has very strict parents. They may have installed software on her phone so they can see her texts since they apparently don't want her to talk to others.

Or 2. She did something that was against Reddit's rules and got her account deleted. Again, I don't want to give out private info, but she claimed to do/send things that may cause termination of an account.

I know her old Reddit username, her full name, what she looks like, how old she is, which country she lives in, how tall she is, her favorite song, some of her 'interests' and I have narrowed down which part of her country she lives in.

Is there any way to track her down/find her new Reddit account if she has made one or find her on other social media?

What she told me is very alarming if true, and is easily enough to get the police involved, but I don't know which police department to contact and she also said that she doesn't want that.

618,"Hi. I have no idea where to post this.. Basically, when i was 14-16 (I’m now 18F), I would go on these websites like Omegle and also other dating apps. Just for fun, entertainment, I was lonely at school...stuff like that. Well basically, there were a bunch of older guys, from like 20 to ones in their 70s, who tried to get me to “date them”, sent me pornographic images, harassed me online (like I mistakenly gave them my number-I was naive-and kept on getting called and had to keep on blocking them). I did many things I shouldn’t have done. I showed my boobs and private area and butt etc over the webcam, I called old men “daddy” and did what they told me to. I even pretended to finger myself over camera because someone told me to, and I didn’t know how. A lot of it was just because it was interesting and exciting, having that attention, and feeling valuable. I also wanted them to keep on talking to me. That’s sad, but I was very lonely and had low self esteem at school. I did enjoy it but it was more like an addiction. I would log on whenever I felt sad or lonely. I would leave later that night feeling so emotionally drained and confused and used. 

I feel very wrong and guilty for this. I wonder how people would view me, like my parents or other family members, if they found out. I’m a good kid and no one would expect that. I’m also scared that somehow someone took photos or videos of me. But more than that I feel confused and a little angry at those men. How could they do that? They were so much older than me, exposing their body, telling me to do things, making me feel valued and beautiful so I would continue to give them what they wanted...

Am I wrong to feel angry and as though they were in the wrong? Or am I the one at fault? Or is it a mixture of both? After all, I’m the one who went on those websites. I was far away from them and could have left.",18May2020,1

The other one was so upset and declared that he was in love with him too and he has admitted that he's gay. This wasn't a surprise because he has always been very jealous of him and harassing. He used to get mad if we went out alone or just about the connection that we had. He started to hate me, he can't accept that the other isn't gay and that he loves me, so he kinda put the blame on me and we stopped talking.

I haven't been diagnosed with anything such as narcolepsy or depression, but even if I were to go for diagnostic tests I will most likely give up, because of lack of energy or get the feeling that I just don't want to be there as I prefer to be on my pillow sleeping and not bother with people and anything at all.

It has now reached the point where I have been a recluse for almost 2 years not in employment and not in education. I now have absolutely no friends and barely engage in communication, because I prefer to not deal with it, but even if I tried I will just be depleted out of energy in just less than half an hour and then I won't even care what is going on around me.

People have always been disappointed in me and how I have performed in education, because of the lack of energy, lack of comprehension skills and fuck all attitude.

I am starting to believe that soon I will have so little energy that I will just say fuck all to society and my life to the point of suicide.",18May2020,1

640,"So the title is exactly what happened. In the bag was wound care, and an all too familiar little baggie of the same type of strong sleeping meds I used to take, stamped with the name of the same psych ER Ive ended up in countless times before. I have had my suspicions that he might not feel too well mentally for a while now, and today it was confirmed.

It is 3-4 hours until he comes home from work and I do not want to hide that I found the bag. It was in plain site in the hallway, and if he really didnt want me to know, I think he would have brought it to his room. Should I see this as a scream for help?

I do want to let him know that he can talk to me, or if he does not want that, I can at any time of day or night follow him to the hospital and wait with him in the waiting room.

How should I bring this up?",18May2020,1
641,"I (23) went to school to get my associates degree in nursing and it took three years. I knew nursing wasn’t for me and realized it during the first semester, but the pressure from my family and getting a degree kept me going. After 3 months of working as a registered nurse, I’m completely devastated and depressed. I’ve been told the first year or two as a new grad nurse is always going to be difficult, but I don’t think I’m capable of dealing with the stress and anxiety that comes with the job for the next year or so. I don’t handle stress well and I don’t want to see myself deteriorating. I don’t think I’ll even make it to 6 months working as a nurse. Other nurses encouraged me to try other nursing specialties, but I’m starting to believe that nursing in general is not for me. I would like to go back to school, but I’m not sure where to start. I’m lost because I truly do not know what to do and currently do not know what type of career I want. I’m worried about choosing the wrong career again. Has anyone else been in the same situation?

I’m currently trying to apply to an honors program. I asked my professor about a month ago to write me a letter of recommendation and she agreed. She said she would have it to me by the week of May 4, however I still haven’t received it. 

I was waiting on final grades to send in my application and grades come out tomorrow. Am I out of line for asking her to send it to me? Or should I wait?

I was thinking maybe she forgot with how hectic things are right now, but I don’t want to push it and come off as rude.

644,"So to make a long story short, when I went to college I had a really hard time the first year and discovered that most of what comprised “me” was rotten and false. Out of sheer despair and depression something sort of saved me, and that was running.

I instantly became possessed and devoted my being to running. It essentially allowed me to withstand the pressure of school and see a “future” for myself that I didn’t either hate or have complete disinterest in.

Well now three years later l, now that I’ve recently graduated and now that I have a chronic injury of unknown cause, (but prevents me from running) I’ve come to realize that this was simply a bandaid for a larger problem.

As far as I’m concerned, if running is not part of my future then I will hate every waking day of my life until I kill myself. I recognize this as a weakness and want advice on how to “fill the void” so to speak. There’s nothing in this world that means more to me than running and since it is completely tied to my physical health...a simple injury sends me spiraling into a depression, but inversely when I am healed I can pull out of it instantly.

645,"Good morning,

&amp;#x200B;

To save you 30 minutes reading I'll try skip over most of the unimportant stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 26 year old male living in WI and I work for a major airline. Due to COVID my employment situation is up in the air (no pun intended) and I think there is a chance that I will not have employment with the airline come this fall. This is not the absolute worst case scenario because I have been aiming for a college degree and to move out of Wisconsin to somewhere with a better climate for a long time now. 

I have never really been a great student and I have made several mistakes along the way.I got into a lot of early debt when I was 20. I had a stroke that put me several thousands n debt, and I didn't take my education seriously. So essentially what I am saying is that my options are limited. I have an associates degree in liberal arts and am trying to figure out the bachelor's situation. But I have a GPA sitting just below 3.0 due to a lot of failures in my first two years after HS and then A-B average afterwards but I failed and dropped a lot of classes early on which screwed me. 

I want/need a college degree, I am from a poor family and my parents earn less than 50k combined annually. I have held onto this idea of a college education for so long because it seems like my ticket out of this situation. I don't really know what I want to do with my life but I just know that a college education is the difference between working class and middle class often. I live in Madison, WI and was not accepted in the flagship school of the state University of Wisconsin-Madison. Which was really discouraging to find out a few weeks ago. I just signed another full year lease in Madison and now I am not attending school here and my job hangs in the balance. I just want out at this point and a hard reset on my life. 

I'm currently accepted into Arizona State, University of Wisconsin- Milwaukee, and University of Wisconsin- Whitewater.  I applied for the Political Science program at these schools for various reasons, but mainly I want to have some sort of purpose out of work and my skillsets have always been more ideological than quantitative. I did well in English and History and horrible in Math and Science is what I am getting at. However, the more research I do the more I am told that a degree in Poli Sci is virtually useless and the people who make real decisions are experts in their field, not just someone with a degree who says they get to make decisions, which definitely makes sense.

Now I am all sorts of lost and having a crisis though trying to figure out my life plan. I am now leaning towards majors in either Stats, Comp Sci, Environmental Science, or Wildlife Ecology, all because they vaguely have things I am interested in, but they all involve things that I am very bad it and did a piss poor job at early in college (Science and Math). I am willing to put in the work to learn those things but it's so hard to be positive and not down on yourself. I feel like I have pigeon holed myself. So I will likely have to retake some classes and ultimately the 2 years I have left of school is realistically 3-4 if I go down that route, however it's still probably worth it right given the alternative of having only an associates or committing way more money for a Poli Sci degree.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if this is all over the place, long story short: I am a poor student who is 26 and has a bad GPA  due to prior fuck ups and no idea what to major in or where I can go with my life anymore. My friends are all content with not going to college and the only person I can talk to about these things is my Ex-girlfriend who is a senior data analyst so she sees everything through a different lens and her POV on job markets can be biased. Someone please help me.",18May2020,1
646,"Hello, people this is my first time posting and I would like some advice. Recently I moved in with my father in law due to loosing my job due to covid. The first week my wife and I saw a lady walking up our street and we thought nothing of it. Maybe it was just someone going for a walk and that was fine. Until it wasn't we were in the house when my wife decided to go to the backyard. I was cooking at the time and she called me practically just after she walked out. She asked me if there was a woman standing at the end of the driveway. I checked and there was a woman standing in front of our driveway looking at the garage but spacing out at the same time. I informed her of this and then she started walked away. Not even 10 minutes later I hear the door open. My wife opened the door and said ""SHE'S HERE."" So, I went outside to see what she needed because at this point she is standing in the driveway 15 feet away from the side door. I asked her if she was lost. She told me she was looking for Frank. I informed her he didn't live here and that we had just moved here. Her dad has been living here for about a year. This resonated with her and she left. We were pretty freaked out at this point but we continued with our day. 2 days later she shows up again. Only this time its 10 pm. My wife went to throw something in the trash and she was standing at the end of the driveway. It was pitch black so all you could see was her face. She stood there for 15 minutes without blinking till the cops showed up. I'm not sure what the officer told her but she headed back home. At this point we are loosing our shit thinking we were going to get killed or something. The cop informs us that she is a schizophrenic who used to take care of someone who had dementia in the house I now live in. Made us feel bad for her because hell nobody chooses to be like that. Then the officer told us that she actually lives in one of the houses adjacent from ours. After this we talked to my wife's sister about it and she informed us the cops have been called twice on this house saying a ""young couple"" keeps banging at her door. I think she might be able to see us in the backyard as we used to visit often. I don't know what her living situation is like but something about her maybe seeing us as the young couple concerns me. She showed up yet again yesterday except this time she was more ""put together?"" The first time she showed up she had a mask and talked to us. The second time she didn't even wear a coat or a mask and it was cold day. Yesterday she came with a coat and her mask on and she didn't ask about Frank. She asked about a woman named Catherine. She said she keeps telling her to go to the backyard. Frank had also told her he was in the backyard. She apologized and left. I'm not sure if she remembers coming the other two times or not. I'm worried because I'm scared frank or Catherine are going to tell her to come inside. Or even think we want to hurt her. I'm worried for her as well I think maybe having to be cooped up inside during all this might be damaging her mental health. I know I'm starting to feel it so I can only imagine. So reddit what should I do? Part of me wants to maybe get to know her and talk to her but I don't know if that's wise or even how to go about it. She lives near to us so I don't see this going away any time soon.

She reached her spending limit on all her cards, she claims she has the money in cash but I’m not sure about that as she has spent nearly all of it that I am aware of on this new project. She then texted me asking if I had my debit card so I could pay for it as her cards kept declining. I never loan anyone money over $20, because of experiences I had in the past but I was so eager to leave the place that I covered it just so we could leave.

I didn’t mean to even see that because it’s none of my business, but it was literally the first thing. Is it weird or possessive or crazy that I got a little sad about it? I just couldn’t help but to think that what I did wasn’t good enough so he had to look at a random woman naked. I mentioned it to him because I wanted to know what was going on and he told me that it was a search from a long time ago that randomly popped up.

653,"Since quarantine hit I’ve been in a group chat with a few friends. It mainly consists of me and a few friends who are very close and then a separate set of friends who are really close. There’s a big overlap though and we all enjoy each other’s company. This chat was really a great resource during the changing and difficult times though. We’d talk a lot and hang out online often. As they do, things have died down a bit. We’ll still chat in there but it’s less frequent, and we definitely don’t hang out as much.

During one of the group’s convos today one of the members was talking about something with another and posted a screenshot from another chat that was half of the group. The one half that were really good friends made their own small chat and that’s where the message was from. It wasn’t a big deal or anything in the convo but my one friend pointed out that they had made it.

Normally this wouldn’t bother me that much. It’s not like the entire group made a new chat and purposely left me out, and they weren’t trying to hide it or anything. It just sucks because some of the people in that group I mostly interacted with through the group chat. I could text them individually I suppose, but I’m not sure if I’m good enough friends with them for that. A couple of my other friends also text these people individually, so right now I feel a little left out I guess. Should I still initiate things and try to have conversations in the old chat?

Also, I know a common response might just be to drop them as friends, but I don’t want to.

657,"I am 24 years old and I am an on-air radio talent in New England USA. I landed my dream job a week after I ended college and I actually ended up really hating it. That being said, it was a great opportunity so I kept it for a year and a half until my dear friend Corona put an end to my position. Now something I want to mention is the whole time I was working there, I was applying elsewhere. Despite my years of experience at records labels / radio stations I never even got an interview. 

I felt like going for my MBA would not only provide me with knowledge that I need if I wanted to pursue a job at a label, but it would also enhance my resume. I got into a fully funded program... but the catch? It starts in September 2021.

So that leaves me with over a year of in between time. And this is where my question begins. I want to take this year by the balls. I have been working since I was 13 years old.

659,"I'm only posting here because r/cathelp isn't letting me post and I can't make text posts on most cat related subs. I just need to get this out. 

My boyfriend and I adopted our cat back in September. She was extremely shy and anxious, and could only go to an adult-only, quiet household. We were more than happy to take her in and put in the work to earn her trust and make her feel comfortable. 

It took a few months for her to warm up to us, and eventually became the most affectionate little kitty I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. I loved watching her progress. Even though she warmed up to us inside of 2 months, her progress stretches well beyond that. Just small steps, like being able to approach us while we're standing, or laying on the bed with us. The quarantine especially expedited her progress, because we were home so often with her. She eventually got comfortable enough to sit on our laps. I was over the moon and so happy she trusted us so much.

Recently, I took her to the vet because she wasn't eating well, and it turns out she has allergies. I now have to put in a lot of effort to keep her comfortable. I have to pill her every day, brush her every day to prevent matting, ensure she eats every last bite of food and bathe her twice a week. 

Now, when we got her, my boyfriend and I decided I would be the one responsible for her, since I was the one who wanted to get a cat. And I don't mind doing all this, I would do anything for her.

It's just breaking my heart, because she doesn't trust me anymore. I do so many unpleasant things to her every day that she won't approach me even when I have treats, she barely lets me pet her, she won't come sit with me at all, and she doesn't come when I call her (she used to all the time, and she would even ""chat"" with me, it was adorable). My boyfriend is filling in, and giving her lots of love, because she doesn't dislike him, he's not doing any of the bad stuff to her. 

Of course I would never ever stop any of the treatment. I just... Don't know how to deal with how scared and hostile she is with me. I'm so upset over this. Am I overreacting? Is there anything I can do to gain her trust back?",18May2020,1

TL;DR: Friend has physical-baseless fears that she asks me to quell...how do you respond to people like this without talking down to them as if they're dumb, while still being respectful towards them but not yield to their every baseless whim?

Example, I've been staying with a friend for the past couple months and because I have a lot of free time while here and she and her husband go to work all day, I help out with chores (along with paying a small amount of rent.) I do all of our laundry and since since its three of us, the dryer is ran several times a week and has been for the past couple of months. It has always made a noise, husband thinks a bearing is loose. But this morning, after I put a load of laundry in the dryer and was getting ready to leave the house to run errands, my friend was leaving for work and asked me to turn off the dryer if I'm going to be gone because the noise makes her paranoid and she wants someone at the house while it's running in case something happens, like it catches on fire. The dryer has run for months like this and nothing has happened, especially not to the extent of smoking or catching fire--isnt that the reality of the situation?  Another example is one time is was daylight and sprinkling rain and her small ankle-height dog was sitting under the porch of the backyard patio.. She asked me to bring her in because she didn't want the dog to get struck by lighting. I told her lighting goes for the highest point (surrounded by two story houses, pool umbrella, transformer on the electrical pole) AND the dog is sitting under the cover of the porch...she said ""So? Lightning can strike diagonally!"" (that's literally not how science works.)",18May2020,1

663,"I was being bullied by this one girl in my class. Horribly. And it was all directed at me for no apparent reason. She just had this one massive hate hole in her heart and must have used me as her outlet. I did nothing wrong to her and owed nothing to her. However, she and I got into the same pickle when where applying to university. Our school didn’t believe that we were capable to attend our desired universities so wouldn’t let us apply. Obviously, I was not having this because this was clearly unfair, but the other girl thought that was that and nothing more could be done, she would just give up and let the school decide her own future (why? If you couldn’t tell already, she’s a hopeless looser). Anyways, I’m not taking no for an answer and of course I’m going to give the school a word, saying they have no right to decide which unis I can apply for, I had the grades and it was up to the unis to decide if they wanted me or not -I should at least try.
Ok, here’s the thing I did that I’m really confused and upset by. At that moment, I thought I would be a good person to defend the girl who was bullying me because we’re both in the same situation, and even though she was too lame to stand up for herself. I maybe just thought that she has so much hate in her heart, then maybe if she got accepted into her dream university she would find happiness (and also she wouldn’t meet a poor soul and university and try to torture them -I guess I was trying to break the cycle of hate or something). So I defended her even though she made my life a literal living hell. After a lot of resistance on my part, the school finally relented and let her and me apply to the unis of our choice.
What upsets me is that we both applied to our individual unis, the bully got accepted into her dream uni, and I unfortunately did not (which was also super embarrassing since I fought so hard against the school to get an opportunity to apply). What kind of karma was that! How come the person who always made an effort to be nice to everyone couldn’t go to their dream uni, but had to watch their tormentor gloat about getting to her dream uni and knowing that she will go on there and have so much fun or whatever.  
What’s more is that I thought that by giving this girl a chance she would at least be happy. This girl knew I helped her and not only did she not thank me (or even stop bullying me) she told everyone that it was her doing, that it was she who convinced the school to let her apply. Ugh! I hate myself for doing that nice thing. 
But there’s still some part of me that admits that the most upsetting part was that the girl didn’t stop bullying me and didn’t get happier after getting accepted into her dream uni. It’s sad because some people will never be happy, because she’s the kind of person who would find any excuse to be unhappy.

TL;DR I regret doing a nice thing for my bully because I know she might have a really great time at uni and doesn’t deserve it (which sounds heartless). Just want to know how I can stop feeling angry about what I did. Thanks all for reading this long post.",18May2020,1

Ive lived with him briefly twice but he was never around because he had an affair and was focused on his ex girlfriend. Now that we're stuck in quarentine together things are getting awkward. 
We've never had a real relationship to begin with because he lived in another state throughout my adolescence. Now that I'm an adult he treats me like he knows everything about me and really underestimates me as a person all the time. He thinks hes enlightened than most other people, is very stubborn, and loves to lecture me. He also demands things like that I use all natural products in his home and we barely have food in the house all the time.
I also have a few half siblings (they're 10 and 5) that live nearby, so they come over all the time. Hes really a big part of their lives so they have a completely different relationship which is hard for me to be around. I dont always agree with his parenting as he let's my siblings cuss, be disrespectful and invade all my space and privacy. He tells me their mom is sort of neglectful so I have to give the kids a lot of attention. It gets exhausting because he'll criticize me for being ""hermit-y"" and ""wound up"" when I finally take some time out of the day for myself to chill in my room (I dont even have a door). When I dont go over to their moms house and decide to stay home alone to work out or have some alone time, my dad tells me I'm hurting my sisters feelings and ""not to ruin it cause the the kid loves me"". At this point my sister is 10 years old and I dont feel I should have to constantly entertain her and hes sort of prioritizing the kids feelings over mine. He also has told me to conserve food when I barely eat anyways. This seems kind of irresponsible to me because he will unnecessarily pick up the kids from their moms just to have them over. We really dont have the money for any extra expenses as he seems to barely be able to afford to feed me.
He wanted me to live with him on and off for a year before I moved in but I was reluctant for two reasons. I knew he would be a pain in the ass to live with but this dynamic is worse than I thought. He also has asked for rent money I really needed to save in order to get on my feet. Since I was 17 I haven't had stability and always relied on family due to constantly moving around, so any amount of money I've had I've tried to save.
He asked for a couple of hundred dollars when I moved in which is fair, and I also started giving him my monthly $200 of ebt as well as a few hundred from my stimulus check. He thought I was only getting 100 a week from the state and told me to save it for a car. However, recently I've started to receive a large amount of money from unemployment and he directly asked if I was getting the extra 600 a week. I told him yes but didnt tell him how much I had. Hes asking me for $50 a week but at this point I'm trying to save all of my money to leave. 
It's not just about my dad, I'm stuck in the middle of nowhere and I dont have a car. Living in the city was much more convenient for me and I'm trying to move back for those reasons. The thing is lately my dads been hinting at buying a house and says he needs two incomes. I dont know why he would even propose this when he clearly despises being around me. I'm starting to feel like I cant trust him and he only sees value in my money. First he tells me to save it, now that I have more he needs some.
I have a friend who wants to move out of his bad situation as well. Hes in the city I want to move to so I'm going to start applying to jobs over there. Ill have enough money by august to move out and live comfortably for about 4-5 months. My question to you all is do you think I can manage finding in a job in this pandemic? Can/should i trust my dad by giving him money? How do I tell him I'm going to leave?",18May2020,1
666,"Hey guys, I'm not sure if I should stay with my dad. I recently moved in right before the pandemic because my boyfriend and I had a terrible break up and I was desperate for a place to stay. Ive lived with him briefly twice but he was never around because he had an affair and was focused on his ex girlfriend. Now that we're stuck in quarentine together things are getting awkward. 
We've never had a real relationship to begin with because he lived in another state throughout my adolescence. Now that I'm an adult he treats me like he knows everything about me and really underestimates me as a person all the time. He thinks hes enlightened than most other people, is very stubborn, and loves to lecture me. He also demands things like that I use all natural products in his home and we barely have food in the house all the time.
I also have a few half siblings (they're 10 and 5) that live nearby, so they come over all the time. Hes really a big part of their lives so they have a completely different relationship which is hard for me to be around. I dont always agree with his parenting as he let's my siblings cuss, be disrespectful and invade all my space and privacy. He tells me their mom is sort of neglectful so I have to give the kids a lot of attention. It gets exhausting because he'll criticize me for being ""hermit-y"" and ""wound up"" when I finally take some time out of the day for myself to chill in my room (I dont even have a door).

670," My dream as a kid was always to become a doctor. I don't really know what specifically drives me to choose such a occupation, but something about being a doctor just draws me closer to it. I have already took CETs and thankfully passed the school that I would like to go to, but my problems are that: I'm looking for a pre-med course that is practical, that is to say, a course that would likely lead to more career options, and that I have already chosen BS Biology as a pre-med (when I filled up for applications for CETs).

The practicality aspect of my problems is caused by my indecisiveness regarding our financial capabilities, I'm thinking that maybe money will be a problem when pursuing med-school.

I know that I should've thought out my future career with utmost care but I was too busy enjoying and cherishing my time as a high-school student (cheesy). I only chose BS Biology because most people told me so, as it is the ""best course for pre-med"".

680,"I've been working at a Dollar Tree since about mid-March, and I already have enough stories to write a book. Since the coronavirus hit the US, and since ""normal"" grocery stores have worse restrictions than ours, we constantly have uptight finks and shitheads from Whole Foods and even Stop and Shop (which is very close by) waltzing into our store and demanding to be treated as if Queen Elizabeth gave birth to them. Often times I usually just tell these customers to get fucked under my breath (rather, mask) or laugh at them after they leave the store, but I have learned to deal with it.

What bothers me more is that I feel like management doesn't fully understand that working in conditions similar to Black Friday on an almost daily basis tends to burn people out, and that most of their employees just need a day to veg out and relax. Yet on every single goddamn day that I have off, one of my two head managers always calls me or texts me about coming in to ring up customers for up to six hours a day. I'm not opposed to coming in to help at all; I'd happily do it. But there'a a problem when they completely disregard my (and my coworkers') boundaries by asking us to come in every day. Hell, I'd prefer it if they just scheduled me to work those days instead of calling me the first thing I wake up.

And it's not like I'm a super important employee either; I was hired as a part time cashier with very basic training that any associate can do. I legitametly don't understand the point in them giving me off days when they're just gonna want me to work anyways.

And when they call me, I have plans for the day, or I just need to detox from all the nosy customers that I have to put up with in a monotonous cycle of ringing, bagging, and PIN pad adjusting. Until very recently, I have been able to get by just by saying that I have schoolwork (I'm in college), yet the semsester ends this week. Yet now that excuse won't fly, and 1. I have no idea how I'm gonna weasel myself out of working on my off days over the summer and 2. I'm gonna feel bad about lying to my boss. Even though I don't wish to work on my off days, I still feel guilty about not going when they call me, because I feel like I'm indirectly subjecting all my coworkers to more work that could've been made way easier with an extra associate. And I also fear that eventually, management will find out that I'm lying to them, and I'll be somehow reprimanded for not coming in when asked.

Two days ago I got a call from my best friend (who is a girl) and the signal were pretty bad inside house so I got outside, outside were my dad,my grandma and my brother, my grandma really doesn't care about that, was only a friend, but my dad and my brother? They were talking about me!! I NEVER ANSWER A CALL BECAUSE THAT, they talk like ""whoa he has friends?"" Like if I were a weirdo or something.

I was in the call and they were secretly talking in each other ears while watching me talk, I wasn't talking nothing important, I don't see my friend since he quarantine started and we really miss each other, but they talking about me freak me out at point when I stopped the call only to say ""What the fuck are you talking about me?"" When they said nothing I was very upset, I didn't end the call that day, I felt his eyes on me and was very uncomfortable.

Recently I've using reddit a lot, I talk Spanish, or better said, we talk spanish here on my country, so I using an English app is weird for all my family, I play some games, watch some videos and read some forums on english and that have never been a problem, but when I said that I'm socializing they didn't like it, it's like if they don't like when I smile to my tablet or phone, I usually don't smile, only do that when I find something REALLY funny or when I'm REALLY happy, so for them it's weird seeing me doing at some weird website/app, or when I'm dancing and singing my favorite electroswing track at the point when they say ""What are you doing?"" And I stop.

Yesterday I had a voice call with someone, and was a call when the other person thought that I was disconnected because I didn't talk a shit in 5 minutes because my mom was present, I don't talk English fluently, so imagine being in a voice call with a stranger who is native English speaker and you barely know how to pronounce it properly while your mother watches what the fuck are you trying to do...

688,"I have lived in this 4 plex for exactly 3 years now. I have an upstairs neighbor. She has 4 children all under the age of 8 and another on the way. She lives directly above me in her identical 2 bedroom apartment. two elderly women live next to one of each of us in their single bedroom apartment. 

When i moved in here i was excited and envisioned a bit of a communal living atmosphere. It has been nothing of the sort. Although I have befriended my elderly next door neighbor (who is deaf btw) I have yet to meet Ashley's elderly neighbor. 

Ashley's mom and dad dote on her and are here every day, several times a day. They live a couple blocks away. Ashley gets all of her bills paid. Gets full assistance, disability for at least one child and child support from the three dads, and she is pregnant again. 

I have tried to engage with Ashley. We have much in common. single mom raising 4 kids, two boys, two girls. (mine are all grown now tho). I made her useful items like a cloth bathroom caddy. like the one i made for my own apartment. I have offered to sit outside when she lets the extremely young kids play outside unsupervised. I have made her and her entire family masks for the pandemic. She rudely and childishly refused all. 

I hear her kids beg her to stop hitting them. They cry far to much. She screams at them and belittles them saying things like ""are you going to cry?"" ""look at the little baby crying"". Still I persist in befriending her. Her parents spoiled her rotten and thus she does not have the capability to cope with the stress of all of her kids. I get that. It is not her fault, nor her children. 

I have tried offering solutions. Illinois is desperate for people and will pay for families to move here (or stay). They will pay every single one of your bills. Yes, there are places in America you can live for free, have all of your bills paid (and are eligible for every single resource Illinois offers). She refuses. 

She is a horrible neighbor. Her children destroy my property, steal. walk in my apartment at will. I am forever picking up their trash. They have no boundaries, manners, respect or consideration for anyone in the neighborhood. We literally had a block meeting about how she can be heard two blocks away as if she is on a megaphone when she has her windows open. 

I have complete sympathy for the people who died in Waco. I hear constant jumping, slamming, dropping, running, banging, drums, balls, and more from my ceiling.  Yelling. Yelling up the stairs. yelling up to her window. yelling down from her window. yelling in the hallway. slamming doors. I sleep with headphones on. Several times i have asked her to stop she simply says ""move then"". After three years I finally reported her. Not only to the child abuse hotline but to our apartment managers. It only got worse. 

Then her parents brand new car was repossessed. Suddenly I occurred to me. They simply want me to move so the parents can move in my apartment. 

What kind of person offers a solution to her problems by tormenting an innocent person they do not even know? 

I dont want this to escalate. I do not want to complain until they are evicted. I dont want to make several complaints to the police. I want her children to be happy. I can not move, I wont move. I can not communicate with any of them. They are rude, irrational and irate. I have tried email, telephone, catching them outside, social media and more. 

How can I solve this problem for the best possible outcome for the children?",18May2020,1
689,"My family is planning to visit me (tentatively incase it’s still not allowed at the time, in which case we would cancel) for Labor Day. We usually go to a small resort with some friends of my older sister and their family, but since they decided to close for the season we were talking about doing it here with just our family. My partner and I recently bought a small lake house, we have one guest room, and I was so excited to host my sister and her kids as they haven’t been able to visit yet. My parents opted to grab a hotel room about 5 minutes away due to space and we all excitedly started plans. My sister called last night and said she wanted to invite her friends and their family and rent a house on the same lake as ours instead, meaning my parents could cancel their hotel and stay in our guest room. My mind knows that this is a great plan and I do like her friends and their kids, but after she showed me the rental I was gutted, it’s much bigger and way nicer than our place, with a much nicer beach. It’s clear everyone would spend the whole weekend at the rental. I tried very hard to sound excited about her plan and told her to just keep me in the loop and whatever worked for everyone else was fine with me, but after I hung up I cried a lot. Part of it i think was that my older sister has never been that interested in a close relationship with me, so things like this have happened in the past. Another part is that my partner and I worked so hard to get this house, and since it’s small I now feel like it’s not good enough and their first visit will be with a direct comparison to a much nicer place. I don’t plan on asking my sister to change her plan, but I’m asking for advice on how to turn my attitude on this around so I don’t spend half the weekend with a lump in my throat and pit in my stomach.

691,"i’m 19, almost 20 and i just finished my sophomore year in college and i’m home for the summer (as of right now). while being at college i’m the happiest i’ve ever been. i’ve been able to meet a lot of new people and i have absolute freedom which greatly reduces my stress. however, when i’m at home i get super anxious and it’s very mentally rough b/c my dad and i seem to always have conflicts and my dad belittles everyone in the family and makes fun of them by putting them down. 

i’m the oldest in my family and i’m also a first generation college student. i understand that me becoming an adult is difficult for them b/c they’ve never experienced it before, but they treat me as though i was a little kid and they don’t want anything bad to happen to me. i understand they have good intentions, but i feel like they’re hindering my growth. my parents have always paid for my car, insurance, gas, college education, etc. b/c they want to provide for me so i don’t have to worry about money. i’ve worked saved up around $28,000 at this point. i’m super grateful they provide for me but they have also tried holding that against me and attempt to restrict me from going somewhere or doing something even if i offer to pay for it, which is very frustrating. i also try paying for things to try and gain experience budgeting money rather than just saving it, but they won’t let me.

i talked to them last night about wanting to buy a car (we’ve been talking about getting a new one) and that i wanted to pay for it to gain that experience, budget money better, and be able to have more of a say in what car i want. it would still be in their name to make insurance cheaper. my dad just said that it was stupid and he felt like i only wanted to pay for it so that i wouldn’t listen to them and ho and do whatever i want. but he said if it was in his name, then it’s like i bought him the car and if i were to do whatever, then he’d report it as stolen and he’d create legal problems.

my dad and i never had the best relationship and we don’t agree on hardly anything but my mom’s more understanding. for the past year, my dad and i have had several heated arguments about if i should be allowed to go do certain things or not. i got all A’s in high school and i have a 3.7 gpa in college and i’ve never gotten in trouble and i’ve never done anything to lose their trust. i just talked to my parents tonight and asked for more freedom and the ability to make my own choices, but they told me i was just a kid who was trying to be an adult and that i need to stop rushing things and enjoy not having to work and be a kid. this is frustrating b/c i enjoy working and achieving things for myself. i also find it frustrating whenever i ask to go hang out w/ friends and my dad tells me no for no good reason other than he just wanted to say no and i should respect him no matter what. a couple weeks ago i mentioned i wanted to get an MBA, but my dad got upset w/ me about that b/c he felt like i should get this other masters in accounting. this is frustrating b/c i feel like i should be able to have a say in what direction i want to take regarding my education. he also told me i’ll never get an MBA and i’m an idiot and he cussed me out some. that’s frustrating too b/c i feel like parents should be more supportive.

well, i talked to a therapist last week and she said she was in a similar situation and the best thing to do is tell them how you feel and move out. i want to try and stay close with my family, but i told them how i felt and that didn’t go well...at all. i feel like the best thing for me to do now is move out (i have a place in the same town as my college for $450/mo including utilities). and i have enough money saved up to cover this upcoming year in college and i’ll have just one semester left. i haven’t decided what to do and i’m probably going to talk to some people for advice, but if i were to move out i feel like that would completely destroy my relationship with not only my dad, but the rest of my family.

There’s been a few points in time where we’ve tried dating for a short period and it never worked, but I always chalked it up to us being in high school and being young. They’ve told me they were in love with me twice before and after some years and them moving on, I told them I had feelings. They don’t have feelings for me at all and we are platonic. I just can’t get over the feelings though... it’s bad. Crying all night, can’t get out of bed... the worst. They don’t know what’s going on with me because of the amount of time that’s passed since they rejected me but all my harbored feelings are coming up now and they don’t get it. How can I get over them? Seeing them with a new person of interest is killing me inside.",18May2020,1
696,So I'm 11 now but since I was young I've always  been crying without my parents knowledge sometimes about nothing sometimes about something how do I tell them I think somethings wrong with me and while I'm typing this I'm crying my eyes  out please I desperately need help,18May2020,1
699,"My best friend and I (both 18) see each other at least once a week. I've recently been robbed so she has stayed the night a number of times in the past weeks. I'm struggling to see if we are just friends or anything more. At night we talk and she pulls her fingers through my hair and brushes her thumb over my eyebrows. And when we say goodbye we hug, she touches my cheek and then we hold each others hand for a brief moment.

This all seems perfect, except for the fact that we where as close to each other physically this time last year. Back then she didn't have feelings for me and we took a break from each other over the summer. Then she came back to me saying she needed me in her life. That she had been miserable without me, dreaming of us being together again.

Of course I took her back but I'm afraid we're going to feel miserable again this summer if I confess my feelings.

What if she doesn't love me? She has said that she's happy that I'm single, implying that she is happy to be able to have me so close to her, but she's also on tinder searching for dates. Now I feel like there are two possible scenarios. either that we start dating or that she finds someone else and we slowly drift apart. Neither of us want to be less than what we are today but I'm not sure she wants to date me. She's said that I'm really attractive or ""objectively attractive"" but at the same time I know what happened last summer because of my feelings. I don't want it to happen again.

I'm going to talk to her, I just don't know what to say.",18May2020,1

702,"Hello all,

So I'm at the point where I have to make a decision pretty soon, and I just want to make sure I don't make a huge mistake.

**TLDR: Living with parents. Not sure if it's wise to move during a pandemic or if I even have enough money saved, but mom is becoming increasingly abusive.**

So I got accepted into grad school and start this August. It's in a city about an hour away. My plan before the pandemic was to quit my full time job in June and use July to look at apartments, search for a part time job, and relax before school started. However, I just received an email from my program stating that it's going to be remote for the semester.

My sister and I currently live with our parents to try and save money for the move. By the end of June I'll have 20k saved up and my sister will have a few thousand saved. I considered just staying home, but our mom is becoming increasingly unstable and abusive. She's emotionally/verbally abusive, has messed with us financially, and is just terrible to be around right now. Arguments and the silent treatment from her are a weekly occurrence.

At this point I need to leave because I can't stay in the house with her any longer, and my sister feels the same. Our mom also just quit her job, so she'll be at home all day long which I know will make things worse. 

So I guess my question is whether my sister and I would be screwed if we still continued with our plan to move in July? We're still planning on looking for jobs, and I'm hoping by January I can try and get a graduate assistantship to help pay for tuition/living expenses. I'm just a little scared I haven't saved enough, and I'm a pretty cautious person so this is a huge step for us.",18May2020,1
703,"My mom is so hard to handle and messes with my head all the time. And I’m exhausted.
I have a strict traditional Indian mom who took a long time to come around to accepting the fact that i have a white boyfriend. She finally says she supports our relationship. But then earlier today, I get a text from her in anger that I spend time with him and that I go over to his apartment. I’m a grown adult living on my own and she wants to tell me who I can and cannot be with. I keep explaining to her how I am more than capable of deciding what I want to do. She says I lost all the values she raised me with and doesn’t know who I’ve become. She says I’m a disappointment to her and that I turned out like someone from the movies who is devoid of morals apparently. I’m just sitting here having a panic attack. She also says that I’m not good enough because I don’t have a masters and that I’ll never find a job or live nicely. I just always hear only negativity from her mouth toward me. She loves to spew it out constantly. I’ve become so fucking tired of it. I’m a college graduate who got my first job and then got laid off due to the coronavirus pandemic, but she thinks I’m a failure for it. Sometimes I feel like dying instead because it’d be easier than dealing with my insane mother. She causes so much distress and anxiety. Any advice on how to handle an overbearing mother? I’m 23 years old and she won’t leave alone",18May2020,1
704,I have friend whose been posting on her ig story that she’s trying to starve herself and i’m genuinely concerned about her. She posted one story saying she’s tempted to kill herself from over eating food. She’s been very public about it on her ig she has like 1000+ followers and her stories are public too. I’m not really close with her anymore since she moved to another country so i don’t really know how to approach her. I don’t know if she’s trolling or not cause a lot of people have seen her stories and it seems like other people are encouraging her to binge eat but i don’t know if the other people are trolling either. I know she’s not the type of person to troll but i don’t really know if her personality has changed since its been a long time since she moved but it would be really shitty if she was trolling but i know she’s better than to joke about these sensitive issues. How do i approach her?,18May2020,1

707,"This is gonna be all over the place so bare with me 

Sooooo I (21F) have been ghosted by someone (29m) who I actually give a fuck about and tried so hard to keep around cause I actually care about them and he ghosted me after 5 months. 

So we were talking about buying a body wand the other week and I bought it. He agreed to go halves with me on it. Toy arrives and he has no interest. Like he will talk to me all day and then when it comes time for me to pick him up he ghosts me like a child. He did this 3 days in a row then totally ghosted me all weekend when he was supposed to sleep over. 

Ha doesn’t have a car. He lives with his mom he is 29 years old and works at a bar as a line cook. I live alone in a 1 bed 1 bath small apartment and work at Walgreens. We are both working at this time in the pandemic but aren’t too bothered by it and haven’t had any big issues until just now. 

I feel that he is not over his ex who cheated on him all the time when they lived together hence his hatred towards black people cause she’s a skank who cheated on him with a bunch of black guys is what I have collected. He has a deep hatred for really anyone who isn’t white which is kinda a huge yikes cause like white people arent that great but whatever. I digress 

He has accused me now of sleeping around when believe mr when I say I don’t. I don’t care enough to. His attitude is enough to deal with. Men are already idiots. I don’t need to deal with more than one at a time. I have been dodging people who are nicer to me than him just simply because at the end of the day they aren’t my man and have no reason to be associating with me if they aren’t my bf or man or whatever. I have no idea if he does the same for me. That bothers me.  I have been cheated on before too and something weird is going on. 

Communication is key and y’all really don’t realize how little effort it takes to send one text saying hey I can’t see you tonight or some bs. This is a 29 yr old man who lives at home with mommy with serious mommy issues who can’t even communicate his feelings and I feel like I have gotten my time wasted. I’m not longer hurt just angry. He avoids me. I did nothing wrong. I cooked for him. I let him stay over. I fucked him good. Like idk what I did wrong and he can’t give me a real answer. I’m so tired of it. 

I know y’all will say leave which is what is in the very close future. I think we are already done tbh but idk what to do. I don’t think I should rekindle anything as much as I would love to cause I do love him a lot but he doesn’t love me back and I can’t handle that. 

But like how do I even get over this. I did everything right or so I thought. I’m not the happiest person and I know I take a toll on other people’s mental sometimes with my attitude but whenever I’m with him I feel happy which is rare. I know I shouldn’t rely on anyone for my happiness which is don’t but he makes it easier to have a genuine smile

So what the fuck do I do now? I don’t do dating apps. I don’t talk to many people as it is which is by choice. Idk I love him but I’m so over being treated like shit for stuff I don’t do. I deserve an explanation. Usually I’d just ghost then too and block all their numbers but this has gotten under my skin. Help. I just wanted someone who pretended to care who gives me good consistent dick and that’s the best sex I’ve ever had in my life.",18May2020,1
708,"I get around $1500 a month from my job, which is a car dealership I'll be getting the new car from. After bills and taxes, I make just enough to put a few hundred dollars into savings a month, so if I take the car, I'll be putting that couple hundred into a car instead.

The Kia runs fine, but it's about to roll over 100k miles. If I'm ever gonna trade it in, I think it should be before 100k because it'll depreciate hard then.

I talked to my boss about a raise and he said we'd talk in a couple weeks after I train the new guy and to see where things stand, but that we'd do something for sure.

I'm the type to have the same bra for 15 years before I throw it out, so I'm not used to getting new things. I wear them out till they're broken and mangled. I want to get a new car before my car is in that state because I want to get this CH-R now while I have some stars aligned in my favor, rather than waiting till my car is a clunker, unsafe and in need of repairs I put off.

We bought the Kia in 2011, when it was 1 year old. The CHR is a year old, so I'd hopefully get another decade out of the new one before I wanted to move on.

712,"I am a college student(PLSCMaj/HISTMin)  going into my junior year in the fall. There is a 3-month contract remote work job listed now for a company where I would be a near-guaranteed hire due to how many people they are trying to hire(200) and the connections I have with previous employees. I'm 20 years old and have only ever worked one job, at a seasonal restaurant where I was planning to return this summer(in a promoted position). I LOVE that job. However, they are closed for the time being and I'm worried if I wait it out, they won't open up this summer. I don't really need the money, I could use it, but I have enough money to cover the things I need to pay for through like January. But I want to work for the experience and a remote white-collar position would help out my small resume quite a bit I imagine. The problem is that I had a very stressful semester(even before Covid) where my anxiety and depression really got bad. I was suicidal at a few points. I think it would be a really bad idea for my mental health to take this job. I am very bad at working from home and this company is known to be stressful to work for and the hours are pretty long. Most reviews on indeed/glassdoor just trash the company. I just don't think that I am ready for it, nor am I ready to give up my job at the restaurant. I need time to unwind and get my head straight for a bit. I don't want anyone to be disappointed in me either. I already told some family members about the job and I don't want them to think I'm just being lazy and jeopardizing my future again.

716,"I Just looked up the term ""gaslighting"" on Google yesterday. I've been reading up on it here and there. I'm pretty sure that's whats been going on in my relationship for over a decade. We have children together. 

This person, we'll call him F, he's been doing this thing to me where anytime I have any concerns about our relationship and call him out for the way he talks to me or treats me, he undermines me, belittles me, makes me feel like it's my fault, tells me I'm too sensitive or dramatic. Every single time, any of our issue turn right back to me. I told my parent ""it's like he likes to stay on top and keep me on the bottom. He's somehow emotionally abusing me."" I've never been able to fully explain it. He can say ""you're stupid"" without even saying those words to me. He does this to me and the kids. One of our kids, we'll say kid 1, does the same thing to me now. I told F, it's almost like kid 1 is playing mind games with me. Our other child, we'll say kid 2, takes the brunt of all of this like me. I noticed when kid 2 started having the same thought patterns that I've had about myself over the years. He asked me one day ""why am i so stupid?""

&amp;#x200B;

This is when I started noticing something definitely was not right. F was emotionally abusing us.  

I was scrolling through social media and saw a meme about gaslighting. I've heard the term before but  never knew what it meant. I googled the term and was blown away. This is it. This is what F has been doing to me all these years and now my kids. I tick off all of the side effects of gaslighting. F ticks off all of the characteristics of a gaslighter. I've been going crazy for years trying to describe to F what he does to me isn't ok. It's messing with me mentally. I'm such a different person from what I used to be. Kid 1 asked me the other day if he could tickle me because he's never seen me laugh. That crushed me. I never really could quite put my finger on why I'm so unhappy but I know now. 

I'm a stay at home mom and have no money. No job ( looking and trying to enroll in school). I got my first job in a very long time, then was forced to quit 2 months later due to covid. I was planning on saving money, to get my own place and get a divorce. So I had to suck it up and try to keep the relationship together. Now, I can hardly look at F. He expects to keep being intimate and happy and fix F a sandwich, because that's my job. To everyone else, he seems like an honest, hardworking father. What if I do try to get a divorce and he does this to other people to make me look like a crazy person? Oh and he has a really bad temper. He's never physically abused me or the kids, but he has punched holes in walls and doors and even left knuckle imprints on our fridge.  I  don't know what to do. I have no lawyer. I can't just leave with the kids because we really have no place to go. I just want some advice or even just someone to share their experiences with me. Please. I'm done and I can't escape.

My girlfriend is adopted and has lived with all over the world dude to her father's career choice. That alone has put a lot of emotional and physiological strain on her. When she lived in Colombia she faced a lot of bullying and her parents did little to help her because they were more concerned with keeping their jobs rather than moving and this led to her having pretty bad depression and self harm. When her parents found out about the self harm and depression they kinda saw it as a chore and patronized her for needing a therapist and antidepressants( from what I understand...this is hard for me to write because I'm not her, but that's the gist of what happened). There's so much I could include in this, but what I'm trying to get across is that her father and mother are pretty mentally abusive with how they talk to her and they treat her like an object and it's really making her worse and worse. Yesterday when I was talking to her she mentioned the only point she thinks they'll ever miss her is when she's dead. I personally think she needs to get away from them and I'm not sure what to do.

I got sent a video of X that had been leaked from what seemed to be a private snapchat story from one of X's friends. In the video X is naked and messing around. They're acting loopy but I'm unsure if they're drunk, high or just acting crazy. In the video (it's 30 seconds long) X is jumping around but at the very end, they say the n word (they're white) and start twerking. The comments on the video all confirm it's X and what they said (they did end it with a not er but that doesn't make it any better, IMO)

I'm very conflicted on what to do. I have no tolerance for (non-black) people using the n word and they need to answer for it. On the other hand, it's a private story and they are naked. The video is leaked so they probably don't consent to having the video up. 

Many of the comments say that no one will 'expose' them because of the fact that they are naked and it's awkward to explain, etc but that they should be.

732,"This is pretty long and rambling but if you can read it and give me some support or advice I would greatly appreciate it. 

.I met my boyfriend 2 years ago and we have been head over heels for each other since. I love him more than breathing and life itself. He came into my life at a particularly hard time. The problem isn't my boyfriend I have no issue with him. But my parents seem to think he is, and his family are the devil himself, they hate him and his mother so much. I love his mother too and they treat her horribly because they think they called CPS on my family. When in fact it was actually somebody else who called and I was the one who filled out the report on it. My family has had a history of horrible dysfunction and iv even been abused by my father in the past. Ever since iv met my boyfriend they have been trying to separate us, so iv kept him a secret for large parts over the next two years and they recently discovered that im still in love with him and now they are threatening restraining orders, (Its not the first time). They are also trying to accuse my boyfriend of molesting me because they blame him for the fact that I am a trans women. I love his mom so much and I used to come to her for advice when I was feeling down or I was struggling with something, she is like a mother to me and I know that she only has the best wishes for me and my future. Once my father tried to kill me in a car and it lead to a lot of fighting in my family and I was asking just for my father to kick me out so I trusted my boyfriends mother and asked her to pick me up if I did get kicked out. Im not a lawyer but im assuming that it would be too late to bring that up in a court case. Whenever my parents would fight with my boyfriends mom it was always over me and she was trying to protect me the only way she knew how. Me and my parents family used to go to the same church and we moved away for a year but now we are moving back to that particular church. My boyfriend isnt there anymore and we have had a long distance relationship together for 2 years now, but his mom still goes to that church so now im worried my parents are going to hurt my boyfriends mom, they already said they were going to try to get her kicked out of that church and bring it up to the church government. Beyond that I am scared what else might happen they have made lots of threats to her to try and get her to stay away from me, she never texted me but I texted her a few times and she didn't tell me so now im concerned that iv hurt someone I love and Im even more scared that we are going back to church. That church put our families at odds with each other for years. Most of the time I was there I was suicidal and my father had me go see the pastor on the issue about my boyfriend where he tried to threaten to remove my fathers position in the church to try and get me to ""renounce my sin,"" he told me that my entire attraction to him was fake. I refused to denounce my sin and on the way out he looked at me and said that he would be there when I come crawling back. He is like 6.7 and tried over the course of our meeting to intimidate me and looked as if he was on the verge of yelling at me the whole time. On another meeting he had me discuss to him what my thoughts were on the situation and I got scared so I lied to him that I didn't love my boyfriend and then he broke confidentiality to tell my boyfriend that I said I didn't love him.

I would really rather die than leave my boyfriend we have been together for so long, and we want to marry each other when I turn eighteen and get out of my parents house, the whole situation makes me want to die sometimes and even besides worrying about the situation that my parents my try to sue my boyfriends mom or even try and sue my boyfriend himself because he is eighteen himself. Iv had a really difficult life and sometimes I really do believe that I would be dead if my boyfriend hadnt stayed with me over these past two years. I dont want to give my parents the satisfaction that they own me, but recently they pretty much told me that I would soon have to chose my boyfriend or my family and that if I chose my boyfriend I wouldnt be a welcome part of the family. Im still a year away from being eighteen and being able to move out so I dont know what to do, Im getting a therapist soon and then Im going to ask them the same questions and ask what I would do. Im not being suicidal for attention which is what my parents might believe, im under so much constant stress and moving back to the area with a church full of horror stories and a cultish pastor and the fact that I might have destroyed my boyfriends mother's life, and that I might leave my boyfriend and future husband that I have been with for two years now and the fact that if I want to lead my life in the direction that I want to that Im going to lose my biological family. Sometimes id rather not be alive than have to deal with all of this. 

I dont hate my biological family im stuck in the middle of this fight and I wish they could all get along, I love my parents because I know they are trying to protect me but they are emotionally and mentally destroying me.

If this goes to a court do I have a chance? What would happen if I called CPS? Would I even have a case if I did either of these things? Im so stuck and I dont know what to do and honestly I can just use support right now.

733,"For background: my mother is severely mentally ill and refuses to get help, so I’m in no way surprised or upset this happened. She also lives 12 hours from me. 

So, last year my stepdad bought my mom a dog. A cute little Shih Tzu who was healthy despite skin problems the breed typically develop as they age. 2 months later my step dad died and my mother moved to where she is now and since then she just hasn’t taken care of this dog. Her skin issues are infinitely worse, she’s constantly biting and making herself bleed, she’s always whining from pain and shaking. My state was one of the last to do mandated quarantines, so a few weeks before it started my mom came to visit and brought her dog. The day before she was supposed to leave I mentioned something about how she might want to take her to the vet and see if there’s anything they can do for her, because she’s a good dog and I feel awful. Well my mom blows it all out of proportion and starts screaming at me and telling me that I have no place to tell her how to take care of her animals, and that I couldn’t do any better, and stomps up to the guest room for the rest of the night. I went to bed later that night and when I woke up the next morning (4 hours before my mom was due to head home, which ended up only being two days before quarantine but after I had lost my job) my mother and all of her stuff are gone, except for this dog. So of course I try to call and text my mom to see if maybe she just went out or something after she packed her car, just to find out that she’s cut all contact with me, blocked my cell and all social media. I want to get this dog some help and adopt her as my own because she’s been with me for a month now, but I haven’t been able to take her in because I’m immunocompromised, and the vets near my house have only just recently opened back up; but I’m worried if I take her to the vet even if I explain all of this they’re going to take the dog from me. I’ve spent so much time with her lately that I really love her and want to keep her but I myself can still barely believe my mom did this, so what if the bets don’t believe me and try to get me for animal neglect? 


Tl;dr: my mom didn’t take care of her dog, got mad at me for suggesting she go to a vet, and has now dumped her on me but I’m scared to lose the dog.",18May2020,1
734,"Next month im going on family vacation to florida. 

The people going: Me (younger brother), my girlfriend, older sister, mom and dad.

My girlfriend has been around for 3 years now and she is super comfortable with my family (she is practically family by now). My sister wants to bring a friend because she feels like she will be left out, but when she does that it turns into this weird vacation of three couples. (this happened before last summer when she brought a friend) (and her friends suck.) I feel like in this situation only people really close with my family should go. Because then everyone can be together and it not be weird. It can stay like a regular family vacation and be fun. We have close family friends that she could bring, but she is instead going to find one of her sorority friends who doesn’t even know my parents first names.

This is really annoying because it turns into this lowkey toxic vacation. I told my sister we would be with her the whole time and hangout and drink with her but she still doesn’t care.

735,"I’ve never posted something on any online forum/community before but I’ve decided to share this issue in the hope of feeling some relief.

I’m a male in my early 20’s who’s approach to any hardship (or just life in general) has always been to keep your head up high and “get on with it”.

Roughly a year and a half ago, one of my friends and his girlfriend at the time split up. Me and this friend were a part of a very tight-knit friendship group, some of us in the group had known each other since day one of school. We would go out every weekend without question, we wouldn’t even ask each other. We’d all just turn up at our local on a Friday night knowing we’d all be there, we had some great times.
A few weeks after they broke up, me and my friend’s newly single ex girlfriend were on a night out together amongst other people, we’d had a bit too much to drink and ended up kissing, nothing more. It wasn’t the wisest move but seemed right at the time. 

A couple of days later my friend found out and was furious to say the least. He wanted to me to come and see him, but he had been drinking so was hardly in the right mind to talk things over. I left him to calm down and agreed to meet him the next day to talk about it. When I saw him he said that he wanted nothing more to do with me and didn’t want to speak to me again. I told him I understood, apologised and left it at that. It hurt a lot losing a friend that I had known for years. Straight away, everybody in our friendship group stopped talking to me, including my life long best friend who was with me the night it happened and said to me “as long as you’re happy, I am”.

I’ve always been of the opinion never to get involved in other people’s business, so when my friends all excluded me I felt very disappointed. I knew what I had done was wrong, and I appreciated that for my other friends the thought me continuing to go out with them, whilst he was also there, must have been very awkward. In the end though, not one of them reached out to ask for my side of the story or to ask me if I was ok though, and that hurt me considering how long we’d all known each other. 

I knew then that the only thing I could do was face the consequences of my actions and carry on without them. 

I tried to put it behind me, but every time I did and things started to go well for me the group would remind me of it again. First it was a post about me on social media. Then they filmed themselves shouting “f*** (my name)” and posting it online. One of them sent me a message calling me a rat and saying that they never wanted to speak to me again. I suffer with anxiety and am a very private person. Whenever I saw things like that on social media for everybody to see it really stressed me out. All I wanted to do was keep myself to myself and forget about it. For a while I didn’t hear anything and I thought it was finally behind me. 

Then today, another one of the group bringing it up on social media and people reacting to it, almost 18 months after it happened. The thing that frustrates me the most is that the friend who I let down hasn’t said a word about it to me or on social media since it happened. It’s always the other ones, looking for a reaction I assume.

Im currently working from home during the coronavirus and when I saw the post, it made me so anxious that I couldn’t concentrate on my work and, reluctantly, finished working early so that I could clear my head. It made me so angry that for the first time in my life I gave in to others and, instead of rising above it, allowed them to make me finish work early. I went for a walk which helped with the anxiety.

I’m normally not the person to do anything like this, but I guess it just got a bit too much for me today. If anybody takes the time to read this it would be much appreciated, just to know that somebody has listened to my day. Many thanks.",18May2020,1

738,"It was late and night and my friend and I went on facetime. We talked and then later we played truth or dare. Mild stuff. Then i was like ""haha i dare you to show me your tits."" Ofc she said no. Later she asked how big my dick was and i answered blah blah blah. Then i asked if she wanted to see and she said yes. so i showed her whatever. So thought that maybe she was more open to showing me her tits so i asked again and she said no. then soon after she said she had to go.

so after the call ended i texted her and said i was sorry for being weird and i didn't really mean anything i said, which was true. then she replies and starts saying that i thought she was easy and wasn't being a real friend. I apologized multiple times and didn't try to defend myself or anything, i just kept apologising and apologizing. I asked her to forgive me and not once did i explain myself i just told her i wouldn't do it again to her anyone else. Then i check back later and i found out she blocked me on snapchat.

740,"I (22M) found out today that my brother (20M) has been drinking alone in his room. My mom found three bottles of rum in his room (2 empty) and we are planning to talk to him as a family tonight. I’ve talked with my parents and they aren’t mad and just want to discuss why he is doing this as civil as possible. For context he works 50 hours a week at an oil shop and spends much of his time at home in his room. We think that he may be stressed about deciding on what direction he wants to take his life and continue on in school, but quite frankly don’t know.

741,"I really hate people sometimes. I have a couple of degrees. I worked really, really hard to find a job in my field but life doesn’t work that way and I just needed a job. I got a fairly decent paying job now in retail, I was very good at my job and was promoted to manager and the pay is the only thing keeping me here. 

It’s a sales job. I have absolutely nothing against it. Was it what I pictured myself doing, no but most days it’s not horrible. 

As a retail manager I have completely different responsibilities from my reps. But sometimes I jump in to help them with a sale. One of the biggest and most important standards I hold my reps to is “no shady shit Ever!” Now mistakes happen. No one is perfect and we do our best to fix them but we are a sales driven store and we have goals to meet as well and I make sure we do that to the best of our ability and in a way that benefits and makes the customer happy. 

Last weekend an older women came into the store. She seemed super nice so I introduced myself and helped my rep come up with a plan that would save this women a significant amount of money, like over $100 a month. She was very excited and super receptive and left the store happy. 

She called into the store and asked to speak specifically to me at least twice a day for the past week. An average of an hour on the phone while I walk her through everything she needs to do with her new stuff (NOT MY JOB IN THE LEAST. I HAVE A TON OF OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES)  but I took the time to help her through everything to the point that she associated me with the sale more then my rep. 

We got very busy a couple of days ago and I couldn’t give her a call back then she called into the store yesterday flipping shit about how much she was inconvenienced and how she was double teamed and pressed into the sale and how could I do this to an old women, and how she didn’t ask us to save her money. And a lot of really hurtful and horrible things. 

I have NEVER, ever, even as a rep helped a person as much as I’ve helped this women. Everything we did was to her benefit. I took time out of my day off to help her, offered to go to her home and help her set everything up several time (again it was a curtesy. me going well beyond my job description, because house calls are not a thing. ) and was even going to pay for the piece she needed out of my own pocket. And I’m barely making ends meet myself as it is. 

She was so entitled that she couldn’t understand everything that I did for her was out of curtesy and not because it was my job. Once the customer walks out of the store. That’s where all interaction ends. And our job is done and she’s someone else’s problem. But. I wanted to be kind especially during COVID time and help her. 

I called her back first thing next day and the same thing. She started venting and saying horrible things to to the point where i was like ok then just stop by and return everything. And she had the audacity to say “well you offered to come to my house before, come get all this shit back cause I have work” I was at a loss for words for a second there. I can’t believe she said that.....  I told that she we needed our register to return it and she’d have to come in and slowly hang up. 

no I will not disrupt my life and work to come and return equipment after everything I’ve done for you and everything  you put me through. No I will not do something that can put me in physical danger after everything I’ve done to try and help you.  

This isn’t even anywhere near the top of horrible interactions I’ve had with customers that don’t understand that I’m a person too and I’m just doing my job and I’m doing my best to help them. I’ve worked with some very sexist, racist, rude, and straight up violent people to the point that I’ve had to call the police several times.  But for some reason this specific interaction has really stuck with me and it’s making me second guess myself. 


I’ve always known what I wanted to do with my life but in order to start my business I need make/save money to fund it. And I’m trying really really hard to do so. I’ve started looking at jobs in my degree again where I don’t have to work with customers but i haven’t found anything near what I’m being payed now and honestly I’m just really down. I’m at a loss for what to do. I genuinely tried to help someone and it blew up in my face. And I just I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t hate my job I just hate dealing with some of the people. I just feel really stuck and can’t help but reply the interaction in my head. 


don’t know what route to take I feel like my entire education was a waste of my time because I’m not using it, not to mention the student loans. I’ve been thinking about going back to school but the idea of taking on more loans and not finding a job again terrifies me. 

Sorry for the long rant. I just had to get it out, I’m sitting here crying while I write this, pathetic I know, I’ll get through it there’s people going through far more then me right now. I’m really grateful to still have a job at this point. It just gets very stressful. Any kinds words would be greatly appreciated.",18May2020,1

745,"context: I was in an abusive household up until last year. When my uncle adopted me, I'm now living with them full time. I refer to my cousins as siblings and uncle as dad. 
Now the title says brother but it's my dad too (this is a whole other situation). (Unresolved issues/trauma he has). 
Anyway, back to the brother. He used to be very loving, and like the perfect brother. Or at least he was in my opinion. 
Now however, him and my dad constantly tease/try to pick fights. 
That was okay at first, but my brother started picking fights with my sister. Little things, but he always makes her out to be the asshole. It became evident to me when he guilt tripped her. 
He's now constantly doing this, doing things he knows will make her angry until eventually she storms out of the room. 
He then acts like she's the asshole, and I don't know what to do with this situation. This started roughly after we were under my dad's full custody and started to refer to him as dad. Is my brother being territoral? Should we step off a bit, or is the damage already done? 
Me and my sister already have enough trauma to deal with (with next to no help from our new parental figures). 
I've tried talking to him, but I can't deal with the victim mentality, and my brother as well as dad demean you if you get emotional.

today i reached out to my history teacher because she knows a lot about law and is the most informed person i know on this topic and i really trust her. i told her everything and she said she’ll talk to the people that handle this type of problems and she’ll text me back asap. i also asked one of my friends whose dad is a police officer and she told me she’ll talk to him and tell me what i should do. i have do graduate and go to college and this is very hard as it is and she’s making it harder for me. today her and my dad told me that i wont make it in life and that i’ll be a failure, that i wont have any money and starve. my dad threatened me that he will interfere in my relationship and tell my bf to leave me alone and reach out to his family (they really dont like him but they’ve only met him once and talked shit about him way before meeting him). my mom knows i really love her and thay i am a very compassionate and emotional person and she once called me when i was with my bf telling me that she feels very sick (knowing how stressed i am with the coronavirus) and told me to come home because she s not feeling well. when i arrived home she started yelling at me and forbid me to hang out with that “loser” anymore. she also used to bodyshame me really bad and wouldnt let me eat. 

my dad told me that xanax was prescripted to my mom back when i was born for this type of behavior that she has, then she stopped taking them after a short period of time. she yells all the time and makes me want to die. my dad is not like this but he’s very influenced by her. my friends told me that i overreacted by reaching out for help and wanting to involve the police. i am living a nightmare. i also have a 7yr old sister. did i do the right thing? am i the crazy one? what should i do? i just want peace and love because i want to be able to focus on my future",18May2020,1

She always gets mad and argumentative shortly after I visit my dad for some odd reason. I visited him 3 days ago. They’ve been broken up for a decade now. And she went crazy how I told him personal stuff which I didn’t. I only talked to him about me because I’m very stressed with leaving uni and trying to get a job. 

She affects my self esteem because I’ve never worked, and she says how can you ever work when u can’t even do simple tasks. Like ok I do mess up but that doesn’t mean I am incapable of work. 

She just always puts me down and I’m on edge around her. I need to get a job, and I need to move out, but the moving out will take a while. I’m just stuck. And The house is just depressing, honestly. 

My mum doesn’t work and hasn’t for a very long time because of health so being stuck together in at home is driving me crazy. Can someone give advice?

She always plays the victim. And she says ‘it’s my life now. My brothers and I moved out when we were in our young teens.’ Blah blah blah.  

But It’s different now. It’s very difficult to get a place, even a decent one.

Sometimes I would have to wait days at a time, like as of today it's been 4 days. We are not long distance. Before quarantine, she still wouldn't see me for over a month. She would ask me about it and make plans but would either just act like they were never made or would cancel without giving a proper reason. Or I would ask her to come over or something and she would just say she can't. 

She seems to think that this isn't a problem. She just says sorry and completely ignores the fact I have had to wait days just to ask her how her day was which she doesn't reply to for another day - a few days. It's the same thing over and over again. Everything's been completely fine before then. I asked to go on a break before quarantine started because it was clear she didn't want to speak to me but I couldn't even do it in person. Then she got angry at me, and told me how I didn't love her. 

I have severe anxiety, and my last relationship was emotionally abusive and manipulative. I feel like I'm worrying too much, and I'm just scared it'll be like my old relationship.

750,"I live with both of my parents, 2 dogs, and 2 cats. 
One of our dogs (Sierra) is 3 years old, we just adopted her a few months ago - A little after Christmas when our previous dog (Gabe) passed away. 

The other dog that’s still with us is Cherie, and Cherie is very old. She’s been with us for 17 years now, but she’s 19 years old. She’s a chocolate lab, which Google told me have an average lifespan of about 12 years. We got Gabe and Cherie together, initially. 

Cherie has no control over her bodily functions anymore - She defecates in the house daily, more often than she does her business outside. This has been going on for about 7 or 8 months now. We aren’t mistreating her, we let them out often. She also has recently started to urinate in the house. Her back legs are very weak in her old age. She appears to be mostly deaf, where we have to yell for her to hear us if we’re 5 feet away. It seems that she’s mostly just confused, most of the time - Cherie wanders the house and walks into a room just to turn right around and walk back out, she spends a lot of time standing for no particular reason (she’s always been kind of lazy, and loves laying down/napping/etc). 

I guess, on to my question - I don’t know if I should talk to my parents and suggest we put her down. It’s a daily burden to take care of Cherie, she frequently defecates on the floor during mealtimes, our house is starting to smell like dog crap almost all the time despite our thorough cleaning every time it happens. We’ve tried switching her diet and giving her meds, but nothing has changed. 

An additional factor I need to consider is that my younger sister (she was 15) passed away from heart complications 4 months ago. My parents and I are still grieving and I don’t know how suggesting this additional loss to our family would turn out.

My parents care a lot about my mental health and have been trying for 6 years to get me help.

How do I/we improve this? My dad is willing to help but we both have issues with not acting on promises like that.

Now I have realize the reason why no one stays in this position long. The owner of the company is some cheap older man who doesn't even have the right number of staff for the business he's running. They'd rather bring in more cars than make sure their employees are happy and thriving. A happy, thriving employee is an important part of a job position— that way you can thrive in the position as well.

The job I am doing is realistically like 5 full-time jobs. And I am the only one working on it, and then get blamed for not physically having time to get to a funding issue for example.

I've just been needing this rant so bad, and when I finally do quit I am going to lay it all out for them like this. I'm actually writing a letter comparing all of the jobs I do and how they all are technically positions, alone by them self.

So, back in December I built myself a gaming rig. 
Ryzen 5 2600x with RX 570 GPU. 

Recently, I have been getting a weird crash, I’ll be using my computer for light loads, such as processing a word document, then go to switch window and boom

Screens go black, RGB keyboard and mouse go black, but the fans are still running. 

This doesn’t happen when gaming, or under heavy loads such as cinebench. 

PSU is a 550 or 600w (can’t remember without taking it apart) but according to the psu calculator I should have plenty of power spare. 



Next issue, my 2600X seems to be thermal throttling... at 72°?!

Hello, it’s not fake.

It’s been a while since I started to see my dad, clearing his history everytime he ask me for help on technical issue on his pc.
He is not tech savvy so I thought it was pretty weird he could do that.

One day, I saw on a word files few links,
Like xhamster/shemale 
I definitely knew what it was, I told my brother, and he was rejecting the idea of it, he told me that it was maybe from another person.

Last time I was on his computer, i tried to see if could see his history, but it was cleared so I tried different method, and there was some cookies for porn site but not anything out of the ordinary, so I was happy with what I got. 

I know I shouldn’t have done that but hey I’m young, and I don’t want my mom being with someone that doesn’t love her.

Fast forward to today.
I think he did not hear me, but when I enter the house he quickly hide his monitor with his hands. I ran to my bedroom.

I know my dad is a grown ass man, he is free to masturbate, but man, there is like a room for things like that, his desk is at the entrance of our house.

I don’t think he should do that outside of his bedroom, but I don’t how to tell him, and I actually don’t want to.

After that happened, I quickly looked at his history and there was a lot of shemale porn, so this is not a one time thing

783,"Just need some advice to give to him or give to myself. My husbands grandmother is around 85. She lives alone, was driving up until recently, and really prides herself on her independence. Unfortunately, her health has taken a turn. While she’s otherwise healthy, she has a debilitating corneal issues that are making her blind. She has to get injections into her corneas to stop the bleeding, but it doesn’t do anything for her actual vision. Because of this she can no longer drive and will have to move into an assisted living facility soon. 

She really goes into detail with my husband about this. She tells him how depressed and miserable she is and how she feels like she will die soon. He feels horrible for days after he gets off the phone with her. We live across the country from her so visiting often (especially now) isn’t really possible. 

My grandmother is nearing 95. She drove herself up until she was about 87, but then her vision and hearing started affecting her and had to give it up, and the next year she had a bad fall. At that point we decided to find a great assisted living facility for her and she absolutely loves it. She is in very high spirits despite being deaf now. 

Our grandmothers live in the same city and have the same financial means. I think it’s becoming hard for me to not be frustrated by how much my husbands grandma is guilting him. It’s hard for him to even talk about her at this point. 

I absolutely understand (though I suppose I won’t fully until I go through it) that the loss of independence is extremely depressing, and compounded by serious illnesses I can’t imagine how terrifying it is. But I feel like telling your grandkids every detail is too much. I’ve talked to him about how hard it was for my grandma and how she loves her life now more than she did back then (she used to talk about how much she wanted to die when she was no longer able to drive, though I didn’t find this out until recently) but apparently his grandmother is completely unwilling to give it a chance, which is irritating because they absolutely have the financial means for her to get to a nice facility. 

I just don’t know what to do or how to handle this or even how to support my boyfriend. I’m not good with comforting people. I try so hard but I feel like, especially in this situation where I have trouble understanding, my comforting just falls flat.

Well, I’ve had to listen to all baby talk since she found out on Valentine’s Day and I have been asked opinions on the nursery theme, on names, outfits, etc. On Saturday, it was her gender reveal party. I didn’t hear a lot of the details for this party but saw on Facebook her mom had made a cake and figured she did family and very close friends. She invited all of our female coworkers except for me. I was never told when her party was or what time it was or even where it was and only knew about it because of Facebook. I still texted her congratulations. This obviously made me very upset because I feel like this was a huge secret and her intention was to never invite me and our “friends” (people I’ve known longer than her) kept it a secret, too.

In 2014 I left the company as I was made partially redundant and needed a full time job. 

  
In 2018 I was looking for a new job and it just so happened that one of the employees at the music shop was due to leave and so I could go back there to fill his spot, I thought this would be great as, because of the small environment, we're all good friends. The older father is also due to be retiring soon, so I would also be there to support some of his lost workload. There is currently 3 full-time staff, the son, the father and myself with somebody else who comes in 1 day a week.  


I have found over the past 2 years that I really don't enjoy the job. One role within my job is demonstrating instruments to customers, which I have been finding increasingly difficult, even with instruments I am good at playing. I feel it may be a build up of anxiety and not being able to demonstrate adds on to this.  


I feel a can't tell them I wish to leave due to the idea that I would be there to essentially allow the father to retire. It would take a couple of months to train somebody to be able to take on the tasks that I perform and I feel any notice period would be very awkward.

Let's just say I recently got over someone that was treating me kinda shit and one day starting ranting to my friend and we realized we were both interested. Now we're both scared to take it further because she lives in the UK and I live in the US and don't know if being an official long distance relationship is worth it. On the other had were obsessed with each other. We called a bit last night and after we ended the call I started crying literal tears of joy because of how happy I was. 

It seems every day I love her more and more and I'm willing to do anything for her. The problem is that I'm afraid of losing her because I love her so much. She's literally the best thing that's happened to me and the thought of her not being there hurts me more than anything I've felt. I get distracted a lot and reply to her messages almost instantly and when she's both texting me or calling me I feel like shit.

I've worked many jobs over the years where I'm interacting with clients outside the company mostly over email (few phone calls and almost never face to face). I am a woman but my name is gender-neutral and used pretty equally between men and women. Because of this, I often have clients refer to me as ""he/him"" over emails.

805,"My uncle and his wife came down for May long and decided to camp in our backyard. While they were here they invited up some of their friends and we all sat in the backyard just relaxing and hanging out. Fast forward a couple of hours and they began to talk about my one cousins school grade and constantly dissed him and his mother, and they wouldn’t stop. It went on for around 2 days. So, I messaged my cousin and told him, because he and his mother deserved to know, what my uncle was doing wasn’t right. Anywho, they left earlier this morning and once they got back to their house, my cousin and his mom went and talked to them about how they’ve been previously acting to my cousin and telling everyone about his grades. My uncle immediately knew who told them and called us up right away to basically yell at us. They won’t talk to us at all, which i’m fine with because I extremely dislike them, but I also feel bad because I hate that they’re furious at my mum because she didn’t do anything, it was all me. Yet, I feel no regret because my cousin deserved to know, if my mother did that to me I would want someone to tell me. So my question is, did I take this too far? Was I wrong to tell my cousin?",18May2020,1

807,"Hi all, first post and I'm just looking for a bit of advice as to what to do about my temp agency asking for more references after I've already been working for them for 3+ months.

I was lucky enough to land a temp job just before the covid situation started, my first day was 24/2/20. I applied through a temp agency who have been an absolute nightmare the entire time - they never answer my phone calls, I am supposed to be paid weekly but they didn't set me up on the system so I wasn't paid for the first month, and they didn't send me my 'welcome pack' (which includes details about how to fill in timesheets, health and safety policy, confirmation of assignment, holiday pay and sick pay information, etc) until 9/4/20. I was supposed to receive this on the first day but didn't receive it until 6 weeks later, despite calling and asking for a lot of this information. I have frequently been fobbed off on the phone and told that my co-ordinator is not in the office that day, only for my colleague to call and be able to talk to her. All of us who work with them have been having similar frustrations.

I don't mind most of this now that everything is set up, since it's only a temp job to last me until the summer, when I start a new job in September. The problem is that more recently I got an email asking for three different references for 'compliance purposes'. This email was initially sent on the 9/4/20 the same date as all the welcome pack stuff, so I assumed that it was an error as I've already provided two references, however I got the email again today.

They specifically want references from two specific previous jobs I had (I provided references from one different job and my university) and a character reference. 

Now, since the email was sent as 'urgent' and for 'compliance purposes' I am pretty sure that my co-oridnator was supposed to get all of this before I started working ( but as I've established it seems like she's not very good at her job) and it just seems bizzare to me to ask someone for 3 references when they've already worked for you for 3 months.

To be quite honest, I really can't be bothered to do it. I don't care much about this job or what the temp agency think of me, and I don't see why I should provide them with a total of 5 references, 2 before I started working there and 3 after 3 months of working there, when they have been incredibly difficult to deal with.

So my question is - can I be fired for not giving references to a company I've already been working for? Should I just suck it up and sort out the references? I know it seems like I'm just being lazy doing it (and honestly that's part of it) but I'm so fed up with them and don't want to bother my old employers at a time like this for something that I don't think I should have to do.",18May2020,1
808,"Schools reopened in my country, but because it's simply impossible to follow the Coronavirus instructions there, school is just back to normal with students wearing masks. No distancing, no nothing, only masks. It's basically an experiment with students as guinea pigs. 
I'm a senior and there are finals coming up for me, but we finished in most of the subjects what we needed to learn. Teachers want us to come to just make it sit better in our brains.
The thing is that two of my close family members are more at danger than other people if they will get the Coronavirus because of pre-existing health issues. I have no idea how dangerous it could be for them and honestly I really don't want to know. That means I am risking them if I go to school.
What should I do? I can study on my own, but the teachers can lower my grades if I don't come and it looks bad that I am not coming because almost everyone else in my class does go to school.

We dated for over 2 years and he was really emotionally abusive and treated me terribly most of the time. He did cocaine and would manipulate me constantly. 

I know I don’t want to be with him but he continues to message me randomly and tells me he isn’t over me. I’ve blocked him before but he finds ways to contact me. I keep lurking the new girl on social media and it seems they are moving quickly as she has already added his friends on social media too!

812,"I know a little bit about my aunt and what she’s done when raising her own children, I heard how they acted then and I see now they act now in their 30’s, I don’t believe their mother was right in some of the things she did and her daughters in their adult years don’t agree with her. I know bow she treated other children that aren’t hers because she used to work in a school type of situation for troubled children and those children were harmed by her. She’d tell her parents the story of what she’d do to them. She was always watched by the woman and she was fired eventually. 
I know how she treated me, she was abusive. I saw porn when I was a little girl in her home on TV. I was there to visit. Then, I relived the same experience and this time I got mad at her for the response she gave me for finding the porn on the TV, I believe she told me to just leave it there until she could fix it but I couldn’t go anywhere else in her home, I was disgusted. 

I met a man in 2019, I found out he was a lawyer and he targeted me. I don’t know what happened. I also know his GF was involved via text to him and her and was basically trying to trap someone, because I saw her daughter which isn’t his during the altercation. 

I noticed my eyesight turned gray right before that happened and when I think about what he did internally I feel I freak out/have an anxiety attack and become afraid all over again.  I had no clue I had depression and possibility PTSD. I’ve relived almost everyday, I have some hypervilance, among other. COVID-19 here and  I feel he’s coming back again. 
He has no choice but to show up at my house. 

I hope he does the right thing and realizes my family will lie to him but they also won’t have have to say about who I am, which is a sign that they aren’t to be believed. He mentioned he knew I need an service dog after all of this was over. 


What happened? I know he isn’t to be trusted so I’ll be talking to his parents.

My aunt isn’t to be trusted so if she text me about some man or I hear otherwise he isn’t to be trusted. 

But do I have trauma? I’m not this troubled person he thought I was. And his plan to target me so I can live this story isn’t possible because I’m innocent. Now I’m suffering the mental health consequence and everyone assumptions about me go down the drain. What am I left with? She goes to court, and what should I do about him?

816,"TLDR AT THE END, SCROLL.

As the title suggests, I am in an impossible situation. The fact that my unwavering indecisiveness has plagued me for the vast majority of my life is no help at all, either. I need to make a decision, I need to make it fairly soon. Let me explain.
Hi. I’m a sixteen year old girl. I don’t know how else to describe myself, since I think I’ve lost around 90% of my personality over the last few years.

I used to live in a ... let’s call it a 2nd world country. It wasn’t REALLY bad, it wasn’t poverty, but it also wasnt exactly affluent. My family and I were in the “1%” of the country, which would put us in middle or upper middle class in a 1st world country (just for a comparison).  A lot of the people there make it their life goal to leave that place. That used to be my life goal, too. 
Until it actually happened. My mother got a job offer in Germany. It seemed to be the perfect way out, a life boat, finally we would get what we deserved.

A better, more stable financial situation, life in one of the world’s BEST countries, and an undoubtedly better education. I used to be a really ambitious girl (ambition which has since withered away), I was ready to tackle all challenges that came my way, and I wasn’t going to let a little linguistic barrier stop me from living the life of my dreams. 
But as they say, hindsight really is 20/20.
The few weeks after we got there, I felt enormous stress and pressure. I wasn’t really getting along with the language since I wasn’t fluent (I could barely read and understand 50% of a text at that point), I wasn’t really digging the people. And the worst part: My health anxiety started.
I had a sudden, out of the blue panic attack on the floor of my bathroom. I cried for nearly a full hour, shaking and trembling because I had noticed a mole on my arm which I was convinced was melanoma. This went on for a grueling two months, my parents never got help because they didn’t think it was serious but they tried their best to calm me down every time I’d spin out.

I started school. I understood little. Didn’t make many friends, and those I did weren’t (and still aren’t) nearly as close as my old ones. I hated the people.

Next was a brain tumor delusion. I still have it. 
Then, I had cancer of the ovaries. Then, I was convinced I would get tetanus from the tiniest scratch on my finger because I touched a single doorknob. 

I got a boyfriend who spoke my language. I got bored of him because I saw so many traits surface in him that I saw in my classmates. I hated the culture. I broke up with him and was lonely again.

All on my own, I’ve been trying to catch up with my peers. It seems that I do way more than all of them, and get half of what they do. The results dissapoint me more and more every day. I try so hard.

I get panic attacks whenever a teacher calls on me in class or I have to speak in public, a fear I previously didn’t have. I hyperventilated for two hours the day I had to hold my German presentation this year.

I have a lot of pent up anger. I’m not sure who or what I’m angry at. Perhaps its my mother, because she brought me to a country she knew I’d hate, with a language I didn’t speak when she got an offer in England.

My home life is not that good either. We live in total disorder. No boundaries, covert narcissistic mother (I’m not sure about this one, she just seems to have empathy as long as it fits in with her virws and beliefs) having to comfort my siblings whenever my mom and step dad fight (literally every day). I’ve developed serious anger issues. My stepfather knows this and uses it against me. He once threatened to “take my siblings out” as in kill them, and I flung a filled water bottle at his head. 

A few weeks ago, I went into a rabies episode. I search my room for a bat at least once daily, every time it takes about 30-40 minutes until I can sleep. I can’t help it.

I’ve started slapping myself, biting myself, punching the walls when I’m angry. Hell, I’m literally seconds away from actually self harming (cutting) myself. 

I have intrusive thoughts of hurting the people I love, hurting myself.

Now there may be an opportunity to go bavk to my home country, my friends, in an environment that would be healthier for me.

The problem is, the education there isn’t that good, not in comparison to where I am now. It would probably influence my chances in the future, and I may not achieve as much professionally.

So please, tell me. Am I just a rebellious trust fund baby who doesnt try hard enough, is this a phase? Or should I actually start thinking about seriously moving back there.

If I stay here, I don’t know if I’ll survive, at least not as a whole, real person. 

I really dont wanna sound ungrateful. I know this situation is better, but it’s just not better for me.


TLDR: I used to be an ambitious, outspoken person. I moved to a country whose language I didn’t speak. My home life isnt great. I’m now lonely, suffering from serious anxiety and health anxiety, weird intrusive thoughts and deteriorating mental health. Do i move back to where I used to live and be happy before, which may and probably will limit my chances professionally, or do I stay here and suck it up, no matter how unhappy I may be?",18May2020,1

820,"My brother and I were raised in a very non-judgmental, non-discriminatory household.  I would say liberal, but politics were never discussed, my parents are just good people and raised us to be open-minded and not judge others for their race, economic situation, etc. etc. and to just generally be accepting people.

My brother moved to a rural southern town after college and has been there over 20yrs now. He's a college-educated professional in a medical field.  He was in an unhappy marriage for a long time and stayed away from social media altogether.  Fast forward to divorce, he's been on Facebook for about a year now....and we are seeing a whole new person we've never seen before!

He bombards his Facebook with fairly extreme right propaganda, and makes it clear he believes the government is out to take away our freedoms and gun rights.  The contents of some of his posts ""disappear"" so I'm pretty sure people are reporting them.  I get private messages from folks who knew him growing up like, ""Is Paul OK?!"" and ""What's wrong with Paul?!"". His posts and current views are not just embarrassing, they really concern me and my parents.  This just isn't the Paul we knew all these years!

We have no idea when his views started changing so much, since he never discussed anything like that with us over the years, not once, and he hasn't been on social media for several years until now.  He's always been into guns, and he is a survivalist, but I always thought it was more for practical reasons, like to be prepared in the event of some Earth event or nuclear bomb or something (I have a healthy ""stash"" myself to a much lesser degree).  Now, putting his Facebook posts together with the arsenal he keeps, it's alarming!

My brother enjoys life too much to do something stupid, so I absolutely don't suspect he will shoot up some concert or anything at all for that matter.  BUT I really am concerned for him---will his views get himself into trouble sometime in the future?  He gets sooooo wound up about things sometimes and is very impulsive, and he can be very hot-headed.  And to top it all off, he met someone recently with apparently similar views and they party and drink every night now (he didn't drink for 16yrs).  Alcohol never gets someone OUT of trouble!!

I really feel I should open some discussion with him, or at least let him know that his extreme posts are really turning friends and family off and genuinely concerning them, and us.  I don't want to regret not addressing this someday.  

What would YOU do?  Or suck it up and nothing at all? 

(I am NOT seeking a political discussion here, there are plenty other subs for that, so if you are one of those types who feel they need to be ""heard,"" please take it elsewhere, I'm just asking for genuine advice here about my big brother).",18May2020,1

Today, completely out of the blue, one of them brought it up again on social media, tagging me in a post for everybody to see and laugh at.

823,"Finger Nail Scratches in Wall

Hi everybody. Need some help trying to figure out what’s going on here, or if it’s paranormal at all. My girlfriend has been having this problem for at least a year where only once a night, usually between 2 and 4 am, there’s a sound that drags across her wall. It sounds like one hand dragging its fingernails on the opposite side of the wall. It happens EVERY night and only ONE time. We tried to eliminate any possibilities (ie water in pipes, animals living in walls) but none add up. There is nothing that makes that sound. There’s no foot steps or creaks, just the one dragging scratching sound. She mentioned it to me a few months ago but I didn’t really think anything of it. She said it was always on the wall opposite of her bed (where it was placed at the time) in this space that’s between the hallway and her bedroom. I was here a few weeks ago, and we heard it at about 4am and it was pretty quiet, but noticeable. It dragged for maybe four seconds and sounded like it was coming from that wall i’d mentioned earlier with the space. Creeped out, as she had mentioned it to me before, I started to look out for it more often. About a week ago, we heard it again around the same time, but a little closer and not in that space. Same volume, around the same time, don’t really remember how long it dragged on for. So a few minutes ago around 3:15 am, I’m face deep in her pussy, and this dragging sound is RIGHT above the headboard of her bed. SIGNIFICANTLY louder than the other two times I’d heard it before and dragged for at LEAST ten seconds. It scared the shit out of the both of us to the point where we both obviously noticed and looked up. She said that it’s been that loud and long recently, and only within the past week or so has it been near her bed. I feel like it’s hard to understand without actually experiencing it, but we’re both very confused on what this sound is coming from. None of her family members are ever awake when this happens, including the dog. Could it be paranormal? She lives next to a cemetery, too, I should add. If there’s any explanation you can think of, demon or not, please share your thoughts. Thx :)

I posted this two nights ago but it didn’t get any attention. After I seriously acknowledged it’s presence, it started happening out of control, every five minutes or so last night, quoth my girlfriend. She’s petrified. Please help.",18May2020,1
824,"Throwaway because I don’t want this on my actual account. Basically, I am 13 years old, my best friend (we’ll call her C) is 12, and her “boyfriend” (who we’ll call A) is either 12 or 13, i’m not sure. Point is, we’re all very young.

First of all, A and I do not like each other. C and I have been friends for coming up 3 years now and obviously we’ve had serious fights. He constantly tries to make her think I am using her or manipulating her when in reality I am doing none of those things. I have no reason to use her but anyways that’s not the point of this post. 

Basically, today I kept texting my friend as I had a question to ask but she never answered, I assumed she was asleep but signed into her Snapchat account (I know this was very wrong) to see if there was anyone she was texting recently to just see if she was ignoring me. I saw A’s name in recent chats and decided to be nosy (I know, also very wrong). I’ve found multiple conversations of them planning out having sex (though they never actually say the word sex, they just allude to it and it’s very obvious). Now, maybe if they were planning to do this when they were older like a reasonable age that many people lose their virginity , like 16-18 I wouldn’t care but they are planning on doing it soon. They haven’t kissed each other yet and they’re planning sex!! I am worried for my friend. She has had a lot of relationships and she ends up getting hurt or used in most of them. She and her boyfriend have only been dating like 3-4 months and I don’t think she is ready for this at all. She can be emotionally unstable and I know that it’s very likely this relationship won’t even last. I don’t want her to get hurt but I don’t know how to talk to her about it because then she would know I have been snooping in her messages and would never trust me again. 
Here’s one of the paragraphs (it’s in weird fonts because she likes to type like that sometimes):

 “𝑳𝒊𝒌𝒆 𝒊 𝒘𝒂𝒏𝒕 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝒕𝒐 𝒎𝒂𝒌𝒆 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒇𝒊𝒓𝒔𝒕 𝒎𝒐𝒗𝒆 𝒅𝒐𝒆.. 𝒔𝒐 𝒘𝒆 𝒏𝒐𝒓𝒎𝒂𝒍𝒍𝒚 𝒂𝒓𝒆 𝒘𝒂𝒕𝒄𝒉𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒂 𝒎𝒐𝒗𝒊𝒆 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒘𝒆 𝒔𝒕𝒐𝒑 𝒊𝒕 𝒕𝒐 𝒄𝒖𝒅𝒅𝒍𝒆𝒆𝒆𝒆𝒆.. 𝒕𝒉𝒆𝒏 𝒎𝒂𝒚𝒃𝒆 𝒋𝒖𝒔𝒕 𝒎𝒂𝒚𝒃𝒆 𝒂 𝒌𝒊𝒔𝒔 (𝒃𝒖𝒕 𝒊 𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒏𝒌 𝒘𝒆 𝒔𝒉𝒐𝒖𝒍𝒅 𝒉𝒂𝒗𝒆 𝒐𝒖𝒓 𝒇𝒊𝒓𝒔𝒕 𝒌𝒊𝒔𝒔 𝒃𝒆𝒇𝒐𝒓𝒆 𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒔 𝒕𝒊𝒎𝒆 𝒔𝒐 𝒘𝒆 𝒂𝒓𝒆𝒏'𝒕 𝒔𝒄𝒂𝒓𝒆𝒅) 𝒕𝒉𝒆𝒏 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝒌𝒏𝒐𝒘 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒚𝒆𝒂𝒉 𝒘𝒆 𝒘𝒐𝒖𝒍𝒅 𝒅𝒐 𝒕𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒕𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒘𝒐𝒖𝒍𝒅 𝒋𝒖𝒔𝒕 𝒄𝒐𝒏𝒕𝒊𝒏𝒖𝒆 𝒕𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒇𝒐𝒓 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒓𝒆𝒔𝒕 𝒐𝒇 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒏𝒊𝒈𝒉𝒕 𝒊𝒈.. 𝒊𝒇 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝒘𝒂𝒏𝒕 𝒎𝒐𝒓𝒆 𝒅𝒆𝒕𝒂𝒊𝒍 𝒍𝒎𝒌”

I would copy and paste more of the specific messages but they’re mostly full conversations so it’s not just one specific paragraph like the one above. I don’t know how they plan to have sex when they can’t even say the word sex or actually describe any sexual act. He probably wouldn’t even know which hole to stick it in. They aren’t properly prepared at all and I don’t know how they expect to get condoms or keep from getting pregnant. She hasn’t said anything about this to me except that she would do it when she was older. From what I read it feels like he is trying to convince her that they should or that it’s a good idea when I really feel like it just isn’t. He constantly trashes her close friends (like the best friend she had before me during a period of time before we were speaking, he trashed her too calling her a thot and a hoe and such) it just feels like he’s trying to isolate her all to himself and he gets angry when she doesn’t answer right away and guilts her when she’s busy or hanging out with people. I don’t know what to do sorry if it’s too long or doesn’t make sense.

TL;DR: My 12 year old friend and her (12 or 13) year old boyfriend are planning to have sex sometime in the near future. They’ve never even kissed. I know my friend enough to know that she will only end up getting her heart broke as it happens a lot with boyfriends she says she loves and I know she will regret this. What do I do?",18May2020,1

829,"a week ago, i (22f) ended my relationship with my boyfriend (35m) of three years. i was nineteen and emotionally/mentally unwell when we got together, and i missed all the red flags. he has never had his life together and i let him use me to attain all sorts of luxuries (before all this, i'd saved up a hefty sum of money from my job and was building credit). i'm ashamed that i let this happen, so it's difficult to even make this post asking for advice.  
  
about a year ago, he talked me into taking out a loan on a 2016 jetta with vw credit. i opposed this, but i felt a lot of pressure from him... i won't try to justify my stupid decision, however. i was foolish and weak-willed. the payment is $367/month and the insurance is about $200/month. i make roughly $1,000/month at work after taxes (without counting tips). now that i have moved back home and will not be paying rent, that's not as intimidating a payment as it was before, but here's the thing: due to anxiety, i don't even drive (he has been the only person driving it this whole time). it is a work in progress, but even after i become more comfortable driving, i don't want to be paying almost $570/month for my *first* car. i am upside-down on the loan, or i'd just sell it and pay it off.  
  
the car is entirely in my name, so it's my decision what happens to it. what should i do? no one in my life has been in a position like this, so no one has advice for me. for what it's worth, the only thing i'll be using my credit for in the next decade will be rental applications, and at that, i'll be in college (in a town where i won't need a car), so i might end up subleasing most of the time, anyway.  
  
what is my best way forward?",18May2020,1
830,"We’re all in high school, she’s graduating in a week, I’ve still got another year. I met this girl in a mostly senior physics class, I got attracted to her really fast, we had mutual friends, she had exited a relationship and I thought it was gonna snap right into place. We talked, snapped constantly, she made an effort to show me affection I guess. I’m not one that talks to people very much, I’m excellent at pushing people away to avoid attraction and getting my feelings hurt, I’ve never dated anyone, not for lack of trying. I’m not attractive, frankly I’m a bit fat. In exchange for all of this no one ever really shows me any sort of feelings, I got bullied a lot, I struggled to see people as I slipped through the cracks emotionally. I was making a comeback but I’m friends with her and she’s dating someone that’s a friend of mine, she mentioned one night I was the one who broke the ice in between them, it felt like a knife going through me. I’m 95% sure nothing will ever happen between us but I like her a lot, she makes me feel good when I’m around her, I don’t really have a lot of friends and she’s a really good one. I wish I could just end things, I know she’ll never see me the way I see her and I cry enough over it at night, I haven’t ever cried previous to the last few months. But I’ve shed enough tears, my mental health is declining for those chats I have with her over the phone every other day or so. Her boyfriend is better than I am, I’ll never be enough to fit her standards. I don’t know what to do, I hate feeling this way, I can’t feel this way anymore and I can’t make it stop. If I cut her off I lose something in me, I lose my softness, I lose hope for my future, my summer loses its plans. Idk if I talk to her about it even.",18May2020,1

I'm not sure if this is the correct place to post this but here goes:

Does anyone have any advice on what I can say to help ease her pain? I don't want to say the wrong thing but feel like just rubbing her back isn't enough.

832,"TLDR: I'm pretty sure if I spent the hundreds and hundreds of hours needed to write a full book, no one would ever read it and I'd fall into a depression death spiral 

I know this isn't on the caliber of the problems this sub tackles on a daily basis, but I do need some help on how to best approach this issue.

I'm a creative type; that's not to say that I'm especially good at anything really, (tbh I think I'm a tad shit in all regards,) but in my free time I feel like I *need* to be working on some kind of creative side project just to keep myself sane and frankly not horribly depressed.

That said, in the past few years through college and following graduation, I've been doing my best to follow 2 key passions: music and writing. 

When it comes to music, [I'm a pianist](https://soundcloud.com/user-975550966/ill-see-you-again?in=user-975550966/sets/musings-of-an-idiot) and producer; I've written a half dozen compositions as well as a [lofi album](https://soundcloud.com/user-975550966/sets/midnight-therapy-sessions-lofi-chillhop-to-relax-smoke-embrace-the-void-to)  (I know, ""lofi"", the meme of the music world) but I'm currently working on a fully fleshed out Alternative LP. As for writing, I've written about 2 books worth of various material, mainly short stories and commission work (people who have commissioned me to write their story ideas) over the last few years. I get generally positive feedback; people tend to like my writing in small doses, which is probably why I've stuck with it so long, but now I'm facing a pretty serious dilemma:

**I'm pretty sure if I take the time to write a full length book and have it published, it will never be touched let alone read in full, and therefore I'll have wasted untold days writing garbage.**

This doesn't come from a place of anxiety; I'm a pretty realistic person and frankly I know that there's very little real reason anyone out there would care to put the time in to read a book by some no name schmuck regardless of quality (And theres still the very real possibility that whatever novel I end up completing will be shit anyway.)

I know the initial response is to say ""Well, you should be writing for you! Who cares what other people think?"" Personally, I just can't believe in that mindset. Art is subjective, but it's also about connecting the audience with the author. If people don't like it, or rather don't even want to waste their time reading it, who am I to say otherwise. 

And thing is, that would probably kill me.

The very thought of spending that long crafting and pouring everything I have into a book, only to have it completely disregarded, would crush me.

And it's that anticipation that leaves me stuck on the first few chapters of each story I try to write. As soon as I get into the thick of it, I always stop myself and think: ""What the hell is the point? You're working this hard, after already working a full time job, and for what?""

I just can't get around this; I want to write, I want to go from an armature to a proper, published author, but I can't justify it to myself.

So, how can I take on a project of this size knowing that common sense tells me I will fail?

Thanks all",18May2020,1

He asked me if I no longer wanted to be in contact, but I insisted I was sick he apologized but then the next day he said he knew I didn't want to talk anymore and then blocked me for a month. We made up and were on good terms for a while.  


Last month I was busy so I didn't answer his call right away, and told him I would call him in a few days. He seemed to believe me at first, but then asked me if I no longer wanted to talk.

836,"So, I’m a senior in college and I’ve been moved out of my parents for two years now. My first year of college, my 15 year old cat, Sasha, died, but two months prior we got a kitten named Giovanni. I put all my love for Sasha into Gio, and I grew super attached. Two months after Sasha passed, we got a second kitten named Nikolai. Gio is a Maine coon and Nik is a Siberian. I absolutely love them. They’re my babies, they slept with me every night when I lived with my parents. About 6 months later I moved out. It was really hard at first. I moved in with my boyfriend since we were going to the same college, and he could tell I was depressed from missing my kitties. 

Fast forward two years and I still go home about once a month to see my parents, cats, friends, and do laundry. It’s still hard to leave home, but it takes me about a full 24 hours before I’m fine. 

A week ago, my boyfriend and I went to go get a kitten for one of our friends. We had to watch him for a week because he wasn’t home, but then he was coming home and we were giving him the kitten. We ran into a few issues... 1. The kitten was 5 weeks old, and our friend wanted us to take care of him until he was about 8 weeks old and could get his shots since he planned on letting him be an indoor/outdoor cat and we live in an apartment, so he wouldn’t be let out to catch anything, 2. My boyfriend and I really like this cat. He’s super sweet and tiny and I’ve wanted a cat for a long time. So, we wanted to keep him, but I do and don’t want to keep him. I want to keep him because he’s tiny, cute, a cat, and I love having him around. I don’t want him because it’s really impulsive and I wanted to plan out having my first cat, it’s not cheap to have a cat, and (this makes me sound and feel like and ass hole) he’s short haired tabby and I really want a long haired or Maine coon. My mom told me not that long ago that she was going to try to get me a Maine coon for my college graduation present, and I was excited about it. 

Lastly, I’m feeling super guilty about having him and missing my other cats. Whenever I’m upset I want to rush home and hold my kitties, and I’m having a hard time being attached to this kitten. I’ve put in all the effort, and I’ve cried everyday since we got him because I don’t know what to do. Our friend said it’s fine if we keep him, but if we don’t he’d love to have him. 

I’m not sure what to do at all, and I’d love if someone could give me some advice. I have another week or so to decide, but I’m worried I’m going to feel like if I have him for too long and give him to my friend that he’ll feel like I abandoned him and that he’ll get depressed and stressed while readjusting to a new home.",18May2020,1
837,"As a child, my family raised me as a Christian, and I thoroughly accepted that as my religion. But when this quarantine struck, I started to question why people devote their lives to God. So many bad things have happened ever since 2020 started, and that's when I started to question why I even bother. At first, I was mad at other Christians. They take everything that the bible says so literally and they don't accept people who sin, even though they do just as bad things as well. This disgusts me.
My stepmom tries very hard to force this religion on me. She doesn't let me watch shows with gay characters and she basically forces me to go on church trips, even when I don't want to. This has a lot to do with my situation, since it's given me an opportunity to figure out who I think God really is.
I've had a lot of time to think over this quarantine, and that isn't necessarily a good thing. I developed mild depression, and a lot of it had to do with the fact that I felt like I was failing as a Christian. Preachers say that I'm supposed to give up my whole life to Jesus, but I wasn't doing that. My mom was telling me that I shouldn't accept people of the LGBTQ+ community because what they do is ""wrong"", but I believe that they were born that way. All the previous months, it felt like I was the only one who was commiting to the ""relationship"" that I was supposed to have with God, so I just stopped it altogether.
This is where the main issues occur. Nobody else knows that I am not considering myself a Christian anymore, so I have to try and pretend that I am still a Christian. I have to still participate in my Christian Zoom meetings, and I have to still listen to the online messages every Sunday, and I have to keep talking to my Christian therapist. It's really stressing me out knowing that what they think about my life is a lie, but I'm too scared to tell anyone about my decision, because they would definitely try to get me back to God, and that's not what I'm looking for right now.
Another issue is figuring out what my religion even IS. It's not like I can just pretend that I don't believe that God created the earth and sacrificed his life for us, because that's all I've known my whole life. So I'm stuck with the knowledge that I will go to hell when I die.
I don't want anyone in the comment section to try and get me back to being a Christian, because, honestly, that will only make it worse. I just mainly need someone to talk to so that I can figure things out.",18May2020,1

840,"Ok, I know that this is more than likely a complete scam, simply based on the context of the email, but just in case it isn't, I don't want to pass up something like this. 

I got an email from a company saying this:

I've reviewed your resume and would like to speak with you about a career with Globe Life's Family Heritage Division. We are currently expanding in your area and need to fill 3-5 positions. We are seeking potential Market Directors and Regional Managers who are interested in a long term career with the opportunity to make $85k-$175k+ first year.
We invite you to begin our 3 step interview process.

We ask that you:
(1) Visit our website
(2) Watch a 5 minute video
(3)Take an online assessment

This process should take approximately 30 minutes to complete. We ask that you schedule a time when you know you can complete all steps at once. To schedule, please use the link below.

Once you have completed  all steps and submit your online assessment, our recruiting team will be notified immediately. Those who are chosen will be invited in for a final interview.
We look forward to speaking with you in the near future!

Yeah, it's all pretty fishy. I deleted all links from the email, but just by the context, someone should be able to tell me if this is a complete scam. To be fair, I did just complete a huge marketing internship, and I am openly looking for work since the Virus wiped out both of my previous jobs for the foreseeable future.

841,I text her and she will reply but after a couple of texts back and forth she will just stop when she probably could’ve said something back but then again maybe she didn’t have anything else to say. She does it a lot and I think she somewhat likes me. She snaps me at least once every couple days. The other day I asked her if she wanted to go walking at the park and she could take her dog and she said yea basically but she got drunk that night before and I thought we weren’t going well around 3 that day she asked if I had dinner plans and I said no so we rode up on my motorcycle to a restaurant and took a little ride after. I think she had fun on the bike at least she laughed a lot. I don’t think neither of us really knew what to talk about at the restaurant. I just hope I wasn’t too boring where she doesn’t want to talk to me anymore. I even got tit pics from her before and I don’t think girls just send that out to people. I don’t know if I should try to keep the conversation going when she doesn’t reply. I haven’t been but I’m wondering if I should start. I know she seen it too it was opened on snapchat. What does this mean? Should I try to text her again later or will that come off as needy? Btw we went on a date back in February but she said she wasn’t feeling anything romantic towards me.

842,"I guess I'm feeling a particular way about it because I don't want people to think I'm weak or making it up. I'm not even sure what is normal anymore. I guess I'll just tell you about my life and y'all can tell me what you think. 

I've been diagnosed with severe osteoarthritis, had 3 doctors tell me I need a new knee. I was on large doses of pain medication but that caused an addiction (coming up on two years sober!). So I only take OTC medication. 

I can walk, for maybe an hour. Its extremely painful but I can do it. Last week I had to go grocery shopping to Costco (first trip since the quaratine) and we walked around for about 1.5 hours shoppin while I was wearing a medical grade knee brace. The next day my knee was so swollen I was on crutches again, this lasted 3 days. 

I can't stand long either. You can literally hear my knee cracking. 

But here is the real issue I guess. I have an eating disorder and severe depression at times, last year I fell off the wagon. In 8 months I gained almost 120lbs. I feel like shit and a horrible person who deserves all of this pain because everyone knows that fat people have worse joint issues. I feel like I don't deserve anyone's help since I did this to myself. I don't want to take away from someone who had no choice to be disabled. I feel like a horrible person for even considering it. 

I usually work a very physical job in mental health but I obviously can't do that now. I am enrolled in school for engineering so I can have a more low key office job and that will help my knee. I'm working with a counselor and dietician too so I can lose weight. But my lack of available exercises and significant weight now means it could take me a couple years to get back to work.

She is a great person, and I love being around her. Our friendship moved to beyond the bedroom pretty quickly, and I care very much for her and she apparently for me. Unfortunately, I have developed feelings for her as of a couple months ago, a little before the mess with covid started. 

Though we agreed to let the other know if that happens, she is currently going through extremely difficult times right now. I offered my support and my ear, and she tells me about how she feels. Due to this fucking pandemic, we have not been seeing each other in person like before, and I feel like that put a strain on how things were. As a result, my feelings have been stirring up a lot more inside of me, and it’s very difficult to not think about expressing my feelings to her the few times I have seen her since quarantine. I really don’t want to add more stress that what she is already going through right now, so I have been trying to wait until after things return to normal and for her life to not be so stressful to her right now, but another part of me just wants to get it out there to get my sanity and focus back.

847,"Hey guys im new to reddit and wasnt sure where i should post this but its been on my mind recently and i was hoping to find some opinions. So i’ve always been a not very caring person, for example I couldn’t care less about other people dying for example, i dont ever go out and hurt people and avoid causing any discomfort to people and i generally try to be a likable nice person however i notice that everytime i get into a debate with someone about morals and right and wrong i always get looked at as if im some kind of heartless monster. I recently got into a debate with a person about wearing masks to protect others from the coronavirus etc. and my stand on it was that i only do it because im following the rules and dont want to be penalized for not wearing them not because i actually care about the wellbeing of others. The other person looked at me as if i had just spoke some blasphemy as he allegedly genuinely cares about the health and wellbeing of others etc. this is just one of the examples i have about my opinions on things that are found unacceptable by the public, ive personally always believed in natural selection and survival of the fittest and i dont ever feel sad for people who die or other unfortunate things like that. I dont know i feel like i view all life with the same level of importance, i feel like for me to care about a human life but not care when i eat an animal or kill a bug or something seems a little unfair because im putting more importance on one life than others, so i view all life equally and dont feel bad for any of them i guess. I dont have any desire to hurt any living thing but i simply dont feel bad or care if they do die, and i do feel guilty and bad when i even accidentally cause someone discomfort or pain but if it wasn’t directly my fault I dont feel anything for them i guess, i just feel like its nature running its course.

851,"Context: I’m 21, got a 3.4 gpa for this semester, and just convinced my dad to let me move into an apartment off-campus in Nashville with a few old roommates so I can get jobs in my field easier.

My older brother (25) moved to Germany after some soul-searching in Indonesia and is in film school there as well. He’s completely self-sufficient, save for my parents paying his rent for the duration of this lockdown.

Problem: My sister (23) graduated in 2019, and is currently working as a nursing tech at a hospital in my hometown. Her graduating GPA was a 2.9 and she’s utterly convinced she’ll either *not* get into PA/nursing school, or if she did, she’d flunk out of it. I believe she’s discrediting herself for the talent she does have. The issue is that she has no idea what she wants to do, and only got a biology degree because it’s “safe”. She also double majored in Spanish and never got below an A in any class, but she doesn’t want to teach or translate. In college she really only seemed to party and hang out with her boyfriend, and now she sleeps most of the day when she isn’t working, doesn’t exercise, and spends most of her time away from the house at her new boyfriend’s. My parents don’t know about the new boyfriend. She says she wants to move on but doesn’t do much in the way of actually moving on.

I keep suggesting she could be a paramedic or could do something like Doctors Without Borders so she can use her Spanish, but she says that’s too stressful and she feels pressured by my parents to figure something out. I don’t know how to help her.

Now to my parents. I’m doing particularly well this past semester, and I’m starting to really hone my interest in a certain emphasis of my major. They’re really proud of me and keep telling me so. My brother is in the same boat. He’s pretty happy, is on good terms with an ex of his (which hasn’t happened before) and is excited to see us when we zoom. It hurts to say it but it’s painfully obvious that my sister is really struggling comparatively.

My parents have noticed, and since my brother is hard to contact because of time differences, my parents have started to take out their frustrations on me. My mom sat down with me this morning while I was working out and kept prodding me to tell her if my sister confuses in me what she wants to do. My answer is always the same, because it’s the truth: she doesn’t know. My mom acts like that’s not good enough of an answer from me, and whenever I tell her the conversation is uncomfortable she just says she’s ranting to herself mostly. 

My dad will make small comments here and there about “now if your sister could just pick up the pace, ********* hospital isn’t the endgame for her, and will give her talks every week or so about how she needs to pick it up. My mom asks her about her GRE scores and she just tells them she “can’t get them because of quarantine”. I’m scared of when my mom is gonna ask me if she even took it. She didn’t take it.

I don’t know what to do. Part of me says I should just stay out of it and keep doing what I’m doing to try to improve myself; but another part of me wants to tell my parents the full truth and get my sister to start working harder. Part of me *also* says I should get her to be motivated myself, but I don’t really know how to do it...

852,"Hey, idk if this goes here but i really need to get this out of my chest. I'm really sorry if my english is not the best, is my second language :(
Well i love my mom, and i think she do loves me, but we get into so much fight and drama. I say this began when i was little.
Mi mom and mi dad had a really terrible split up, he was emotionally abusive to her and cheated on her so my mom entered a deep depression after that.
She was so full of anger and rage and she would lash out at me and my big brother, she would hit us, scream at us, overall was really aggressive. 
To put it in an example, one time i ate a little bit of butter (yes is gross but idc i was like 5) when she found out she slapped me really hard and grounded me. 
Everytime i cried because i was in pain she would call me a liar, she would say that i was manipulative  (keep in mind that i was 7).
Eventually my brother got fed up and moved out with my dad. I remember the day he left i didn't understand a thing but i cried, and my mom got really angry and told me that i couldn't cry.
All that anger passed to me and i got beaten up by her, and she would tell me that i was lazy, fat, a liar, i was manipulative and she would get physically violent at me at fights.
When i started to grow up, i began to be tired of her and would fight back or lash out at her, and everytime we fought she would not listen at what i had to say, it was (and it is) horrible because everytime she was mad at me, she would treat me horribly, she would snap at me or throw my things away, etc. Sometimes she would text me horrible stuff. I'm not gonna lie, out of anger i also said horrible things to her and done things that are not okay.
Eventually she would talk to me and demand and apology which i always gave, but she would not take responsibility for the things she did/say. She would say all the fights were my fault and that i was problematic and bad, she would say that i did not love her or i was ashamed of her.
All these things made me grow up with a series of problems, i feel guilty about everything and i feel i have to apologize for every little thing, i also feel like i constantly manipulate people and i'm afraid to do so, i always think i'm lying or seeking for attention when i get sick or feel bad. And the worst of all, i have a lot of agression inside me.
I believed my mom has changed a little bit, she accepts that she abused me (but she says it was a short period of time when i clearly remember it was all my childhood and part of my adolescence) and she tries not to lash out at the minimal things i do. But when we get into fights is always the same things, and when she gaslight my feelings i feel like i need to punch her, and i'm really scared to get out of control and attack my mom.
Yesterday we got into yet another fight and she threw my things into my bedroom like they were nothing, along with my dog medicines, etc. Now she demands an apology because i told her that she was really entitled and gave her bad attitude. I'm really tired of having to apologize everytime but idk what else to do. What should i do??",18May2020,1

859,"Hey, all. Hope you all doing well.

So, here's a short disc to the situation I'm at. 

I'm a foreign student at Europe (PL). I was given about $2.5k by my parents so I could afford making country's proof of residence. I got it for 1 year without any problems. But because I'm still immature and stupid I've spent about $1,5 to the air: alcohol, parties, food delivery. I'm far for being rich, and more close to being poor. 

I tried to work, but had some struggles with it. I wake up at 5:30 morning to go to college and come back around 17:30-18:00. Really not many job offers. Most of them at night, from 20:00 to 4/5:00. Tried it out but it was to hard to sleep for 3-4 hours per day. 

Now I am trying myself at freelance (I can make simple but still good and adaptive web pages ), but got only one order in 3 months and made $16. 

It's summer soon, I hope to find some job out here. In June I have an internship at web development company.and it's for free. Thinking about working at food delivery again (I've made like $15-$20 for 3 hours because of my poor physical condition). 

I do really hope that I could work at that company for whole summer, but I don't think this is real. Those ""happy things"" a seem to happen only at films and TV series. 

So, adults and you g adults of reddit. Any advice for the 20-yo poor student with only 2 skills: English and Web-dev at making any money ($2k for 2 month at Poland)? I'd really thought about going to work at building site, but those money will be enough only to pay rent and not to die starving. 

Maybe your stories? And thanks for reading this. Cheers 🌸💖🌸",18May2020,1
860,"im moving to a new city in july and im going to a new school that following year and im dreading it

so im moving to a new city in july. and at first i thought i was okay with it because i thought of it as a fresh start. but then my parents showed me the new high school im going to and i hate it so much. 

i’ve always gone to a public school and never worn uniforms. now they want me to go to a private school, only because it’s the closest one to where we will be staying. (no hate towards anyone who does go to one, it’s just im not used to it). you have to wear uniform, and its just so different from what i know. i love expressing myself in what i wear, it’s something i have control over and now i feel like the one thing i was in charge of is being ripped away from me. they also dont have a sports team for volleyball and its the only sport i can play well and enjoy. 

ive tried so hard to see the positives but i just can’t. it makes me so mad and upset everytime i think of it, so i try to repress it. and whenever my parents talk about the move i walk away. ive tried talking to them about how much i dont like the new school but they really dont understand. 

and on top of that i only told one of my friends here that im moving and she (very understandably) took it horribly. and i don’t have the heart to tell any of my other friends right now. especially my best friend because i convinced her to move to my school this year (i didn’t know i was moving then) and she’ll be absolutely heartbroken about it. idk what to do",18May2020,1

863,"So me(18) and my ex broke(19) up a while ago and it started out as a good breakup and slowly started Turing it into a bad breakup.

Long story short there was a night were we both got drunk and slept with each other. He said a lot of thing that night about how much he missed me and to this day I still dint know it they are true or not.

Because we slept together I got my hopes up for a while that we were going to get back together, until I realized that we probably were not. 

In this time I confided a lot to my friend who had also been friends with my ex for a long time now. She got fed up with how he wasn’t telling me the truth and confronted him and told him how he needed to be honest with me and set me straight.

He had a few beers before he talked to me and when he did he told me the truth in the most hurtful way possible. He essentially told me that I needed to get over him and that I was starting to become pathetic. He then told me he lied about his body count and it was around that time that I poured my beer over his head. We continue me to talk things out to the point we agreed to be friends.

I then later find out that he told one of my friend that I had danced with earlier in the night that I only danced with him to make him jealous. (Which I did not do) 

If my ex was completely over me why would he care wether it not I was dancing with other guys and trying to move on. He is sending me mixed signals and he is starting to confuse me. He never talks to me anymore unless we’re in the same room and some days I wonder if he still even cares about me.

864,"My previous post has more information on the general surroundings of this situation, if you'd like more context for my state of mind, you'll find it there. The short version is, I'm a generally very happy, upbeat person, but I'm dealing with a lot of negativity from a lot of people, and it's beginning to weigh on me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Partner received some annoying news today, nothing life altering, just ruined plans for the day, and added some stress. I drove them to where they needed to be (I always like doing this, it's quality time!), but was frustrated that they were acting like (in my own words) ""someone just died"", certainly an exaggeration, but only just.  I felt like they were being unreasonably negative towards me for no justifiable reason, and I tried to make it clear that I wouldn't accept that, without raising my voice or letting my temper get the best of me, but I was obviously annoyed, even though I tried to be sympathetic at first. I was trying to encourage them to not let this ruin their day, and was being fought the whole time, until at one point, I was told, politely, to stop talking. (we have a ""safe word"" which means the other person just needs a break to gather their thoughts, but has to resume the conversation within 30 minutes, I always make a point to be quiet in the most supportive way I can in these moments, this time there wasn't going to be a 30 minute break, since we had nearly arrived at the destination).

&amp;#x200B;

On the way out of the car, my partner still looking morose, I say ""I hope you have a nice day, but I think you've already decided not to"" which was a dick move, and I regret it. For what it's worth I believe a lot in positivity, and I say things like this honestly hoping it'll help people change their attitudes, but it was still a thing that ""felt good to say"" rather than necessarily being helpful.

&amp;#x200B;

A while later, I get the text in the title (this was not part of a conversation, it was unprompted). It's important to note that I often feel like when my partner brings up ""suicidal thoughts"" it feels like it's being used as a means to an end rather than just a statement of fact. I reflexively replied with some nice things, and offer my support in any way I can, and things seem to mellow out, but I feel strange and dirty, like I'm being tricked. It doesn't feel like a genuine cry for help, just a really manipulative way of telling me to ""shut up"" even though I wasn't saying anything. It also doesn't feel very adult way of dealing with things, which makes me feel frustrated.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to make it clear that this is a snapshot of the worst thing that happens in our relationship (in my opinion). We're normally better people than this, but when I feel like my partner is in a mood, I feel like I just have to wait it out, and it feels like sometimes luck dictates the pattern of our day more than anything else. We've got a lot of beautiful, happy, loving moments too, but that's not why I'm here.

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do in a situation like this? Is it ok that I feel like I'm being manipulated? Honestly I want to be mad about it, and I want to tell them that doing this is not alright. My partner has been to therapy, but left because it ""wasn't helping."" It's important to note that they have good days too, obviously. We also have been to couple's therapy. I'm not sure why we stopped going, but I felt like we got a few good tools out of it, even though I feel like I'm the only one who applies them (other than the safe word). It does seem to be getting better over time, in that it's happening less frequently, but with the same intensity. I'm not looking for blind support, I'm looking for real responses.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks for your time.",18May2020,1

866,"A quick summary. I was the happiest in my life when I was 19 and boxing. I loved boxing, never enjoyed watching it naturally as i grew up with Dragon Ball Z and that's what inspired me to box. But the issue lies in the  brain damage. I got health anxiety in 2016 and really started to realize when I get hit in the head it feels wierd and I dont like it. It sucks because I was super into boxing.


I also love anime, it inspires me more than anything. But I can't find anything to do with the inspiration. I was a semi-pro in Gaming for Halo 5. But then Halo 5 died and now all the time I put into it is for nothing. I may try to go pro when the new Halo comes out. But for now there is literally nothing to do, and in my opinion video games just suck now and days and are toxic and boring.


When I get into gaming it also seems to take away from my fitness. I loved lifting weights as a kid, but when I game it takes away fitness due to making time to improve at the game. I have 2 kids and I love being strong. I love getting really good at a skill and competing and beating others who are good. I just can't get passionate about anything now. I'm 26 so I cant even find a sport.

Thanks.

TLDR: Cant find anything to be passionate about. Used to love boxing but don't want to risk brain damage.",18May2020,1
867,"I love my dad, he can be great, but I honestly think he has anger issues. I feel like he sometimes looks for a fight, or feels as though he is being attacked when he isn’t. There are many examples, but I’ll stick to today’s

I was going my homework when my older sister asked me if I want to go for a bike ride later. I said I would but she’s a little to slow to bike with. 
Please let me explain. The only bike I own is a road bike. It has a two gear system and is pretty fast. She has a regular sitting “girl” bike. The problem with my bike is that the lower gears are sleeved up a little so I can only stay on the high gears, which causes a real problem for me. For one, it takes a lot of effort to pedal, and I mean a lot of effort. I have trouble going up hills and everything, it almost feels as though I’m riding a fixed bike. Anyways, I’m order to stay upright, I literally have. To pedal really hard and it ends up being faster than a leisurely ride. I’m fine with this. I bike to stay in shape, and I like going fast. Not to mention that my seat is the same height as my handle bars so it kind of hurts to ride a prolonged period of time. Anyways, she goes to my dad to complain about me and I follow trying to defend my case. Instantly the light hearted mood in the room changes and my dad starts brooding about how me and my start are blood and I should spend time with her. The minute I start to explain my case he gets angry with me and says that I’m not listening to him. I continue to try to make my case u til he starts using expletives and “bad” language. It quickly turns into him yelling at me, using “f***” “sh*t” “motherf**”. I literally didn’t see this coming. My sister walks away so she’s not even in this anymore. The argument ends and I hear him and my mom talking in the other room and he’s complaining how “he always deals with this” that I ruin his day” “that he feels completely screwed” and yadayadayada.

870,"Sorry if this is a long one, throwaway because people I know follow me on here. 

I’ve just finished my first year at college studying education and I’ve been accepted to an internship with Disney in lieu of a traditional semester at school. My original plan was to do the internship, then come back home to finish the school year, then finish my bachelors, get my masters and become a teacher. 

But the more I think about it the less I think I actually want to become a teacher. I’ve hated college so far, besides the quarantine online schooling I just haven’t enjoyed my classes or living on campus. Living at home and continuing to do online school isn’t an option either because I cannot stand being around my parents, specifically my father. I wouldn’t go so far as to call it emotional abuse but I can’t live with him and have good mental health. 

The more I think about it, the more I feel like my future is with Disney. It’s something I’ve always been so passionate about, and it sounds like an amazing career. If I could do anything with my life, in a heartbeat I would do my internship and then stay in Florida to get a full time job with the company and never look back. 

I’m really struggling with the decision though. My internship doesn’t start until August and the program lasts until January, but it doesn’t seem like a decision I should make last minute. But I’d be leaving behind my two closest (re: only) friends and my entire family. I’d also be dropping out of college and I don’t know how that sits with me. I don’t want to be a college dropout because being labeled as such makes me feel like a failure. I really don’t want to continue going to college because I feel that it isn’t for me, but I also feel that without a degree I won’t be successful in life. 

It’s a personal decision, so strangers online can’t make it for me and I know that, but hearing outside perspectives would be really helpful.

I am asking in this forum because I am a man and men can related to male weight loss and my situation more than women. I can’t seem to find my motivation anywhere! I was 240lbs, this fat rude girl we hung out with had the audacity to make fun of me about my weight in front of everyone a year ago when she knows herself she’s just as big and for some reason that pist me off so much that I did KETO hardcore and ran a mile every morning before work at 3AM lost weight and was at 175lbs at around 4 months! It was a grind but I was a stud, girls kept touching me like nudging me and putting arms around me, these flirty behaviors were not normally happening when I was big, it was nice to be in shape and be social and talk to girls and what not. Fast forward, I almost got a girlfriend and we were getting closer and sex was becoming more realistic at the time but I have an issue that I didn’t tell her about in fear of everyone else finding out, I’m uncircumcised and had a plan to get it fixed before the covid virus so those plans got ruined. Once I realized I could not comfortably have sex because of my situation I then cut her off, said I wasn’t ready for a relationship and I really did like this girl and my parents liked her it was great, she probably thinks I’m this asshole douche guy with bad intentions now, it sucks I ruined it because of that.

I started smoking cigarettes again so my motivation to run and ride my bike just seem that much further. I just want to be more invested in myself like I used to be but this embarrassing problem with my dick is holding me back, how can I get motivated to get in shape and get back out there talking to women when I can’t comfortably have sex or even show a woman my situation for that matter.

He left the other day and I was kinda sad, he was actually kinda cool to be around taking away all my feelings of needing to be wanted.

I don't trust him and I don't think I ever could, not fully at least. He likes other girls pictures on Instagram and even that makes me question his intentions. He tells me he loves me and I think he realises that I care about him and uses that to his advantage almost. 

I'm just worried that he'll cheat again. He's told me that he's cheated in past relationships too and it's hard for me to believe he'll ever change. If he had the opportunity to cheat, there's no doubt in my mind he would. 

I love him but I feel like an idiot for staying. The way he left me last time hurt more than anything.

He mainly spends his time on his phone and will keep the flat reasonably tidy (sometimes) and cooks us dinner most of the time which has helped during the earlier parts of pregnancy when I was not well. He is contributing £300 a month from his benefits and possibly money from his parents. It costs over £1000 to live in this flat and I don't ask for money from my parents. I'm struggling with the concept of being on my own but I'm also aware he does not have anything wrong with him and has no reason why he couldn't work and it feels like I already have a child. I have been unemployed pre relationship and I applied for every job under the sun. 

Aside from this our relationship can be unhealthy from time to time. We both call each other names but it usually ends with him taking it too far by saying really mean things and I end up ugly crying and locking myself in the bathroom and then it goes back to normal. 

He seems to genuinely love me but I'm having a hard time believeing this. I feel like I am holding the weight of all respinsibility on my shoulders and sometimes I just feel used as a place he can live. Pre baby him and his friends would come round and party a lot. 

I feel like an idiot because I believed all his bs about stepping up and I do believe he genuinely thinks he will do those things but he isn't putting pen to paper.

I have experienced troubles with a neighbour of mine who lives across the street over the last 6 months and want to know what I could do?

Before I type it all out I know this isn't OBVIOUSLY against the law but I was wondering if it could be seen as anti social behaviour or as a minor incident that authorities could have a say on.

Basically I only have 1 parking space that doesn't obstruct a drive way outside my house without having to walk further down the road, I park between two driveways (with a good gap between each to allow cars to get out, as the guy in question has done many times without difficulties) but my neighbour over the road keeps parking outside of his driveway blocking my space (he then moves his car hours after I park down the street...

I am on a public street and not obstructing any driveways, is this something I could contact a local authority about to prevent him aggravating me and being childish? Or do I just have to keep finding another space down the street every time he does this forever?

I apologise if this is a dumb thread, but I would appreciate other peoples thoughts on this.

Idm walking a bit further to get in my car if he had someone staying over or something but it is deliberate and I'm getting fed up.

Thanks in advance for any advice guys and girls :)",18May2020,1

903,"I work for a small verifications company. I’ve only been here about six months, there’s about 10 employees in the whole company, and only two in my department being my boss and myself. I’ve been noticing for about the past two months that my boss seems to be pretty reckless with her work, and has made countless mistakes. As we do verifications and background for people applying for home loans and rentals, it’s really important that all her information is accurate. But I’ve caught countless mistakes with mixing up background reports with different applicants, requesting information that we absolutely do not need and making the process take much longer, and incorrectly submitting income for applicants, thus creating a false approval when they should’ve been denied. My boss is my only direct manager, above her is only the owner.

A couple weeks ago we had incorrectly approved an applicant To move into one of the communities we work with. I’m 100% sure that this was her mistake, but nothing ever came from it. And the applicant ended up having a severe record of sexual assault and battery, who should’ve not moved into the community.


If this were any other company I would just go over her head immediately, as I am either the one fixing the mistakes, or apparently the only one catching them even when it’s too late. The problem with this is everybody else and this company has worked here with each other for at least the past 15 years, and they’re all basically family including the owner. So I fear if I report this, it’s going to completely backfire on me, and I may just be out of a job.

I’ve considered speaking to her directly about it. But I’ve gone to her with far less severe errors of hers and she just gets pissy with me and brushes it off like it’s my fault that I caught her mistake. I’ve also considered not saying anything at all and just dealing with it. But the fact that I can’t in good conscience know that we are endangering people in these communities because of her errors, and that it’s a ton of extra work for me fixing her mistakes, I really don’t think that’s an option.

After typing them all out, I realized that this isn't the point of this post and I'd rather not share them.

More to the point-
Over the past 3 months, after I stopped vaping, I started drinking alcohol more. Basically 1 or 2 drinks a night. Almost every night. And the weekends are closer to 3 or 4 drinks a night. When I Vaped, I didn't drink this much. Maybe 1 or 2 drinks a week. I'm not sure if it's the social distancing, some sort of depression, or just something to occupy myself. 
For more info, it's not just at night. I'll have a drink at lunch every now and then too. I am a major lightweight and one or two (8%abv) drinks can get me buzzed.

Should I pick it up again and see if it helps? 
Yes I know I realistically shouldn't drink either, especially if it's becoming a concern, but if I don't have something to occupy my mind, my anxiety does it for me. I also don't do it to get drunk, unless it's a social gathering where I didn't drive.",18May2020,1

923,"As there are a lot of posts there and much less people to read them, I'll just try to be brief and I'll give more details if needed.

I have a friend who I've known for a bit now but I think it's only the last half year that we've became really good friends, or at least that's how I feel it. Actually, she is my best friend at this point even though I believe that's not bilateral. It feels like this gives way to an unequal footing between us: while I am just a medium sized picture in the mosaic of her life, she pretty much occupies a huge, and the largest part of mine (as I don't have a lot of friends anyways, that doesn't make her any less great than she is though; it's just that I'm on the average very lonely and there's her making me feel alright).

What I want to ask about, is that there is always a strange feeling that gets me after we meet (we meet, in the best case, once in twice weeks). I just feel down that day or even the day after. It's almost like if I'm having some sorts of withdrawal symptoms from her? I really enjoy being with her, but this is making me feel bad and, to a degree, guilty in feeling in a way that makes this friendship unequal. I've met her yesterday too in fact, and even though last night when I was alone was mostly alright, my whole day today has been off and blue. Reddit hivemind, what do you think, what might explain this and is there anything I could do about it?",18May2020,1
924,"I (25) am an E-5 in the USAF. I make really, really good money. But being here kills a little bit of my soul every day. It's the least happy I've ever been, and I drink and smoke far more than I ever did, and sometimes on weekends I can't even get out of bed because there doesn't seem to be a point anymore. 

But I kinda fucked myself enlisting at such a young age. I have no experience anywhere else, didn't put the time in at a good company like some of my friends, didn't learn a trade or anything. And now I can't afford to start over. My mortgage alone would drown me if I made anything less than an unreasonable amount for an inexperienced, entry-level type job. 

Everyone keeps telling me I'm young and have time to figure it out, but I don't even know where to start.

926,"This is kind of a rant, and I would post it to the ranting subreddits, but I wanted to post it here because maybe someone knows how to help me with something. 

So... Where to start...
The first place I can think of is my family. My cousins, whom we can call Rachel and Candy, have an abusive father who is also cheating on their mom. Rachel is about 20, and Candy is 13. The thing is, in this country, school goes up to the age of 20, and Rachel doesn't have a job. So she can't leave. Their father hits them and their mother, and overly favors Candy over Rachel. The father owns the house so they cannot leave because they have nowhere to go. Rachel is really depressed and hostile, school has been really hard for her so her grades are dropping. Their mother is brainwashed or some shit, because she doesn't care that her children (Rachel especially) is being abused. She also has no motif to run away, of which could be done since we have all expressed our willingness to take her and my cousins in. It really hurts me to know what my cousins (especially Rachel) is going through. I've already expressed to my parents that I would love if we adopted her. Or at least let her stay with us. They do not live in the same country as us. Apparently the dad has another family. Five kids. The woman is a military woman, so he says that he cannot leave her or she will kill him. Still doesn’t make up for his shitty behaviour towards his other family(my cousins). 

Now, onto another part of my family. My uncle is in his second marriage and finally has his first kid. Let's call my baby cousin Kevin and my new aunt Laura. I like Laura, and I try my best to. But she makes it really hard. I love her parents too, her dad especially was so nice to me. But Laura, doesn't seem like she likes her husband or my cousin very much. Many times she has given food to Kevin that should not be given to babies.  She repeatedly does this, always insisting it's for a different reason that he throwing up right now. Once, when they were staying overnight at our house, Kevin got sick. Laura knew this, but didnt tell us until an hour later. He has bruises all over his back and was crying hysterically. We got a medicine for him and it worked, but she never admitted it worked. Always, Laura would always finally say Kevin was sick when it’s almost too late. Another weird thing Laura did, was when we visited her with my grandma. My grandma sold her house and moved to our country. Since then, my uncle and my family have taken turns taking her in. Anyways, we visit, and Laura has made a special dessert for all of us. There is also a certain dessert just for my grandma. It looked the exact same as all the other desserts, so it would appear quite sketchy as to why my grandma got a certain one. Anyway, we eat it (only because we don’t want to be rude), and then my grandma gets sick. She has stomach problems for about a week, and we end up admitting her to the hospital. She’s fine now. Laura and my uncle met online. They met and talked for months. This was all while my uncle and his first wife were together. They ended up divorcing, because according to my uncle “she wanted too much jewelry”. It sounded like bs but we didn’t call him out on it. His wife was a really nice girl, and even learned my grandmas language so they could communicate. In this time, my uncle was housing my grandma, so when his first wife was pleading my grandma to let her stay just to get back on her feet (it’s a shame to go back to her home country after leaving), she said no. The house my uncle and my grandma lived in was bought and furnished using the money of my grandma. (Some from my uncle too but mainly grandma). After banishing my uncles first wife from the house, my grandma welcomed Laura with open arms, but Laura did not do the same. Laura kicked my grandma out and my uncle let her do so. My grandma does not like staying with them, and really can only stay with us now. At this moment, my grandma is with us. Now, according to my mom, my uncle and Laura are planning to go back to Laura’s home country and take Kevin (the baby) with them. They can do that of course, but I feel really shady about that for some reason. My mom has not told my grandma yet. 

Okay now let’s talk about me. I need mental help. No I’m not some “edgy thirteen year old”. I need help. I’m pretty sure I have some sort of a personality disorder. Because my personality is always changing. Sometimes I’ll act outgoing and full of myself, sometimes I’ll act quiet and shy, sometimes I’m depressed and angsty. I also have somewhat “personified” (if that’s even the right meaning) my conscience. I’ve made a person out of them. It’s kind of similar to a Dissociative Identity Disorder, but more like two people being fully conscious at the same time in one body. I call him Evan. Evan is a good guy. He does sometimes make me slap myself, but still, I don’t think I’d be alive today if it weren’t for him. Whenever I start thinking about being suicidal, or start getting really depressed, he always manages to calm me down. (He says “thanks!” To what I’m writing now). Whenever I’m bored or lonely, he keeps me company. He also continues to remind me that we are the same person and I need help. He always tells me that we share a body, so I need to take good care of it since it’s his body too, and he wants it to be nice. Personally, we think I may have made him because of a lack of relationship? Not romantically, but a good friend. I have no one to confide in, and talk to. I also have paranoia issues. Or maybe I don’t. But I always act as if someone is watching me, even if I’m alone. I always half expect someone to be on the other side of the door whenever I open a door, and I constantly look around or defend my actions when I’m alone, even though there is nobody watching! I’m also kind of wary of people. I’ve noticed a lot, that I tend to jump to conclusions and make all these stories up in my head. I’ve always assumed the worst of people. I feel like everyone is evil and against me sometimes. But there is some reasoning. In my friend group, everyone is so shady. Half of everyone has come up to me expressing their hatred towards everyone else in the group, and smack talking other people. Which then they assure me “really the only people I like is you and x” . But they say it in a way that makes me wonder if they only say me because they don’t want me to know that they also smack talk me. I feel like everyone hates me, just as much as I hate them. It’s terrible. I have terrible trouble falling asleep. Usually around 1 hour before I do. Along with the personality disorder stuff, I feel very confused about my sexuality and sexual orientation. Can you believe, that there was a night that I was on the verge of tears and I was so sure that I wanted to be transgender? I can’t. It happened more than once too. I’m always changing how I feel about those things. I’ve almost had a mental breakdown a night. Some were so bad, I had to stuff paper into my mouth so I wouldn’t make noise. There wasn’t anything particular triggering it too. I even pulled 911 out in case. But I think that made me even more scared. I thought I was gonna die. I remember thinking so many times to my future self. “Don’t forget this. No matter what you think, you need help”. Because the next day, I’m perfectly fine, and question if last night even happened at all because of how ridiculous it was. I feel like the lyrics to Paranoid by I Prevail really describe how I feel sometimes.


“Something isn't right, I feel it in my bones
Every time I look around, it follows me home
And I get so stressed out
With nobody here to listen
When my head gets loud
From the weight of this vision
All this emptiness inside
I can't fill the void in my mind
Sometimes I just wanna die
Wish that I could tell you why
Is it all inside my head?
I just can't escape the noise
Is it all inside my head?
I think I'm paranoid
I think I'm paranoid
I think I'm paranoid
Is it all in my head? I can't escape the noise
Is it all in my head? I think I'm paranoid
Take me to the edge like hands around my neck
Hanging by a thread again, I think I'm paranoid
Something isn't right, think they start to notice
Hear it in the night, in and out of focus
And I get so stressed out
With nobody here to listen
Got a head full of doubt
From the weight of this vision”

Yeah I really can relate to this song. Same with Paranoid by ASHS. For some reason, everything is a bigger deal to me. Like once , I was drawing and listening to music, having a jolly old time. Then my mom bursts into my room, complains to me about how messy my room is and how I’m useless and worthless and how fat I am that I need to exercise. I get really mad at her( I don’t express it though) and when she leaves my room I start crying. I don’t know why I found that such a big deal. I’ve always had issues with weight and body image. Only recently, did I realize that perhaps I struggled with it, when I caught myself thinking “I’m too fat and disgusting to get help”. I guess that isn’t a valid argument to not get help. I’ve tried talking to my parents, (namely my mom because I’m not as comfortable around my dad) but my mom will either blame me having mental issues on video games, or start acting like a “baby” and gets all joking. It’s really immature and I’m very unimpressed with her behaviour. She refuses to have a mature conversation with me about it. It’s like she’s trying to make it a joke so it doesn’t matter or something. My parents are convinced mental disorders are diseases and that a healthy child like me can’t get one. I told my mom about me being unable to fall asleep, and after giving me an irrelevant rant on phones, (I always stop using my phone 45 minutes before falling asleep) she said “aNd iM gOinG tO tElL tHe dOcTor aBoUt tHiS”. I don’t know if she still remembers, there is like a 5% chance she does, but if she does tell the doctor, perhaps they might have a brain cell and see that I’m not doing so well. I also feel useless. I feel like a burden. Everyone else in my family is good at something, but I’m not special enough in everything. I like to draw, but one of my cousins is a better artist. How do I know? Everyone constantly reminds me. I like to sing. But that cousin is a better singer than me! How do I know? Again, everyone reminds me. I like playing the clarinet, but again, someone else has already done that, and done it better. I’m not special in anyway. And you might say “you don’t need to be special!”. But I do if I want to feel some worth. I’m the fattest kid in the family, the ugliest one (I’m not just saying that, I promise you that if we all lined up and you had to choose the ugliest you would in fact choose me) and the  least smart. Everyone else gets straight A’s. I get average grades. I did get honour roll last year, and this year I would technically, but that’s still nothing, since my other cousins all have medals and awards and jobs and stuff. My mom once told me that she regretted getting married and having a kid. She tells me that time to time. I’m an only child btw. I feel like my life is a lie. 

My dad is being really shady, doing a lot of the things a person in an affair would do. Separate phone, separate credit card, always being shady with devices. Whenever I need to borrow his device for something, he gives me his work phone. Like what??. He also has a lock on his messages. And his phone. Everything has a lock, every single app. I caught him with a porn CD too. Can't say I blame him though. My parents aren't sexually active anymore. I can however, blame him for cheating on my mom. Which maybe he is or is not. But my mom is convinced that he is in love with his previous employer. My mom and dad have a nine year age gap, but his previous employer is the same age as him. I also want to talk about my mom. Very religious. Believes aliens exist too. Which I do as well, but I feel like she has an obsession with aliens, and it’s affecting me. She makes me sleep all cramped with stuff around me because she’s convinced that aliens will get me. She always boasts to me that she’s going to contact aliens tonight or they contacted her in her sleep or something like that. She always ruins my mood by talking about depressing things, or shit talking other people. She tries to make everything about aliens or conspiracy theories or religious related stuff. She really doesn’t bother using the internet as a resource, and I wish she would. If she just searched up “why is my child so moody and stays in her room”. My life might get better. But she won’t do that, and has diagnosed all my problems with “iPhone”. I would say my phone has helped though, more than she has. I could research using my phone, different ways to calm down when I’m having an anxiety attack, and resources to use so I can better manage my mental health. (Instead if searching up “do I have BPD” I search up “how can I handle BPD” not that I know I have BPD, but something similar that can be helped the same way”.). Sometimes I wonder if I’m making all this up, or making it a bigger deal than it needs to be. But I remember what my past self said, and then I decide I should listen to them.

Anyway, that’s all I can think of for now. I may edit this and add more stuff. It feels nice to write this all out somewhere. If you’re here, thanks. It means the world that at least someone listens to me. I know that not many people will reply to posts like this because, what do you say?? But sometimes just knowing someone knows and hearing people express empathy is all you need. Something which no one has done for me. So please comment. It would make me happier knowing someone understands, and even if you don’t, taking the time to read this post already makes me feel better. And even better, if you know something that could help me, that's amazing, please help.",18May2020,1

929,"Won't give too many details for fear of this getting out to the wrong people, but we are the moderators for a fairly medium-sized and growing Minecraft server. It hasn't been up for long but has a very tight-knit community and an extremely active discord group. The server has recently undergone a completely unexpected change where the admin turned over the server ownership and discord ownership to a completely new person. We have been members of the staff from practically as soon as the roles were created and we have been shown to be competent and fair and have the respect of the community. 

When the admin announced publically that the server would be in new hands it was a massive blow to us as we had not been given any notice of the fact. The admin promoted a complete stranger to the community or the staff, Ass Hat, as the new head of the server, claiming that he had lost interest and was too busy with work. He promoted one staff member who he had been training to take backups of the server to admin as well but had transferred the ownership of the server, RDP client, and discord to Ass Hat. 

Immediately many people in the community started freaking out because of the suddenness of the whole thing, with one mod making a joke poll to ask the community who they thought should be the new owner before the new guy was announced. As soon as Ass Hat saw this he demoted the moderator, adding more panic and confusion into the mix. He continued to ban many prominent members of the group who were simply expressing frustration or confusion over the topic. During this time, many of the mod staff were still asleep or not online. 

Finally, Promoted Staff woke up to witness the dozens of long-time members that Ass Hat had banned and was in shock. Old Admin had mentioned that their work was getting busier and that they'd turn over more responsibilities to this person, but hadn't said a word about Ass Hat or the sudden server owner change. When Promoted Staff contacted Ass Hat to ask that the discord side of the community be regulated by a longtime staff member instead of him (since he was mad with power and banning people left and right), Ass Hat told them that they were on ""thin ice"" and threatened to demote them as well. During this time, the actual Minecraft server had been offline for several hours and Ass Hat had revoked the Promoted Staff's ability to access the RDP. This meant that frustrated players were coming in droves to the discord to complain about the ""regime shift"" as they called it and to be subsequently banned. 

Currently, Ass Hat has been very evasive in answering questions and claims to know Old Admin irl and live in the same timezone. The only thing Old Admin has said in the matter is that Ass Hat is a prominent member of the Minecraft server community, but no one has found any info that corroborates that. In addition, Ass Hat claims to live in the same time zone as Old Admin and sometimes uses similar language to him while typing. After a while, Ass Hat reinstated Promoted Staff's ability to access the RDP and they managed to bring the server back online as well as smuggle out a copy of the world file.

Currently, we as the staff are trying to figure out how to deal with this. The new admin has said that he ""makes up the rules as he goes"" and says that information is ""classified"" and is tearing the community (that we have worked so hard to build) apart.  Obviously, there are suspicions that Ass Hat is the Old Admin on an alt, but many of us have been talking with the old admin regularly over the course of the server and agree that this is not something that he has shown himself capable of doing. We have also floated the possibility that Old Admin's email may have been hacked and the server backdoor, but we don't know what to do if that's the case.

If anyone has any advice regarding what we should do please let us know.   


Sincerely, Staff of a Broken Community",18May2020,1

***

Right now I'm working from home due to covid but normally, I work out of an office. In general, I don't mind small talk with coworkers.

I'm often asked normal questions like ""What did you do over the weekend?"" In the average weekend, I worked on personal projects most of the weekend - coding (programming) or analytics projects. My job is also this, but I don't work on the weekends.

I sometimes say ""I worked on some projects, how about you?"" But then they ask me what projects, and **I honestly can't remember**. I'd have to check my logs to see what I did.

So I usually end up saying ""nothing much, you?"" But then coworkers seem to think I literally did nothing, and I get unwanted recommendations for things to do on the weekends.

I (25F) had a doctor’s visit on Friday of last week to be seen about some complications I’d been having (I’ll spare you guys the details, as honestly it makes me incredibly more anxious to speak about it.) My doctor could not come to an immediate conclusion of my issue, but she discussed possibilities, ran lots of tests and told me she’d probably contact me this week with results.

I know today is just Monday, but of course over the weekend I’ve been googling my symptoms like crazy and I’ve just made myself even more anxious thinking about what this diagnosis “might be”. I’ve since stopped this, but the anxiety from the waiting alone is definitely affecting me in every other area of my life. 

I’m working from home and today I noticed that I was very distracted in my meetings. This sickness caused me to miss days of work last week because of my appointments, and I really don’t even know how to explain what’s going on with me to my bosses without feeling so uncomfortable. 

My motivation in general is at an all time low. I’m in process of moving out of my apartment, and honestly all I feel like doing is sleeping and laying in bed. But when I lay in bed, I think about this issue.

My question is, what do you do to ease your anxiety for something you highly anticipate during the pandemic? Many things I’d usually do to take my mind away from my problems aren’t options right now. With this, my mental health is declining now more than ever and I honestly have no idea how to move forward with this.

938,"I work in a very small office/machine shop. We have 5 to 7 people in our front office. We have many shared areas. A computer used daily by a minimum of 5 people, shared fridge and a few other areas. Essentially I am never more than 6 feet away from at least 1 person all day long. 

Our state has a mandatory mask at work regulation and our employer has required everyone in the building to wear a mask at all times.

So this has been in effect for for like 2 weeks and basically no one is wearing their masks unless the boss is around. We don't have a lunch room/break room so if I say anything everyone says ""Oh I was eating"" I sit in very close proximity to one person (we share a cube) and she wears her mask maybe two hours (non-consecutively) a day. she keeps it looped on one ear in case our boss comes through - she also takes frequent bathroom trips to our super tiny 2-stall bathroom to ""take off my mask and breathe for a few minutes.""

We have a shop/errand/cleaning person that almost never wears his and has talked many times about get-togethers with family and friends and he really hasn't quarantined at all (very very exposed to others)

I find myself getting more and more irritated and paranoid about the lack of hygiene and since we don't really clean anything (and don't have the supplies anyway), it's getting even worse. Because the office is so small, it's almost impossible to say anything to anyone without it becoming a huge ordeal and then getting ostracized and talked about. 

I have discussed privately with my boss about finding another place to sit, but again, very tiny office so not many options. I've talked to my co-workers about the reasons for the masks and that we should wear them and I do wear mine and I've started eating in my car and limiting my use of shared space.

About 2 and a half years ago I was in a relationship for a little over a year. Everything was absolutely amazing and I found myself actually figuring out what true love felt like. We did everything together and the trust and love shared between us was indescribable. Life just felt easier. Doing simple everyday chores, sports, grades, or whatever else were trouble free. 

Anyways, I’ll spare the details but we ended up splitting apart and after a few months she decided to try to be with a girl and she has now decided she’s lesbian. I am happy for her and they have been together ever since. I have found someone else and things are going great and I am happy. 

However, how do I lose the strong feelings I still have for my old girlfriend? I would’ve thought that by now they would’ve been gone but I can’t shake them. I am happy in my relationship now but I can’t help but miss what me and the old gf had if that makes sense. I feel terrible for having these feelings...

Thank you for reading.",18May2020,1

Recently my mother keeps saying how ""The daughters of her friends are much more female than I am, they like to put on make-up and dress like a girl unlike you""
The most recent discussion I had with her was about how I wanted to cut my hair, but she refused saying ""You're a girl, not a boy, where do you think you're going with short hair"".

949,Hello r/advice I’m a high school senior who’s about to go to college. I have extremely bad habits of procrastinating and avoiding work and being lazy. I don’t want to be this way in college since my major is going to take an insane work ethic and I don’t have that and I’m scared. My relationship with my girlfriend is in jeopardy because she doesn’t see me as ambitious or driven or anything else that will give her a good future. I’ve tried so many times to break these habits but I always find myself falling back into the same routine. Does anyone have any piece of advice on what I could do. Please,18May2020,1
950,"The simple question: What will it cost my ex when I have his car towed out of my driveway?

The details: 

The car hasn't been driven in nearly 18 months. He doesn't have a key for it. It's unlocked and literally just gathering dust.

We broke up last summer after five years together. Now he is in a mental health facility for the foreseeable future. I checked him in there in December. A few weeks later, he stopped talking to me, his family, and all his friends. 

The last several times we talked about his car, he said, ""Please just let me leave it there,"" ""Tow it, I don't care,"" and ""Never mention it to me again.""

I live in an apartment in Los Angeles and pay for two parking spots. When I decide to have the car towed, my landlord will have to be the one to actually do it. A few months ago, my landlord called me to say someone had ""broken in"" to my ex's car and left the door wide open. Yeah, yeah. It's been ransacked so many times, nobody bothers anymore.

I have no ill will against my ex. He's very, very sick. When he abruptly disappeared from our home last summer, he left not only his car, but all his clothes and possessions. Everything was all very heartbreaking and awful.

But back the fun stuff, am I right? My questions are:

What, if anything, will it cost him when I have the car towed? Will anyone be able to track him down and charge him? Or will that only happen if he tries to get his car back? Will this be a blemish on his credit rating? Or come up again if he tries to buy another car in the future? Are there daily storage fees? Is there anything else I should be thinking about? He's on disability and obviously got a lot going on, and I don't want to pile on anything without knowing the facts. I'm also in no hurry since, well, you know. Thanks.",18May2020,1
951," So when I moved into the area my extended family was living in, about five or six years ago, my cousin, we'll call her Renee, told me she thought her sister, Collette's, husband and mother-in-law wanted her husband's grandfather to die for his money. I was preturbed by this but never mentioned it because at the time, I didn't know the in-laws at all. So time goes by and I begin to love them, adopting them as my family, so what Renee said begins to bug me a lot. I finally mentioned it to Collette's husband last October after Renee was being especially bitchy. I forget about it and move on, glad it's off my chest.

Unfortunately Collette's husband mentioned it to Renee in January, which led to her being extremely mad at me for throwing her under the bus. And yeah, I get it, I totally should not have done that. I apologized on the spot, but she blocked me on everything and I typically don't see her much from January-April because we just celebrated a ton of holidays and essentially take breaks from one another.

So my closest aunt tells me how upset and angry Renee is, and I completely understand that. I try to apologize again but I don't think there's a way to know if she blocked my phone number, so I couldn't tell if she'd read it. That was end of February. I thought it was a good idea to give her some space.

Anyway, nothing happens. Quarantine starts, and eventually that aunt (call her Jade) tells me to write her a letter. I do that, but then Renee goes around telling the family that she'd unblocked me a while ago, and that me saying I'd apologized was a big lie. I was still blocked on all our social media, so I wasn't sure what she was talking about. Regardless, end of April I send a longer, more sincere apology text, drafted from my letter, to no reply. Meanwhile Renee is telling Jade that she's pretty much over the whole thing, but she can't trust me yet. I understand that. I texted her a happy Mother's Day too, to no reply. Then I was talking to my sister about how Renee's son's fourth birthday is coming up, and I'd like to go, but I wasn't sure if she was still mad at me.

So my sister, Juniper, blows and though I prevent her from sending a nasty text, she still asked Renee ""Why are you ignoring {me}."" Renee replied with ""Excuse me?"" to which my sister said ""You're excused,"" because she's the jokester. Juniper is like Renee in the sense that they are both very stubborn and will hold a grudge, so this behavior should not have been out of the ordinary.

Renee went CRAZY. She called Juniper a little girl (my sister and I are older teens, both borderline 20s) and said that she was just going to block Juniper next, and that Juniper was making things harder for me. So then she sends me a bunch of nasty texts, accusing me of sending my sister after her when Juniper merely asked her a question. I said I couldn't apologize for what my sister did, and she told me to stop digging a hole for myself. Straight up I said ""I don't see how I'm digging myself a hole when it's my sister's actions you're mad about."" She claimed this justified her reasons for pushing me out of her life and that all I want is drama. I told her I loved her, reminded her that I had already apologized for the aforementioned event several times, and said sorry again. I told her I didn't want to fight. She said ""I want absolutely nothing to do with any of you anymore,"" which could mean me and my sisters (I have two, though Kristen wasn't involved with this) and I think blocked us both.  

The thing that makes me so angry about this rash behavior is that my mother recently spent a week in the hospital with really bad pneumonia. I thought she was going to die, though I was extremely relieved she didn't have COVID. It was a difficult week without her and I spent so much time worrying. So I was curt to remind her, whether she had blocked me or not already, that my mother almost died and that took a severe toll on me, and that I cannot begin to heal from the rift I caused in my relationship with her (Renee) until she was ready to heal too. I also straight up told her that I hate myself for what I did and I wish I could take it back, but ultimately I cannot.

She then proceeded to call my aunt Jade, who was completely on my side because Renee's argument didn't make any sense. I hadn't done anything. Renee claimed that she wasn't ignoring me anymore, but I was still yet to hear from her, so her point wasn't valid. As far as I was aware, she was not answering me, so she was still ignoring me. Jade points this out. So Renee blocked her too.

I know the initial thing I did was wrong, and I have learned from it. I should not have sold her out. I should have mentioned it to her instead, but she is sometimes very hard to deal with and it just came out. I get it if she doesn't want to trust me anymore. But we have a very close extended family and it isn't like either of us is going to go away. I don't know how to deal with the drama. Let me know if I'm in the wrong, because though Renee is ALWAYS like this, I still feel so much guilt. I can't keep apologizing for what I did if it means demeaning myself, because she's only seven years older than me. She's not my superior in any way, and I'm an adult. I don't answer to her. So what are y'all's thoughts? Overall I just feel very hurt and I want this to be over. I understand her anger at my initial actions but I didn't do anything wrong when it came to my sister. She hardly listens to anybody.",18May2020,1
952,"Hey everyone, 

I (F23) went on a date a few nights ago (Saturday) with (m24) and we both had a great time. We spent five hours talking and he begged me to stay longer, which I did. He even wanted to make plans with my for Monday. The next day, we were texting a bit and something just felt......off. By that, I mean that before our date, he would be constantly texting me. Now it takes him thirty minutes to an hour to respond. I have also been careful to not appear needy and text back immediately. I also asked him today if he wanted to still hang out and he said that he was afraid that we would be too tired from work and suggested that we go out again later this week. 

I know this is a silly question to ask, but I am afraid that he's already losing interest in me after one date. He has said in previous texts that he didn't want to come off as clingy, so maybe that's why hes taking longer to respond. We just had a great date and I am just worried that he is already starting to regret it. I know I am probably overthinking it, but what do y'all think?",18May2020,1
953,"I recently broke up with my boyfriend of a year and a half, and a few weeks afterwards one of his best friends contacted me to check in. He told me that he wanted to make sure I was doing ok.

I even told him I thought things would be awkward between us and he told that regardless of what happened between my ex and I, he didn't want to throw away the friendship we had. 

Anyway, today we were hanging out and the topic of my ex came up a few times. It really hurts me to talk about it and I didn't want to make his friend feel like he had to pick sides.

956,"Does He Even Like Me (Venting/Need Advice)

I met this guy around the last week of January and had our first date on the second week of February. We've had a couple more dates since then. Fast forward to 3 months later, I'm still with him (not exclusively though).

Within about a month into talking/dating, I finally decided to go back on Twitter after taking a long break from it. I asked for his user so we can follow each other. I looked through his tweets and found one that was posted around the 2nd week of January saying something along the lines of ""I'm keeping myself busy so I don't have to think about you."" I confronted him about it which turned into a conversation about his ex, who he visited during Christmas/New Year of 2020 and ended up friendzoning him. I felt a little weird about that because it all felt too soon, and kind of made me feel like a rebound. He reassured me though that's he's over her. 

A few weeks after that instance, I was scrolling through my Twitter. Twitter does this thing where they show tweets that people you follow liked. He liked his ex's tweet that's why it showed up on my timeline.

I went back on Instagram, and his ex's profile was public which let me see her posts. Each picture was liked by him.

Now, I'm feeling a little heartbroken knowing that they're still in contact with each other in every social media. They have a streak together on Snapchat, follow each other on Twitter, and follow each other's main and spam on Instagram. 

People say that you keep in contact/remain friends with your ex either because you were not emotionally invested, or too attached to let go. It's hurting me a lot because I know the first one can't be true, being that he went across the country to visit her in the holidays. Being that they dated in high school, were each other's prom dates, graduated together. 

I know social media should not determine everything and ""it's not that deep"" but I feel too deep about this. It's hard to shrug off. 

He always reassures me that he likes me and that he's serious about me, but I can't help but feel so suspicious. I don't want to keep pressing him on about his ex because the more I talk about her, the more he might think about her. Of course, I want to believe him but I'm just so :-/ I don't know.

972,"Hey everyone. I was curious about receiving some advice on soundproofing a part of my house to hopefully mute the sound coming through the shared wall to the neighbors. 

My fiancé and I bought an old duplex in an old little town a month ago. We were very happy and excited as it was the nicest house we felt our money could buy and it is in a beautiful area. Unfortunately, the neighbor moved in a few weeks ago and has been rather noisy (blasting heavy metal on his stereo, playing his electric guitar on a high volume, speaks very loudly on the phone, etc.).

I have interacted with him on plenty occasions and he is very friendly. So I have no problem going over to his house to ask him to turn down his music or whatever he’s got going on - which I’ve done twice now. However, it doesn’t necessarily fix the problem as we can still hear whatever he’s doing after speaking with him. 

I have ADD and am a teacher, so I need to be able to focus as I teach from home and the noise I’m hearing is making that very difficult. Also, the dude’s just living his life and I don’t want him to have to change the way he behaves in his own home so that we’re comfortable.

So my question, and what I’m hoping to receive some advice on, is possibly some ways to deafen the sound from our end. I’ve done some research and saw that there’s sound proofing tiles that you can install on the wall... which is a route I don’t necessarily want to take but will look at if there are some high quality ones that someone recommends. Are there any products or construction recommendations we can possibly do to that part of the house to help solve the problem?",18May2020,1

976,"I have a great relationship with my team, we all get along well and chat regularly at work, but one of my colleagues is really starting to get on our nerves. 

He's a great guy, a close friend of mine which makes this situation harder because I don't want to lose him as a friend, but I really don't know how he will react to me just having a word with him because given how *passionately* he lies it feels like it will probably offend him.

But at the same time every conversation with him is starting to feel like a chore, you can't mention anyone famous without him knowing them and sharing stories of them together, one of them died two years ago which proves he's lying. You can't talk about any major topic with him bringing up his *lawyer/pilot/doctor/journalist/soldier/FBI/music producer/hollywood-actor* etc.. brother (and his ONLY brother) to back up his ""expert"" knowledge of the topic. Everything is always ""my friend"" this or ""my friend"" that, he acts like he knows every detail about every topic because his ""friends"" are elites in every sector from governments to underground music scenes, or how he got drunk with the head of Russian mafia on holiday. Even discussing opinionated topics, he will say something reasonable but then back it up with lies. I could go on for ages... 

He's a CHRONIC liar, it's almost like he has a lying addiction, his entire life is a fictional story he's made and it's so annoying for us because he doesn't need to do this, we won't think any more of him if these stories were true but he loses so much respect for constantly lying to us. it's never anything malicious like having cancer, or anything for financial/sympathy gain, it's just repetitive stories designed to ""impress"" us I'm guessing. We all try to *hint* we don't' give a shit through body language or just bland replies in conversation or switching subject but he just doesn't get it and tries even harder. 


Is there anything I can do to try and stop this without causing tension between us? has anyone had experiences with compulsive liars that can advise or is it just too risky?

Now when my sister makes a mess and I don't clean it in time my mom freaks out and screams at me that I am just someone who lives in her house and she just treats me like I'm some bum on the streets and I'm just her god damn slave not to mention I've been grounded for the last 4 months because she caught me smoking a cigarette after I left the house because she flipped out on me because I didn't clean my sister's room.

980,"For me, otherwise known as “Falling Out Of Love anxiety”.

Anyway, I just am dealing with an anxiety that me or my partner will fall out of love. I’ve been in this relationship for two months, now, and she’s really special. There’s a lot more to our connection than simple lust and infatuation, and that’s really great. I just keep focusing on a day where she tells me she doesn’t love me, anymore, or maybe my feelings fade and I don’t love her. I never want this, but I can’t control this. Reddit, how do I cope with this? 

This is my second serious relationship. Losing the first one hurt, but it wasn’t a nasty toxic mess. We’re still on good terms. 

I just have fears. I want to be the best man I can be for her, and for me. I know that I’m a human and these feelings are normal, and I’m not perfect. It’s just difficult, sometimes.",18May2020,1

982,"Background: I’m an 18yo trans guy with depression, social anxiety, ADHD, and an eating disorder. Quarantine is still in effect where I live, but even when it ends, I want to keep social distancing for a while (the second wave of a pandemic is always the worst &amp; several members of my household have compromised immune systems). 

Most of the time, being in public terrifies &amp; drains me, but hanging out with my friend group brings my energy back up and just boosts my mental health in general. Without school, work, or my friends to force me to take care of myself, my depression is the worst it’s been since middle school. If I have any moment where I’m not intensely focused on something, I automatically start overthinking about covid-19, which leads into a panic attack- so I’ve been putting all my spare energy into my current hyperfixation (half-life). 

I haven’t been eating regularly enough, my sleep schedule has gone to shit, and I’d rather spend 10+ hours watching half-life playthroughs than interact with people. 

I’m mostly worried about how it’s affecting my boyfriend- he struggles with psychosis and is co-dependent. I’ll often get sidetracked and forget to text him for several hours, or I’ll be asleep for 20+ hours at a time and won’t be able to text him. We can’t video chat or call, because it’ll cause him to hallucinate noises that make him think I’m in some kind of trouble. I don’t like talking to him about my hyperfixations, because he’s a dry texter, and my RSD will convince me he’s uninterested in what I have to say (which will just make everything worse). 

What can I do to help make things easier to bear? And what can I do to make it easier to be there for my boyfriend?",18May2020,1

I grew up doing activities that you can’t do much in the country so I have absolutely no interest in doing country related hobbies such as riding horses, raising farm animals, etc. The town is extremely small with nothing to do unless you drive 45 minutes away to the nearest “city” if you can even call it that. It’s pretty much just a place with slightly more things to do. And on top of all that, my closest friends and my girlfriend live in a big city about 2 and a half hours away and I only get to see them once a month. And if I talked to my parents about moving it would never work since my dad is a cardiologist and had a great job down here. Plus all my younger siblings love it down here since they were raised in this environment. I want to move down to that city with my friends so bad but I have absolutely no control.

And just to make sure she told me a place where they were having tests for covid. With that she sent me home and told me she was going to send the information on where to go. At home I told my mother and sister, about my appointment and with the possibility of having covid. Having them hearing I may have gotten covid, they reacted by being angry with me. ""How could you have gotten it if you haven't been working in 3 months! All of  sudden after finding a new job and only working for 4 days, you have it?!"" I told them it wasnt 100% if I have gotten it, but they ignored that fact and started saying that I probably wasnt taking this virus seriously. And if I was, I wouldnt have gotten it.
So they decided that I was going to be punished by removing internet. Which it was the only way I could chat with friends, possibly getting kicked out of my home. Just for the possibility of having it. and cutting my phone. I did do my best for following basic practices like washing hands and avoiding lots of touching the faces. And I find it disturbing that even my family can be so greatly feared by this virus to do this. To punish me for something I couldn't even control.

So I guess what I need to hear is. How should I live with this, up until I get actual tested. I wont be able to work in the meantime, and the possibility of getting kicked out. Hopefully you are able to understand my writing",18May2020,1

So over the last month I've been experiencing similar extremely vivd dreams relevant to the same exact event that I'm struggling in real life with. Someone I was extremely close has left my life for their own reasons, and while I try to accept that and I don't reach out anymore, I'm still extremely dissatisfied with how things are and it's hard to move on. I thought time would be the solution but it seems that my own mind is against me, as every night in my dreams an extremely similar set of events happens: we meet, we talk and we become friends again. Sometimes it might be in different ways, different contexts, different situations, even while implementing elements from my days or events that happened in real life, so I wouldn't say it's a matter of having the same dream but coming up with the same pleasantry every night.

This repeating happy thought in my dreams haunts me once I wake up knowing I still cannot reach out to that person and I still cannot reconnect. It's haunting me how I live out my outmost desire every night to wake up in this world I don't like. I have had occasions where I'd sleep through my alarms and my classes until the dreams ended, even if I was well rested and such.

Today I woke up at 6pm after an 11 hour sleep and the happiest dream so far, and reality hit me like a truck, it's getting harder to study on my finals and focus on my responsibilities, as getting out of bed in the morning is getting harder and harder, as is accepting the situation I am currently in. I am at a loss on what to do, how to move on and how to discipline my mind into behaving correctly.

989,"A little background here: 
My younger sister had two children. (F5, B3). Shortly after her son's birth  three years ago she became hooked on drugs. Abandoned her children and proceeded to abuse her friends and family members until no one she had ever known would speak to her . 
Her ex boyfriend stepped up to the plate and for the last three years has devoted his life to working 6 days a week and raising the children by himself. My  BIL ( brother in law) doesnt do much for himself now. No hanging out with friends, he hasnt even so much as gone on a date in three years, to my knowledge.
I admire him greatly for staying and working so hard. 
The relationship between him and me is decent. We can text about the kids and I'll visit about 2/3 times a month. The rest of my family either lives out of town or makes his life difficult and he has limited contact with them to the bare minimum. 
Here is where I need some advise. Recently in my last few visits I have noticed that BIL does not discipline. I have never seen the children in time out or a corner. Anything. My niece will constantly  take my purse and dig through it for candy or makeup. I do the bend down to eye level thing and the ""this isnt yours, no no"" thing. But she is right back at it as soon as she can.  I have since started leaving my things in the car.  She will grab food from the fridge or candy ( its abundant in their house and easy to reach) and will refuse to touch her food and instead eats candy. I try to get them both to say please and thank you and she will start to throw a tantrum instead of trying to use her manners. I do not give in but her father does and I feel like hes looking at me with the thought of "" seriously, dont upset her. what are you doing"" all of these are basically small things. Yet yesterday was her 5th birthday party. I had bought presents on behalf of my additional 3 sisters to bring to her. I was very excited because it was things I would have loved as a little girl. Well present time starts because shes refusing to eat her dinner. Sitting at the table, She start THROWING her opened presents on the floor. Dad just laughs. Says ""sweet dont do that"" but the next three presents are taken and chucked over her shoulder onto the ground. I tried to stop her for a moment  and explain if she breaks them they won't be fun to play with. I dont dare  physically stop her from throwing presents. I dont feel like it's my place. Long story short. I spent 100 dollars on cute toys that were thrown onto the ground in front of me. It hurt my feelings. It upset me  . I cant imagine ever acting that way as a child. I love my niece and shes fun to be around and play with most of the time but only when she is getting her way. I feel completely stuck that she is not my child and I can not discipline her. BIL has cut off half my family from seeing them and I feel if I make myself a problem in his life I will see them less and less until I dont. As of now I am the last connection between them and any of their mothers side of the family. Its important to me I remain in their lives but the father does not want my parenting advise.

Title sums it up pretty well. Yesterday, my friend (who is also my roommate) asked me to go into her room to see if she had left her bike keys at home, she was worried she had lost them while she was out so wanted me to check.

While I was looking for them, I found a small tub filled with paracetamol pills. I don't know if it's like this everywhere, but in Europe at least we have packets for medicine with foil over them, each pill is individually wrapped. So, she has manually gone through what seemed like many packets of paracetamol and emptied the medicine into a separate hidden container.

I'm quite worried, I don't see any use for this other than possible harm. I don't know if I'm just being paranoid, or if I'm right in assuming that. Should I bring it up? And if I do, how should I do it? I don't want to assume the worst of her, or scare her off and drive her away if she really is having a tough time.

(And if this helps, I've not really noticed any changes in her behaviour, mood, eating etc. so she isn't noticeably depressed or suicidal, but I understand that these things can easily slip under the radar)

Throughout my life (24 years) I’d say I’ve put in about 60% effort of what I’m capable of. I’ve just been coasting without too much stress and somehow I’m doing ok. At school I was a solid B student as I always wanted to work on building a business instead of studying but at the same time I wanted to do just enough to get by. I have also been VERY lucky with work. 

As I get older I realise I only have two choices:
1 - Keep coasting and just be average or slightly above average and  hope I keep on getting lucky in life; or
2- increase the amount of effort I put in so I can determine my future a little more. 

I’m leaning towards 2 as I can’t live the coasting life anymore. However I don’t want to overdo it and slip back into old ways at the first sign of trouble...

I am supposed to be applying for jobs and definitely get one by the end of this year. I am constantly thinking about applying here and there, projects to add to my resume, upgrading my skills, and hunting for opportunities. Every waking hour is spent on mindlessly working towards getting a job. It is almost like a spontaneous reflex now and I feel guilty if I do anything else like watching Netflix or spending too much time on pretty much anything that is not academics related.

I’ve been blessed and I know it, and I know that’s what some people are going to tell me in these comments. But it doesn’t help. I don’t want her to feel like it’s her fault, because it’s not. Without my fiancé idk what I’d do with my life. But I’m still upset all the time. I just don’t know what to do because I feel like I can’t talk to anyone. So here I am.",18May2020,1
1015,I think I want to have sex with my best friend both males and not sure if he is bi he acts like he’s not interested in women. Known for 10 years how should I approach this?,18May2020,1
1016,"So I am a female who works at a car dealership in the service department. I'm not a technician, but I work with them. I am the only female that works in the parts and service departments currently. Apparently I'm one of only a few females that have worked this position at all at this dealership. Keep in mind, this is a fairly new job. I haven't even been here 6 months yet. 

I am in a very physical position where I have to carry tires and batteries and other large parts. I have no issue with doing these jobs, as I knew what I was getting into when I agreed to work here. I honestly don't mind getting a bit of a workout at my job. The guys I work with joke with each other in a manner I'm not overly comfortable with. It's very much locker room speak. I can pretty easily ignore this however. 

My issue here is the manager I have to deal with. This manager seems to hold me to a higher standard than my male co-workers. If I do something wrong, he calls me out in front of everyone. And if a male co-worker does the exact same thing, he stays quiet and doesn't bring it up to this guy. He will yell at me multiple times per day if he feels I've done something wrong, even if I really hadn't and he didn't understand. 

I ask questions about what I'm supposed to be doing  just to be sure, and he almost always snaps at me or mocks me. No one else says anything in my defense.  However, if I don't ask my question and end up doing it wrong, I get yelled at again. So I'd rather ask too many questions than be yelled at.  But this manager jokes with all of my male co-workers who are at the same level as me. I'm the only one he likes to yell at. 

Another issue I have, is there is one technician that tends to act very ""creepy"" towards me. I get the typical ""thanks hun"" when I take papers to some of the older technicians. Being from the south, I understand that this isn't meant as a creepy thing and is something that you hear fairly often (at least in my experience, plus, as a female in this industry you pick your battles.) But in this case, I was taking papers to a technician who didn't happen to be in his bay at the time. I set his paperwork on his desk, and turned to walk away. But he was standing very close to me (within 6 inches of me) and he startled me when I turned. He just stood there and stared at me. This may have not been anything weird, but it's left me feeling unsettled, for lack of a better term, since then. Especially when I have to go to his bay. 

I genuinely like this job, and it's something I've wanted to do since I started working on my own cars. I'd hate to quit. But with the blatant double standard and borderline harassment that I get from these men, I've been considering it. What should I do?",18May2020,1

1018,"So, as the title states. My sister has a bad habit of getting animals, realizing she can't take care of them, and I end up with them (2/3 times)

The first incident was with a baby snake she got when she was 20. She didn't realize what went into feeding and caring for it. She kept it in one of those plastic little hamster cages. She moved out and left it and a lot of stuff in her room for me to go through (as the younger, I got the bigger room when she moved out). Luckily, I had an older friend who had snakes and had a breeder friend that took the little guy as he had the means to care for it.

Second incident was when her kids (5 and 3 at the time) wanted a cat, so she obliged. Merlin came into the picture. She is not an animal person, did not want to care for him. The kids constantly grabbed him, squeezed, held him longer than he wanted resulting in lots of scratches. He was restricted to a cut off section of a porch, about 3 feet by 5 feet with just food, water, and unkept litter. Apparently her last straw was when he was inside he popped in the bed under the sheets. That night she called me and told me to come get ""the thing."" When she gave me him, she grabbed him by his neck scruff and tossed him at me about 3 feet away. I can still feel how deep his claws dug into my shoulder blade. Within two days Merlin was a completely new cat, and I've never had any issue with him. He is the sweetest boy. 

About six months ago she got another cat for the kids. When I found out, I was highly upset and I knew she would ultimately ask me to take care for this cat. I thought it would have been last week, when I watched the cat during the day while something was done in their house. But lo and behold, today she texts me that the cat is ""scratching everything"" and she can't take it anymore and do I want the cat?

(Weird thing too, both these cats have sun spots in their eyes, and while  my vet says its fine I can't help but think this may be related to my sister)

I have two cats of my own, Merlin and Loki. I'm also currently cat-sitting my mother's cat as her house is under construction, for at least 3 more weeks. I only have a one bedroom apartment where the living room, dining room, and kitchen are just one space. It's not very big but it works for me and my two boys.

So I guess the advice I'm looking for is two part - should I take this cat so she won't be abused? My sister is not a good person and I could see her just letting the cat out on the side of the road or something. 

Second part would be, does anyone have any advice on how to bring up the subject to her about not adopting any more animals? She has a TBI as well so she can be forgetful.

Thanks for reading and for any advice.",18May2020,1

Hey all, throwaway account here with a conundrum. I'm not one for introductions so I'll just drop info here.

  


\------

  


I work for Company A. They pay a good rate. The job involves using my car for appointments with customers. I get a monthly stipend for using my car. The job is in a field I love, and is made quite easy because of deals the company has. It's a maintenance job, and all our parts come from OEM sources, customers are well taken care of, and pay way less than they ordinarily would. Finally, there's chatter that there may be a spot opening that would allow my boss to move up in the company. He generally sees me in a positive light, and i may be considered for a promotion in the near future. Generally a happy job.

  


But, I have a couple big worries. Firstly, the amount of jobs that I can do has dwindled significantly due to the Covid outbreak. Secondly, a lot of people in the region have been stealing time, and so the way we are paid has been changed. I'm currently sitting in my car on a 13+ hour day that I probably won't get paid for over half of. Lastly, the job is doing a number on my car, and it is depreciating much faster than I'm being paid for it.

  


The possible promotion could happen at any time. That would likely take care of all of these issues at once. Knowing this, I was perfectly happy to continue as I was, at least until I found out about whether the promotion was coming or not.

  


The wrench in the works is that my dad has cancer. I live with him, and when he dies, I won't be able to afford to keep our house. I just found out about this, but he apparently learned some months ago. It's a quick acting cancer, and we have no clue how long he could live, and he refuses to get treatment. Long story short, I can NOT afford to dip into my savings right now.

  


I also received an offer from Company B. Company B is much smaller, we're talking a handful of local stores vs. a national enterprise. They offered to match my pay and guarantee me a minimum fully paid 40 hour workweek. The job would be in a store, so I wouldn't have to use my vehicle other than commuting. The parts would be aftermarket, and the little things I like about Company A wouldn't be a thing, but the field and core work are the same.

  


I don't like the idea of giving up my current job. But right now, I'm not getting paid nearly as much as I was (I now make less than I did when I used to work in a grocery store), and I don't know if I'll suddenly need to move. I don't qualify for any pandemic assistance either, because I still am scheduled full time. My state's unemployment department has declined my reduced hours claims multiple times. I'm at a loss for what to do right now, and I'm hoping some people more experienced than me might have some insight. Thanks!",18May2020,1
1021,"This happened a while ago, I was 14F. I had a 17M “friend” that had asked me out on numerous occasions. The first time was because his crush had just moved schools and he saw me as a replacement, even admitting as such.

I friend zoned him twice, I think. We started dating in the end for maybe two weeks, but I ended it because he kept getting touchy when I wasn’t comfortable with it, and I didn’t actually like him (my friends encouraged me to accept).

This happened before we starting “dating.” He and a couple of his his friends (all guys) were going through the phase where they experimented with alcohol, and they enjoyed getting drunk quite frequently.

I was invited and I went with them, to the house of the 17M guy. I felt uneasy and I never had alcohol before. I drank a bit, and I was tipsy I think, but I pretended to be way drunker than I actually was. Maybe it was dumb, but I did it because I wanted to see if the group of “friends” could actually take care of me, or if they would take advantage of me, or I don’t know.

Basically at one point I remember two of them saw I was extremely “drunk” and carried me to a bed. Either coincidentally or purposefully, the 17M was lying on the bed. I think we lay side by side and he turned me. I remember his exact words: “can I be selfish?”

This struck instant alarm bells and I got out of there. I quickly stood up and left the room, and I think very shortly after I also left the house.

My question is, was I right to do this? What kind of situation had I actually gotten myself into? Looking back, it seems I did the right thing, but I also feel guilt and I wonder if I overreacted, and I’ve been confused and really lost about this whole event. If anyone can share their insight, I would be so grateful.

TLDR: pretended to be drunk and was actually tipsy. was carried to the bed by two “friends.” another “friend” who I would wind up dating asked if he could be selfish while lying on the same bed as me, and I got very uncomfortable and left.",18May2020,1

1025,"I'm 30 years old, and have spent the last 12 years of my life coming from a poor family, living on my own living paycheck to paycheck with no savings, a dead end job, and student loan debt with only an associate's degree to completely debt free, money in savings, money in retirement, making over 100k/year running my own business as a freelancer, and in great physical shape.  I thought that I was doing great, until I realized that there's one obstacle that I cannot remove; my mother in-law.

My mother in-law and I do not see eye to eye.  She is heavily reliant on appearances, she is rude, she will insult me passively, and insist on making me do things I don't want to do.  However, she does not use profanity, and is also very wealthy (millions) thanks to her husband's mother.

Here's my question.  It's not illegal to be rude to somebody.  However it is illegal to cause harm to someone who is rude to me.

The concept of ""The Pen is mightier than the Sword"" is that administrative power is a more effective tool than direct violence.

But what happens when I'm dealing with someone who has more administrative power than me?  How do I regain power so that I can feel respected?  I can't compete in terms of money, it's already taken me so long just to get the small amount of success that I have?

How can I effectively win back my power without using violence?",18May2020,1

When I got home I went online to pay the ticket and I realized that the ticket I got was completely illegible. It looks like they write it on the paper with copies underneath it, and they give you the copy and keep the original. Well mine was totally illegible, like the cop didn’t push down hard enough on the paper or something. So I took it to the police station and asked their advice. What do I do? The clerk at the police station turned me away and said if it’s illegible it probably won’t get entered into the system. 

Okay, so I waited a few days and checked in again... Still not in the system or anything. 

Then, I just forgot about it. I never received any further communication, calls, mail or ANYTHING relating to this ticket. 

Fast forward to today (5/18/20) and I went online to get a new drivers license with my new address on it. This is when I found out that my license has been suspended for nearly 2 years!

1040,"My brother's hs will be holding an in-person graduation, and limiting attendees to 4 per student and claim to implement ""social distancing"". I believe that this decision is incredibly irresponsible. Potentially hundreds of students plus 4 attendees each under one roof. The neighboring district is doing the same with each of their high schools. Yikes.

I have a phone call to speak with the superintendent of the school district about this. I want to express my concerns, though I don't have high expectations considering its the south lol. Regardless, I'm nervous and want to make this opportunity count by effectively making points about the risks of holding this event. Does anyone have any advice on points I can make or examples I can bring up and how to effectively word them? Also feel free to share your perspective if you agree with holding the graduation - could be insightful for me.

Currently, I plan to mention:

\- Understanding of the value of one's high school graduation - it's my own brother graduating and my family has been working years to help him get to this point.

\- Commend their decision to quickly transition to online classes. There are digitial solutions that can be applied to graduations too.

\- How this event completely disregards CDC recommendations on mass gatherings and warnings of asymptomatic individuals.

\- The state governor acknowledging that students in his state will not be having traditional ceremonies and is hosting a virtual ceremony for them. What is the difference between this community and the other communities in the state and nation who are acknowledging the severity of the pandemic and taking steps to adapt?

\- This sends the message that the pandemic is not as big of a deal as one's graduation and devalue's the efforts of essential workers especially health care personnel, and really everyone around the world who is doing their part to fight this disease and limit it's spread.

\- I've been getting a lot of bs responses that include ""The safety of our students is our priority"" or something along those lines. I want to respond with "" I feel like you can't say such a statement and really truly mean it when you make a decision to hold an in-person ceremony with hundreds of attendees despite the warnings about mass gatherings"" It's not just my brother's high school, but the other schools in this district and the neighboring district who will be holding ceremonies.

Some questions I want to ask:  
\- How will you know if someone with covid-19 walks into the venue?  
\- Are there any concerns about asymptomatic individuals?  
\- After graduation, students will want to take photos with their friends. How will you regulate that?  
\- Is there an exit strategy after the graduation?  
\- What other options for the ceremony were you considering before this decision?

1046,"I'm going to try and summarize this as best I can, as it contains a bunch of really difficult topics for me to think about, but I hope everything still comes off as clear and understandable.

Some (related to the situation) background info:

I am approaching my late 20's. I am the victim of life-long mental abuse by my family, but I finally got away from them a few years ago. I have a handful of mental issues (PTSD &amp; OCD) related to my family, and cannot talk to them, be in contact with them, or come into contact with anyone or anything or anywhere that they have been in contact with. I moved thousands of miles away from them.

Here's my current issue: My parents took out 30k in student loans in my name without my knowledge when I went to college. I don't mean to sound like a brat, but after high school I made it clear to them that I only wanted to attend a college that would not put me into debt afterwards. They insisted I go to a ""better"" school and told me they would pay for everything. I had been their victim all my life and was manipulated again and blinded by the idea of simply getting away from them. I was stupid and trusted them, and after I graduated they told me that I would be responsible for 30k in loans (plus the accumulating interest.)

If I had known they were going to do this, I would have never gone to college. So in the 5+ years since graduating, I broke free from them and have been on my own up until about 2 years ago (when I met my now-wife.) 

I've been trying to save money to pay for the loans but life keeps kicking me in the face. All I want is to be free of these loans so I can stop thinking about my evil family and what they did to me after college and all my life growing up. I can't even get into contact with the loan company to see what the current balance of the loan is (although I've paid nothing off since I just can't seem to escape poverty despite my best efforts) because the loan company people have spoken to my family before, and I can't contact or talk to anyone that they've spoken to due to my OCD &amp; PTSD.

I just don't know what to do.",18May2020,1
1047,A few of my friends make me feel really bad over the fact I’m still a virgin and I’ve never had a boyfriend. I wouldn’t say I’m ugly per se as I’m often told I’m pretty but I’m also fat so I feel like that might be what is holding me back.,18May2020,1
1048,"Hello, so, I’m looking for roommates and an apartment to move out. One of my best friends is telling me to move out together and is being really persistent about it. The thing is that she has BPD, I try to be patient and help her any time she needs it, however I’m a person that can get depressed (I was diagnosed with high functioning depression years ago) and one of the things that has helped is being alone sometimes, with my thoughts and own space. I love my friend and I want to support her but she sometimes can get really verbally aggressive, intense, and extremely angry in an instant. I’ve gone to the beach with her for 4 days and I’ve experienced it. Of course I try to help her, be compassionate but sometimes I feel emotionally drained, exhausted, and anxious. I don’t think I won’t be able to live with her, specially because we are extremely good friends and if I tell her that I want space she’ll get extremely sad which I don’t want her to. I would prefer a more impersonal roommate to be with and someone that I know will respect my privacy and alone time, without feeling sad or taking it personally. What can I do? How do I tell her?",18May2020,1
1049,So my crush and I met in her house and it went good until I had to go for an hour to my house to do some tasks. After an hour I came back to her house and she started being toxic to me. after some time I got angry and I was mean to her. She said I need to go and after some time she texted me that she is sorry about being toxic. So today I called her and it also went good until we got into a fight and she disconnected from the call without saying anything so I asked one of my friend to talk with her and she said that she doesn't want to talk to me and that I was toxic to her. So tommorow is the end of the quarantine and we are going back to school but I'm scared of a weird situation that could happen between us and I'm also scared that my crush wouldn't want to talk to me anymore.

1051,"My mother and I don't have the best relationship. In fact I only talk to her or tolerate her because she still has myb2 younger siblings living with her. I went to her wedding yesterday (wedding number 5 I might add) and honestly, i didn't feel anything but hatred. I hate her new husband and a part of me hates her. Here's where the anxiety comes in. In 2018 she went through a nasty divorce that got so physically violent my siblings and I had to move in with my grandparents for roughly 2 months. During this time, she called her brother who is currently in prison for life and asked him to protect her. Enter new husband. She moved him into our home after 2 weeks of knowing him. While my siblings and I were at my grandparents, my 21st birthday passed. It was a day full of anxiety attacks, crying myself to sleep, wake up, repeat because going out meant I risked seeing her not quite ex husband. She spent all of 30 minutes with me that night before saying she had to go because her new boyfriend was off work. When we finally moved home, the night we did so, she expressed he would be moving in permanently with his teenage daughter. She has never prioritized me or my siblings, always choosing her men over us instead. I've made it clear I don't like her new husband for a multitude of reasons. He cheated on her at the start of the relationship(blamed his depression), when she was laid off last year he told her he thought she was a gold digger and flat out told her he downloaded tinder and was speaking to other women. He was arrested(for what she still wont say), and if we ask about how he knows our ""uncle"", whatcha does for him, how they met, or anything involving one specific tattoo, he claims up and says it's none of our business. This alone makes me not trust him because he is in a house with my two siblings that I raised. He is shady as hell but all she sees is he makes her happy so screw what's best for the kids. She's wanting to meet for lunch on wednesday and I agreed because if i blow her off, i lose contact with my siblings.

Back when I was applying, I showed interest in a school somewhere else in my state that would lead to me separating from my parents, and that lead to a hellish argument that involved endless guilt tripping over “leaving my family behind”. I’ve dealt with a lot throughout my life thanks to them, and I’ve also been denied plenty of common pleasures as well such as not being allowed to have friends. I am at a point where I really do not want to live in this house that I feel I cannot call my home, and I have no idea how to break the news to them or if I should just dip and leave a note. For some context, they are the type of parents that do not care about what I say and only do what they think is best for me with the argument that they love me, such as taking my keys away for lying about going to work when really I was hanging out with my friend. I have a hard time speaking to them about anything serious that they do not want to hear as they discredit me for being a child (in their eyes) and call me selfish and immature for not seeing their point of view.

1062,"Hello. I am 29 years old and still living at home with my mom. The reason I am still living at home is not a financial one - I work full-time and have about $60,000 saved up to put a down payment on a house. It’s an emotional reason - my dad died about 6 years ago and, while I am fine, I worry about my mom and her well-being. I have these intense feelings of guilt whenever I think about moving out. Is this normal?? I have talked to her about it before and let her know my feelings. She says she understands if I need to move out, but I still feel guilty. I feel like she just said that to make me feel better. 

I have been feeling incredibly stuck and suffocated living at home, with these feelings intensifying more and more recently. There are some reasons for this. 
I just find it very frustrating that all of my friends and anyone I know my age (and younger) has moved out and living their life the way they want, but I can’t. It be different if I was a fool and blew all my money and had to live at home because I couldn’t afford otherwise. But my reasons for living at home are out of my control. I think because I find it “not fair” (even though I know life isn’t fair) is what makes me frustrated. 
Another reason I feel suffocated is because I am gay and not completely comfortable with it. I am still trying to find my identity but find it hard to do when I live at home. My comfortability with my sexuality has been static over the last few years - little to no progress. My mom knows I’m gay but it’s a very uncomfortable topic so we haven’t talked about it since I came out to her years ago. 

My mom tries her best to give me my space and privacy but it’s not enough at this point. I don’t know what to do. Any advice??? Anybody find themselves in a similar situation?",18May2020,1

1068,"Hi. This is my first Reddit post, so please feel free to correct me if I'm doing something wrong.

Like the title says, I've liked this girl for a pretty long time relative to my current age (I'm a high school senior waiting on my diploma to arrive via mail). I first met her in 5th grade where we instantly hit it off and became best friends. The next few years flew by, but they were the happiest years of my life so far— I know how everyone cringes at their middle school past, but not even the memories of my pink-dyed hair could tarnish my time spent with her (she actually dyed her hair purple to match). Due to personal reasons, she moved to the next town over for high school and we fell out of contact. We met up once during the summer of our sophomore year just to catch up, but that was the last time we've seen each other.

I realized I liked her during 7th grade, a little after our mutual friend came out to us as gay. Before that point in my life, I didn't even know it was possible that a girl could like another girl. Though I don't remember it clearly, I think I actually confessed to her that I liked her. She told me she was straight and that she didn't feel the same way towards me, and that was the end of that. Oddly enough though, things didn't become awkward between us at all. She continued to treat me the same way she always had and we never brought it up again. Sometimes I wish that she didn't let me down so gently back then so that maybe I could've moved on right then and there.

I've struggled with my sexual identity for a while now, mostly because I grew up in a traditional, homophobic household. I'm sure that I had crushes on boys when I was younger, but a lot of that went away in middle school. During freshman year, I harbored crushes on two upperclassmen. One was a senior (male) who had a really nice laugh/smile. The other was a sophomore (female) who was on the varsity volleyball team. Although I think both of them are cute, I cannot entertain the idea of dating either of them as it makes me uncomfortable. They still made my heart race— I just didn't want it to go any further than that.

While I haven't seen her for the last 4 years (excluding that one time we met up in sophomore year), sometimes I think of her randomly, or I see her in a dream and wake up kind of wistful (I've only dreamt about her 3 times). Around the start of the school year, I made a promise to myself in hopes of moving on that I'd ask her to meet up in the summer again and give her a letter with everything I've wanted to say—thank yous, I (still) like you, sorry for not wishing you happy birthdays, etc—IF we'd be going to different colleges. It was supposed to be something to give me a little bit of closure so that I could finally close the door on all of this, but I guess that would be too easy. We are both headed to the same campus in the fall, so I don't think I'll be going ahead with the whole letter thing...

If there was a possibility that we could somehow reconnect and become friends again, I think I'd take it by the horns and hang on for the ride. I would gladly be her best friend again even if it meant I'd have to hide my feelings for her for years and watch her be happy with other people. I think I could be happy just staying by her side, which is incredibly pathetic even to me.

I honestly have no idea what to do anymore, which is why I've taken drastic measures in asking the internet for help. I'd appreciate any kind of advice/opinions wholeheartedly. I'd be glad to elaborate further or answer questions for the folks who want to help so long as I can maintain a certain degree of anonymity. Thank you.",18May2020,1

1073,"Hi reddit, I’m posting this because I need somewhere anonymous to get advice about this situation. 

Some background: I am 21, my brother is 18, we live with our father and our other younger brother who is 15. Our mother has our youngest brother who is 12. 

My 18 year old brother, who we will call Tristan, has a problem with stealing; he always has. He steals everything from everybody. He will go into your room and take things without asking, then when confronted about it, will lie and claim he didn’t steal anything, and that you are bullying him for assuming he stole. He will complain that everyone in the house just hates him and always blames him for things he doesn’t do. But then...you find out later...he had stolen it all along, and was lying about it and making you feel bad because you confronted him about stealing. 

This has been going on for years and years and years, since he was about 10 years old. Maybe even before that, I don’t know. I can’t remember. At this point it just feels like forever. None of us in the house can leave anything unlocked or in the open, because we all know Tristan will steal it. 

So, now the bad situation that’s going on. 

My parents have been divorced for a few years now (I wanna say 4-5 years). Up until about 3 years ago, we were all living with our mother, that’s how it had always been. But some financial issues happened with our mom and she had to leave us all with our dad, and she moved in with her boyfriend a couple towns over. My youngest brother, who we will call Dylan, was living with all of us kids and our dad up until around 1 year ago, and he moved with our mom because Tristan was constantly torturing him, stealing from him, going in his room without asking, and making Dylan have extreme anger issues and become immediately hostile whenever Tristan was around. 

It was like Tristan was just bored, so he decided to torment Dylan. So Dylan is now living with our mom, and he is much happier.

Tristan turned 18 a few months ago and is trying to move out. He says he wants to move out because ‘dad doesn’t care about me and hates me’. 

The reason our dad always gets mad with Tristan is because of the constant stealing. Whenever Tristan steals something and gets caught, he cries and says nobody cares about him. This happened a few days ago when Tristan went into our dad’s room and stole a pack of cigarettes, again, for like the fifth time. Our dad was very mad at this continued theft and yelled at Tristan and told him that if he can’t stop stealing from everyone in the house, he should just move out already. Tristan freaked out and ran to his room crying and screaming, saying dad doesn’t care about him at all, he’s moving out anyways, etc. 

A few weeks ago, Tristan was using our dad’s cellphone to make some calls, and he found text messages my dad sent, apparently talking badly of our mother and about how Tristan steals and stuff. Tristan sent those messages to our mother, and our dad was extremely angry at the violation of privacy by Tristan, so he yelled and got very mad. Since then the air in the house is very tense. Tristan says dad was overreacting, that he shouldn’t have been talking badly about everyone then, and he has taken no responsibility for reading through dad’s texts. He just feels like the victim because our dad is mad at him for violating his privacy once again. 

Our mom has been trying to help Tristan move out, because she hears all the time about how our dad tells Tristan to move out, etc. From only hearing that, it sounds like my dad is horrible and abusive and constantly yelling at Tristan and telling him to GTFO. But the only reason my dad ever gets mad at him, is when he steals or violates privacy. 

Our dad told our mom that Tristan stole from his room again, and that’s why he told him to move out. Now my mom is telling Tristan ‘I don’t know how I can help you if you keep doing things to piss people off on purpose.’ Tristan texted me today and said ‘Mom believes dad’. It’s like he steals, then plays the victim, and expects everyone to blame the person he stole from, simply for getting mad, instead of him.

Now I don’t know which side to take. Tristan steals from me, too. He literally stole my headphones right from my room yesterday and hasn’t given them back yet. He steals from everyone. It's exhausting. But every time I have tried to tell him to just stop, and nobody will be mad at him, he says I’m being a bitch and nobody cares about him and he threatens suicide sometimes, too. 

What do I do? I’m so confused. Tristan tells everybody that our dad is abusive and horrible, but the only reason my dad ever gets mad, is because he gets stolen from constantly and his privacy is constantly violated; same for everyone else in the family. Is there even a right thing to do in this situation? I’m trying not to make enemies with anyone in my family...

TL;DR: Brother steals from everyone in the family and lies about it, dad told him to move out, now brother is saying dad is abusive",18May2020,1

1076,So I(14 female) have been taking piano lessons for a few months now. Because of quarantine my piano teacher is helping me learn a song that is WAY out of my level right now. Lately I’ve been feeling very unmotivated to practice so I always end up forgetting or not practicing at all. I love piano so much but my mom and I always end up getting into big fights about me not practicing or her wasting money on me. Today I was practicing the next part of my song and I showed her the part that I was working on. She said “you should be perfecting the first part of the song” even though my piano teacher said that I was ready to move on. When she says things like this it hurts. Another example is when I use to do horse shows and stuff.

1078,"About 5 years ago I lost my family in a big fight. They always treated me badly and made me feel like a ""wrong"" kind of human. 2 years ago I met a guy (B) who lives in another country next to mine. I met a friend of him online and through gaming together I met B. We texted and skyped a lot for about half a year. Then the friend of ours planned me visiting B as a surprise. After a cool surprise party-thing I planned to stay a week at the other friends house, but it quickly happened that I spend my time with B and we fell in love. We where young and stupid so we quickly got into constant fights. Before all that, B was a very important friend for me and he made me discover that I am not ""wrong"" or ""weird"", but I have autism. Just like him. But 2 years ago we cut contact due to a lot of miscomunication and stress. We lived far apart, didnt share a language we both know perfectly and being young and stupid. 
I am still in contact with our other friend, who I asked some times if I should reach out to B. But the friend told me, that B hated me and would never ever talk to me again. I was confused, afraid and sad... I didnt want to give up B, even if it would be the best decision. So today I woke up from a dream where I visited B and this hit me hard. I live together with my now boyfriend who is definetely the man I wanna spend my life with... but I messaged B over facebook. He even replied, being thankful and telling me he understands our both mistakes. He is sorry for what happened and if I wanna text, there was his number.

Is it ok to talk to him again? I don't love him in a romatic way anymore but he was a very good, important friend... is this in any way cheating on my boyfriend?",18May2020,1

1080,"I never had a good relationship/friendship w someone like me.

I just received a friend request on fb from my direct supervisor, I saw her suggested to me for months but never sent a request, we have a similar character, reserved, professional, introvert, tough on the outside ...
When I first started we clashed and I hated her, I don't hate her anymore but i don't like her either, we're just professional and have a lot of respect towards each other.

My gf's closest friend is also like me and we clashed from the first interaction, and we fought a few months ago and she called me and i didn't accept her apology and sent me a message on fb and didn't reply and her friend request is pending.

I also had a guy friend who has a similar personality but it didn't last.

Now seeing both friend requests pending made me really think about it, i never had a good relationship/friendship w someone very similar to me.

1082,"Hi reddit! Covid has been hard. As a person with diagnosed depression and anxiety the thought of myself or any of my family members contracting Covid-19 immediately put me into a tail spin in mid-March. I felt a panic that was familiar, but this time felt justified. I used this panic to prepare for the pandemic in the way I felt appropriate. I did not binge buy, but I did make sure I had enough food to last me a couple of weeks, and this settled my anxiety immensely. I I thought that I had figured this whole Covid thing out while I bleach dyed my sweatsuits and ordered a new desk to begin working from home for the foreseeable future. 

My parents and 2 older sisters also saw the danger of Covid and be an preparing appropriately. My sister, A, lives in the Bay Area so she saw the scare of Covid before we did up in Canada. My other sister, S, and my mom are both nurses so I figured surely they would be taking Covid seriously, I was wrong.

My grandfather passed away of non Covid related circumstances about a month ago which is where this all begins. Dealing with a death during Covid is strange because you’re given the information but then just have to sit at home on it and not really process your feelings properly. I live in Toronto, about an hour away from my parents house, but I don’t have a car to do a distanced visit so I called my mom and apologized but said that once restrictions loosen that I’ll come for a week and help her sort through my grandfathers belongings. She seemed okay with this and understood that during this circumstances that our family couldn’t come together like normal for the funeral.

My sister S then decided to begin texting me every other day to tell me how upset my mom is and how o am being a bad daughter by not going to see her after my grandpa died. I explained that I’m scared of transmitting Covid to my mom since she is older so I had made alternate plans. My sister didn’t find this acceptable, even though there is a Covid outbreak at the hospital she works at, and has barely spoken to me since.

My sister A told my that she would be flying home to see our mom if she could guarantee to get back into the Bay Area, but that’s a bit hard to believe considering she hasn’t even felt comfortable ordering takeout for the last 2 months. 

Mothers Day was last weekend so I made an effort to walk to a friends house to borrow their car to surprise my mom with a distanced visit. I was uncomfortable borrowing my friends car but we did not come into contact and I sanitized the car, so I figured it should be okay for a one time thing. My mom was happy with the visit, but S didn’t speak to me while I was there.

I was feeling a lot better about everything and thought that my sisters had gotten off my back and would be okay for a few weeks, until my sister started getting on at me about coming for my Dads birthday next weekend. 

Also to add, this past week the nursing home my mom works at has an outbreak of Covid, and one of the people who tested positive was in close contact with my mom the week before she tested positive. My mom hasn’t shown any signs but she very much could still have it considering she is considered high risk. All of this aside my family still does not believe I should be social distancing from them and think that I’m an asshole for not wanting to come to their house for the weekend. Also my Mother’s Day visit ended up being thrown back in my face because now my sisters are saying that it must hurt my mom that I’m letting myself use my friends car but won’t get into her car with her driving. I just cannot believe the amount of blissful ignorance of two nurses who work at places with Covid outbreaks trying to get me to come to their houses. 

I really don’t know what I’m looking for by posting this but I just really needed to get it out. I am so thankful that none of my family members have caught Covid as of yet, but it’s just so hard seeing them be so irresponsible and trying to make me feel like an asshole for trying to do the right thing.

She emailed my sister the receipt because she offered to book the slots and because of covid they are making you book slots to limit capacity. You have to be a member to book and typically they let you use the receipt as your pass until the sticker comes. 

My sister said she booked all weekends available which was like 3. Thought she booked for us to go. 

My aunt also has a pass and I mentioned in a group text that it was supposed to be 85 and sunny this Friday. Weekend is crappy.

OK so i am planning on moving to Florida with my Girlfriend of 2 years in march of 2021 i will be 20 years old by then and there are reasons we chose Florida, my girlfriend has seasonal depressive disorder or SAD and it effects her bad in the winter, she has been diagnosed and even has a therapist, but even with that these past 2 winters I,ve spent with her i have seen what it does to her and its bad and after all this she told me that she cant stay in Ohio much longer and i understand, so i am currently enrolled in MyComputerCareer and in march of 2021 i will graduate, so i will have 8 certificates to put on my resume for a good IT Professional job anywhere in The U.S and my girlfriend has a grandmother in Florida that is willing to take us in while we get on our feet and get our own place in Florida, so this all seems like a good and decent plan for a happy life id like to lead, or at least i think so, because my father is not happy with this at all, and he says that ""normal people"" do not move to other states and leave their family, while i think a parent should let their child do what makes them happy, so my father said that he will cut me off and never talk to me again if i move and he also threatened to cut me off from my little brother and now this happy plan to move to Florida has turned into a stressful event that my father says will cost me my family. and its not like i would never see them again i definitely plan on visiting for every major holiday that i can.

1096,"I'll just jump straight to issue..

My boyfriend has a dog. A beautiful, good boy.
The only problem is.. That dog is taking out more than 60% of his day every single day (some days more).

Now, at first i was sweeping this under the ""you are just being jealous bitch over a dog. You are behaving unreasonably"" , but lately its getting.... Ridiculous... And im sitting here lost...

Stuff that i can particularly name that are ridiculous and pointless:
The dog was sent off to a police training for 5? Or so months (it cost them 1000€,which isn't a little amount of money for him and his family.), dog came back knowing to give paw, sit and lay down. He has to make sure to teach his dog all of that again and again every day.
He is convinced that dog has traumas from other bigger dogs ""attacking"" him when he was puppy (dog was on a leash, in his arms,or next to him when other dogs went to sniff his butt few times).

The dog, soon after coming home from training, bit his mom and dad (nothing too bad, but still bleeding and few stiches needed) because they tucked on his leash while he was focused on another dog wanting to attack him.(that single thing made me not want to ever go near that dog inmy life. Even with my bfs constant ""but they were at fault! They tucked him! He was angry and didnt know they were there!!! I have a dog. I had lots of dogs. With my current dog a, street dog i found and took in when he was puppy last year,I  TESTED IT ON PURPOSE. My dog was on chain,looking at a dog in the street, focused, hair on his back was spiked, he was growling a bit, i SNEAKED behind him, grabbed the collar on his neck and yanked jt to me. He yelped. Looked at me frightened, realsied its me and licked my hand. Yes every dog is different but you can't fucking tell me a dog that was trained by police for 5 months, and was in a walk by 2 people for 30mins coudlnt know who was behind him WHEN THEY WERE TALKING. and thought that bitting anyone was okay. )

The dog doesnt know basic stuff. He doesnt know what no is. He doesnt know any boundaries. If he whines or barks he can raise fucking hell even in middle of the night,waking up everyone in house and neighbourbood. If he gets pet for less than he wants he screams until he gets more pets. 
If he is bored he calls for attention and he ALWAYS gets it. 

He can do whatever the fuck he wants and everyone is running around him as if its a child. 

He goes on 5 obligatory walks during day. 30 min walks, with one being 1h+ cause ""he needs to"". 
They livr in house. In a village. With a big fucking yard. And good fence. 


Yes i might be biased cause i was left alone, in absolute darkest times over a fucking dog when one and only person that said would have my back wasnt there... But it honestly feels so wrong.. To behave that way with a dog(in my eyes its same way as its with children. Being a good parent doesnt mean you let the child do EVERYTHING it wants) .. I have a dog too, i have him on a chain because i do not have a fence and i live near main road,i dont want him getting run over by a truck. 

Yeah, i let him run around every day for few hours I have to sit outside and watch out for him.(I DO NOT vanish out of existence when i do so tho) .  I taught him to sit, to not bite, to not growl, to not howl in middle of the night nor to dig in garden and ruin the yard. 
He can play, he can run, he can dig whenever else he wants (whole yard js covered in hidden bones i swear), he plays with me(rougly too sometimes) , he gets pets and good food and is spoiled little thing. 

But if i tell him no, he god damn well knows he shouldn't continue doing whatever he is doing. 
No i never hit him nor even rewarded him more than by petting him for anything.. (okay i lied, when he was younger and an asshole he managed to catch VERYsmall kitten and try and strangle it, he did get few hits on the butt then and never again tried strangling anything). 

I went off the track.. Im just pissed... 

Also, yes i told my bf billion times that it really hurts.. When I'm literally  begging him to stay and talk with me cause im very close to being very depressed again(no he isnt my distraction, sometimes i just really need him and noone/nothing else) and i just need to talk with him for a bit.. Even 10mins at least.. But he hits me with ""GOTTA GO. Dog is waiting. Be good pls. Dont be bad, i love you. Im sorry.. I really am... But i cant stay"" and leaves for 1h++.. He acknowledged what i said, felt bad and appologised like crazy.. Yrt it all stays absolutely same... I think this wouldn't be an issue as much if he was actually there, 100%,when we do get our 3h of the day... But its mostly just.. ""oh my dog barked! Brb, he is calling me"" ""oh sorry i watched youtube, i forgot to reply"" ""i dont feel like calling you.. Im sorry"" 

Again, i understand okay. Fine. I dont mind,im not THAT type of girlfriend, have your freedom.. But please.. Remember i exist and think about how to make me happy ocasionally, by littles things like staying in chat and tlaking with me about your day for 10mins..not going afk.. And replying every 10mins each time i try to talk with you.. 

This was more of a late night rant... Sorry whoever bothered to read..

No, im not taking it as if he doesnt care or as if he doesnt love me. I know he does, i just wish he bothered enough to learn to show me that he does care....

Breaking up/leaving him isn't an option.. I just really wish someone would tell me how to maintain the respectfulnes and support towards his life and stuff that he loves while also having him make me feel as pleasant and good as i make him feel (as he says i do.. So)",18May2020,1
1097,"I admittedly don't like that I feel so petty when my mom helps my sister out with washing the dishes (which we switch off and do every other week, so she'll do one week and the week after I do). I don't think my mom does it necessarily to help my sister out, but it's because my sister literally waits until last minute to wash the dishes and we typically need sink cleared so we can cook our next meal (or just to prevent them from attracting bugs). 

Some reasons why I feel annoyed about this is because my sister doesn't have anything to do (she does not attend school as she's been done with school and due to quarantine, she doesn't go to work either) and she does not do the full duties of dish washing most of the time (which includes cleaning the stove). Her not having anything to do is probably one of the reasons that tick me off the most as I still have classes and assignments to turn in (online classes really ended up being more work since professors want to make sure you're actually learning in their class) and I am still able to wash the dishes early. She's also not super appreciative of when my mom helps out with chores (if my mom mentions it, she'll either say ""thank you"" w/o looking up from her phone or in some cases, she'll even say things like ""I didn't *ask* you to do it""). 

This has been bugging me a lot recently, but it's probably due to quarantine and having to be around her. I feel super petty for feeling this way and not wanting my mother to help her with chores.

1100,"Hey there, I've been having some relationship problems recently and just wanted some advice

I met my SO about four months ago at a wedding and really hit it off. We messaged each other for hours and hours every day for the next few weeks and after a while, she decided to come and visit. We had an absolutely amazing week and we made plans to see each other again, this time me traveling to her. Unfortunately due to Covid-19, we had to call the visit off. It was disappointing but not the end of the world, we were still very close and still talked for hours every day.

When the Pandemic got really bad she went back to live with her parents, she didn't talk to me as much, but I wasn't particularly worried she was probably just spending more time with her parents. As the weeks passed it got worse and worse, at this point I'm lucky if I get a reply within a day.

I just don't know what's going on every time she does respond she's the same happy person and everything seems fine, when we video chat (normally once or twice a week) again everything is fine. Sometimes if it's taken her a particularly long time she'll apologise for the delay but she never mentions why she's been so distant.

Messaging each other has been a huge part of our relationship and I just don't know whats going on. I really love her and miss her so much, but it's just making me feel like she doesn't miss me at all and honestly I'm really depressed, she's finished uni for the year now and complains about having nothing to do.

My head is a complete mess and I can't think straight. I've talked to her about how sad I've been but things just aren't getting better. I've been thinking about breaking up because it's been hurting me so much, but I still really love her.

I'm a mess at the minute and not thinking properly. So could you please tell me straight what you think? Is this a normal stage in a relationship? Does it just mean she's comfortable in the relationship and therefore thinks we don't need to talk as much? 

I've mentioned it pretty casually but she's not taking it seriously. I don't want to make it a big thing as I feel it will just make things awkward, I don't want to force her to talk to me. Just a few messages throughout the day to make sure she's okay as I really care about her.

1102,"I’m 19 years old, just graduated high school and have really been wanting to change my life lately. I consider myself very level headed and I know I have great potential. I have high goals and aspirations in life and want to get them but throughout the later years of high school and within the last year of being graduated I became close friends with a group of people who simply are drug addicts and it’s turned into a tough situation for me 

It started out as smoking pot and drinking to party and that was whatever to me, I have always been pretty in control of myself, I never get blackout drunk and I don’t overdo it when I smoke weed and don’t let it affect me in work or other things in life. Things started to change when cocaine and molly started getting into the mix, I hesitated for the longest time but being around it constantly I gave in which is a good example of you are who you hangout with. 

Ever since then basically everyone I’ve stayed friends with has a drug problem imo. They snort coke sometimes daily all they care about is the next time to get f*cked up and they act like literal tweakers a lot of the time. I’ve tried explaining it to them that it’s gonna ruin you in the long run but no one cares or listens and it’s hard for me to want to be around a bunch of cokeheads when I’m pretty adamant on not doing it again. 

I took 2g of shrooms recently with a different group of closer friends who are completely separate from who I’m referring to above. None of them are like this really and we all had a huge discussion on how really messed up mentally these people are and how they have affected our lives in a toxic way almost. I made the decision to put my foot down and start cutting out people who aren’t ready to grow up and be adults, if they want to spend the rest of their life chasing the high and getting caught up in all of the dangers of doing drugs, as some of them already complain about health problems related to it.

1104,"This is a long one, but hopefully it's somewhat clear.

Around mid-October 2019, my girlfriend's father (55-ish) decided to move out of their house, citing mainly lack of respect from his daughters (my girlfriend (20) and her sister (18)) and his wife. My girlfriend still lives at home, just to clarify. A lot of other things likely culminated as well, such as a supposed crisis about manliness (Gfs father grew up without a dad). Basically, the times were fairly tough, and he got outta there. He would later go on to have a short affair with a female friend of the family. This has since been broken off, and it would seem that he is getting to be on better terms with his family again, so much so that they are discussing him moving back in. This happened within the last two weeks.

Throughout the year, it has been a bit of back and forth in terms of how friendly the girls were with him, seeing him from time to time. Whenever I would be around, I'd start to greet him by calling him bud, or similar. I won't get too deep into why I thought it would be a good idea, though essentially, the girls wanted to make sure that he knew that they weren't all too upset with him, letting him deal with his issues in his own time. The affair is something else, and not too important to this part of the story. Well, some time passes, and he apparently sends a text to my girlfriend (and her sister, same thread or something, I don't get apple features), telling her to tell me to stop calling him bud, or he'd make sure that ""he (me) would get the message"". I was livid, not about the perceived threat, but the fact that he would threaten me *through* my girlfriend. I wanted to let him know that if he wanted to tell me something, he should talk to me directly. Alas, I never found myself wanting to contact him, seeing as the man intimidated his daughter and threatened me.

In hindsight, I could see why a guy, who is doubting his masculinity, might not like being called bud by his daughter's boyfriend (I'm 24, btw). But like I said, I'd prefer that he had told me directly and somewhat more decently than threatening me - in my opinion, it ain't all too manly to threaten someone into silence through their daughter. Quite the opposite. Now we're at the point where he and my girlfriend have talked about it - she is ready to forgive him for using her as a middle man. He, however, is not ready to take back what he wrote. Seeing as he might move back in with them soon, I might see him more often, but I really would rather not sit at the same table with a guy with whom I have this ""feud"". I'm willing to let bygones be, on the condition that he tells me that he didn't mean his threat, he's sorry for intimidating my girlfriend and why he didn't like me calling him bud and perhaps hearing my side of the story too. Until then, like I said, I really would rather not spend any time in his presence.

And I won't get all ""dude-broey"" and say that if he tried something, I'd kick his ass. Rather it didn't come to any sort of confrontation, really. I want to talk it out, hear him out and have him hear me out. It might take time to mend an already awkward relationship, but it'd be better to start soon in my opinion. So all in all, I don't really know where to go from here - do I contact him directly? Do I wait for my girlfriend to give him the message? Do I wait for him to contact me?

I'm leaving out some details, because you know why. Hopefully it's somewhat clear, the most important details should be present.

**TL;DR**: GFs dad (who moved out for about half a year) threatened me, through her, over me calling him bud. He'll be moving back in with them, meaning I'll see more of him, but I'd rather have this unfortunate situation talked through before spending any time in his presence. wat do?",18May2020,1

1108,"This is going to be a pretty long post and if you're going to understand the situation you need a bit of context, so sorry in advance, though I would really appreciate the help!

&amp;#x200B;

Bit of background: I am an 18M in my senior year of high school and graduating in like the next two days (yay)! Before going to this school, I attended a much smaller middle school (there were only like 30 kids in the class). Since there were so few of us, most of us lived pretty close to one another, and because the curriculum and such were pretty rigorous we all grew fairly close. At this school I met a girl, who for the sake of privacy and such, I will call Stella (not her real name). Stella came to my class in 6th grade and over time we kinda hit it off.

Anyways, over time we became fairly close friends, I have a number of memories where my best friend of the time (who I'll call Steve), her and I were all in a video call together just talking and having fun. Anyways, I will admit I did start liking her in a more romantic context, but it wasn't reciprocated so I never to bothered to pursue that line of thought, (and don't worry I didn't like get rejected a bunch of times, I just knew she wasn't interested so I never bothered asking her, though I'm pretty sure she knew). Instead, as we all later found out, she was interested in Steve and the two ended up dating in 8th grade. I was perfectly fine with this, I liked hanging out with both of them, and since they spent a lot of time together, when I hung out with one I often hung out with the other. We were fairly good friends.

Anyways, fast forward a few years. Steve, Stella, and I are the only ones from our school who go to the same High School. This High School is a bit weird because it starts sophmore year instead of freshman year (you have to apply from another high school to attend), which means that technically Steve and I went to the same high school the year before, but then all three of us applied to the new high school. The two of them started dating again, which again I was fine with, but because I was going through some stuff at the time that I don't really want to get into here (it's also not relevant at all to my question), when they tried to ask me to hang out I often turned them down and on a few rare occasions I did go. I sort of dropped of the radar to all of the people from my old school (something I now regret)

Anyways, the stuff I was going through ended, and I started looking back at my life and realized I kinda miss talking to Steve and Stella. As such, I tried texting them a bit. Trouble was we all shared very few classes (and Steve and Stella had broken up again). I had better luck with Steve and was able to sort of re-establish some degree of regular contact (I can do more in that field and I plan to in the future). However, with Stella I have run into a problem that I need your advice on.

So, unfortunately, in our entire high school career Stella and I never had a class together. This is rather problematic because I normally make friends by talking to other kids in classes and dealing with that shared current state. As such, when I tried reaching out to Stella via text message back in 2018 (I never had the chance or the confidence to actually talk to her face to face, though I wish I had now), she seemed kinda receptive at first. I would usually ask some sort of question in the hopes it would lead to a follow up or whatever.

Let me stop here and clarify a few things:

1. I wasn't trying to ask her out or anything, just talk because I used to really enjoy talking to her. She and I were good friends and I hoped to sort of re-establish that, not go further.
2. I also really didn't want to be a nuisance. I know there are creepy stalker guys out there who will text girls at like 2 in the morning with weird messages. I am not one of those guys and would completely respect and understand if she didn't want to talk to me. I'm not trying to force anything, and I really don't want to be one of those incel creeps, so keep that in mind. 

Alright, so here's the trouble I ran into the first time round. I basically would send a message or whatever and she would reply but the replies were never all that substantial and she often took quite a while to respond. It was also telling that she would never initiate the conversation, I always did. I also later realized I made a mistake in this early phase. I had set a goal for myself (because I am a fairly introverted person and was trying to force myself to be social) that I would text her once everyday and try and have a conversation. However, because of the lack of shared classes and the delays in replies I worried I was being boring or struggled to find what to talk about. With all that information I drew two possible conclusions:

1. She is either busy and can't really talk to me.
2. She doesn't want to talk to me.
3. Maybe I sort of startled her when going from radio silence to messages everyday

I wasn't sure which of the above conclusions was true, though to be safe I was leaning towards #2 or #3 (busy doesn't explain why she never initiated the conversation). However, a few days later our school got shut down because of dangerous weather conditions. For reference, this is a public boarding school (I know that's a weird concept but stay with me), so we were all locked in our dorms. During that shut down she texted me and we had a long funny and really enjoyable conversation. During the conversation I also learned two important things for later. #1, she didn't seem to remember a lot of the stuff I did about the time we spent together at the previous school, #2 she seemed to be willing and wanting to talk to me because she was the one who started the conversation and the replies were pretty quick. This made me lean towards conclusion #1. However, after the weather conditions ended and life returned to normal she never initiated the conversation and replies took longer and longer to receive. This led me back to conclusion #2 or #3 and I explained away that weather conversation as her being bored and needing to talk to someone (though why me instead of her roommate or one of her other friends, I didn't know). As such, I sent one final message as an experiment to see if it would take forever to receive a reply, and unsurprisingly it did. I figured she wanted to be left alone so I decided not to bother her anymore and stopped texting. She never tried to reconnect.

\--------------------------------------------------------------

That was all before my senior year. Now, everyone has announced where they're going for college. Steve, Stella, and I are all going to different colleges (unfortunately). However, this is the digital age! We can stay in touch with people on the other side of the planet if we want too! My sister wants to be a doctor, and Stella got into a pretty good medical program. When I told that to my mother she asked me to text Stella and ask for advice or tips on how to get in.

I was hesitant to do this at first 'cause I didn't want to bug her, however I did eventually text her and ask because my mother kept pushing for it. She replied within I'd say like 30 minutes and we had a little bit of back and forth with like 10-20 min delays between replies. She offered some kinda obvious advice and said that she'll try 2 come up with more 2 tell me later. It has now been 4 days since that conversation and I haven't heard back.

So here's what I need advice on:

\#1: My old desire to reconnect with old friends is still there, so long as I'm not bothering her. My old school was big on saying: ""You'll make life long friends"" or whatever, and I'm not one to typically buy into advertising but I did some looking on some old classmates facebook pages and found that other classmates had been commenting and communicating since then. What that means is that it isn't unheard of for my classmates to still communicate with each other, as such, this particular goal isn't impossible. However, I am unsure as to how to proceed. What exactly should I do? Since we're going to different schools we will have even less common ground than before, but I do really want to have at least some regular contact with her, like even once a month would be fine (the more the better though). Ideally, this sort of contact would be similar to that conversation in the extreme weather, just talking about stuff, making fun of complaints about the school food or one of the teachers or whatever, just talking about life.

\#2: How do I solve this common ground problem, when we are going to be leading increasingly different lives? Normally, I would solve such a problem by letting someone else tell me about their problems or help them out with something, or listen to them complain about a teacher or a project or whatever. That way I don't need to delve into my life (which frankly nobody wants to hear about, everyone loves talking about themselves), and they have a topic that they are actively vested in. However, since I'm the one initiating conversations, this clearly can't work. It'd come off a little weird to say: ""Hey, you have any problems you need help solving?"" and you can't start every conversation with ""How's life""

\#3: I need to evaluate is this goal even realistic or did I miss my opportunity two years ago and it's too late to do anything about it? How do I evaluate the weather conversation? Was that just a fluke or is there actually potential for long-term back and forth? Is this whole thing futile?

\#4: Since 2018 I have sort been radio silence again because I really didn't want to bother her. I am now worried that given that she didn't remember a lot of the stuff we did together at my old school she now only associates me with the text everyday thing from 2018, which means she automatically would write me off as an annoyance. This would mean that this goal isn't realistic and I should move on to try and re-establish contact with someone else.

\#5: How do I know how much is too often. I made a mistake in 2018 where I probably overwhelmed her and I don't intend to repeat it. That's why I haven't texted in four days, but she hasn't texted either so that doesn't solve the problem. I am not sure what I can do right now, it's not like I can ask her.

\#6: I asked my parents what I should do when I ran into these problems in 2018. Their advice was not helpful. One said that she was probably assuming I was trying to ask her out and the other said that the two years of radio silence screwed me and that my goal is fundamentally unrealistic. Needless to say, that wasn't helpful. However, I now wonder if they're right. Are they? Or do I have at least some hope of success here?

\#7: How can I tell which of the three conclusions is correct, and since I can't like see facial reactions, how do I know that I'm being a nuisance to her other than her flat out saying that.

\#8: How much am I overthinking this? I have poured way way too much thought and energy into this and tried analyzing every possible angle and outcome. Frankly, it's exhausting and I'm tired of trying to figure this out myself. Is the very fact I'm thinking about this so much make me into one of those creepy stalker guys that I really don't want to be? I don't know, but I'm kind of worried here.

\#9: Am I being pathetic for turning to a bunch of strangers on the internet for help on this? I don't want to come off as rude or disrespectful to anyone on this sub, that's now what I'm trying to do here, it's just that I don't normally post my life problems on the internet for anyone in the world to see, usually I'm the one helping somebody else out. I would really really appreciate help though.

Anyways, sorry that was so long but I am really unsure as to how to proceed. I would greatly appreciate any input on any or preferably all of these questions.

1113,"Background: I have a friend who I had a short-lived romantic past with that did NOT go well at all, to say the least. We have since worked out these problems and become just friends, and I truly do want the best for him. He has a girlfriend now and I'm happy to see that he's (somewhat) happy with her (they have some problems but he seems like he's changed a lot.) We talk every once in a while because his girlfriend is the insecure type, I can't really blame her, he HAS cheated on her before, and he doesn't want her to know that he has a female friend (me) and especially one that he used to be romantically involved with. Trust me when I say I want no part of that with him. He was a good friend, just not someone you'd want as a partner (cheater.) 

Here's the problem. We were talking the other day because he isn't doing so well with the quarantines and stuff, and he said something along the lines of ""wishing the virus got him."" I told him I wished he wouldn't say things like that and that this will all get better and he should definitely seek help if he needs it. He said he's just depressed. That night at, like 3am, (I was asleep and woke up the next morning to it) he texted me ""I'm drunkkk."" Like, obviously he's really depressed if he's getting drunk alone. I told him not to tell me that and that he should drunk text his girlfriend next time, because I really didn't want to be the receiving end of her jealousy for no reason if she found out. He responded with a ""Lol k"" and I told him not to talk to me like that, because I'm not going to be disrespected as a friend to him.

Well, fast forward to today and he says ""I blocked you cause I didn't like what you said, lol sorry."" Which is fine, I don't need that kind of drama in my life. But he does know where I live (us being friends) and he seems quite unhinged, he has a lot of mental health issues and he's threatened to ""pull up"" on people who have hurt me in the past. He can be a loose cannon when he's angry and I really didn't want to get on his bad side. I now know I need to get out of the friendship and never respond again if he talks to me, but for now I'm just worried he'll do something. Am I being over concerned? What should I do?",18May2020,1
1114,First I want to say this isn’t a post to bash social media or anyone using any social media platform.

1115,"For context, I'm currently about to turn 18 and I live in the United Arab Emirates. I come from a very well-known Muslim family, I've always had all these expectations and responsibilities placed on me as I'm the eldest out of my siblings. For a long time, I had accepted the fact that I would never find my own happiness. I would just have to deal with living a very mundane life that's pretty much been planned out for me by my parents.  
What my family doesn't know is that I'm not exactly heterosexual nor do I necessarily believe in Islam which as you can imagine would be a very big issue if they found out.

A few years ago, I was struggling with my mental health and I ended up missing many school days. My own mother told me that if I didn't get my life together that my dad was going to lose his patience and if he wanted to, could kill me and no one would be able to do anything about it.  
Ever since that day, I've been pretending to be fine. As well as I can.  
Over the years they've been very mentally abusive and expect that even though they treat me like shit, I'll still be here when they need me. Which isn't completely inaccurate, I've always been there for them even if it meant that I had to give up my own desires or my own happiness. Even after everything, I still love them so very much and it won't be easy for me to leave but for once in my life, I'm putting myself first.

To add, I have a very close friend who lives in Germany. Both she and her mother have offered to take me in should I ever decide to leave.

Now, the thing I want advice in is how do I pull off leaving my family safely and without them potentially tracking me? What kind of documents would I need? Are there laws in the UAE that would allow them to find me/bring me back? If so, is there like a specific age I need to be where they're not allowed to do that?  
Would it be hard to obtain residency in Germany? Is there anything I should be preparing from now? How would I even manage to leave without them getting suspicious? There are a few things that are near and dear to me that I could never leave without. I don't mind leaving with the clothes on my back but there are things like my books, my cat and my childhood photos/videos that I need to bring with me.  
In addition to this, I don't want to completely lose contact with my younger siblings. We're very close and I've practically raised them, they're like my own children. I can't bring them with me because they're still young and I assume my parents could legally get them back.

1117,"Hi! During quarantine, I've realized that there's a lot of control and anger issues with my father. I'm 25 and yes, I know I \*should\* be out of the house by now, I help out financially with my family and that has made it harder to leave (plus COVID now). However, being at home much more often because I lost one of my jobs, I've realized how selfish, controlling and narcissistic my father is/can be.

We both butt heads A LOT because he is ""my way or stfu"" and I want to have a reasonable answer for why he needs me to do something/why he may be doing something that I don't feel comfortable doing. Often, he will try to tell me what I need to do for my future goals (currently in an MA program and am readjusting my content creation career), but doesn't understand the new media or educational landscape. He has some college experience but went more to party and left half way thru to help his family once his father passed. He keeps telling me to get a doctorate degree, even though I've said it would hinder my career goals at the moment. I said to him that he didn't know how my field of work actually operates so don't tell me what to do, and he was understandably upset. However, what it boiled down to was him saying I talk ""too much like a textbook"" and I should ""talk normal and easier"" so he can understand. 

I don't believe I typically talk too academically, as I've know this to be a large problem he has had with me in the past, so I often talk more in slang at home so I don't offend/upset him. With my being home and not physically in a classroom or around peers who I can not censor myself with, I find myself talking normally like I'm with my peers v. around my dad, who (I heavily assume) feels inferior to the way I speak because he doesn't understand certain words or concepts I use. It's to the point of frustration where we argue almost daily and where I'm ready to say ""you WANTED me to keep up with my education so why are you putting me down for it because you have your own insecurities?"" but he has bad anger management and I am worried it would escalate. 

My relationship with my mother is more like a fairweather friend, as she has resented me for most of my life and is jealous of the father-daughter relationship my father and I have, so my dad is really the only person I have in my immediate family that typically is my support and someone I feel welcomed by. This is where I often have problems with handling how to live with and continue a somewhat ok relationship with my dad.

So I'm 24 and just finished my first semester of an accounting program. I did very well (like A/A+ good), have decent networking/social skills, and will more than likely get a job at the end of it. Before Covid I actually had interviews/internships lined up, but yeah...

This was a recent transition as previously I had just finished a Master's in History. I honestly was pretty lost as to what to do after my undergrad (also in history/classics) and even though I wasn't sure I wanted to pursue a PhD I figured that I could give academia a try.

Though I love history, the stress of Grad school got to me and even though I graduated and did well (very high GPA, awards, scholarships etc) I honestly think it fucked me up quite a bit. The Job market in academia is horrendous. I didn't think that would be a viable option both financially and due to mental health reasons.

After I graduated I started working for my city at a local museum, but the hours were few and the work is seasonal (so also not a viable career on it's own). I was recently laid off from this position with the promise of being rehired at some point. If I do get rehired and get seniority I might be able to make this position work though.

While working at the museum I decided to start a program in accounting to open doors to a more viable and profitable career, but honestly I find it very boring. Even though I do well, I'm not sure I see myself being an accountant. I hate the corporate world and how fake everyone is. Barley anybody is there because they genuinely enjoy the work. Everyone just wants money. I hate networking events, even if I can do well enough at them. The problem is compounded by classes being moved online as I hate online classes and our teachers are honestly terrible for the most part.

Money and debt are not an issue at this point, I just want to find something I want to do for a living. I'm good at writing, reading, research, public speaking, teaching, I love learning. I don't mind working alone or with a team. I can't see myself as a teacher at the elementary/high-school level. Law school is an option but I hear it's even worse than grad school and the job market at the end is not great. Honestly digging ditches sounds more enjoyable than the stress and poor prospects of law school, the boredom &amp; stress of this accounting program, the fakeness of the corporate world etc.

Do you think I should continue with the accounting program? What steps do you think I should take? At this point i feel like there's no good way forward, since the economy is fucked and there are so few prospects. I don't need to make big money, I just want to be happy.

Sorry for the long post.

Additional info: I really like skiing, bouldering, learning languages, Table top RPGs

TL:DR: did history BA &amp; MA. Did well, but Grad school fucked me up. Got a job at a museum, now laid off. Started accounting program but find it boring. Can't see myself as an accountant. shit's fucked, should I drop the accounting program?",18May2020,1
1126,"I am a very reflective person in general but when it comes to fast decisions or answers to questions I just answer without knowing why that guy asked. Looking back on it, its because sometimes I can't understand emotions a whole lot and can't relate to a lot of what people might feel. I need to increase that intelligence as I know it has a lot of positive effects. I really need some help. Once someone was congratulating me and saying words that could be either out of anger or happiness, I asked ""are you angry or happy?"" And that killed the mood. I couldn't tell what he was feeling.",18May2020,1
1127,"This is a long one so sorry I’m advance. One weekend my boyfriend (24M)  and I (21F) joined my bestfriend (21F) of 13 years and her boyfriend (23M) to the lake for the weekend and we were staying in a hotel together. She’s been dating him for about a year and we’ve all been best friends since. They’ve fought quite a bit and she’s called me multiple times saying she wants to break up with him. I’ve always been patient with her and they’ve always worked it out. So the last night of our trip I’m showering and she comes into the bathroom and locks the door. She starts going through his phone and finds out he’s been messaging strippers or something of that sort. They both had been drinking so I advised her to wait until the morning to talk about it and it would be best to speak with him privately. She agreed until 3 minutes later when we walked out she starting yelling at him. We had ordered a pizza 15 minutes prior so my boyfriend and I said we will walk and get the pizza so you can have some privacy to discuss this. We get the pizza and arrive back to him silent while she continues “you’re a cheater”. I understand her frustration but it was extremely uncomfortable for us so I said “hey let’s eat and maybe we can talk about this in the morning I’ll make you a plate”. She didn’t want to and I understood. All of a sudden something snapped in him he grabbed her by the throat and began choking her so hard she was lifted from the bed (she’s 98 pounds he’s probably 200) my boyfriend and I dropped everything and ran to the other side of the room to help her by the time we had gotten to her he had let go and slammed her on the ground. Then he started throwing everything in the room, the pizza, presents I had bought my boyfriend, all of my personal belongings, an entire gallon of lemonade then ran to the restroom. My boyfriend is non confrontational and has never been in a physical fight but he was livid. We heard her boyfriend throwing things around the bathroom (the hotel room is on my boyfriends card) and my boyfriend shouts “never lay your hands on *blank* or any woman again. You need to leave the room immediately!” This maniac storms out of the restroom shouting “what do you want from me? Is this what you want?!” And charges towards me I’m sitting on the bed terrified he grabs the mattress I’m on and flips it and I hit my head. My boyfriend “says get the fuck out or I’m calling the police” he walks out of the front door and my boyfriend follows. He asks my boyfriend if “he wants to fight” my boyfriend responds “I don’t want to fight I want you to leave the premises or I have no choice but to call the police. You’re a piece of shit” and instantly her boyfriend charges my boyfriend throwing blows. Lucky enough I carry pepper spray in my purse and I pointed it at him and told him to get away. He tells me he will kill me and immediately ran to the elevator and left. So first things first I ask my bestfriend if she’s okay and she says “I need to chase after him” I try to stop her saying he’s dangerous and she pushes past me. My boyfriend looks to me and says “please pack your belongings we need to leave, contact *mybestfriend* and tell her to get her things and meet us” so I pack everything and call her begging her to leave she says she doesn’t have a key card to the room to get her bag. So we go get the car and drive her over a key card to the front of the hotel. I said “please come with us I can’t leave you with this asshole” and he runs literally out of what seemed like nowhere and smashes in my boyfriends windshield with his fists. I instantly told my boyfriend don’t react don’t get physical back call the police. So we called 911 and he was arrested immediately. This is when it gets really fucked. My bestfriend is pissed at me telling me we are fucked up for calling the police on him. I’m genuinely baffled like are you kidding? She proceeds to tell me he’s done this to her multiple times and it’s no big deal, and I’m crying my eyes out hearing this. She completely turns on us and decides we are the bad ones because this is none of our business well I respond “this is our business when we were attacked”. We spoke to the cops together and she said he never hurt her i asked her to tell the truth and she said she won’t and she will lie for him. Fast forward the next day I beg her to leave with us for hours on hours and she refuses she says she has to pick him up from jail and I tell her I refuse to be near him. She goes on about how I’m a judgemental bitch and I shouldn’t judge him for how he expresses his anger. And I’m like are u okay? Anyways we eventually had to leave I extended check out so she could stay there. Her moms texting me the whole way home saying I’m so wrong for not picking up her boyfriend from jail and she can’t drive to go get them and I’m just thinking wow like mother like daughter. Side note her whole family mom and 3 sisters are all in abusive relationships and she’s always said she would never follow in their footsteps and talks about how they’re idiots for staying. I texted her driving home that I love her I will always be a support system but I cannot be around her boyfriend after he threatened our lives. She’s now blocked me on everything and we have no contact. This breaks my heart because we’ve been bestfriends for 13 years and never once has a boyfriend or anything come between us. I genuinely don’t know what to do but let go for now.

TL;DR

my bestfriends boyfriend snapped and physically abused her in front of us when we asked him to leave or the cops will be called he attacked us and smashed in my boyfriends windshield. She’s now mad at us for calling the cops and won’t speak to me.",18May2020,1
1128,"I’m a 19 AA M and lately I’ve been suffering from the problem of constantly looking up racist things. I don’t know why I do it but it’s like I have this need to read something that will make me depressed. It not just racism against black people, but racism against everyone. It makes me so sad that people around the world are being discriminated against because of something they can’t control. I’ve noticed that if I go a while without looking up racist things, my mindset becomes infinitely better. But every once and a while I’ll go down a rabbit hole of racist things that are happening or happened around the world and I can’t help but think that everyone is racist against each other, which ironically is racist in itself. It makes me Sad that some people can’t travel to certain parts of the world and see the worlds beauty without something possibly racist happening to them.

I have an apprenticeship at the moment and I’m absolutely hating it. The works fine it’s just not where I feel I’m meant to be working. I’ve applied for uni and received an offer I’ve accepted. The issue is work is pushing for me to complete many different courses costing both them and me time and money, for no reason cause I’m never going to use this information or qualifications. I’m just about ready to pull the pin but I still have a month until the course starts. I’d also need to find a job within the next few weeks to month. Not sure what to do whether I should wait it out and do all the pointless courses, or call it in and wait the month or so.

Its ridiculous what I’m fighting off everyday but here goes nothing,It’s complicated but long story short I had ocd ( I still do but it isn’t as bad). What helped me ‘cope’ was religion but it made everything ten times worse I had some breakdowns etc it was dark so turned to spirituality and prayed to my spirit guides. I felt fine at first but the same tuning that happens w religion is happening again. I really don’t know why and I HATE it but for some reason idk if this is my ocd but I’ve started to belive they don’t want to help me or support me and that the only thing to freedom is being with evil ones.This scares me as it’s a battle everyday i have to deal with although sounds stupid it’s just so complicated.

1134,"Okay, so my family is poor and trying to get a house. We live in my aunts house. I don't want to sound like 'poor me!' but we live in a pretty small floor and the basement has other people and upstairs is a family. I dont own a bedroom and still sleep with my mom at 14. (Which is SUPER embarrassing. I wish so badly to have my own room but its either sleep with my ma, or sleep on the couch where theres mice) Every few months mice and roaches come to the house, and believe me when I say we try our best to get rid of them. We set up mice traps, mice poison, sticky pads to trap roaches and mice, but they still come back because of the guy downstairs bringing in them....

This sounds pretty whiny, but I feel like our life SUCKS. I can never be alone because in my room, my mother will be there talking on the phone. (Which isnt her fault, shes entitled to being able to atleast be in a room to talk lol) I cant be alone in the living room because thats where my dad sleeps or he watches TV And theres no other rooms, unless you count the kitchen which reeks of my aunts smoking, not even exaggerating. It gives me headaches. So yeah. Living room, bedroom is pretty much all I can go to.

Anyways, we wanna buy a house thats around $230,000. We have a specific one in mind. My father works in a tree company and my mother is jobless. My brother (18) should be working but ever since COVID19 its hard to get a job. Im only 14 but I NEED money. Y'all dont understand how much I wish we could live in our home. I dont wanna be embarrased about bringing people over. I dont want to be worried about mice and roaches. Or about the deranged dude downstairs who bothers my mom (he called her a n*gger, said she has a black p*ssy because she married my father who is a darker Mexican and not even black, and other disgusting racist slurs) 

I need money because Im worried we wont have enough money to keep the house when we get it. We havent live in our own home since I was like 6, so we arent used to paying: mortgage, gas, water, electric bills and other bills. We can barely make it as it is. I dont know how to make money to prepare for this saying as Im too young for a job. Can anyone recommend ways?",18May2020,1
1135,"I am a 22(F) currently studying biology at a big university but I don't know what I want to do when I graduate. I have been thinking about two possible career options which are nursing or teaching. I am going to go over the pros and cons of both and ask for you all to give me some advice.

Teaching:

I got accepted into TFA which is a program where people are placed in low income schools that are in need of teachers. In my case, I have no background in education besides some tutoring. Since I have no background in education this route scares me however I could instead continue my education and get a masters to be a teacher. This option would cost more money and I am hesitant to get into more student debt only to become a teacher since I already have 20,000 in student loans. I know this is not a lot but I am very financial conscious and I don't wont to be in debt for the rest of my life.

Nursing:

I have been considering going into the medical field for awhile, but I am nervous I would not be able to handle it. I don't know if I would be able to handle seeing the injuries and losing patients. Also, if I were to choose this path I would have to take a ""gap year"" where I took the prerequisites for nursing school and then apply to an accelerated program. This also means more money on school but nurses do get paid more than teachers.

I like helping people and caring for people that is why these two career option are the ones that I am stuck on. Everyone that knows me says that I will be good at either path I choose but I am not so confident. If anyone could give me some advice about each of the careers and what I should do that would be awesome.",18May2020,1

Okay.. this is gonna be dumb but I’ve fallen so far down the rabbit hole by now this is my only option. 

For context, I’m so extremely depressed. Anxiety, ptsd, blah blah blah. Quarantine has sent me into a whole new depressive episode, one of the worst ones. I have done nothing, I repeat, NOTHING for online school. I’m so incredibly behind that I’m failing every class. I have a block schedule if anyone knows what that is, so there’s only four classes, but each class is an hour and a half long so.. lots of homework. 

I’ve missed a lot of my classes video calls recently because I can’t move.. I’m so incredibly unmotivated even moving is hard. I’m so tired.. I’m so tired. I don’t want to do anything anymore. I don’t even want to breathe. 

I’m so behind and my parents are furious.. I don’t know what to do besides give up but I can’t fail. Responsibilities or whatever. My four classes are Speech class, Geometry, Music class, and Geography. Geometry is the hardest right now, because I don’t know how to do any of the work, even if I had attended a meeting.

I know this is my fault. I know I don’t deserve help, but if anyone has advice.. please help. I have three days to do this and I’m so unmotivated it hurts.. if anyone has advice I need it.

1139,"I have a small friend group of four and I love then to death but every time we meet or speak on the phone, they always talk about their other friends (who I don't / barely know). 

For example:
 I met one of them and of the two hours we hung out she spent at least 30 - 40 minutes talking about this internet friend she has and how nice and funny she is. She even mentioned that they want to get a friendship tattoo. After a while I got so uncomfortable that I said I had to go home and left. 

And I just talked to my other friend and one of the first things she said were how much fun she had today with some of her friends, how nice they are,  what they did and so on. She didn't even let me come to word. 

I don't care if they have other friends outside of our friend group. I'm happy for them if they have fun but this has been going on for quite some time and it's kinda making me sad and anxious. Because if they keep talking about others when I'm with them I feel like I am boring and annoying.

He wants to facetime a lot but I, not necessarily enjoying talking to people, don't enjoy frequent facetime even if it's with someone I consider a friend.

Option 1: doing something that will give me experience within how do plan, arrange and run a what we call here a folk high school. It is initially what I WANT to do, but here is the deal. That means for me, leaving a good potential relationship for long distance, and postponing taking up a few classes to get in to the college I want to go to. This is a one time opportunity for me, having me taking a leading role and tryout more of my interest which is Animal care taking.

Option 2: working, taking up lectures that I need better grades in and maybe go for a good potential relationship. This is in my opinion something, except for the relationship, I can do next year, and is no big deal to do. It is the relationship I am torn between and the fact that it may seem like a waste of time to do the folk high school thing cause It doesn’t give me a lot of extra points, and I will have to take the extra studies anyways.

My (relatively new) partner was laid off at the start of the pandemic and has been struggling mentally because of being isolated and without a job for the first time in his adult life.  He’s also been having some health problems recently that he’s not been handling very well. 

I have a very high stress, mentally and emotionally demanding job and have a lot of people rely on me there too (I’m a backup supervisor and trainer on top of my day to day duties). 

I’ve always been a pretty strong person who can just power through...but I’m starting to feel weighed down.  I try to take time for myself, but I often come last while I’m trying to take care of everyone else’s needs.  I do see a counsellor but I’m not really feeling like we are jiving on the level I need - and it’s not the best time to be trying to find a new therapist. 

I’m so, so tired and I don’t know how best to cope right now.  This is the first time I’ve really felt like I might break a little under all this pressure.  If we weren’t still under a lockdown I would ship the kids off somewhere and take a weekend to myself to regroup, but I don’t have that option right now and I’m feeling trapped.  Halp! 

TLDR: I take care of everyone else in my life but I don’t have time to take care of myself and I’m about to break under the pressure.",18May2020,1
1154,"It's 2:25 AM right now and I do not have much time to write this, so I'm sorry if this is messy. All help and tips are appreciated here - I'm desperate.

Okay. I planned on sleeping at 12~ tonight. That didn't happen. As you read in the first section, it's about 2:30 AM. I set a goal to sleep at 10 PM in the night between the 19th and 20th. I need that sleep for an incredibly, incredibly important test I have.

So basically I need to sleep about 4 hours earlier next night. Which seems almost impossible. I am a teenager, and so do not have access to pills etc.

And so my despair has brought me to Reddit - Is there any effective way to sleep earlier than your biological clock will usually intend, in one night? I'm extremely desperate and so any help/tricks/tip will be a huge help to me. This could determine a good chunk of my future.


Thank you for reading. I will be going to sleep now.",18May2020,1
1155,"background: im 18 years old and a college junior, i dropped out of high school when i was 16 to go to a residential college and have been living on my own for two years (in the dorms). the dorms are really shitty and really expensive at my school, so i was hoping to move off campus next semester, however my mom thinks that i’m incapable of living off campus and wants me to live on campus with the “support structure” that the school supplies (which doesn’t really exist anyway). i depend on my parents for financial support with tuition, and my mom said she wouldn’t pay for my tuition if i decided to move out of my own accord and get a job to pay for it. 

i understand that she’s worried about me, but it feels infantalizing, especially now that i’m actually an adult. she seems to treat me like i’m a lot younger than i feel frequently, and i’ve tried to make it clear that i don’t like that, but she won’t apologize or make any changes in her behavior. 

i’m not sure what i can expect, given that in real terms i am 18, but i feel much more akin to a 20 year old given my living situation and whatnot. so i’m wondering if anyone has any tips on how to stage this negotiation in such a way that she sees me as capable of having my own life or just lets me live off campus. thanks!",18May2020,1
1156,"Sort for formatting and all that shit, using my phone and I'm only new to reddit...

So for context I live in UK and we are currently in lockdown for covid-19. I live alone and so I asked my friend to move in over lockdown for some company to which he happily agreed (we were planning on moving in together at some point so decided to use it as a trial run) but about a week in he brought down a girl he was casually seeing because she had to work still and her family were isolating for health.

The first week or so of this arrangement was fine no issues or drama but at some point my friend decided to become cold and distant to both me and the girl involved. So we naturally became closer as he refused to interact with either of us and we were left alone 24/7, we ended up drunk and cuddling on the sofa but it was never discussed or acknowledged it.
This continued for a week or so every single night, cuddling laughing and joking but then last night we ended up kissing and finally talked about how we felt.

He has made it very clear he doesn't want anything serious and that he doesn't overly care about her but now that we're getting on hes changed his tune and is trying to assert his position in her life.

Added info: Me and the other guy have been friends for years even though we are polar opposites in most aspects of our lives except for a few things that bond us closely

He has alot of bad habits and honestly I could probably do without him as a friend but because of how intertwined our work and social lives are I'm not sure how to navigate this situation in any sort of positive way",18May2020,1

For 70% of the time she is full of life and joking around however for the 30% she throws tantrums, stays in bed, verbally abuses, refuses to eat or drink, kicks, ignores, is very manipulative, blames you for everything and is so unappreciative of anything you do for her. This is supposedly due to her period, and hormonal changes. I agree partially with this and the tummy pain she experiences is quite bad and definitely a trigger. However nothing seems to help and she locked herself away today and gave me hell when I tried to help. Leaving her alone doesn’t appear to help either, I know she wants attention as she sometimes calls my manager or if I’m not on shift she might call me but won’t interact with the carer on shift (which is mostly me) I don’t know what to try or do.

I am in Michigan. One of the worst hit parts of Michigan due to the virus. My niece is turning one this Sunday and my family is insisting on having a birthday party. It will be at my parents house and will have around 30 people or so. 

Truthfully I feel this is irresponsible and I don’t want to go. My girlfriend is now mad at me because she really wants to go (we live together and have been very careful thus far with everything going on, mostly due to my insistence)

1160,"Hey everyone!

2 months ago, i graduated from highschool. Which i'm happy about, even if i didn't get a chance to celebrate it (thanks covid), i'm still happy about it and i'm proud of myself for this achievement (especially that not alot in my family tree have graduated from highschool).

Anyway, now that i have highschool behind me, the next step is university. But there is one problem, i'm seriously scared of university.

Idk if it has to do with fear of growing up, but the thought of going to uni really makes me anxious.

I was planning to study Civil Engineering, but seeing how my final in Maths turned out i started rethinking that decision. I'm also under a big pressure from everyone around me. Friends and family, all want me to go to uni, and expect me to go to a valuable field like engineering or IT, and i don't really blame them. I mean, you go to uni so that you could have a stable job in the future, right?

Especially that this is the reason i'm in the country i live in (germany) in the first place, my parents brought me here so that i could get a proper education. So their expectations also make me afraid of doing the wrong thing.

With all that piled up on each other, University is making me seriously afraid, especially the fear that it might not be the right thing for me.

Is this normal? Or is there a way to get over this fear? 
Is university the right thing for me at all?

Thank you in advance

TL;DR: Expectations and Uncertainty is making me afraid of University, and i contemplate if it's the right thing for me.",18May2020,1

I’m 24F and living at home with parents and brother 22F. Unfortunately he started dating this  girl several years ago, currently 21F. She’s really nice to everyone in my family and they all absolutely love her. Except for me. She goes out of her way to induce anxiety in me (ex: purposely letting my dogs out without a leash), lie to them about mean things I say to her, and always has to one up me in almost everything I do. The number one thing that irritates me to no end is that she hates when my parents give me any attention. She has to do everything in her power to make sure she gets more attention and that the attention is positive. It drives me crazy and I can’t stand her. Unfortunately, they let her spend the night several nights in a row despite my protests and don’t wanna believe me because they can’t see what she’s doing. The only time we actually talked about this she played the victim and it was brought on because she was upset I didn’t let her decide what college I wanted to go to. I’m at my wit’s end.

Im a pretty active person and i sweat alot, and the night before me and some of my friends from basketball played and i came to my dorm and crashed. Anyway yeah, on my way to class a guy behind me made a face like i smelled bad. Was confused, but then someone next to me complained of a smell and i knew it was me and wasnt a coincidence. 

A few more people made a comment about the smell and by then i was mortified and went back to my dorm instead of hanging out with my friends/around other people after class was over. Before i left i had a friend smell me and he said he wasnt sure if it was me, but then said he must be imagining the smell and im pretty sure he knew it was me. Besides him, no one said anything DIRECTLY to me. My friends especially. We have a pretty damn honest friend group, and besides one of them complaining of a smell constantly, no one said anything directly to me. I kept my distance though, so im sure thats another reason why.

I washed the shit out of my hair and went to class the next day and everything was fine. No one made any comments about a smell, and no one did for the rest of my time there. I know its not that serious and everyone has a “bad day” and since i always come to class and just go to parties and stuff well put together, not smelling bad obviously, i know this isnt the end of the world.

1178,"My parents are incredibly emotionally abusive. In the past, there have been times of physical abuse, with them hitting me and holding me down on the floor excessive. But lately it’s been getting to the point of constant panic attacks and so much weight loss because I’m terrified to leave my room to eat. I’m at such a big loss. 

Everything I do is never enough, my grades are never good enough, I never help out around the house enough, I’m never enough. They keep making incredibly unrealistic demands of me, and everything I do at the same time is wrong. Every outfit I wear is wrong and inappropriate. My hair is always a mess. My makeup is always too much. Every morning, no matter what I wear, I’m told I’m a whore and that the reason I was raped when I was younger is because of what I wear. I’m told I deserve the sexual assault that has happened to me constantly. I was told to just assume I lived in a foster home since my parents don’t love me anymore or care for me. They’ve screamed that at me countless times. 

My parents have admitted that they’re manipulating me, but they justify that their actions are okay as parents are supposed to mold their children. I don’t want to have the same opinions as my parents. My parents are sexist and at times racist. I want to have my own thoughts and feelings, but my parents don’t allow me to express them. I can’t write them down in my journal, my parents read my notes, and my parents go through my phone. I just want to be a person who has thoughts and feelings and to be loved, and I doubt I’ll ever find that within my parents. 

I don’t know how much more I can take, I’m in a partial inpatient program right now, but I feel incredibly suicidal everyday and without help. At the program they listen to my problems, but that’s the real extent. My parents have never cared about my emotional health, this morning they threatened to take my therapy away. I’ve always been crazy, or too sensitive, or too much. I’m lazy, even though I work so hard at my job and as a student, and I’m selfish. If I tell my parents how I feel, they say I’m manipulating them, and when I tell them that’s ridiculous, they say that since both my mom and dad feel that way, it must be true. My parents are always right and I’m wrong because I’m their child. 

There was a time where all I wanted was love and affection from my parents but now I’m on a fine line of wanting to get out or to just have one neutral day. Not even a good day. Just one day where I don’t have a panic attack. I wish they would apologize to me, or even try to fix things. I’m the only one trying to make things better, which is why I’m terrified of talking to CPS. I know something serious would happen and that my parents and I would part on bad terms. I love them and I want them to love me too. 

I feel like I’m being so complacent and perfect to make them happy, but this isn’t realistic. I’m 17 right now, I can wait a year, but I need real advice on how to maintain my sanity. I can pretend to be who they want me to be, but they’ll still be incredibly toxic to me. I still won’t be enough. As well, that would mean that I don’t respect myself enough to get in a better situation. The reality is that moving away is incredibly hard and illegal, but I need to be healthy and in an environment that isn’t hurting me every single day. I have to love myself and take care of myself. I need real advice on how to preserve my self respect and live with my parents at the same time. I have no idea what to do.",18May2020,1
