2,"Hello, university student here. Under normal circumstances, I am an extremely productive worker. When I was physically at my university, I was able to study for hours on end and get loads of work done without any difficulty. However, there was one caveat; I would exclusively study at the library. Being around other people forced me to sit down and do my work as opposed to browsing youtube for hours, and because the walk back to my dorm was so long, the temptation to simply leave and browse the internet was effectively nonexistent. Now, I'm completely alone at my house and away from university. With youtube at my fingertips, I can't sit down and do work to save my life. I have done absolutely nothing this past week and if I don‚Äôt curb this behavior now then this will become a huge problem very soon. Reddit, how can I sit down and study in my own home with the temptation to do a million other things right in front of me at all times?",31Mar2020,1

4,"Hi, so I moved to St. Pete Florida two years ago with my boyfriend. We‚Äôve been together 3 years and we argue a lot and I find myself wanting out of this relationship periodically. Sometimes I want to move back home to St Louis where my family is and everything is really familiar, but I also don‚Äôt want to leave this beautiful city. Here‚Äôs a list of me staying in Florida vs going back home:
STL
Pros: 
Friends and family 
Cheaper rent
Amazing food
Cons:
Bad weather 
Bad for my business (I make jewelry and set up at markets)
No job lined up there

St. Petersburg 
Pros:
Beautiful weather 
Fun city with lots of things to do
I have a decent job here
Plenty of markets to set up at
Supportive arts community 
Cons:
No close friends or family 
Food is good but not gooooood
Rent is high, can‚Äôt afford to buy a house here by myself",31Mar2020,1

Plus, everyone at my high school are assholes and I really don't wanna get mixed in with the wrong crowd. I've heard that college gets better as most people by then actually mature.

6,"I've had a number of things hit me like a truck over the years; false accusations, a lack of support, threatened with a weapon. Too much for any one person to handle.

I don't know why I've found myself in those situations. I draw negativity like flies, but I'm looking for a way out. I'm a good man. I'm successful. I'm intelligent, kind-natured and good looking. I want friends. I want to date. Yet the moment I take steps, any steps, to change my circumstances... something bad happens.

I've been to therapy many times, and I've worked on a lot of things. I'm in a much better place than years ago. But I think there's one thing holding me back.

All this bad stuff... it's left me jaded. I'm hurt, deeply, and I don't know how to let it go. I just hope there's some salvation.

7," Hey guys,

Long story short, I'm in med school in NYC, but I pushed back a year to work in a research lab (the one that, if I get accepted in June) will be doing my MD/PhD in - I know it's a weird timeline, weird program. The lab head has been my mentor for half a decade, because of Covid it looks like they no longer have the funding to hire me. I moved here expecting to have a salary and now no job, little money, no hiring prospects since everyone is being hurt by this thing. What should I do?

19,"This has been really taking a toll on my mind for about a month now, and it is really getting to me and making me feel awful. 

Here‚Äôs the situation:
-Close friend‚Äôs cat gets a UTI
-apparently for cats this can be lethal and very painful for them
-He takes cat to the emergency vet, and they want $3k up front before they operate.
-like many people, myself included, he doesn‚Äôt have this.
-like many people,myself included, he doesn‚Äôt have amazing credit.
-All-in-all he has to go to another vet, same procedure is HALF what the other place was charging, so between 3 people we were able to get a partial loan and pay the rest so the cat would survive
-fast forward to this week, cat is blocking up again and must go back to the vet.

From what I understand here‚Äôs my friend‚Äôs options:
1. Pay up front 
2. Get approved for a loan
3. Surrender the cat to the Humane Society, and forfeit rights to the cat in order to get care. Cat lives, but loses a loving home because their human can‚Äôt afford to make them better.


There are no payment plans at all. There is always charity and pet insurance, but we couldn‚Äôt find charity/donation funds in time for an emergency like this. 

Pet insurance would have been great, but from what I have read (for my own cats) coverage seems either unreliable (what is a pre-existing condition?), or insufficient in cases of emergencies. Maybe there is an amazing plan out there I am missing. Recommendations from anyone who has had to go through this is loved and appreciated.

And you think...what if I had money to make a down payment? We thought the same thing. What if we offer $1k up front, and cover the rest in payments? Nope. All or nothing.

It just makes me feel like my faith in humanity is destroyed, and I don‚Äôt know what to do if one of my cats has something really bad happen to them. I guess give them away or let them die. My friend surrendered his cat to the humane society because he couldn‚Äôt afford the operations and it‚Äôs fucking heartbreaking.

I think about all the people ‚ÄúGo adopt from the shelter! All those loving animals need homes!‚Äù

21,"Hey everyone, my roommate is in a sticky situation and I don‚Äôt know how to help her anymore. It‚Äôs possible that I can‚Äôt do anything but I was hoping reddit can provide an outside perspective on this. Thanks in advance!

I live in an apartment with two other roommates (all college students) and me and one of the other roommates have been quarantined here since all of our belongings are here and it would be too much trouble to move them home. The other roommate went home to her parents house for spring break and since then, her parents have not allowed her to come back to school.

This may seem reasonable because of COVID-19 and the orders for everyone to stay at home, but her household is an incredibly toxic environment. Her family is very unaccepting and because of that, they very recently almost kicked her out of the house and completely cut her off, but since then, they‚Äôve completely 180ed and now they just control her every move. They berate her a lot, and even when she requested just to come back to her apartment to move out and get her things they wouldn‚Äôt let her, despite all of her school work, her glasses (which she can‚Äôt see without and she ran out of contacts) and clothes. She said she needed her schoolwork since classes are starting up again but they said it doesn‚Äôt matter if they fail anyways because she‚Äôs a woman, she doesn‚Äôt need to go to school. In addition, they continually interrupt her studying. There‚Äôs so much else that goes on but I‚Äôll spare the trouble. 

She‚Äôs been trying to convince her parents to allow her to come back to the apartment for the past few weeks but every time she tries it just gets worse. Her mental heath is declining, she‚Äôs not eating, she‚Äôs avoiding her family. 

I want to be able to help her from this situation, because I‚Äôm not sure she can survive the next few months if she‚Äôs living with her family.  I don‚Äôt know what I can do, I feel like I‚Äôve come up with every logical argument there is to give to her parents yet they don‚Äôt care whatsoever.

22,"Warning: Details about Trauma (not super specific)

I‚Äôve never been a normal child. I‚Äôve always been super hyper sexual and was never taught boundaries. A couple of years ago, I found out my two older cousins ( one is nine months older while the other is two years older) were molested by their step dad when they were around five to eight. During that time period, is when I started to act out sexually. I don‚Äôt remember how it started but my older cousins and I would pretend to mother and babies and nurse or doctor and their fingers would roam around. Eventually, it progressed into dry humping (I am female while they both are as well) and who could be the best provocative dancer. I started to have dreams about being a stripper and I swore I was in love with every boy. They always initiated it and I went along, despite feeling dirty and like it was wrong. I don‚Äôt feel like it was sexual abuse as I also would have other experiences with my other two other friends. My cousins would always be there and we would have kissing competitions and sneak and watch pornography my grandpa had laying around. This went on for awhile until social services eventually took away my cousins and I didn‚Äôt see them for about three years. They went to their the dad and eventually we saw each other again but the games stopped. 

I calmed down a bit but the hyper sexuality was still there. I hated myself for it and felt dirty. Even then, I knew that my cousins had gone through something and that explained why they did it (I didn‚Äôt know the details as I was only eleven around this time now), but I couldn‚Äôt get over why I was the way I was. I hated myself for it. I should point out that this was time that I had started to become groomed by my mother and her boyfriend. She would neglect me and refused to spend time with me unless her boyfriend was there. He was emotionally abusive and creepy. He was the landlords son and had cameras on the apartment complex and would tell my mom if I came home late from school. I was home for twelve hours a day alone. I had access to the internet with no limitations and got into pornography as well as omegle. I was talking to fifty year old men by the dozens because I liked the attention that nobody else was giving me. 

Then the incident happened. I would get more and more curious about what it felt like to have oral pleasure. I often played with me brother and babysat him. He was five and I was eleven. It was a one time incident but I remember pulling pants down, not fully just probably to around upper thigh level, and told my brother when we were playing doctor that it hurt and I wanted him to lick it to make it feel better. Even with all my experience, I was still stupid in female anatomy. I can‚Äôt remember exactly but I think I pointed to my lower abdomen or upper pelvis. He whined and said he didn‚Äôt want to, but proceeded to do it anyways. He pretended to and didn‚Äôt actually do it. I asked again, he said no, but did it again and pretended too. At this point, I realized how very wrong the situation was and immediately got up and stopped. I felt disgusted and wanted to cry every time I saw my brother. I apologized and played whatever he wanted after. 

Later on, he started to have behavioral problems and acted up. He would get very aggressive and violent. I felt guilt ridden and thought I had done this to him. It turned out he was autistic and showed symptoms before this event, but to this day, I still feel responsible for his life and I proceed to hate myself over and over. 

At the same time, my cousins had started to initiate the old games again and I didn‚Äôt want to. I felt dirty and at this point sex repulsed. But they kept insisting so I gave in. It got to the point that they would touch me when I was sleeping and I understood what they wanted. It was the same thing when we were little, but just more grown up. Eventually, I finally stood my ground and told them no. They respected it and we never were in that situation again. 

But then the abuse started.

We moved into a house with my moms boyfriend and he started touching me. At first it was just massages then he went further and further. I feel like it was what I deserved and the universe was punishing me. What I had wanted with my brother, I now got, forcefully. I was twelve and he was forty. I told my mother but she blamed me and after that I told nobody. Everyone told me to be grateful for her since she wasn‚Äôt like my cousins abusive mother. I craved her love but never got it. It happened over and over and he groomed me by covering me so I could go out with friends or he would buy me food. He controlled every aspect of my life. If I wanted something my mom would tell me to ask him. He was emotionally abusive to my brother and he used that against me. My mother never did anything and would pretend he didn‚Äôt hear the cries of my brother. If I didn‚Äôt do what he wanted, he would take it out on my brother. I kept my mouth shut because I thought I owed it to him after what I had done. 

I am now 18 and he is 12. He is high functioning and in a normal classroom setting. We are very close but the question remains. I don‚Äôt know what to do. The abuse carried on for five years, ending in last May. I left for school and came back but the same person is trying to make moves and abuse me again. I mentally cannot handle anything anymore. I want to leave and run away. But he has guns and im scared. I don‚Äôt want to leave my brother. But he will be okay with my mother once the abuser is gone. I‚Äôm going to the police and reporting everything and hoping my mother will finally leave him once I tell the rest of my family about him. 

Is it wrong to do this though? I will be leaving and probably not seeing him again until he is 18. And when I go to the police, do I turn myself in? I would be a coward and say I‚Äôm scared to. I‚Äôm studying psychology and want to work with kids who have been sexually abused. I know the damage it does. I have flashbacks and can‚Äôt keep healthy relationships. Whenever I ask my brother about what would happen we played doctor, he doesn‚Äôt remember the incident. He only remembers when we would pretend to be sick and give our stuffed animals shots or each other shots on the stomach or thigh. But I know that if he doesn‚Äôt remember, it can come out later on and he will be traumatized all over again. 

Please help me. Even if I don‚Äôt deserve it.",31Mar2020,1
23,"So, my fiance and I are currently living with her parents while we try and save money to move out into a place of our own. Currently, I work in manufacturing and she works on a horse breeding farm. She doesn't make a lot there and has been attempting to find other jobs, but hasn't had any luck in hearing back from anyone.

Due to the financial issues she's been under from her pay and student loans now coming into affect for her, she posed the question of how I'd feel if she began selling pictures/Snapchat videos to people online for money. I'm not comfortable with the idea and I told her that, and she seemed to get genuinely upset at hearing this.

She knows how highly I view her and how much I offer to help whenever I can with money, but she stayed insistent, stating how she isn't good at anything other than farm work and this. The thing is, I know she'd be successful if she followed it through, but I don't think I could handle seeing messages from her clients or having to give her time and privacy to 'work.' I love her with all my heart and want to see her succeed in whatever she sets herself to, but I just don't think I could handle that, emotionally.

32,"I've had a crush on this girl in college for well over a year now. We started texting regularly at the turn of the year, where I told her from the beginning that I liked her and would like to get to know her personality better (as in go on dates and stuff to see if we match together as a couple), just to avoid getting into the friendzone. Her answer was quite vague, she didn't exactly say she liked me back but she said ""well we can get to know each other's personalities better and if all goes well, we can take a step together."" We agreed to define our relationship as ""friends who are getting to know each other to see if we romantically click, rather than ""just"" friends""

We've been texting everyday since then and have gone on one casual date and were planning another date/hangout until that corona thing happened, but the thing is I don't even know if she was attracted to me (as in terms of my appearance) in the first place. I feel like if there's no attraction in the first place, no relationship would work. She says I'm handsome when she didn't have to and gave me a 7/10 rating in terms of appearance (idk if that's good or bad considering i'm quite short/skinny but have a good looking face), but at the same time she says that the one time she fell in love was when she felt attraction right at the start. This confused me, so I asked if she had that attraction/a liking for my appearance before we started texting, again her answer was vague, she said something along the lines of ""of course any two people who are getting to know each other better wouldn't agree to get to know one another without liking each other's appearance/being attracted to them in the first place""...so idk if it's my low self esteem talking or if she actually doesn't find me that attractive after all. I honestly feel like I should just move on, but then when I stop texting her she keeps initiating conversations...I don't want to ignore her either. 


Key point: we are in an Islamic environment and this girl is a bit more reserved than usual. She's never had a boyfriend, she only likes relationships to be official and doesn't hang out with guys for the sake of it, as far as she's told me she hangs out with a guy she's only getting to know/dating, and if all goes well, the guy can propose to her from her parents. So I feel like even if she likes me back, i'm not ready to propose right now (we're both still students) as I'm not ready, I don't even have a job yet. I should move on, right? Did she even like me?",31Mar2020,1
33,"\-QUESTIONS ARE AT THE BOTTOM-

&amp;#x200B;

**Upbringing**: 

Parents divorced when 7 (due to $), raised without a consistent father figure (he's a self-induced pathological liar who believes he's gonna be rich one day without change), went into Boy Scouts, went full steam ahead due to its comradery, rank advancement, an abundance of fatherly-like mentors and leaders. Earned my Eagle while learning valuable skills for life (very involved through HS and Middle school). Anonymously inducted into the honor society of BSA and then voted for the highest honor (super uncommon for those who don't know). All before I graduated from HS. Hated HS but couldn't wait for College (since I've resented my mothers' lifestyle, like the choice of smoking, being unambitious, boring in a sense, since the divorce).

&amp;#x200B;

Get accepted into my state's largest 4 year as a dual-enrolled community college student (taking classes at community college and living at a 4 year). Very excited and pick my two roommates who're from the central part of my state.

&amp;#x200B;

**Summer 2019**: 

Worked at Philmont Scout Ranch in NM, adored it, (THIS IS WHERE MY CHANGE BEGINS) and after watching a video of Graham Stephen about investing I bought 7 books that were shipped to my home in the PNW.

Invested $200 into Robin hood and didn't know a damn thing...but still thirsty to learn.

I made many mistakes as a rookie and came back home to finish reading the books I bought.

&amp;#x200B;

**6 months later**:

Winter term ends and I decide to go into the Plumbing trade in my home state (Union is nearby my hometown). I call all of my relatives for advice as well as my mentor from BSA and get lots of new perspectives, so far so good. I decide to abandon college for numerous reasons, mostly due to finances and the fact that I'm not willing to sacrifice my wallet for parties, girls, stupid nonsense overall and the non-gurantee of a job. Not only that but the fact that I'm very burnt out on delaying what I want in life (remember the prereqs?). I was going to become a forester but realized I can make much money while I learn, get mentored for doing good, and contributing to society sooner rather than later.

&amp;#x200B;

(You know what) occurs in early 2020 and school is all online. Everyone leaves Uni to go back home. Myself included. This occurs soon after I make the above decision.

&amp;#x200B;

**Current**:

At home with Mother, I got a job and waiting till the illness is over to look into when I can apply for plumbing. Reading books about investing, stoicism, philosophy, etc and checking in on what stonks to purchase for dividends. Been investing more into my RH account and recently started an M1 account. Did taxes for the first time as well (not as bad as I thought). Brainstorming about backpacking after my apprenticeship is over (in my state takes 4-5 yrs), either JMT or PCT with lads from BSA over the summers. Yes, I still talk to my father but the conversations lead to nothing...ever. My mother has given up on me going back to college for now and is helping me with the plumbing sector, but we can't do much when it's all closed down. In the meantime I've been exercising (with caution), chatting with friends online (one group I mentor, another about going through tough times, and another about backpacking and investing). I listen to a few podcasts about investing and help my mother with remodeling our home as well as doing chores around the house. Recently been diving into ""digital nomads"" whatever the fuck that means, and learning about living in SE Asia for some years after I save up dough from my plumbing journey. I can't wait to get outta my mother's home and live on my own. I loved college for the living part and not the schooling part.

&amp;#x200B;

My Questions:

1: I loved BSA and what it stood for, which programs similar to BSA can I donate my money or time into and get a similar group mentality from? I've been looking into Big Brother Big Sister, Meals on Wheels, etc. and need a group of some sort to fill that volunteering gap. My hobbies are backpacking, investing, finance, economics, cooking as well as literature, philosophy, and psychology. Not to mention everything that comes with becoming a high-performance person (leadership, grit, intelligence, you get the idea).

2: Which books would you advise me to read for mentoring folks my age? I currently mentor 5 people.

3: Any advice for going into the (plumbing) trade? Keep in mind I live in an urban setting on the West Coast, going Union, residential service.

4: Planning on doing the PCT or JMT in 2030 with some buddies, any suggestions for my 1st thru-hike? I've summited peaks at 9, 10, 11 thousand ft. and even one 12k in NM last summer and had no problem with them with a full 40-50 lbs. pack. Only summited one peak in my home state, which has tons of mountains but is all technical gear requiring, except the one I summited.

Everything was more or less well in hand when an outside woman showed up demanding a share of the will. She doesn't have any legal grounds, just a former relationship with the deceased, but everyone in the family is terrified and unsure of what to do because it turns out that she is a Visayan black magic witch. They are genuinely concerned about the threat of being cursed. gf has always been superstitious; she believes her father once saved a baby from being eaten by a vampire and if we don't make the bed each morning a ghost will come sleep in the bed and she thinks her catholic prayers have power, but until now these have always been harmless superstition and when I questioned her on them she got very upset.

35,"I dont love myself, im so conscious of everything i do, i cant breath without me questioning it. The most important things to me in life are friends and family...yet i dont have any friends. I havent for a while and i feel so alone whilst im surrounded by people.
God knows what im going to do with my life, i dont have any hobbies or anything i enjoy. Im not good at anything either so how am i supposed to get a job i enjoy or a job that im good at? 

How am i supposed to love anyone or be loved by anyone...when ive never loved myself, ever. I hate my body, i hate my mind, i hate my personality. I hate me. I would do anything to be anyone else, even just for a day. Id feel so at ease being someone else, everyone else has a purpose when i dont. I dont have a impact on anyone's life, im easy to forget and i know that.
Ive come to terms with that. I dont mind that im just a blip on this earth that really isnt important, if i died tomorrow or in a year i dont think anyone would care, i know I wouldn't. Or maybe they would but they'd forget about me in a month or so.
Reddit, im in pain. I cant numb it or cure it. Ive tried everything. Ive got to therapy, medication, exercise, eating healthy, not eating, socializing, staying locked away, tried hobbies, tried making friends, tried expressing how i feel so dead inside to those who would listen.

The words i speak dont..register in their brain. Its not their fault that i feel this way, or maybe it is some of their fault.. ill never know. I feel lost and trapped all at the same time, stuck in a room with loads of doors but none of them have opened for me, even when i have the key. 
I cant sleep, i dont eat probably, i dont look after myself..i just dont love myself, in fact i hate myself, i loathe myself. Nothing i do is right, i cant even breathe right. I cant smile right, i cant cry right. I cant be me right, but who am i kidding.. i dont know who i am anymore, or who i was back then. I just forgot about myself as odd as it seems. I just know how awful i am at living, at being me. Why cant i just be at peace, just this once. Why cant i catch a break in this rotten life i live in this beautiful world. Why can't i just numb the pain...it hurts so bad that its making my whole body hurt, not just my heart.

Why cant i find peace with myself, why cant i stop hating myself, why cant i be happy, why cant i be whoever i am.",31Mar2020,1

When I was about 21 years old(24 now), I came across a photo from one of my friends of her sister who at the time I thought looked about 25, well it turns out when I scrolled through more photos that she had just entered highchool and was about 14. She had the physique of a woman, the face of a woman,everything. And i had the urge of masturbating/wanting to masturbate to the photo but I also felt wierded out and confused at the same time.So I kept rummaging through my feelings to see how I felt and determined after a few minutes I would be too weirded out to do that no matter how mature she looked. The thing is, I feel weird about it, I feel like once I knew she was 14 when I thought about masturbating I should‚Äôve been immediately repulsed but instead it was kind of like a tug of rope between she looks like a model vs she‚Äôs like 14. My mind was telling me she was 14 and this is weird but my genitals were telling me she looks mature and giving me a sexual urge and desire, and this created a conflict where I had to think about it, but I feel bad for having to think about it. Was my confusion normal? I feel like a pervert.",31Mar2020,1
37,"Hi,

I hope all of you are doing well in these troubled times.

Since we're all stuck together, I wanted to share this story with you. I know this is a typical issue with fans of celebrities, but I feel mine is a bit different and it's killing me from the inside. Apologies, but the post is pretty long and I don't want to bore you. 

For the sake of this post and to get the best help possible, I'm a 26 years old male and haven't had any relations in the past. I'm still virgin due to religious reasons until I get married.

Now that we got this out of the way, let's move on with the post.

This is my story with the celebrity, Ariana Grande...   

A year back, I had a dream about Ariana Grande. I don't listen to her music at all (I don't even like her voice that much). So, you could say I have no feelings whatsoever towards the girl. The first time I saw her, I was in the gym. They played her music video (Break Free) on the gym's TVs. I paused my workout and was stunned by her beauty. I prefer the innocent looks on girls faces, and she was the perfect representation of my type. I didn't bother to ask about her name that time nor did I care much. I guess when they were playing her video, it was her peak year. This is when she rose to fame I think.  

Anyways, going back to what I said earlier. I had a dream about Ariana. It happened all the sudden. I wasn't thinking about her before that nor was I watching her videos or listening to her music. I made that clear from the start. I was NOT attached to her in anyway. She was just a passing memory. 

Do you know the feeling when you have a dream that feels so real that you think you may not wake up from it? 

That was it!

I didn't even know her personality that time. The dream wasn't special. It was just me and my family staying on a hotel somewhere in America for a vacation. I'm not even sure if it was America haha. All I could remember is that I saw her by accident. We met inside the hotel's elevator.

When I met her inside the elevator, I was really embarrassed and blushing so hard. I told her that I'm sorry and I didn't know you were inside. Then I started to ask her questions like are you Ariana Grande and what are you doing here. Just normal conversation. We then started giggling and laughing together. My sisters came and saw me with this girl laughing and having fun. They weren't happy. In fact, they were furious. The dream ended right there. I woke up and realized it was just a dream.

And from that very moment, I started to get attached to her. I opened YouTube and typed her name there. Kept watching her interviews and seeing her music videos. I was thinking the entire time why on earth did I dreamed about you? What is it that made you trigger my inner mind? Of course, nobody can find the answer to your dreams.

My affections towards her started to develop. First a dream, then a crush and now an obsession. An unhealthy obsession. I didn't ask for this.

I went to USA last September for my usual summer vacation. It was my first-time visiting LA. We all know that LA is the city of celebrities. I was staying there for 10 days  with two of my friends. I told myself: ""Why don't I seize this opportunity and try to get in touch with some celebrities here?"".

I admit it. I was completely naive and unaware of the consequences of my actions. Nonetheless, that didn't stop me from doing what I did. Of course, by the time we decided to go to US, my friends were already aware of my obsession with Ariana Grande. They just thought it would be temporary and not something serious. We landed on LA and literally the first thing I did was opening my Google Maps and typing Ariana Grande. I was just playing around that time and wasn't sure if GM would show up any results. It's not like her house is a hotel or something for people to search for.

Shockingly, it did! Her house showed up on GM. It was located on Beverly Hills (obviously, that's no surprise). It was pretty far away by the time we were in the airport. Afterwards, we arrived at the apartment we rented, settled down and then checked GM again. You wouldn't believe it, but it was only 20 minutes away on a car drive. We were living so close to Beverly Hills. I guess we wanted a much quieter neighborhood in LA.

I wanted to tell my two friends to go there so badly, but then it hit me. Instead of doing something irrational, why don't I do it in a more professional way. I started digging the web for some answers about how to contact a celebrity. I was searching for an answer that time about the possibility of asking for a house tour or maybe a simple meet and greet. Most of the answers I found online were suggesting that I should contact her agent as the best approach. So, I did.

I was able to pull out the contact information of the agency including their numbers and emails. Not only that, but I wanted to meet other celebs like Johnny Depp, Hans Zimmer and Keanu Reeves. So, I started making some phone calls. As the phone was ringing, so was my heart. I was telling myself that time: ""What on God's name am I doing right now?"". It's like I was having second thoughts.

The representative picked up the phone and I told myself: ""That's it! I must act professionally now and mustn't show them I'm nervous. There's no turning back now.""

I didn't say directly I want to see Ariana Grande, no!

I wanted to make it more like I'm serious. I told them that I'm here for 10 days and I have a big plan to do here in LA. One of the things on my to-do list was meeting celebs and exchanging cultures with them, doing house tours, having friendly conversation, learning from the industry and get inspirations. These basically are the main points I mentioned to the representative but in a more fashionable and gentlemen way. Luckily, she was all ears and was interested on what I said. Sadly, by the time she transferred my call to Ariana's manager, he didn't pick up the phone. He wasn't available. I left a voice massage for him though, and sent him an email.

Not surprised, I did not receive any calls that day or the next. The email inbox was still empty, too. I knew it from my heart that it's impossible for them to fulfill my request. There must be dozens of other fans dying for this opportunity. True fans who love her music and her work. Unlike me, I'm just an unexplained accident. Regardless, we were still going to Beverly Hills me and my two friends.

I told my friend: ""Since we have enough time to explore, why don't we drive to Ariana's house?"". He looked at me like I'm crazy. He said: ""Are you crazy! What are you going to do there? Certainly, you won't be jumping out of the car window when you see her, right?"". I responded: ""Of course, not! I'm not trying to creep on her. I just want to know what's in there, that's all"".

So, after a small argument, we agreed to go there and look. I assured him that if anyone stopped us, we could always show them the proof that we tried contacting the agency by phone and email. I know this is wrong, but I was just preparing for the worse.

As we kept driving up the hills, things started to become quieter. We felt like we were separated from the rest of the people down there. The streets are starting to become narrower. The car turns are a bit edgy. It felt like we were climbing. It was weird. As we get closer to Ariana's house, my heart beats faster and faster not knowing what I will see there or what I will do. 

Finally, we arrived! We couldn't proceed anymore. There was this gate on our right. I was sitting in the back of the car, so I couldn't see properly. My other friend who was sitting in front of me said that after the gate, there is a bridge that leads to somewhere which could probably be her house. We immediately tuned backwards and drove away. We all felt like we were doing something wrong and this could be considered trespassing.

I realized that day I can't contact agents simply for the sole purpose of meeting a celebrity. Nothing is free. You either contact them for something serious like a concert, acting, promoting or you don't call at all. I guess we all learn from our mistakes. I tried contacting her directly via Twitter and Instagram, but always no response. I even tried to contact the people she follows in order to use them as the ""middle-man"" to get in touch with her.   

And from that moment, I'm trying so hard to get rid of her inside my head. Trying to build some sort of hatred towards her just to forget her and move on. The thing is, I still don't like her music or personality. But I believe the absence of a female presence in my life in this very age may be the cause of this problem. Starting to watch her Nickelodeon show, Sam &amp; Cat, and purchasing her perfumes is sure not a healthy way on both your health and wallet. To watch something that don't feel like watching it just for someone, or to buy something that you don't find attractive just for someone. It's driving me crazy.

I've tried talking to close friends about this issue. I wanted very much to left this burden out of me and talk to someone. The problem is that this obsession have turned into an emotional relation. I feel sorry for her and empathy her after knowing about her trauma, ex-boyfriends, unstable relations, bad company, etc. I wanted very much to be the person that could change her. That could change her attitude and her character. Someone who she can trust in the times of needs. Call me crazy, but if I died, she won't even know that I existed in the first place, yet I still sympathize her for no reason! It's not like I know her in person or she know me. I only know her in front of the camera. And to be honest, after seeing her posts, I've realized she's a... sorry for this... trash mouth. She kept saying things that even hurts her femininity and I disgrace a woman who do that, yet some part of me still wants to help and reach out.

I don't know what to do and how to solve this mental issue. All the people I talked to answered me the same thing: getting married. It's the only way to channel all your emotions to someone you truly care about and love.

Other than that, apologies if my words were a bit offensive or inappropriate.      

Stay safe and healthy everyone!

Cheers!",31Mar2020,1

39,"My cat has had a bit of a journey, during her kitten years, she lived with an old lady. But that old lady got sick and had to move in a nursing home, which didn't allow pets. So her daughter got it, but she was allergic. She gave the cat to her boyfriend, my uncle. The cat took up with my grandmother when she visited my uncle. 

My uncle gave her the cat and she became a part of our family. It's been over 5 years since then and she's like a part of the family. I can't imagine my life without my cat. She loves us, she has special places where she sleeps and everything. She loves us and has grown into a full adult.

But still, it's been 5 years and the old lady is out of the nursing home. She wants ""Her"" cat back. My uncle got the phone call from her and he called us. She wants her back and i'm pretty heartbroken

40,"As a child I had always felt awkward, paranoid and sad, but at some point 2 or 3 years ago that turned into perpetual anger, or something like that. It went from wanting to help everyone to genuinely wanting to hurt people. The scary thing is that I've become good at it. I used to be socially awkward, now I'm not, but now I don't have the motivation to interact with people, and it's become hard not to push people away. Not a day in 2 years has gone by that I didn't feel a cold underlying anger that made me want to hurt people if not physically then emotionally. It's like I'm in ice-water and the only way to get relief is to either drag others in with me or throw ice-cubes at them.

44,"I (20F, at the time, I was 17-18 years old) graduated from high school two years ago. For some context, I went to a very small Christian high school in a rural community. I had a rough time in high school, I was dealing with anxiety and depression, and also coming to terms with the fact that I'm gay. The entire community I was in was not accepting, and I knew my parents and friends would not accept me if I came out, so I was really lonely and scared, especially towards the end of my grade twelve year. I ended up coming out to one of my teachers (27F), because she had mentioned that she had a brother who was gay, and she was the first adult in my life who supported me. She gave me her phone number and said I could text her whenever I needed to, and that she would be there for me. She gave me extra attention, and made me feel special, and I grew closer with her through the year. 

Things began to escalate over the next  few months, to the point that we were texting daily, and there were no boundaries in place whatsoever. After I graduated, things got worse. The whole context of how we met and of her being my teacher was dismissed, and she tried to be just like any of my other friends, despite the imbalance of power that our friendship was built upon. She was very controlling and manipulative, and she isolated me from my friends so that she was the only person I would go to for comfort. She was very dependent on me, and would get upset if I didn't text her back right away, or if I didn't answer her calls. The summer after I graduated, she started texting me alluding to the fact that she wanted to hurt/kill herself, and made me feel like I was the only person who could stop her, even going so far as to send me photos of her self-harming. This continued across the next year and a half.

Some things that were especially inappropriate were:

\- she lied to her husband about spending time with me, and made me believe that he was being unreasonable in having concerns about her being friends with me

\- she told me that if I ever told anyone what was going on, she would lose her job.

\- she pressured me to stay over at her house and sleep in her bed with her. I told her I was not comfortable with that, and she tried to guilt me into doing it anyways. (this was after I had graduated)

\- While I was still her student, I told her that I was depressed and that I had suicidal thoughts. To my knowledge, she didn't report this to any other staff members at the school. 

I no longer am in contact with her, and I've been thinking and reflecting on this a lot. I know that she exploited me and that I was mistreated, but I don't know what to do going forwards. I'm worried about current students at the school, especially as she mentioned to me several students who were struggling who went to her for support. I have contact with one of those students, and I want to reach out to her and to tell her what happened to me, but I don't know whether I should go straight to the school or not. I don't have any specific evidence that my teacher is starting an inappropriate friendship with this student, I just know what happened to me, and that this teacher is not very stable. 

I don't want to ruin her life, and I don't want her to lose her job, I just want to make sure that she doesn't do this again. 

Should I message the student and see what she says before deciding to talk to the school, or should I just go straight to the administration? Should I call the children's aid society? I'm kind of overwhelmed by the whole situation, and am just so scared that she will keep hurting students.",31Mar2020,1
45,"Tl;dr: I need access to a C tuba by May 4th, and ASAP before then, and my own C tuba is inaccessible.

Obviously I play tuba as part of my major, music composition.  I keep it in a locker at the music building on campus, which is usually open 24/7.

All the students in a music program got an email saying access would be restricted due to COVID-19, and that it would only be open 8-5 on weekdays and 8-1 on weekends.  Generous.  I read this email, but leave my tuba there, because I spent spring break in my parent‚Äôs house and couldn‚Äôt practice with other people trying to remotely complete work.

A week after that was the end of the first week of spring break, March 20th.  Another email is sent saying that they‚Äôre going further and completely locking the building down for at least 3 weeks, maybe more.  I either did NOT read this email, or I did and didn‚Äôt realize the implications.  In any case I am conveniently working during the remaining open hours and obviously don‚Äôt grab my tuba by the cutoff date, which was the 23rd.

I only just realized this now that online classes and lessons are going, as I cannot get into the cac to get my tuba.  I‚Äôve alerted all campus personnel who are relevant and so far, it seems like it‚Äôs stuck there for 2 weeks minimum.  I have to have a recording of myself playing a piece done by May 4th as a sort of final, and while I have played it and gotten muscle memory down before now it‚Äôs not an easy piece and demands more attention.

Whether by going home for spring break (40 min away) or by not getting my tuba at the first sign of trouble, I‚Äôve screwed up here, that much is clear.  My question is if anyone has any ideas on how I might be able to get my hands on a replacement if only for the next month.

46,"so im just going to dive right into this.

(im 14M)

my step dad is a piece of shit. hes a huge narcissist, hes manipulative, and complains about literally everything. my mom is with him and i dont see why there is literally no redeeming qualities about him other than he knows how to cook but thats it. I fear this man. i dont feel comfortable around him and im just in my room all day because i do not want to come into contact with him. my mom knows this ive tried telling her how i feel about all this but she will not listen no matter what i say.

 they argue all the time and its usually about me and everything that is wrong with me. its only my step dad that says those things tho. they yell and yell at each other, my stepdad has his own house but hes never there. my mom will usually tell him to get the fuck out when they argue but he usually doesn't. my mom is an alcoholic and most of the time she is drunk when they're in these arguments but not all the time.

A few months ago my mom was at work and it was just me, my step dad, and my brother who were here. my step dad got really pissed off at me because i was grounded from my xbox but my brother could play. i asked him to please got on my account and collect something in a game and he did, keep in mind i did not even touch the xbox. he got so insainly mad because he was looking at my account at the last time logged in and it of course came up when my brother got on. he started to yell at me and get in my face about how im always in the wrong and there is nothing good about me. i told him it was my brother who was on and not me, my brother even confirmed this. he still kept yelling at me and i eventually told him to fuck off and gave him the finger and i ran away to a friends house for the night because i did not feel safe with that man. i texted my mom where i was and that i was safe and she said that we would talk the next day. the next day comes and literally nothing. doesn't even bring it up when i get home. the next day she told me that i was grounded and i said what for my mom said its because i told my step dad to fuck off and that i gave him the finger, not because i ran away. i was grounded for 2 and a half months because of my disrespect. tbf i should have gotten in a little trouble but cmon. my mom had no worry or care in the world that i literally ran away because i did not feel safe with my step dad.

i included that story because i thought i may help you understand a little. 

now why do i feel like i need to call the cops? last night they were in another argument, this one was particularly bad. my mom said my step dad hit her. she was threatening to call the cops herself but never did. I am tired of my step dads shit. my mom will not do anything to help stop this no matter what i tell her. i decided if shes not i will. earlier today i told her, me or your boyfriend? she didnt choose. my own mother could not choose between her own son and her boyfriend who treats her like absolute shit. i told her i would call the cops myself the next time they get in an argument that bad. she told me not to and we would go through a bunch of unnecessary bullshit like we did a few years back (thats another story for another time.) 

I want my step dad gone. i fear for myself and my mom greatly. he is abusing her.

So, am i just being an arrogant ass and overreacting because a little bit of me thinks that but at the same time i want this to end and my mom refuses to do anything about it. should i call the cops the next time it gets that bad and make my mom choose between me and my step dad, or should i do something else? i feel like a cop might get the point across the best tho.",31Mar2020,1
47,"Due to several severe health issues, I have been unemployed for the past 5+ years and have been surviving on Disability benefits. 

When a person who I've just met attempts to make small talk by asking what I do for a living, how should I answer?

I'm not ashamed of my situation, but when I respond by saying ""I'm actually on Disability, "" ""I'm not able to work for health reasons,"" ""I don't currently have a job,"" or anything along those lines, the person invariably gets flustered and seems to feel guilty and/or embarrassed for having asked the question. 

I don't want to make anyone feel bad for simply trying to make friendly conversation, but I don't know how to *avoid* doing so when I'm asked this type of question.

I'd appreciate any ideas regarding how I might respond more appropriately in the future, because this situation happens fairly often!",31Mar2020,1

50,"I'm 22F and I've been struggling with depression/anxiety/anorexia for several years. I never thought I would post on reddit for help using a throwaway, but I don't know where else to turn. 

I am in a constant state of worry about anything and everything. I feel embarrassed admitting I have these diagnosed mental illnesses, so I think that keeps me from wanting to talk to a family member or friend about any of this face-to-face. Basically, I feel like I want to change everything and I've felt this way for years. 

I'm getting ready to graduate college in May, and I work at a bank in adminsitration. This job is completely unrelated to my field of study, and some recent changes there have made me hate it. I have a differnet boss, and I feel like she belittles me for being part-time by always asking me to come up and do things during times I'll be in class. I try to remind her that I am scheduled to be in school, and she seems to get frustrated and then pushes the project off on one of my coworkers, making them upset with me. I've tried to politely tell her that I am more than capable of doing it during the time I'm there, I just need to know about it so I can plan. I work 25-30 hours a week and am in 21 credit hours, so I just have to make a plan for everything. She gets visibly frustrated and blows me off; my old boss and I got along great, she was awesome, so I don't know how to handle this. Am I stupid for wanting to quit and find a job that's related to my field of study even though I've been offered full time at the bank? Am I giving up too early because I get anxious over stupid things? I feel like if I quit without being in good standing with my boss, I'll doom the rest of my career. 

Then, I'm having issues with my boyfriend of three years. He's 8 years older than me, but graduated with his bachelors last year. He is still only working part time, and has made little effort to get a full-time job. We're supposed to move in together, but now I'm thinking he's just going to need to stay with his roommate because I can't imagine working fulltime at the job I have now. It almost seems like his lack of effort is showing me that he doesn't want to move in together, even though he swears he does. I feel like all the finances will fall onto me, when I really want someone who will be equal to me so I can go get my masters. Is this selfish? He has been helpful with navigating my depression and anxiety in the past, but now it seems he doesn't care. He actually gets mad if I ask him if everything is okay (I probably ask this once a week because we don't see each other very much, and I get insecure that he doesn't want to talk to me anymore). I've tried really hard not to be insecure, but I feel like he gives me no reassurance. He gets grumpy when I ask him to go to work events with me, and never seems excited for me when I do something I'm proud of. I've talked to him about this and he says I'm making it all up in my head and that he'd be devastated if I left. Yet, he isn't bothered that we talk maybe once a day now that the virus has caused us to be separated. I can't tell if I'm just being stupid and focusing on the negative, but I feel stuck in a rut. 

This is long as hell, and I understand if no one takes the time to read this. I just feel like I can't find a therapist because of the virus and that I've let this go on too long. Any advice?

55,"For a little information, i have something called paranoid schizophrenia. This means i hear sounds and hallucinations that are not there, for people that do not know.

I get these even more when I'm in bed, alone, in the dark. I **always** have a night light on, because i like to see my whole room, so i know what and where things are, if doors open, close, etc. This makes me scared to go to sleep, because often i will wake up to sudden loud noises, like someone for example coughing right in my ear. This is the best way to describe it for people who don't have it. I will often hear knocking on my door, outside my window, footsteps and a kind of whispering. This makes it so i can't fall asleep by myself.

I have tried sleeping pills, but they do not work for me, as when i get scared or hear/wake up from a noise, my whole body goes to ""protect mode"", and my adrenaline rises. This removes the effect of the pills

I also need to say that i don't classify as a person who ""needs"" to be medicated against this, so that is why i don't have anti-psychosomatic-pills(English is not first language and i don't know what to call them in English)

But as said. i hear noises. i need to distract myself, but i cant just ""think about something else"" it does not work that way for me. i need an activity, something that takes up my whole mind. I play on my phone a lot, so this is currently what i do to fall asleep/fade away when my body can't handle being awake anymore. I fall asleep at 5am or later, and this is beginning to be a huge problem.

I am willing to try anything if any of you have rituals that makes you feel calm and relaxed before bed, or things you do to easily fall asleep. thanks for all advice.

*and by the way, please don't say ""just close your eyes and think of something good"" this is advice i have received too many times and it is starting to make me feel bad, and different. my hallucinations gets worse when i close my eyes and try to sleep, because i can't observe my surroundings. Music also does not help, as i feel it hides the sounds i should be aware of, and makes me scared.*

56,"My best friend (F) and I (F) have been inseparable for 6 years and we‚Äôve never had a falling out or an argument, but recently she has made me upset because she got a boyfriend and didn‚Äôt tell me. I thought this would be something that best friends talked about, so to find out from other people was really hurtful. 
Obviously this means that she‚Äôs had to have been talking to him which she never talked to me about, and then I found out that she had been telling someone else this stuff, so that was really upsetting because we are so close, but she didn‚Äôt tell me this but told other people? it‚Äôs just so out of the blue because we normally tell each other everything. I‚Äôm really hurt by this. 
then I keep thinking back and realising times when other people would ask her if she was talking to someone, so this shows that other people knew and i didn‚Äôt, and then even though I was there and heard her say yes, she still didn‚Äôt tell me. 
This makes me think I‚Äôm not good enough, and makes me feel like I‚Äôm getting kicked to the curb and that she doesn‚Äôt want to be my friend anymore. It makes me feel terrible about myself because I feel like people keep walking all over me, and now I‚Äôve even been made upset by my best friend, someone who I thought would never.

I think I like him, but a part of me is kinda icked out by our age difference.

He doesn't act immature and you'd honestly mistake us for being the same age. But I don't know...

I dated my first real boyfriend my first year and a half in college. He was my best friend for those years. I broke up with him 3 years ago because I thought I didn't love him anymore. Turns out I actually suffer from depression and anxiety to an extent I wasn't fully aware of. I recently realized my depression makes me feel completely empty inside, so I don't know if I actually didn't love him anymore or if I was in a terrible state. I feel so much guilt over breaking his heart just because I was broken. Regardless, I do not have feelings for him romantically anymore. 

When we broke up, we stopped talking for a while and then kind of became close friends for a few months. Then he started icing me out and being kind, but not fully responsive. I told him if he didn't want to be friends, that was okay, I'd just really like to know. He assured me that he wanted to be friends. Then after a year of not talking, I realized yesterday he deleted me from all social media (I'm not sure how long ago- I just realized.) I'm really really hurt, and also still so so guilty about breaking his heart years ago. I don't know if I should text him and apologize or leave it alone or ask him if he hates me or blah blah blah (my brain is running in circles)

It should be noted that I have a really really hard time socializing and making friends, and I fucking miss him as a friend. I know he doesn't owe me friendship, and I'm prepared for that to be his answer if I do speak to him. Should I pursue this or let it go?

81,I've been lying in my bed for 4 hours now and I just can't fall asleep. It's 3:30am and I am crying because of everything and my chest feels super tight and my heart is racing a bit. What can I do to finally sleep and still be fit tomorrow?,31Mar2020,1
83," 

Hiya. I'm nearly 30 years old, and I've got severe thanatophobia, or a fear of death. The dying part doesn't bother me - but the idea of going to sleep and never waking up is terrifying beyond belief.

I'm an athiest who believes that death will be exactly like before we were born - an absence of experience or feeling. I won't be lying there annoyed that I'm dead, or have any concept of time passing after me. I'll be gone.

The difference is - and this fact is what causes my panic attacks most nights - is that the nothingness before I was born had an end. I woke up. I was born. Every time I sleep, I wake up. When I die, I believe I won't ever wake up again. Sleeping passes instantly, as did the time before I was born, but how can the time after death be as 'instant' if there's no waking up at the end of it? It's just eternal. I can't imagine what a 'lack of existence/experience' is like if it has no end.

During the day I can quell my fears by filling up my days. I accomplish goals, have fun, and remind myself that 'there's nothing I can do about it, so worrying is just wasting the precious life I have'. At night, that tune doesn't ring the same. It doesn't work. All I can think is, this is it. There's no getting away from it. It will happen to me. I'm in life now, and that means one day I'll die, and there will be no waking up, no brain activity to let me dream, no consciousness to allow me to experience. My body will rot away in the ground and I won't even know. I'll never get to see or feel or speak or laugh or cry or think ever again.

Every night I'm reduced to tears and panic attacks by this inevitable, inescapable terror. I love life. I could live 1000 years and still have places to go, things to learn, people to meet, or even just seeing what the next day brings. I'm scared of not being here anymore, not experiencing ever again, and not getting to wake up like I did when I was born.

How does everyone come to terms with this? Does thinking 'nothing I can do, worrying is a waste of time' really work for everyone and I'm just alone in this? I can't get past this endless eternity of nothing where I'll never wake up again. Please help me, any words, advice, or perspective is welcome. I'm so scared.",31Mar2020,1
84,"So this may be long, it may be short, idk. Depends on how much I deem necessary. Sorry for my spelling and grammar and such, I'm really on edge right now.

So my internet friend (let's call them M) recently opened up to me about their parents. They told me all about the physical and verbal abuse they've gone through and It was so awful to hear. They told me things about how there dad threw a rolling pin at them so hard it left a hole in the drywall, how their parents have thrown knives at them, stuff like that.

And just today, they messaged me saying that they're scared and nothing else. They wouldn't reply to any other messages. They then opened an audio call where I could hear them sobbing and borderline screaming with their mom shouting in the background (I couldn't decipher what their mom was saying because their mom speaks Portugese).

This went on for around ten minutes before my phone died. When I came back, the call was closed and they're still not replying. 

I don't know if they're in danger or not, but I'm scared. I don't know where they live so there's no way for me to call resources for them and they've refused to tell an adult, claiming that it's disciple, not abuse. So this is more about what can I do to support them emotionally.",31Mar2020,1

86,"My son has been in prison for a few years now and he started out fine with no issues in the beginning. Two years ago I received a letter from him saying there was a riot and that they had everyone in lockdown. Ever since that point he has been getting jumped, stabbed, and threatened. I talked to him one day about why all this was happening and he explained to me that the day of the riot 1 gang went against multiple gangs and a lot of people ended up getting hurt. He said a cop ended up writing his name on the list of the gang that caused the riot. My son has told the cop multiple times and even had people testifying for him that he wasn't part of the gang. The damage ended up being done. I guess some prisoners got hold of that list and now this has been following him for the past 2 years. He has been moved to the same 3 prisons and continues to get jumped, stabbed, and threatened. I've seen my son really beat up, in a wheelchair, and overall depressed. Multiple people on that list have been jumped and stabbed also, so it's not just him. 

The problem is, I've talked to the wardens and multiple counselors from the same 3 prisons he keeps getting moved to. I've talked to multiple obudsman and they all seem to tell me that there is not a single thing that I can do. I always ask them that why do they keep on moving him to the same places expecting different results and they say that they are just following the system. I've gotten into contact with so many people and it's so shitty hearing that there is nothing I can do. My son reported the cop and things seemed to get even worse for him. I feel like there might be some corruption going on but I'm not sure. Regardless it just feels like they're doing a terrible job of keeping him safe. 

Well today I received another letter from my son. He admitted to me that he has tried killing himself. I'm glad they noticed and were able to take him to the hospital to save his life. He tried to overdose. 

I'm not sure what to do. I just want my son to be ok, it breaks my heart feeling like I might either lose my son to suicide or him being murdered by multiple gangs that has been following that list for years now. If anyone has any advice I would gladly appreciate it and thank you to everyone who took the time to read this.",31Mar2020,1

88,"I have been feeling this way for some time now, but the ""staying in"" thing has made me realize none of my friends seek conversations with me. For example, I'll enter a discord call and speak a little with everyone, then wait for their responses, which are very short, such as ""cool"" or ""nice"", but they never start speaking with me, only with eachother.

They also always have private stuff with eachother I never have, such as a quick, ""Hey x, remember I told you this?"" Or ""I need to talk to you, X"". No one ever speaks to me in private, or is excited while talking to me, am I boring? Should I change myself to match their needs?

In the past, some of them have made group chats to talk about stuff they don't trust me with, group chats which I only knew existed because of quick lines like ""Hey, check (group chat), X"", which happened to slip in the discord calls.

I've tried speaking to them about it, but they say I'm ""seeing patterns"" too much, and they don't do it to hurt me, even so, when I ask them to trust me with more stuff, they shrug it off. It seems like everyone's my ""friend to talk to"", yet I am no one's.

The situation that made me write this happened today, where I spent half an hour quiet in the call, people coming in said Hi to everyone but to me, spoke with eachother, yet didn't even ask if I was there, the way I see it, it doesn't matter to them if I am or not.",31Mar2020,1

My coworker and I got laptops recently however, our boss wants one of us to be in the office at all times to help with the phone even though we explained that we can answer calls from home on our work phones.

97,"
I apologize for the long backstory (TDLR at end) : I have an aunt who is just absolutely nutty. 
For the last 5 years she has been out of our small niche of a family circle. 
During those 5 years my other sweet aunt myself and cousins cared for my grandparents night and day. (Mostly them.) 
At one point it just became too much to care for them and we put our grandmother in a nursing home.. she was not pleased and reached out to crazy aunt (whom grandma had instructed us never to inform of her death because crazy aunt had not been around) for help. Of course crazy aunt, never missing a chance to make someone‚Äôs life miserable, jumps at the opportunity to make sweet aunt look like a terrible person for dumping grandma. 
Of course even worse when grandpa, suffering for Alzheimer‚Äôs became too much as well. 
Well many court dates later, crazy aunt takes grandma home to care to her. Grandma is happy, we‚Äôre happy, because grandma is happy. 
But now grandma hates us, and crazy aunt is saying that everyone is terrible and stole money (it was proven in court to not be the case) and to have taken random items from their house. Yea I took my late brothers old toys.. come at me.. 
my cousin was gifted an old tractor from my grandfather and his old truck. Lawyer says that‚Äôs all fine.. 
ok so what‚Äôs the problem? 

The problem is.. she (she is just nuts and we know it‚Äôs her) is posting terrible things including pictures of my aunt and cousins saying terrible things about them on local online forums. She is non stop harassing them, sending the cops to sweet aunts house saying that she stole money. (Again She didn‚Äôt) 
Of course she never mentions her name in these posts and obv there‚Äôs no way of nailing her to this. I would think maybe we could stop her somehow.. but how? 
We‚Äôre all so devastated, we‚Äôve worked so hard to do the best for our family, and she‚Äôs just such a bitter mean person who has all the time in the world to just harass people. what can we do? 

TDLR: crazy aunt harassing my family with slanderous messages on local online forums, including posting photos and calling the cops. Can we stop her somehow?

So to summarize, my mom's an addict. She's in treatment at this time, it's only 28 days. She was homeless prior, and basically cornered me into taking on the responsibility of my 15 y/o brother after my boyfriend had gotten shot (Dec 27th) through both of his legs and was unable to work. I'm working full time, plus I'm a full time online student. I have a lot on my plate prior to him even moving in.
Now, him being here wasn't the issue. I could financially support it (up until last week bc I was laid off, but bf is back to work this week so YAY), but what the issue is, all school is canceled and he was required to work from home. I'm extremely laid back. My parents told me he's just being a normal kid when I bring this up to them. He doesn't clean up his trash. He ate 12 packs of fruit snacks and puked, left all the packaging on the floor and shoves trash underneath my couch. I have to tell him to shower and brush his teeth every day. He still wets the bed (I'm pretty sure it's a medical problem involving erectile dysfunction and we've been dealing with it for years), but I had asked him if he had an accident, to let me know so I could clean it up before it super soaked my carpet. He also had bathroom pads to prevent the carpet or couch from even needing to be cleaned...which he refused to use and he tried to make excuses for his laziness. The other night my friend, boyfriend, and I all decided we were going to take some LSD and have a good adult night in the safety of our homes. While we were peaking we had laughed for hours to the point of weeping. After everything was said and done, I made a comment that we had probably burned some calories. My friend, who is slightly overweight, became my brother's victim, with my brother basically fatshaming him telling him he could stand to lose some pounds. This isn't the first time he's made nasty comments like this. He's rude and cocky and honestly a condescending little know-it-all who's wrong 90% of the time.
Then, the next day (yesterday) we were working on homework. He's reading Harry Potter and the Sorcs stone. I've had his English teacher back when I was attending the High-school so I know what's expected for class work. I was playing rocket league with bf and I was having him finish chapter 6 and read to 9. The kid pretended to read the same two pages for 30 minutes. Then he lied about reading, so he could move on to the work sheets. I saw through it, and told him to finish reading or else he's grounded from all entertainment devices and driving (he already was because he managed to take my mom's passenger side mirror off and run straight on into a pole to cut a corner and beat a stoplight in a matter of 3 days. No license either) he finished reading and did his work sheets. I went to check his work and his essay questions (this is a quiz) we're two sentences each with 5 periods scattered about. I told him to do it right, which resulted in a two day long argument about rewriting his essays. I ended up just kicking him out because it was like this any time we were trying to help him do something correctly, better, or more efficiently. His way was the right way, even if it was EXTREMELY wrong. I called my mom to discuss this with her and she started apologizing to him. I'm thinking about talking to her about putting him on the CHINS probation program if this is a consistent problem.

109,"So, today I (23F) matched with a cute older guy on Tinder and things seemed to be going well.
We were talking about life, flirting and even talking about sex a bit. I let him know I‚Äôm looking for some kind of actual relationship and not just sex, and he told me he feels the same way.
Anyway, he asked me when I‚Äôd want to meet up and I told him I‚Äôd feel comfortable if we talked for a week more or less before meeting up with him.
He got really pissed, starting talking about how obviously our texts meant nothing and that he doesn‚Äôt understand women.

As things got on, probably to about a year or two ago, I started to realise the problems (around the time my step-sister was born). S started to get meaner to me. From the odd thing of calling me dumb names sometimes, to shouting things out the van window while I was at the bus stop. I didn't think much of these things, until they got worse.

He can by extremely hypocritical. He will say to me, get off my phone, and then proceed to spend the next hour on his. I'm sure this isn't uncommon in house holds.

So to make sure I didn't spend too much time away from the family, in my room playing games with very good friends, I had to go to work with him for the whole 6 weeks. He is self employed and generally nobody else where he works. 

Oh boy, over those weeks, my mental health very quickly decreased, I became depressed as fuck. By the 3rd week I became quite prepared to jump off a bridge onto a high speed motorway. Before this summer I was feeling depressed, but no where near as bad as this. Let me tell you why I felt this way.

He would call me really cruel names. He started by calling my gay all the time (I'm straight), like all the time calling me gay, sometimes doing impressions of people having gay sex. And then they developed into calling me a retard, a spastic, batty downy, you name it. Whenever I would talk he would either make fun of my stutter or do impressions of people with down syndrome. I also learned that while on the phone to his friends, he also does these kinds of things, under his breath and what not, about them, if what they are saying is confusing him or whatever. 

He thought he was hilarious. One time, when I was getting some food, he came onto my Discord calls with very good friends, and said: That I was gay, and that he was a pedophile. Now, they didn't take it seriously, but got a little concerned I think. I played on my Xbox a lot, and talked with these people, just to get away from them. 

So my Mom isn't that bad compared, she is just extremely hypocritical about a lot of things, has a favourite child but I'm the unfavourite, doesn't believe a thing I say about anything, always questions me, and thinks that playing my games will literally cause me cancer directly. Despite any scientific evidence that it won't make me violent and stuff, she won't believe it. 

So with the whole quarantine thing going on, I've had a lot more time at home. I get set a new set of work, every two weeks. So far it's the first week, and I've finished all my work. So I would go onto my Xbox, and play some fun games with fun people. But nope, now they've decided that for the next 6 months or however long I'm out of school, I need to spend all that time with them.

Fuck me, I can't spend that long with them. I just want to get away, but really can't. I know they are my parents and care for me, but they just really are not nice people to be around. Anyone got any advice?",31Mar2020,1

113,"To start I am extroverted. Extremely, I love people, I love being around others, I love talking to people. But I have a life 10x more cut off than any introvert I know. I see people who I know prefer being alone complaining about ""What am I supposed to do indoors"" and I'm just like, this is the same. I always noticed I had fewer friends than others, but now its showing so dramatically and I can't take it. I know everyone is going to leave their houses after this is done, and hang out and meet up and its going to be everyone except me. And I don't know what to change or fix to be someone that has more than 6 close friends who don't live near me. I need physical contact, I need to interact

But the kicker is I hate alcohol, I don't know how to talk about things that aren't technical stuff or science, I can't figure out small talk, I get nervous around guys (I'm a guy too), and the worst is I hate going out without someone I already know being there. And I want to change this because I want something to look forward to after the stay at home orders are done, but I know literally nothing will change except I'm going to work from the office instead of from home. But I don't know how to change it, and I don't know how to get comfortable with the things I don't like so I can go hang where everyone else is and meet people",31Mar2020,1

117,"I'm 18 years old and am still in highschool. I moved out of my moms house in late September and have been living with my boyfriend since. I don't have a job yet (I wanted to finish highschool first) so I've been relying on my boyfriend for essentials like food,  lady hygiene things, etc. I learned about the stimulus check from my boyfriend when he said we could use the money I get to buy me some new clothes and a camera I've wanted. I was skeptical about the fact if I'd even be getting one, if anyone gets one at all, because I don't work or pay taxes. He assured me that *everyone* would get one, and the least I'd get is $500. 
A couple days ago I was with my mom and she brought up the check. She said ""when I get this stimulus check I'll give you $200 for clothes and stuff"". I thought it was a little weird but just said okay. Today I remembered what she said and mentioned it to my bf and he got mad. I couldn't understand why at first until he said ""she better give you your money, its yours"", then I understood that he thinks my mom meant she'd give me $200 of *my* money. And honestly he's probably right. I couldn't imagine her giving me $200 of her own money, and its something she would do. When I asked why he thought she would get my hypothetical money he said its because I'm still in school, and so she's legally still my guardian. 
Is this true? In the case the stimulus check is given to people, would I even be eligible to get it? And if so would she be the one getting it? 

Sorry if this is the wrong sub for this. I just thought ""I need a little insight on this"" and came here",31Mar2020,1
118,I‚Äôve been friends with someone for over almost 7 years. We had the same classes in middle school and high school and hung out every single day during our friendship years. He was the only friend I had so he was like my best friend. About a year ago now he texted me one day out of the blue and said he didn‚Äôt want to be friends with me anymore cuz I add no value to his life and him being around me is making him lazier even tho we went to the gym a couple days out of the week. I mean we had amazing times together and memories I will never forget. A couple weeks go by from that text and he wants me to hang out with him again and the one day I see him  again he never said one word about the text and didn‚Äôt even mention it he played it off like it never happened. Then another week goes by and he blocked me on everything from my number to all social media so I have no contact with him. I recently found out he moved to Vietnam by someone we both know that he‚Äôs been talking to and he has no plans on coming back to the states. It‚Äôs been really weighing on me recently that I don‚Äôt understand why he did what he did and I keep dreaming about him sometimes. I guess I just need some advice or something to help me with this problem. Should I try to reach out to him hoping someday he unblocks me and sees that I‚Äôm concerned for him or do nothing and hopefully forget about him eventually?,31Mar2020,1

121,Hello everyone I'm 25 years old and I desperately need some guidance from anyone and everyone.. Currently I live with my parents our relationship was very toxic and abusive during my childhood hence me growing up very self conscious and depressed with anxiety and now it's gotten better there's not much of a relationship but there's hope for the future if I can just get my shit together and move out.. I do not own my own car yet. I dropped out of college since school was ruining my life at the time I was very suicidal and I had no real passion except for basketball. I live in Portland and I dropped out to coach basketball for some trail blazer youth camps but the money was real bad as fun as it was and I needed something else.. I went to work in the cannabis industry at the entry level I currently work for $13 an hour. During this quarantine ive just had too much time to think and I'm not happy and I want to move forward in life.. I need my own car and the only way to Salvage my relationship with my family is to move away and be independent for a few years which I am desperate for. My current situation is my company is solid and full of great of people I spoke to my boss about how I'm feeling about the job the pay and my overall mental health and they were very understanding and will try to find something I can train up for and move up in the ranks and work for higher wages since low end cannabis jobs are a lot of labor and not a lot of pay.. but that won't be immediate and could take a while. My other option was try and continue searching for a job in the sports field since I live in Portland I'm right next to Columbia and Nike and I have friends that work at both. But with my experience and lack of a degree I'm sure it'll just be a warehouse job for the same pay.. and my last option is to go back to school and get some skills. I was young and I didn't know what I wanted being older now and been in the work force for a while I have a better understanding of what I'm capable of. I'd like a sports related degree basketball being my passion that can be multi faceted in to other industries if anyone has any recommendations on that please tell me. Me and my parents don't have the best relationship but they still want the best for me and would be willing to help pay for school so it wouldn't be all me. Thing with school is I'd have to live with being at home still for another 4 years.. but potentially arming myself with skills and I could get somewhere a lot better soon after graduation then where I'm at now. I'm just stuck and I don't know what to do i am desperate for some guidance I appreciate everyone's answers and input thank you.,31Mar2020,1
122,"I‚Äôm (21F) the eldest of four children in my family. My mom (37F) had me when she was sixteen, but through hard work (and help from her older siblings) she got her life on track to eventually become a lawyer. She has three younger children between 4 and 13, her current husband is the father of the two younger ones. I‚Äôve helped with my siblings since I first met my baby brother when i was seven, and I love them all more than life. I would do anything for any of them, and they see me as a caring parental figure. 

I was in college for a while, but I was forced to move back last year due to financial troubles. My mother refuses to co-sign any student loan forms, and refuses to let me register for emancipation because she wants to claim me for her taxes. I do not know my father. I paid for college tuition out of my own pockets for two years, working 40+ hours per week on top of school, but eventually it got to be too much and I could no longer afford it. I‚Äôve been living at home again, doing daily chores and paying my mom $350 every month for rent, and struggling to find a job that is lucrative enough to allow me to leave this house and go back to school. Both my mom and her husband make a lot of money between her job as a lawyer and his job in Manhattan advertising.

This lockdown began about two weeks ago. Every single weekday, for up to six hours per day, my mom has demanded that I watch her 3 children while her and her husband isolate themselves in their upstairs office to work. I am expected to execute homeschool plans for the children, clean the entire first floor, cook two meals for them, and come up with creative crafts to do indoors for these three children every single weekday. I am temporarily not being required to pay rent, but I am responsible for my own groceries and college fees during this time. I applied to several schools for the upcoming fall semester, but now with this gap in my income, I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll even be able to cover the fee required to accept my admission before the deadline. I‚Äôm not allowed to take any job right now because I am expected to be their means of childcare, and my regular weekly job is closed due to the virus. I brought this all to my mother‚Äôs attention and she became extremely defensive, recalling how she overcame her own hardships alone and saying that she couldn‚Äôt afford to ‚Äúsimply throw money‚Äù at me during this pandemic.

As if being an unpaid nanny and maid wasn‚Äôt enough, my mother is becoming increasingly hostile. She is and always has been oddly competitive with me, with her own insecurities manifesting as disdain and malevolence, and being confined to a house with her during this time is proving to be too much for me to handle. She constantly reminds me that I am weaker, dumber, and fatter than her. As a side note, her behavior towards me has been this way since I became a teenager. She has shown me little in the way of love, and since I turned 18 has only let me live here because I am paying her/helping her with chores every day. 

I understand that times are tough right now, and that they need to work in order to keep their home. Between hours of unpaid labor, endless hostility from my mother, and fear that I won‚Äôt be able to get the fuck out of this house in the fall- I feel hopeless. I am beyond depressed, I don‚Äôt see any hope. Am I overreacting? Should I be okay with giving daily unpaid childcare/cleaning services and being treated like a servant in my home? What can I do to help myself out of this situation? How am I supposed to afford to go back to school? Any advice at all, I am absolutely desperate. I don‚Äôt know how much more of this I can take.

TLDR; I am 21 years old and being forced to work 25-30 hours per week watching my three young siblings. I‚Äôm expected to do laundry, dishes, and general cleaning for the entire family during those hours- as well as to act as their teacher to get through their homeschool work. I am not being paid, and I am not allowed to pursue paid opportunities due to the fact that my mother and stepfather ‚Äúneed‚Äù me to watch their kids every weekday and do chores every day. I‚Äôm losing a ton of money by not working, pretty soon I won‚Äôt even have enough to go back to school this fall. My mom is treating me like dirt even more than usual, and I don‚Äôt know how much of this I can take. I am scared of what I might do just to get out of this situation. I can‚Äôt do this for another month, and I don‚Äôt have any friends to talk to about it. Somebody please give me an ounce of sane advice.",31Mar2020,1

I want to go. The surgery I need is a spinal fusion, and I'm at risk for paralysis if it isn't fixed. In my opinion, the faster I get testing done, the quicker I can get into surgery when they allow it.


My dad told me not to do it. I'm considered high risk (asthma) and he doesn't want me to get sick. I'm not used to him acting this way. He doesn't usually freak out over stuff like this. In fact, I've had to fight with him in the past about my medical issues.


He's been keeping my mom inside and running all the errands around town, and now he doesn't want me going to the hospital.


The thing is, we always fight about this and I really don't know how to explain the importance of the imaging.


I guess this is kind of multiple questions, but:


1) How to I explain to my dad the importance without drawing into an argument?

Also TW there are topics some people might find upsetting.

Okay so a bit of context.

In August of 2018 I started to date a guy. We didn‚Äôt even last a month but the thing here is the emotional damage I allowed him to cause me.

Everything was wonderful until I started picking on his toxic behaviour patterns.

It started with him wanting me to have all my attention on himself. When we hung out with friends he‚Äôd get mad if he considered I wasn‚Äôt talking to him enough. Then he started telling me stories about how he used to be bullied and self-harm. When he did this I‚Äôd tell him how beautiful and amazing he was. He got the attention he wanted.

Then he started making weird sex jokes. He was like that before we started dating, but now they had became weirder or at least this is what I remember. He was very insistent on the sex topic. He‚Äôd think about making out or tongue kissing as little archievements (which I now see it‚Äôs weird and fucked up). As I said he always insisted on having sex. I always told him no, and he always physically respected that. But phsychologically, he tried to guilt trip me into thinking that me not wanting to have sex was weird and wrong. He made up that my best friend has lost her V-card to convince me. None of it worked. It was hard but I stood up for myself and that‚Äôs something I‚Äôm proud of.

Then I went on a 10 day trip with my family. He insisted on calling me every single night and texting me hearts which I found childish and a bit weird. And the 9th day he texted me saying that he had fallen in love with a girl he had met three days before. He broke up with me via text message. He didn‚Äôt even have the balls to say it to my face.

A week later my uncle, terminally ill with cancer died.

I was at one of the lowest points on my life. He knew that. He tried to call me and make me feel better about my uncle passing after he had done something stupid, so I guess he felt guilty. Anyways, I hung up on him. 

Then a week or two later he called me again to make up some shit about my best friend faking her uncle‚Äôs suicide. I told him I did not believe him nor I trusted him and he got mad at me.

Then a month he created drama out of nowhere and insinuated I was a burden to my friends. He got mad at me because I was telling my friend off for not buying a ticket event before they ran out of it. I told him to stop bothering me.

Like three months later he sent an audio high on weed saying that he was sorry and he had fucked up. I said it was okay and went to sleep. He apologised another then and (I think) that time he wasn‚Äôt high. Anyways I ended up accepting his apologies.

But he wanted to still be friends with me. In summer 2019 he told me he wanted to hang out with me and go to the beach as we had done last summer (2018 when we were dating). I told him that I‚Äôd texted him and never did. Had a great summer spent on self-growth and art improvement.

And today, during national lockdown because of coronavirus he has texted me at 4am after 0 contact for like a year. I don‚Äôt know how he found me on Instagram. There‚Äôs only my (pretty common) name and it‚Äôs not even on my @, just the profile name. Also there‚Äôs not my face anywhere on it because it‚Äôs an art account. I am very confused and anxious. Words can‚Äôt describe in which ways this boy has hurt me, and I really don‚Äôt want to talk to him again. But I know he‚Äôll make a scene and I hate it.

What should I do? Do I answer him? Do I tell him to fuck off or kindly decline his offer of human contact? Why the fuck is he texting me at 4am on lockdown? Like why right now in an already stressful situation?

131,"So, I have been trying to get a part time job for a long time now. And for that I moved to a new city, where one of my friend let me move in with him and suggested it's easy to get a job.
Corona at that time was just hitting the news and nothing was so serious.

So in the beginning of march I started to look for jobs in this city and I was able to find one.
Got the interview and was selected.

But now the emergency was declared by the Gov here, and everyone is like Stay at home.

Now the problem is this, even though I have a full time offer at hand, the people at apartment are indirectly telling me to not to go for the job or find a new place to move in(so that they wont get infected incase I get infected).

I understand the whole situation around me, but what suggestions you guys have to offer. I am having difficulty in making up my mind.

133,"Confusing title. I know.

I‚Äôll start off with this. We‚Äôll call him Q. I‚Äôm in MS, and Q is my history teacher. 

My family life isn‚Äôt the greatest. My dad‚Äôs not really around, and I constantly argue with my mom. Until I met Q, I had a little philosophy: never trust anyone. (I developed this philosophy from personal reasons I‚Äôd rather not go too deep into.)

When I first met Q, (new teacher) I didn‚Äôt think much of him. But soon, he must‚Äôve noticed I looked stressed in class or something of that sort because he asked me if everything was okay. I soon started to open up to Q; I told him about my stress with classes, tests, applying to high schools, etc. Then I started telling him more personal stuff, like how I always fight with my mom, and how she insults me. Or how my parents always fight, and I‚Äôm afraid they‚Äôll get divorced.

He always listens, and he always gives me advice on what to do. He actually seems to care about me and my well-being. I have always appreciated his help. But, later on I started to develop a crush on him. 

I know I‚Äôm a teenager, and nothing will ever happen. But, I‚Äôm deeply afraid of Q finding out I ‚Äòlike like‚Äô him.

He‚Äôs the only person I truly trust; I don‚Äôt know what I would do without him. I have no one else to rely on except him.

136,"Tl;Dr at the bottom.

Late this afternoon I went to take the trash out and something caught my eye in the yard of the abandoned house nextdoor, it was a dog. I called out to the dog and it hesitantly approached the fence line. It was filthy, caked in mud, matted fur, teeming with fleas, had a huge open sore behind it's ear, and looked awfully hungry and thirsty. I noted that it had a collar with what appears to be a homemade (hand written tag), but I couldn't make out what the tag said. 

So, I went inside and grabbed a bottle of water and a few of our dog's treats. I was hoping the dog would let me get close enough to read the tag while it ate and drank. Unfortunately, the tag was too faded to read. 

Just as the dog finished the water a puppy appeared. The puppy did not have a collar, but they seemed to be acquainted. So, I went back in and put a few cups of our puppy's food in a disposable container and brought it out to them with some more water. The gobbled it all up like they hadn't eaten in days. 

I let my kids come outside (once I was confident that the dogs were friendly), and we played with the dogs through the fence for a little while before we had to head back in. I had hoped the dogs would head back home at that point. 

A couple of hours later I took my dogs out only to find that the lost dogs were still there. I gave them some more water since it was still quite hot outside and headed back in, hoping that they'd head home because it would be getting dark soon. 

No such luck, they are still out there now. I am gravely concerned for those dogs and conflicted about what to do. As far as I can tell, my options (if they are still out there in the morning) are to take pictures and post them to the local Reddit/Facebook/Twitter pages in an attempt to find their [negligent, possibly abusive] owner, call the city (severely overburdened kill shelter), or try to contact the local humane society (running emergency only on a skeleton staff). Unfortunately, all of the local independent dog charities are not taking in more dogs at this time (I checked all of their websites). 

I would love to take them to a veterinarian and get them the care they so desperately need (and see if wither dog is microchipped), but honestly we simply don't have the means right now. 

So, kind folks of r/advice, what's the least of all evils? How should I proceed?

We have a bit of a language barrier since English is not my first language and sometimes he doesn't really understand me, but he says that's ok.

We used to not be awkward when we were just friends but now it's a whole different story.

140,"I feel really lost. I'll be 100% honest here and tell you about my life and hope you'll give your true opinion about what I should do with my life.

Like I said I'm 21 years old, a student college and lives alone. I don't have any friends or gf and never had one. There's no college nowadays anyway but it doesn't matter because also when there's college I still have pretty much the same social interaction. 
Lately I started to think about how loser I am for not having anyone, and felt like I need someone to give me some attention, even if it means to pay for getting it, so I started to go to prostitutes, less for sex and more for someone to talk to even though it's super lame (and not cheap)
I can't get Tinder because I'm not hot, I'm kinda chubby so Tinder is off the list anyway. 
I study a few hours a day but don't how to fill the rest of the day. 
On the days before coronavirus I used to go to the gym for 1 hour so there isn't much difference anyway.
I'm so lame that nowadays when there's no gym I miss even to the female trainer of the gym that when she saw me and smiled and said hello it kinda made my world for the moment
I asked a few people what they do during these days and they sai mostly watch tv and that kind of stuff but I get bored REALLY quick and can't watch tv more than 10 minutes, same thing for any other activity including a screen.
I talk to my mom and dad a few times a day with a phone call, but basic stuff only. They are also all the contacts I have in my phone anyway. 
Honestly I feel sorry for them, I believe that they know I'm alone all day and not talking to anyone and might also suspect about that prostitutes thing or simply think I'm gay because I never had a gf. 
What I'm supposed to do about it? I'm not gay just a loser, and even if they know about that prostitutes thing I don't think it will make me stop anyway.

144,"I've had a crush on this girl in college for well over a year now. We started texting regularly at the turn of the year, where I told her from the beginning that I liked her and would like to get to know her personality better (as in go on dates and stuff to see if we match together as a couple), just to avoid getting into the friendzone. Her answer was quite vague, she didn't exactly say she liked me back but she said ""well we can get to know each other's personalities better and if all goes well, we can take a step together."" We agreed to define our relationship as ""friends who are getting to know each other to see if we romantically click, rather than ""just"" friends""

We've been texting everyday since then and have gone on one casual date and were planning another date/hangout until that corona thing happened, but the thing is I don't even know if she was attracted to me (as in terms of my appearance) in the first place. I feel like if there's no attraction in the first place, no relationship would work. She says I'm handsome when she didn't have to and gave me a 7/10 rating in terms of appearance (idk if that's good or bad considering i'm quite short/skinny but have a good looking face), but at the same time she says that the one time she fell in love was when she felt attraction right at the start. This confused me, so I asked if she had that attraction/a liking for my appearance before we started texting, again her answer was vague, she said something along the lines of ""of course any two people who are getting to know each other better wouldn't agree to get to know one another without liking each other's appearance/being attracted to them in the first place""... so I don't know if it's my low self esteem talking or if she actually doesn't find me that attractive after all.

I coped fine for awhile by just powering through, but they've gotten worse over the past few months.

Do any of you have any experience with this sort of thing? Any advice on how to mitigate the issue, or maybe solve it? Further, is this really that atypical? Any time I've told anyone about it, nobody seems very concerned, which makes me wonder if this is more commonplace than I thought.

150,"Help me. My brother ruins me and destroys my soul. I am closer and closer to suicide with everyday.

Please help me with your advice. My brother is ruining me with his bullying and it will eventually lead to my suicide.

My brother is ruining my mental health, and he does everything that will lead me eventually to suicide. I need help. I tried with it many times

What do you think of my brother? It‚Äôs going to be long. Please help me, I can‚Äôt deal with this anymore. Be honest.

I suffer from severe depression and anxiety. My brother also suffers from it.
He is really abusive towards me whenever I disagree with him, he calls me awful names really hurting my feelings.
I often listen to him for hours about his problems, I try to calm him down, not to think about the worst scenario. But it‚Äôs too much for me. I have many problems in myself. I suffer from suicidal thoughts every other day. I feel fucking hopeless and I have many stress issues right now. I stayed alone in my apartment and didn‚Äôt go home to the family. 
And I have to repress all these feelings because whenever I tried to share anything with him he betrayed me, made fun of me, increased my fear and anxiety, and even victim blamed me.
Examples:

When I told him I was sexually harassed by a 40ish married man when I was 17, he made fun of me, how I am a w***** and even told everything to my parents who are really conservative and it just created so much shame in me yet I shouldn‚Äôt feel guilty.

He often made fun of me how I am a feminazi and nobody will have sex with  me and I will stay a virgin forever just because I don‚Äôt have a boyfriend. He made me so upset that I told him how I was basically raped when I lost my virginity. He laughed about it, told my parents again: She was raped. She was raped.

He always calls me cringe whenever I post something on facebook. How pitiful I am, this basically creates anxiety in me. How I am not going to find a boyfriend: just because I posted a photo with a sketch about a guy on a wall and me together and the title was: me and my boyfriend ( it was supposed to be sarcastic) and he also said now: women don‚Äôt behave like that.

Some days ago I shared a post on Facebook, how it sucks to be alone and your mind can just basically go crazy and I envy the people who spend their quarantine time with someone they love. And he just made fun of me again. How I am behaving like a celebrity, like I am Kim Kardashian. How pathetic I am, they will use it against me.


I once shared a post with a really dear friend of mine on Instagram and I mentioned how she has always stood by me even when everybody bullied me. And I got it again: how I am behaving like a celebrity, you are not a star to share your bully story. Every bullied person deserved it. 

I mentioned him once that I was dropped out of a group ( in one of the university groups because they created an official one for us newbies and their group chat was basically a private group chat) and he tried to plant the idea in me that they threw me out because they talked about me or laughed at me. It made me anxious again and sad.


He blamed me for other things like: he accidentally sent a mail to a lady containing the text: die rat and he wanted to send me.

He blamed me when a married man ( I didn‚Äôt know) hit on me, talked for a week on whatsapp and his wife found me and I stopped talking to the man and told everything to his wife because she asked me. And how I ruined other people‚Äôs lives.

Yesterday was my birthday, his friend sent me a Happy Birthday message on Facebook. I texted him: Thank you, have a good day ( but if you talk to my brother it won‚Äôt be hahaha) just being sarcastic. The guy also laughed it off. And on my fucking 25th birthday that I spent alone without any cakes, friends, loved ones I had to talk to him for 2 hours because how he was insulted and I ruined his friendship and now his friend behaves odd.

I just can‚Äôt deal with this anymore, it‚Äôs really toxic, I blocked him everywhere but he is sending me nasty mails containing every swearing you would describe the shittiest person on Earth.

My mental health is really bad now, his behaviour really hurt me. He is selfish, he only cares about himself, he just ruins me. And I can‚Äôt cut the contact because he is 23 and still lives with my mom ( she and my father also endured a lot : including: putting a gun to my mom‚Äôs head, breaking my father‚Äôs finger, constantly verbally or physically abusing them) plus he always blackmails me(e.g.: he uploaded my lost photos from my really old Iphone to a computer and he threatened me to share my private ones on the internet and I will commit suicide, he threatened to curse me, he made up a story  about him being involved in the mob and he was smuggling stuffs and he lied about it that he needs money or he will be killed and I loaned money from a bank and he even created panic in me how the mobs know about me and they are going to kill me if I mention anything to anyone: I escaped to my friend‚Äôs dorm she was also scared, I cried and had panic attacks 6 times a day that I will be assasinated, it was exam period I couldn‚Äôt do my exams I was a f-ing mess and still suffer from it) when I talk to my mom he just takes aways the phone and doesn‚Äôt let us talk on the phone. I rely on him now as well because he has to send my medicine via the post office and I don‚Äôt want my mom to do it because she has diabetes and she is 60 so I don‚Äôt want to endanger her.

He doesn‚Äôt go to college, he doesn‚Äôt work, he just does nothing, he sometimes goes out with his friends and that‚Äôs all. 
Oh and yeah my parents far from perfect but he can‚Äôt take responsibilities for his mistakes. It‚Äôs always somebody else who is to be blamed.

152,"Here's the rundown:

I live in New Jersey, and my boyfriend lives about 30 minutes from me. We are under a stay at home order so only essential travel is allowed. Many articles say that it is okay to see a close friend or family with social distancing, to travel for essentials, and for work if you have to. 

Here is who we are exposed to almost daily:

He works full time in PA and has a ""let me go letter"" if he ever gets pulled over. I live with my aunt right now because my mom is a nurse on a COVID-19 unit and my parents don't want me to be exposed, and I also attend an internship MWF co-counseling group therapy. My boyfriend also lives with his parents and his niece and nephew that are under the custody of my boyfriend's mom. (So, the sister doesn't live there, just her kids.)

I am from Europe and from non English speaking country.

From the first day I started there and till now I introduced myself by English version of my native name, because I like it and it sounds nicer and tbh I am used to it. If someone speaks to me in English I always use my English name.

 American part of the team call me by my preferred name and the rest refuse to do so.

There are a couple of ppl who speak my native language in the company and they call me by my original name when we speak our language. 

The rest picked up on it, and started calling me by that name too - it just sounds so weird and mispronounced. and I really dislike it.
 let's say if you introduce yourself as Lisa (Leesa), but people keep calling you Laiza.

when I was 12, my mom, drove me home drunk. So drunk that I had to keep her awake and had to tell her to turn brake and do everything involved with driving. this was a 1-hour drive and I was scared shitless.  

Every day I think about it and don't know how to move on so your help would be gladly appreciated. 

backstory:  My uncles have cabins, and we go every year it is very fun until the end. As for we have to deal with our mother who is always drunk. At home, we normally leave her to be but here we can't. This year I was going to sleepover at one of the cabins with my dad but things changed, the problem was that my sister wanted to leave but because our mom was so drunk they can't. So my dad went home with my sister and was under the assumption that my mom was going to sleepover too. but after she put down some more beers she changes her mind and wants to go home but is so drunk she can't get to the car. however, in her struggle, she caught the attention of my caring uncles, aunts, and relatives. For the next two hours, they talk to her and tell her to stay for the night and go home first thing in the morning. She still said no which I do not understand because it was a Friday night and she would have got home fine. But still, no so we went to our car and before we left my uncle said to sit in the back of the car of which I agreed. when we started to drive she asked why I was sitting in the back which make me thing she did not know that she was drunk also the fact that she did not know how to use the radio in her car. When we got on the freeway she started to cut people off and brake cheek them that is when I had to say when to turn etc. I was praying that a cop would pull us over because she did just endanger the life of the other drivers but my life too. When we were behind an 18 wheeler she was speeding towards at one of the last seconds I yelled stop where so slammed on the brakes avoiding the bumper by Maybe 5 inches by the best. this was one of the most terrifying parts because that is what I dreamed about in the late morning of the next day. what makes me madder is that it took 3 days to apologize and her clam is that

""all mom do it and that was my time I did it"" mom. 

what I was thinking in my head was not the same that came out of my mouth. Instead of saying maybe all mom do it but not to that level was substituted with it ok and yea it is fine in a very embarrassing way. and also one of the persons who were trying to make her stay she quoted by my mom saying 

""well \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ did it with her son""

I don't care that \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ did it with her son you should not have done it with me! and maybe you should have learned by her doing it with her son.

I'm still a tad fuzzy. Tad sniffly. Got some mucus in my throat. 
I got a lot done today at home. Hung out with my 7 month old all day. Did a ton of laundry. Played some cod. It was all just generally nice. 

My job sucks ass. Not the actual position, but the bosses. Of course. But they don't take this virus shit seriously. I called in this morning and they didn't ask 1 question, it was just ""ok see you tomorrow"". You'd think in times like this you'd show some concern, but nah. 

My job weasled it's way into the ""essential infrastructure"" category. We some some units to a hospital like 5 years ago. Did some military work as well, like 5 years ago. Boom, essential. 

They won't replace me, I'm one of their best employees. Haven't called in all year until today.

So the ""problem"" isn't him. It's my parents. I've told them he asked me but they see us moving in together a year or so from now. 

Some important things, I moved in with my dad and step mom the summer after senior year. Making me 45 minutes away from him. And even before this my stepmom would always find a way to keep him from visiting. She also seems peeved when I would go stay with him at his parents house. 

Something else, neither of us have ever lived on our own. I understand the experience is something you should have but it seems pointless and like a waste of money at this point. 

Basically I just want to know how I should tell them we're already looking for a place. I really just care about possibly hurting my dad. He doesn't wanna hold me back her was just so excited to finally have me living with him.",31Mar2020,1

When school was around I would drink water all day, eat the school lunch and come home and just wait for dinner and that would be it. My family isn't necessarily the healthiest, and I was able to avoid temptations by being at school all day, but now I drink soda all the time, eat half a pack of Oreos because I have lost self-control, and eat chips without thinking if they are in sight and within reach. I haven't necessarily reached an extremely high weight, but I notice that I'm starting to develop some unhealthy habits that are getting harder and harder to break.

174,"Hey Reddit, I'm just in need of some advice over something I can usually handle, only circumstances have made it slightly more difficult.  
For a few years now, my mum and I have not gotten on well at all. She blames my ex boyfriend and me. Everything I do/say is an issue. Due to this, we argue a lot. We both see things very differently and she has no filter whatsoever, and so says/does stuff which is often too far.    
As I've endured the arguing and anger, I've slowly learnt how to reduce the conflict. My time would always be spent at college, working or with friends/my boyfriend. Sure, she hated this as I'm hardly around, but it's better for all of us at home if I find ways to keep myself busy and out the picture. Well, the UK went on lockdown with immediate effect, while I was at home. 'It's only three weeks, how bad can it be?' I thought to myself. 

Well turns out, it can be pretty bad. My mum has decided to use this time to try and find out why I am the way I am towards her, and I won't go into detail here but anyone who knows what she can be like toward me knows why I'm distant. We had an argument today, I did my usual thing of isolating myself afterwards and I thought that would be the end of that. It carried on all day and night, to the point where her and my stepdad came down to argue with me when I was just getting a drink. My mum made me do a full reset on my phone and give it to her, even though I pay for it. 

During the argument, my stepdad told me I need to leave, to which my mum agreed. They're completely aware of the situation in the world right now, and I think they said it to prove how disposable I am. Thing is, usually I would just leave. I know how my family feel about me, plus I suffer with bad anxiety and depression (both diagnosed) so getting out the atmosphere is better for me, otherwise I relapse into very unhealthy coping mechanisms. My mental health is already less than good due to isolation. It's not so easy to do leave right now. Travel is still running, and you can travel for essential reasons. My friends are all saying that my reason is enough, but I'm not sure if it's worth the risk.   
If I were to travel, I'd be going to my boyfriends house where he lives alone and isn't a high risk individual, and I would be isolating there the way I have been at home. 

Do you guys think it's worth the risk? Is my reason essential enough to justify travelling? If no, what would you advise I do with the situation at home?",31Mar2020,1
175," It has been two years since I took the SAT, which I got a 1530 on. I'm not happy with the 1530 since I wanted a 1600. The area that I struggled in was reading, on which I got 11 wrong. On writing, I got 1 wrong. I missed none on the math sections. I don't understand why I'm so bad at reading, and I worked so hard to get a perfect score on it. Meanwhile, there are many others who can easily outscore me on the reading section getting 1600s, so there has to be some IQ/intelligence component. It's not fair at all.

177,"To give you a brief background, I grew up in a home where my step father was emotionally and physically abusive. He was also an alcoholic.  He used to get super aggressive with me for no reason, either a bad day at work or simply just intoxicated. I still vividly remember the anger I could see in his eyes when he got angry, it terrified me. 

Recently, I moved into a house for a month with 4 people. We are basically stranded somewhere during the epidemic and decided it would be safer to hunker down in a house for a month. It turns out one of the housemates is extremely aggressive and controlling, he‚Äôs more so like this with me than any of the other housemates (for reference, he‚Äôs 40 and I‚Äôm 35F). I perhaps think it‚Äôs because we bonded a little more than the others? We had a disagreement (I can promise you that I didn‚Äôt my absolute best not to provoke him) and he got exceptionally angry, raised his voice and started swearing in my face. The look of anger in his eyes reminded me of my step dad and it was a huge trigger for me. My heart started racing and I had to leave the table. I was in my room hearing him shout - it brought me right back to my childhood and I was in a complete state of emotional breakdown. This ended up happening later that day again, with him shouting and raising his voice. In addition to his growing temper, his small actions (such as telling me to put my phone away when we are watching a movie) make me realize how controlling he is, and we are only a few days in so I assume it‚Äôs only going to get worse. 

Without going into further detail, I‚Äôm doing my best in life to work on inner healing and not run away from challenges. I‚Äôm wondering in terms of people‚Äôs emotional triggers, will they ever go away or is it just that we have to completely avoid what triggers us? 

It‚Äôs unfortunate I didn‚Äôt see this side of him until we moved in together, and I do understand this is a time of severe stress for everyone.
I don‚Äôt believe he would ever be physically abusive (at least I hope not), but the look in his eyes was haunting for me - it truly took me back to my childhood where I felt scared for my safety. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do at this point, try to work things out and work on my triggers (if it‚Äôs even possible) or be willing to lose $500 on the house payment and find a safer-feeling space on my own?

I‚Äôm curious to hear from other people with similar triggers and how you deal with them. TIA!",31Mar2020,1

202,"I am a student at a large university in Colorado. I live off campus in a three-bedroom unit in a building which is owned by a private landlord. Here is our situation:

My roommate and I are having problems with our third roommate, named ""P"". On Monday March 30th, we spoke with P about the current shelter in place executive order from Governor Polis (link below). She had been bringing multiple guests over to our apartment and traveling back and forth from our apartment to her boyfriend‚Äôs house despite it being against the current law. We told her that she needs to stop doing so because it is not only illegal but also puts our health in danger given the current situation. At this roommate meeting, she refused to comply. We informed our landlord our her refusal to obey the law, and our landlord reached out to all of us and our guarantors informing us that we must obey the executive order. P and her guarantor reached out to the landlord and told her that P would comply to the executive order. 

However, P is currently not on the premises, and we suspect that she is actively non-compliant. She was absent from the apartment from approximately 4-9 pm on March 30th, then returned to the apartment for about 10 minutes around 9 pm, then left the premises again. 

Ideally, we would like for our landlord to remove P from the lease. We believe she is actively lying to our landlord and to us. She is knowingly breaking the law and putting us in danger by doing so. She has a history of unpredictable violent outbursts, including striking a dog and punching a friend. We no longer feel safe in our apartment. What can we do?

We have contacted the free legal services provided by our university but have not heard back yet.

Going to our parents' homes is not an option for me and my compliant roommate. My parents both work in a \~very\~ large hospital. My roommate's mother is pregnant and for her to return home would pose a great risk to her pregnant mother.

205,"My mother has always been one to look for deals, at the shops, garage sales, and more recently on Craigslist and Groupon. If it seems like a deal, she's going to buy it, whether or not she or anyone she knows really needs it. 

Despite several hints from myself, my siblings and my father, she continues to buy and collect 'gifts' under the guise that so-and-so could use them. She never buys anything new and never for herself. Sometimes the intended gift ends up in the possession of the recipient's hands, but more often than not it ends up taking up space in the garage. My father and siblings have expressed concern, but they seem reluctant to confront her about it outright. My father in particular wants to clear out the attic and garage of all the collected junk, but we're both worried the situation won't be truly resolved unless she recognizes the issue personally.

To be clear, the situation isn't as bad as you'd see on Hoarders. The inside of the house is generally kept clean and tidy, but with both my parents in post-retirement age, it might become a bigger issue in the years to come.

They‚Äôve always offered for me to hang out with them and I definitely have tried to enjoy hanging with our group. It‚Äôs just hard when I‚Äôm the odd one out. I tend to watch YouTube with one headphone in or read a book while they‚Äôre having a good time. I‚Äôll try and join in the conversation, but since it‚Äôs about the game, I can‚Äôt do much other than ask a few questions before they move on to another topic.

I want them to be able to enjoy themselves, but I also want to be able to spend time with the group without feeling left out. I don‚Äôt want to sit alone in my room while they all spend time together, especially when we‚Äôre already isolating from our other friends. This tends to be the only time we all are together, so I don‚Äôt want to miss it.

What can I do to feel more like I‚Äôm a part of the group? Any advice on how to feel more comfortable in this, outside of just giving in and buying the game?",31Mar2020,1
211,"I‚Äôve been best friends with her since middle school and we all had a lot of fun times together in our friend group and since then I have become really close with her. We box and go to the same gym together to train we have gotten close to other people as well and especially with her it‚Äôs with my sister. At first I don‚Äôt mind them to being friends since we will all be seeing each other technically every single day but they started going to a another gym together to work out and since I‚Äôm not big on lifting weights and such I didn‚Äôt really join them and plus I can‚Äôt even if I wanted too since my sister is going from my best friend‚Äôs guest pass. After a while they have gotten really close. Always face timing together(which she never ever did with me), making plans, sharing about things that she would usually share with me. She‚Äôs leaving me out on everything. It makes me upset and sad sometimes seeing them getting along so well. My sister doesn‚Äôt notice anything even though I clearly look sad and talked about it before she just continues and don‚Äôt care. I even told about all this to my friend too and for a short while everything will be back to normal but then it all repeats. I don‚Äôt know how what to do.

212,"So back when I first graduated from high school I got super into making YouTube videos. I made mostly lets plays and every once in a while I would make a small skit video. One day I made a Fallout 4 video where I put a anime character in the game and played how I figured they would react. But after I posted it I realized I had high amounts of creation regret and then slowly stopped making videos. Every now and then I would get get on the channel and check to see how it was doing. Most of my videos still have zero views or maybe one or two. Except for that one Fallout video. For some reason it to this day gets a good amount of views. No idea why I really really hate it. But all the comments in the video are asking for a part two. I got back into making videos for a month or two about a year ago and they got some views but nothing like my Fallout video. I'm considering making a part two after all this time but don't feel I can ever make it to the level I will like it.

213,"I am not sure why she stays at our house, she has a home of her own and whatnot and to make things worse she brings her 9 year old son, she keeps coughing every once and a while and i am genuinely scared because theres a chance she might have covid19. There are about 38 confirmed cases in my area and i hope this woman does not have the virus because i am sharing the same house with her for days. Why my parents would allow someone else to stay with us in a time like this is beyond me, this woman is sleeping upstairs next to my room and i hear coughing every once in a while, I don‚Äôt know if she has other symptoms because i spent 2 days already locked in my room hoping she would leave at some point, I don‚Äôt feel safe and if i tell my parents they are just gonna say i am being paranoid. I try my best to stay in my room at all costs but when it‚Äôs time to eat i have to share a table with her and she uses the same utensils as we do, she even helps my mom cook, shes nice and all but I don‚Äôt want her here, i wash my hands whenever i leave my room or whenever i feel like i touched something I shouldn‚Äôt.

214,"Most times I try to comfort people and be optimistic I feel fake deep down inside. I want to be realistic and I don't think that just believing is enough so I'd rather look at the positives. I'm coming to this conclusion because during this crisis I'm kinda having a ball pointing out to myself the unsafe practices people around me are carrying out by being up and about when everyone should be inside/at home if they don't need to go out.

I'm looking at the cases and she its a large number but can't help but feel a bit of enthusiasm knowing that its gonna spread rapidly at this rate. I think I developed this because I come from a fucked up family where no one will ever admit their mistakes. So I value watching people fail when they don't listen to me more than actually getting my point across. 

I guess I can't be optimistic because it seems like I rarely get any payoff from things I put effort into and watching people fail at not listening to me is the only thing I've ever really known to feel like an accomplishments.",31Mar2020,1
216,"I have this friend, we've known each other for a long time, and at one point i considered her my best friend. But, she is not nice to me.

217,"I'm 35 yrs old unmarried, nepali (newar) guy living with my mother. My father recently passed away due to cancer. I studied in Southern part of India, and now I'm trying to build my career in IT field. I worked in different field earlier due to lack of opportunity in IT company, because I was not a brilliant guy in studies. I am working in the IT company for over a year now, still haven't done good in programming, kids joining the company after me moved up quickly and I am stuck where I was from the beginning. And I'm not making good money. I'm little frustrated.

I am a shy guy, didn't have lot of friends but I have a girlfriend, she's still studying. My mom and everyone want me to get married the next day they see me, keep asking me about my girlfriend if she's reliable or if she will marry me. I sat with my family and told them calmly that she's still studying and we can talk about all this after her studies. but no, the little minded people keep talking same and they want to get assurance from her parents too. Now, because of my dad's death, I got a year to postpone this marriage talks. I talked to my girl about this, but she wanted to work a while after her studies, build a career before marriage. it is really difficult for married-Nepali-Newar girl to build her career. Even it's getting difficult for me to grow my own career because of so many newari rituals and all - guthi, festivals and so many things that I've to take leave from my work.

The thing is I'm tired of living with my mom, listening to her. I didn't like the way she talks since my early adulthood, I always tried to move away. I don't like my neighborhood either, in fact I don't like the community as a whole, the way people talk about each other, the way people talk as if they knew everything, the politics and everything. But being Nepali/ newari youngest son, I've to look after my widowed-single mom. My mom is illiterate-and doesn't have a job. My two older brothers left house many years ago because of my mom's arrogance, they are settled in their own now, visit us sometimes during festivals and so. Even in those short visits my mom can't stand my ""bhaujus"" - sister-in-laws. It is impossible that my mom will settle with my brothers.

I'm so frustrated, I can see the future where I am unable to balance between my wife and my mom in the future. I don't know what to do with my life. Can't leave widowed single mom, can't live in this community happily. And I'm not doing great in career as well.",31Mar2020,1

220,"So I knew this guy, who we'll call Joe for now. Me and Joe had met each other back in August and we've been talking for months. Usually we'd DM each other using our Instagram accounts, since me and him are pretty busy after school and don't share any classes. 

On February 16 we were chatting at night and we were exchanging memes and shit. I told him a dark joke about cannibalism and he seemed to be pretty ok with it, but apparently one of his parents looked over his shoulder and saw what I sent, and forced him to block my account and to not associate with me.

A couple days later a rumor had spread about him and I got blamed for spreading it when I wasn't the one who did. Someone told me the rumor at school to me and a bunch of people but I didn't say anything. All I know is that later that day his girlfriend got mad at me and another one of my friends told me that Joe's life is bad now and that he's getting depressed over it.

I decided that the best course of action was to just not try to talk to Joe for a while, and I wanted to say something to him at school, but they had closed down due to covid 19. I have a spam account (which doesn't feature me or anything about me) which I thought about talking to him through. I haven't decided whether it's worth it to do this. Should I try to contact him again?

TL;DR: made a dark joke to a friend, friend's parents got angry with him and forced them to block/stop associating with me, I get blamed for a rumor about him which apparently ruined his life.",31Mar2020,1
221,"I'm a 15 year old, I'm going to turn 16 this May. Recently, school and my friends have been talking about what they are going to do in the future. I come from a big family, being the youngest of 5 and my mom being a single parent, we won't have our colleges paid for us. I have a pretty good GPA, it's a 4.0 and has been for the last 3 years- it might even be higher if I can keep my A in AP Euro. I'm going to go to study in Switzerland next year (if the Coronavirus doesn't stop me) through the Rotary Club. So, my will be academics pretty good. 

My mom really wants me to go to Stanford; all students who's parents make under a certain amount will have their tuition paid for. I would qualify for that grossly. But the thing is, I don't really want to go to Stanford. I just don't think I could do it, and I don't want to set my hopes too high just to have them shattered. As everyone knows, college is expensive, my mom just finished paying off student debt loans- and she's turning 50 this year. Not just that, she only went to college for 2/3 years, but stopped because she had children. I could go to a community college and apply for financial aid, actually getting paid to go to college. The thing is, I've been thinking about studying something in science, and I don't think community college is best for that. I'd like to go to a university. 

My family also has a long history in the military. My great grandfather fought in the Imperial German Army, all of my mom's side fought as sailors in WW2, my uncle served in the navy for 8 years, my grandfather was an engineer in Vietnam, and I just learned that my family even fought in the Spanish-American War; our military history is reaches far. One of my closest friends has been talking about joining the military recently too. He even showed me an article that said you could enlist with one of your friends and do boot camp together. I've also always wanted to do something bigger than myself and I keep hearing drill sergeants say that the military is the best place to do just that.

So, my question is, should I just try to go to college? Should I just join the military and then go to college? Should I go to college a few years and then if I can't pick a specific major then join the military and have my college tuition paid off by the government? One of my thoughts is, I could just join the military when I'm 18, and then get out around 22/23, which is a bit late to start college, but it's not awful. And I feel like that would be something that would look good on an application for a college. I don't know though, maybe I'm missing something. If I've misunderstood how the military works or college or just life in general, please correct me.

226,"Hi all, so about a year ago I flirted with this guy. We exchanged pictures, and soon after became best friends. I would like to remind you guys that there was no sex, or intimacy that took place. Just pictures were sent. About a day ago his friend messaged me saying that the guy I befriended no longer wanted me to be around, that I was manipulator and a user as well as someone who had sex with him as well as tried to kiss him in public. Due to these accusations I went straight to the guy, and he admitted that none of those things happened. Afterwards I sent the text to his friend that he lied too, and his friend basically said THAT I threatened him to say those things and he had a recording of me. But none of that was true. Basically he went back and forth lying to his own friend and I about my character and I‚Äôm completely hurt over it. Next came my nudes, he posted them in my DMs saying if he even told anyone that we had sex that no one would believe me because he clearly has nudes of me. However his friend then stated that since I made a threat to get the cops involved that I would be taken to court. Yet.. Considering the guy never did anything to me other than lie about who I was why would I need to get the police involved. If we both agreed to the fact that he did not touch me, rape me, or hurt me then how could it be possible that we had sex. On top of this he never gave me a clear time and day of any of this happening, he just stated that we had sex. His friend then made me download a snap chat so we could get to the truth and I told him everything. That nothing sexual happened. He then added on that because he showed an interest in me that his friend that he had intercourse with me JUST to ensure his friend would not come on to me. Sounds like complete jealously. The very next day I was blocked by his friend, but not blocked by the guy I befriended. I‚Äôm not really sure what they are planning to do with the pictures. I had a major panic attack and spammed the hell out of the guys phone. I really don‚Äôt need the stress, I get it it‚Äôs my fault for sending those pictures but this happened SO long ago. I feel so defeated that someone I befriended decided to tell lies about me then share pictures without my consent. I most likely can‚Äôt do anything, but it still hurts to know that my pictures will possibly be leaked. I made everything private including my Instagram and my Facebook. I sent messages to the guy on Instagram he‚Äôs seen them and has yet to reply on why he would lie to me like this and make me feel so out of place. I don‚Äôt understand why the police were brought up if both of us didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. We are both adults but this entire situation sucks. I‚Äôm still panicking I have way too much anxiety to be dealing with this, and I even got a little suicidal because I wouldn‚Äôt want myself to be exposed on school or on social media. School is kind of hard now because we are quarantined but I‚Äôve been deleting social media then downloading it to see if anyone has seen anything or if he messages me.

230,"Hi! Before I start, I know none of us know what his true intentions were except for him and unless I ask. I just wanted to know what you guys think.

We‚Äôve been friends for 3 years. We met my freshman year of college and it was obvious he wanted to get to know me from the beginning. Long story short he became my first kiss, later got mad at him because he got hickies from another girl, he apologized, I initiated the talk about what his intentions were and he said he didn‚Äôt want a relationship at the time. We left off on good terms and remained good friends. Sophomore year happened, he made the effort to hangout here and there but we never hooked up or anything.

Summer going into this school year was when things started to change. We began to snap a lot and he tagged me in a lot of things on Facebook. When school started, he immediately asked to hang out with him which then became a consistent thing throughout the school year. He would always pay for my coffee, always try to hold my hand, cook for me (specifically bought me steak cause I asked for it), bought wine, asked to go to the city and FaceTime over winter break. We were at 2 parties together and he would always stay by my side and try to get with me which was unusual because the past 2 years he would be hooking up with other girls. One of those parties I was dancing pretty close with another guy and I knew he was mad but just didn‚Äôt say anything. He remembered my birthday and bought a bottle to my party after I jokingly asked for one too. I got kinda touchy with some of his friends cause I was so drunk and one of his friends the next day told me he looked stressed when I did that.

Anyways, because of the coronavirus, our classes got moved to online. He asked to hang out with me the last day of college because he said ‚Äúthis might be the last time I see your face.‚Äù Once again, he pays for my coffee and holds my hand. We then go back to my room and we cuddle for a little bit. Finally he asks if I wanted him to kiss me and I say no. He asks why and I said I‚Äôm really nervous and bad at this stuff (I have no experience lmao). He ensures me that it‚Äôs fine but I say only on the cheek. So he basically kisses me cheek and goes for my neck and we then cuddle for 2 hours. Later that same night, I go to the bar with friends and I get a text from him saying he‚Äôs coming. I dance with my guy friends and then I see him hooking up with another girl.

I‚Äôm confused; did he just put all this effort throughout the year to just hookup with me? Or was he actually trying for a relationship? He has never had a girlfriend before if that makes a difference. What do you think?",31Mar2020,1

Worded more officially, my question is: What methods have you used successfully, or heard of being used successfully, that quickly give financial stability for a brief period of time? The conditions are listed below:
-Can begin earning in a month or less
-Can earn at least $2,000/mo
-Is reasonably stable for at least 3 months
-Has to be done in Florida

Assume I'm able to do whatever it is. I learned to ride a unicycle and juggle one summer just because. I've flipped bikes. I have an aerospace engineering degree. I'm motivated and open to anything.

236,"This might not be the most entertaining post, but I've been really torn thinking this over for months. Some background ! I'm a sophomore in high school right now. My school is quite rigorous. I'm shooting for MIT (I know it's unrealistic but I'd at least like to have this one dream!!), so I know I need to challenge myself and do well. 

This year, I took AP Calc AB and AP Statistics at my school. Both are taught by the same teacher, a new teacher. It's been horrible. She's a terrible teacher, gives insane workloads, and is very dismissive whenever students bring up complaints. Having her classes has been an incredible detriment to my mental health over the past months, to the point where I just don't do any of the assignments, because of how stressful it is (I'm a straight A student, I used to rarely miss assignments). 

Next year I know I want to take more math classes, but I'm torn between taking AP calc BC at my high school or PSEO (post-secondary enrollment options, basically a program that allows me to take classes at the local college) the equivalent class(es) at a local community college. At this point you may worry that college classes will be more stressful. Many people at my school do PSEO at this college I'm looking at and find it much easier than the classes at my school, so I'm not overly worried about that aspect. What I'm worried about is more that I've been told that colleges value AP classes more over PSEO classes, since it's more standardized. I also have a few other worries, so I'll just include a table of pros and cons I can think of.

238,"Tw: sexual assault 

Something happened to me a few weeks ago. I haven't told many people and I dont really know how I even feel about it so I guess I'm looking to see what other people make of it.

For the last few months I've been sexting with one of my bosses at work. I know the moral and ethical ambiguity of this but I figure mentioning the power dynamic is important. Weve gotten drinks a few times and made out but nothing further. 

The last time I saw him he offered to get us a hotel room. I agreed. There was no discussion of protection, and I know I'm dumb for not having anything on me (I'm on birth control and have since gotten tested). Halfway through having sex he just grabbed me and said ""I'm going to fuck that ass"". And then just...did 

I'd never done anal before. I had in fact told him in our previous conversations (which I have screenshots of) that it wasnt something I was interested in doing. But when it was happening i just froze up, to be honest i was just in complete shock. Once he was already doing it he asked if I was ok to which I replied yes. And tbh I dont know why I said it, I guess since it was already happening I was like yeah I guess this is ok? Which is why I know I have no legitimate leg to stand on here. But I really think he should have asked first. I would have said no for multiple reasons, not the least of which is because we weren't using protection.

When I spoke to him the next day I mentioned the anal had been ""unexpected"". To which he replied saying ""hey I always said I was going to do it!"". Which isnt true, we had never sexted about anal and also I dont think even if we had that that equals consent.

Once it was going on I feel like I just froze up and accepted it was happening but in the days and weeks since it's really been playing on my mind and been upsetting me. Like I dont get it, I'm a strong outspoken woman, I've never been afraid to tell a man no, I don't know why I didnt say anything and its messing with me.

241,"So I‚Äôm pretty into this girl and I can‚Äôt tell if she feels the same way about me or is playing me or something. Like some days we‚Äôll talk all the way through the night and Snapchat a ton and it‚Äôll be great but then the next day it‚Äôll be completely silent on her end and I‚Äôll think, ‚ÄúOh she‚Äôs just not interested I guess.‚Äù And I‚Äôll try to move on but then the very next day we‚Äôll go right back to the super awesome flirting and constant talking. This process constantly repeats with it sometimes being days at a time of flirting and days at a time of silence. 

Another thing that happened recently is we were talking late into the night and we were both under the influence and she sent me nudes. She was saying that she accidentally sent them but my friends think that she did it on purpose. I don‚Äôt know if that changes anything but she‚Äôs been acting different since then. Sorry if this sounds douche-y or incel-y I just have no clue if she‚Äôs into me or not and I just really need some advice.",31Mar2020,1
243,My family got a foreign exchange student from Italy. We bonded really quickly and have been jamming since she got here mid-August. She was supposed to stay until late April/early May but thanks to COVID-19 and international flights possibly shutting down when she was supposed to leave she's leaving EARLY tomorrow morning. I wrote her a letter and put it in her suitcase to find when she gets back. But I'm still emotionally crushed. I need advice for sadness.,31Mar2020,1
244,"Last night, my bed which is an inflated matress, broke. I slept on the floor instead and today I went to buy a bed. This bed is also an inflatable. The problem with it is it is made of a flammable vinyl material. This material is off gasing a lot and the fumes only further accentuate my being disoriented from lack of sleep.

I have a few close friends that I‚Äôm comfortable texting and more people that I casually hang out with, but it seems like they all have more friends than I do or more people to talk to consistently than I do and it eats away at me. 

I‚Äôm also pretty bad at reaching out to people first- I tend to make snap judgments and decide if I think someone and I will get along, but I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs more out of me being selective or actually being intuitive as to who‚Äôs right for me.

246,"It‚Äôs been 4 months since my breakup with my 3 year long relationship. She moved on after 2 weeks and it lasted for 3 months that relationship. She told me about what she did with him. When we would speak on the phone. 

(Her cousin lied to me about some info so I just confronted her about it because the pain was still fresh at the time. Also her cousin lies to me about a lot of things to get me to hate my ex so I just needed to confirm things. That‚Äôs why I was asking to begin with). 

Anyways, I assume weeks later they most likely had sex after she told me about some foreplay kinda stuff. Really didn‚Äôt want to know about it. She just kinda admitted to what she did and didn‚Äôt do. Really didn‚Äôt need that. 

So my big question is, though her cousin lied, and yes she was intimate with him, why the hell is it still bothering me? Yes I know it was none of my business because we broke up. But I still love her. And I just don‚Äôt understand why it still bothers me. I‚Äôve been clearing this through and through. I act like it doesn‚Äôt bother me but like, he was my friend. Like she screwed my friend 2 weeks later. 

I feel kinda personally attacked by her actions but, seriously, It‚Äôs mind boggling how much this is bothering me again. How do I keep my thoughts from triggering such sick feelings of her being intimate with my friend? Like I dropped them both.",31Mar2020,1
247,"So a little back story: I (F18), like many others, have been struggling with isolation because COVID-19. I know others have lost a lot more than I but I still feel some need to vent and seek help beyond my usual support circle. I‚Äôm clinically diagnosed with anxiety and depression and have attended therapy multiple times so I knew this would be hard but I thought I could work around it. Before everything closed I bought a journal to keep myself occupied, started a new video game, made a list of TV shows and downloaded a home workout program all of which I still use to this day (two weeks in to quarantine) yet it‚Äôs all becoming seemingly futile. 

Now, for whatever reason I‚Äôm finding it impossible to want to keep in contact with my friends, my group is fairly social so we spend a lot of time on FaceTime, messaging, planning at home activities etc. but I no longer want to. I think it may be because I can‚Äôt seem to make them understand that this isolation is really putting me in a dark place because whenever I bring it up they say something along the lines of ‚Äúoh just try going on a run!‚Äù or ‚Äúpick up a hobby!‚Äù etc. and when I explain to them I have been and yet my mindset won‚Äôt improve the conversation just kind of dies (bare in mind I have no hard feelings against them I know they‚Äôre trying their hardest to help me)!!

This isolation has already taken my 18th birthday celebration from me, a trip with my best friend, seeing the play Hamilton live, my final staff party and is likely taking away my graduation, prom and upcoming concert of my favourite artist and I‚Äôm insanely worried that my own seemingly standoff-ish behaviour is going to cost me my friends and my boyfriend all of whom have been nothing but supportive yet I find myself drifting away from them anyways.

For others who once found themselves in a similar situation or just from anyone reading, what helped you maintain a positive mindset and your relationships when everything feels unimportant?

For most of my life I have wanted this career as I see officers as people who genuinely want to better their community by serving them. As I have grown older and been educated on policing, there are parts that are appealing and obviously parts that are not (police brutality for one Minor example). I know that our criminal justice system needs WORK and I have always envisioned bettering our system by being an officer that makes a genuine and positive difference in my community. 
As a Hispanic woman it is difficult of thinking of becoming an officer when I have not only learned in my classes, but seen in daily life how officers treat people of color.

266,"Background: I began learning guitar in 4th grade, but only during high school did I realize I have a passion for music. I joined band this school year (Grade 12), playing in both concert band (string bass) and jazz band (guitar). I have been accepted into university for chemistry but I want to switch to its music program. I primarily play jazz, classical, and rock/pop during my free time.

I realized that I want to spend my life doing music. I‚Äôve spent the past 3 years of high school questioning what I want to do in the future and I‚Äôve realized now that music is what makes me happy and I cannot just keep it as a hobby. I know for certain that I want a career in music. However, I am well aware that performing musician is a very difficult career. I‚Äôm not sure whether to study composition or teaching, but what I truly want is to perform and play concerts, whether with Symphonic bands or jazz bands or rock bands or whatever.
I wasn‚Äôt able to apply for auditions in time, and I‚Äôll have to wait until next year‚Äôs auditions to get my chance, but I still plan to take any music electives this year. When I saw the requirements for guitar, the expectations are high. What I‚Äôm concerned about is whether it is truly the best direction to take.
I‚Äôve read posts on the classical guitar subreddit that strongly caution this career path for its unfruitful market. I want to be a part of the music program because I feel that it would benefit me as a musician, but I am worried that it is hard work and dedication for a profession that lacks jobs.
I‚Äôm uncertain about what direction to take this career. Although I enjoy science and chemistry, music is what I absolutely want to do. I don‚Äôt know where I could work towards to make a career out of music.
To clarify, I don‚Äôt care too much about money or worldwide fame or anything like that. I‚Äôm happy with being able to support myself or just making my name known locally as long as I get to play music for a living.

267,"Hi guys.

I accidently found out how much my coworker (has the same role as me), is getting paid and it's more than me.

I have been in the role for a year longer than my coworker and I have taught them how to do the role, I'm more ""technology smart"" and we are basically matching very evenly in effort and going beyond our work roles. So we are pretty evened out.

One day, the coworker opened their pay slip infront of me and I saw how much they were getting paid an hour.

I didn't say anything and decided it would probably be best if I ask for a pay raise as well. 

My supervisor was happy to give me one but had to double check if he could, depending on what level I was, and if I was in the highest level (level 3) he could not give me a raise.

Turns out I'm in the highest level therefore he cannot give me a raise but now I'm confused as to why my coworker is getting paid more than me, for the same role. I am being honest when I say that we both go high and beyond with our roles and neither is better than the other, so I'm not sure what to think of this.

I can't go complain about it because revealing that I know how much my coworker is being paid looks really bad and also I believe it is illegal.

I feel just a little bit, silly? But I'm not sure if there is a logical explanation to this or if I'm being reasonable.

This is my first full time job out of high school so I'm still unsure how to approach pay rises, pay differences and concerns.

268,"About 5 months ago I experienced my first ever heartbreak. It was a 6 year relationship where we were engaged. 30 days before we were supposed to get married we broke up because of a fight. The fight wasnt huge or it wasnt anything unfixable but my ex said ""lets talk with other people and take a break"" the very next day she went out with her coworker who was there while she was hurting from the fight and 10 days later they fucked and started dating. Huge bullet dodged. After months she started regretting everything because it wasn't  working out with her fuckboy of a boyfriend. But that is besides the point its over now. Through the months I started noticing me becoming very cruel towards women. My ex deevalued me in every way when we were going through breakup and said how the new guy is pretty much better in everything which is nonsense because she later admitted  that she ""made her self believe that to move on"" anyway. After the breakup I became what I hated in the past. A fuckboy. Its so easy to get girls interested its laughable. I have had lots of one night stands and some short ""relationships"" which made me realize how shitty I have been treated by my ex and she was pretty much bad in everything. This to a point that I question if she ever did love me. These girls that I have been seeing have been more affectionate than she has ever been in 6 years towards me and what makes me mad is I dont understand why. I have done everything for that girl. Just so you know I met her online. She is from USA, I'm from Netherlands. So it was a semi-long distance  relationship where we would spend every vacation or break with eachother. And this was the year we would close the distance ah well. Anyway, I have noticed that despite pretty much every girl being better than my ex I don't treat them as I am supposed to. I actually treat them like garbage out of spite towards women. I know I feel like this because of the grudges I bear towards my ex. I have sex with them and whore out to validate my self because of the lies my ex told me. I know they are lies otherwise she wouldnt come crawling back. It just makes me angry that someone that I have treated so well could do this to me after so many memories and promises. My ex is failing in life in every way right now without me and Im honestly getting joy out of it. It was her choice and karma did the rest. I hate the man that I am right now because I have never been like this. I have always been deticated and full of love and smiles. But now everything seems so bland and I see my self become ""cruel"" towards good girls that dont deserve to be treated the way I am treating them. The whole love thing seems so stupid and fake.

269,"I feel like I need to mention that Im using a throwaway to prevent this situation from being traced back to me, or the people involved in it. That said, I am also going to try and keep the other people involved in this situation unknown as to not stir about any drama, where names would be used, Ill only use a letter where the name would be.

 That said it all starts a little over a year ago, With the situation happening at the start of the year months ago, So Ill try my best to summarize the events leading into this fallout.

I was 17 starting my final year of high school, Due to where I was living at the time my school had a very small number of people to fit in with, as a result I was a bit of an outcast in this place, I never really had anything in common with anyone so I tended to stay inside alone and not really talk with anyone outside my family. Our school was understaffed so as a way to provide the necessary courses for the few students here, we had to take online courses (A common practice for rural areas where I am)

I never was good at socializing with people, I was always the awkward one in every social situation, Never knew how to talk in a way that would make me fit in, So I always was anxious about talking around people.

Its not like I didnt try, but I was always so worried about being seen as a ""Weirdo"" as I was into Anime, Video Games, Dark Humor. Essentially: Things that didn't really catch the interest of people where Im from, Anime (for example) was generally frowned upon.

But starting online courses, I figured I could take a shot at making friends through these classes, as it was setup like a skype call every class and the program used allowed us to exchange social media accounts, well I came across this one person in my art class, and as a stroke of luck: They actually seemed really interested in what I wanted to talk about, The feeling of having someone to talk with, with no worry about coming across as ""Weird"" was such a surreal feeling to me. We clicked at that point and started talking almost on a daily basis. We will call her ""M""

""M"" and I lived a few miles apart and as things progressed, It turns out we were going to the same city for college. I felt relieved that I could possibly start what I percieved as a ""Normal social life"" one I percieved to be happy with very little drama.

I was wrong.

Beyond that point, Our friendship turned a little toxic at times and I tried everything to hold it together as I never had a friend I could confide in like I did with her, But the situations kept getting worse. It started with her getting frustrated at me for not facetiming her one night (I promised I would), to me getting pissed at her for trying to use my phone number to make her self a Tinder (Which I eventually gave in and let her use it because I was so worried about losing her as a friend.) 

It came to a point where I was bending over backwards for her to make this last, I constantly tried to talk things out but she would just leave me on read during times when things were sour. 

Having turned my life around at the time, Fueled by the confidence that things would be happy for me once I got to college I proceeded to become more involved with my towns small knit community and tried to help people where I could.

Then one day while I was working, ""M"" messaged me out of the blue saying she had enough, that I was no longer the guy she knew, that I was nothing but pain to talk to ""So it was best she cuts me off while she can"" Beyond that point, I fell into a deep slump never really told anyone about it as I figured they would say the same thing my parents did when they heard about it ""She's just a girl you met online""

I understood what they meant, but even then the fact that she was a girl had no impact on how much it meant to me at the time to have a friend

Well, people took a quick notice to how I was. I stopped volunteering around my community, I stopped doing the things I loved doing. I essentially slept, work, ate, repeat at that point. A few people took notice at the time and got her name out of me, to approach this girl and ask what the hell happened. One of these people was my cousin of whom I trusted alot (We will call him L) 

I don't know what happened between the two as its all up in the air at this point as to who is lying but at the time. ""M"" actually added me back just to tell me that she met my cousin, that she was much happier talking to him then she was me. ""He was everything I couldnt be""

Well, Some context on ""L""... he at the time was 28 and married with a family. So sure to say I was a bit perplexed on what she meant.

It turns out they in under a week formed what she described as a ""Very naughty relationship"" but I always found it weird she never referred to him hy name, She just called him by his username. Out of curiousity I asked her if she even knew his name 

""Of course I do its G""

No. It wasnt.

He faked an alias and exploited this girl, So (naturally) not wanting this I told her to stop talking with him, he is not safe.

""I think I will, he's more entertaining then you""

I completely took my self off social media for a while after that, I was just so conflicted on the situation. But nothing I could do would fix it.

Cut forwards to college, I at the time was helping out someone from my town who was attending the same college as me unpack. Then they nonchalantly asked if I was still friends with ""M"" 

No. I wasnt

They sat down and listened to me describe the story, To which they told me that they were still friends with ""M"" at the time. They actually met up with M earlier that day, They asked if I wanted to see if I could make amends.

Well, Of course I did. So, they arranged to have me and her meet. I apologized for my part in the situations we had and asked for forgiveness. In the moment I felt like I finally had a foothold in getting this together again. Nope, told me to fuck off through the person who had us meet later on text.

Well, I at that point just gave up. I wasnt about to fight a losing battle and just get more hurt over the situation. I went to look for more friends beyond that, and would luck have it I actually was able to stumble upon what I assumed at the time was a group accepting of who I am. I finally got level headed and was able to live normally with the group of friends I had. 

I along the way met two girls...

""K"" Which was a girl whom I met on Tinder, She stood me up for a few dates (Her sister is sick, Her back hurts, Etc) it became a repeated pattern, now I never got mad at the situation, I simply said I was not going to try and pursue a date/relationship if she wasnt going to put effort in on her part. We agreed to stay as friends from there on, She would come to me when ever she had issues as I did with her (Stress, Work, etc) 

""B"" was someone I met on a facebook group, She was stressing out about not being able to find friends (The page was for making new friends) so I reached out and wondered if she'd be up to hang out sometime with my group of friends. Within that day, we made plans, got to know each other, then I was blocked. I was worried if I said something that upset her, so a week later I was passing through the campus and ran into her. I apologized if anything I did offended her and moved on with my day. Later that day she took to social media to call me a creep, fortunately people who knew who I was at the time and knew the situation between us two stepped in and halted that issue before it got out of hand.

Few months pass, and life proceeds seemingly as normal. Havent talked to M or B since the start of the semester,  Me and K were still friends. It was the start of 2020 at the time and I went out and bought all my friends gifts at the time (Late Christmas Gifts) as my way to say thanks for everything they did for me over the months. It was on that night though, I was drinking hard liquor as part of a drinking game. Shot after shot after shot. It came to me during a conversation, that ""M"" actually was friends with a large portion of my friend group which had grown to be about 14 people, I was so shocked at this, even more so when they said they were approached by her firstly and many of them had pictures of the times they hung out (I thought they were fucking with me since they knew I had a troubled past with her, but nope... They were there)

I at the time didnt know how to act, I felt stabbed at the fact that anyone could seemingly be her friend. But in her eyes, I was not worth her time. I messaged ""K"" saying ""Im sorry If I do anything stupid"" and that was that, I went home and tried to take my own life.

In hindsight, absolutely stupid to do so over one person. Fortunately, I survived and was admitted to the hospital, ""K"" knew something was up and contacted the hospital before anything could happen

As I was in the hospital, guess who makes contact with me? 

M. Fucking M.

But they never said anything, just added me back, said ""Hey"" then left me read every time I tried to talk to her, screenshotting occasionally.

""K"" then messaged me and lost her shit at me, saying I was a piece of shit for bringing a girl through so much pain, That they had intentions to ""press charges""

Wtf?

My friend group (Who was initially very supportive at the time) was offering to talk to me about what was going on, as I left them in the dark about what happened when I went home, and why I was suddenly in the hospital. So, I turned to someone whom I thought was my closest friend and simply told him what happened.

It was that same night, that everyone that was part of that friend group left me almost instantaneously. Blocked with no hopes of reaching out to them through media. 

The one friend I still had contact with I went to and asked ""Wtf is going on"" and they sent back a message which essentially said ""We can't be risking our reputations to be seen with you"" and like that I was blocked from talking to them again.

I was friends with them for nearly half a year, I was there for them whenever I could be, but they dissapeared when I needed them.

Remember ""B"" from before? Well, she took to social media to spread the word about me being a guy who is (and I wish I was kidding) ""Sexually assaulting people on campus, stay away from him"" 

I knew this girl for a day, and unknown to me, the three of them were friends. So when it came to me they all sided against me to state I was someone I wasnt. I went to the police with photo/screenshot evidence of everything that has transpired and they all told me the same thing ""There are no threats so there is nothing they can do""

I let the situation die down for roughly 2 months, then went ahead and tried to find a new friend group to fit in with. One that would hopefully last...

Well, As soon as word reached them that I was out looking for friends again, they all took to social media once again to state that this time...

I am a rapist

How could I possibly rape anyone? Im still a virgin and have been shut in since my hospitalization (Where I was diagnosed with Depression, Anxiety, and Bipolar) 

Irregardless of the evidence I could provide in my case, I was at odds as it was 3 against 1 and just like that... the new friends I found wanted nothing to do with me.

I have since then been recieving death threats (Which the cops wont do anything about I already tried) and haven't been able to go anywhere, where I would be recognized. 

My life has been like this for a few weeks, and I just wonder: Am I at fault for being so invested in a friendship that wasnt meant to last? Am I at fault for not being able to control myself that one night?

What do I do to get out of this? How can I make friends when I have this group of people shutting down every attempt I make months after the initial fallout?

TL:DR - Made a friend out of years of not fitting in, tried desperately to keep the friendship afloat but as things fell apart, so did my mental health, chasing away the big group of friends I found over it. Attempts to make new friends proves pointless as people interfere with false accusations on social media as soon as I try. Police refuse to do anything.",31Mar2020,1
272,"The past 12 months have been the absolute worst of my life. I lost my two best friends and basically everyone I knew in college chose them over me, so I lost all my friends. One of those best friends was the guy I loved most in the world. 

His girlfriend hates me and made him block me but he still did it and chose her over me. They‚Äôve been dating for less than a year and they‚Äôre engaged, live together and have a dog together. Years of him leading me on and going back and forth about commuting to me while he can commit to her so easily, makes me realize how little feelings he had in the first place. 

I moved apartments and my apartment got bed bugs. I was dating a guy right before coronavirus and that ended a couple weeks ago. My job gave me a promotion and took it back due to coronavirus leading to a dramatic loss of sales for our company. My dad is high risk and has diabetes and has to go to work everyday because he works in a pharmacy, so I‚Äôm stressed out about him. 

I need advice and just to talk to someone. Every day feels harder to move through. I‚Äôm trying to move to San Diego at the end of the year and that‚Äôs the only thing getting me through.

274,"Hey there. First time posting on this sub, and I‚Äôm using an throwaway because I don‚Äôt want this attached to my account.

So. I (17 M) have been dating my girlfriend (16 F) for about three months at this point. She has very severe chronic anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, and PTSD, none of which she‚Äôs seeking therapy or medication for despite my gentle encouragement. That, however, I‚Äôm fine with; though I wish she‚Äôd seek help, I understand her reasoning and I think she can overcome these issues on her own with enough time and love. I hope, anyways.

That‚Äôs not why I‚Äôm posting, though. She‚Äôs been having stomach troubles for a little over a year now, but fairly basic stuff. Mild discomfort on and off, filling up relatively quickly, occasional constipation, that sort of stuff. She‚Äôs taken a stool test which came back negative, so that leaves two possible culprits: irritable bowel syndrome, which runs in her family and is very severe in her mother, and ovarian cancer.

The problem lies in the latter of the two. Despite not being tested for ovarian cancer (she has a fear of needles and won‚Äôt get a blood test, just the thought makes her woozy), she‚Äôs absolutely certain she has cancer and that having it for only a year means it‚Äôs spread throughout her entire abdomen. It‚Äôs one thing for her to just think that, sure, but the way she‚Äôs talking scares me. She says that if she has cancer, she can‚Äôt deal with it, won‚Äôt deal with it, and ‚Äúwill kill [herself] before the cancer can.‚Äù Obviously, any talk of suicide isn‚Äôt okay, but I can‚Äôt seem to talk her down from it.

How can I convince her, gently, that it‚Äôll be okay no matter what she has and that treatment isn‚Äôt as scary as she thinks? My number one priority is getting her to back off the ledge right now, after that I‚Äôm comfortable with her (reasonably) taking her time. I just want her to take the test so she can really know what‚Äôs happening and relax a bit...

TL;DR: my girlfriend thinks she has ovarian cancer and is saying she‚Äôll kill herself if she really does.",31Mar2020,1

294,"I'm pretty young but it's still stinging me good after like 6 months. I was in a 2 year relationship with a girl and in the end she cheated on me, lead me on and treated me like garbage.

 Throughout our relationship she was really good (mostly) to me and very faithful. She was a great girlfriend and honestly I never expected her to be so cold and overall disgusting as a human especially after 2 years with her. She immediately slept with a few guys after we broke up and spread lies about me. I like to say I was a great boyfriend. I wasn't abusive in any way, and treated her like a princess. 

The biggest problem was she often was angry at me for nothing and I wasn't allowed to have friends. She would get mad over me being with my friends, almost resentful and depressed.

A few things to note.
 Once I smoked weed (like 2 hits) with a coworker after work and she was furious for months about it. Later, she smoked weed with a friend and I was accepting towards it but mentioned to her how she shouldn't be mad about me doing it if she can. 

Now I have OCD (I'm diagnosed now) and I have tattoozophobia. Tattoos give me extreme discomfort and make me feel sick and panicked. Well that same day she got a tattoo and hid it from me for a few weeks. I was hurt she didn't tell me but I was nice and open to trying to get over my fears. I tried and once stopped during sex cuz it was too uncomfortable. Other than that (before and after it) sex was perfect. 

Once I went out with a friend (one of the 3 times I did over the 2 years we dated) and my phone died. She was furious with me, started cutting and wouldn't talk to me because I wasn't avidly talking with her. I was nice to her and felt bad about it. I felt horrible. 

Those were some of the worst times we had. There were a lot more good. She was adamant about searching my phone and often did behind my back but i had nothing to hide. 

Now, she is loaded with demonic tattoos, gained weight, and got a new boyfriend after like 3 months.  That hurt. I thought that maybe she wasnt ready for that really. She was always the one more scared of me leaving her, and she was much more attached to me than i was her. It was odd she took suck a turn. I hate her with a passion but i love her with all my heart. I know when i treated her wrong and i know when she treated me wrong. I know  what ive gained but i cant get over what i lost. 

 Theres nothing i can do and i try hard to not feel bad. Some days it builds up and i feel so sad. I often forget about it and try not to dwell on it. I loved her so so much, but I look to the future and know ill love someone more. Its hard to truly get over someone you loved. I still have feelings about my ex before her. Lesser feelings but they exist nonetheless.

Any advice on how to help me feel better? How to get over it? Will these feelings stay with me forever?

295,"Hello. Recently I have been going through a very difficult time. I posted in another group asking for assistance with paying my utilities. I offered to send proof that the bills were real. I am embarrassed about it but I have been so desperate and depressed about myself and my situation I didn't know what to do. 
I was overjoyed when someone reached out and offered to pay the utilities, so that myself and my son would be safe. He requested copies of my utility bills. I blocked out my personal information and sent then to him immediately. He asked for the login info for each of my accounts, so that he could pay them directly. I told him that I was not comfortable with that as that would give him so much of my personal information and I have already had my identity stolen once and it created a horrible mess. I told him that I had a PayPal account and offered to pay the bills and immediately send him receipts. If I didn't he could file a claim with PayPal. He agreed that this would be fine. 
And then radio silence for days. I sent him a message stating that I completely understood if he couldn't help but if could  just let me know what was going on.
A few days after that, that he told me that he couldn't help unless he could pay directly. I told him I understood, but I was concerned. I suggested that we just try it with one bill and see what happened. Again he stopped responding. 
I am so desperate that I don't know what to do. I don't want to appear ungrateful but I can't risk being scammed. Is there anything that could be done with that personal account information? Am I being ridiculous?  It made me so depressed to think that I had some help and then nothing

I know this sounds nuts, but this isn't a joke at all. Funny enough legaladvice banned me because they thought I was trolling, and when I offered to send them proof they still thought I was trolling. 

I didn't put famous to humble brag on bloody Reddit but to give you an idea of the fact that I can't just sweep this under the rug. Essentially I run a large program on Youtube/TV and have just recently gotten discovered and with that a lot of my old programs that I made and was in before I was famous have resurfaced on the web. One of those things is a rap song that I made when I was a really stupid 19 year old. In said rap song I was trying to seem edgy and super politically intelligent and in one part I say ""I wanna stab the president inside his f\*\*kin face"" alongside a bunch of other politically extreme stuff that was just there to be edgy. Here's the huge dilemma for me, a few people have re-uploaded this rap and luckily they haven't gotten a lot of attention (Yet) and I don't know if this could potentially result in a conflict with real Secret Service.

I am not being crazy here, there have been ***Runescape*** players who have gotten years in prison for saying way less about the President. Keep in mind this song was during the Obama administration but I say President so even though it's old, it's reuploaded by multiple people as of very recent with no disclaimer and it seems like I'm being serious in the song. What do I do? I don't have a lot of money, enough to support my family, pay my bills and have some on the side for fun stuff. I would be screwed if any type of legal action hit me.

Again even if you think this is a joke, humor me. I'm not joking though. If you've ever been an edgy 13-19 year old on the internet you know how easy it is to go too far especially considering I am a massive attention whore.",31Mar2020,1

304,"Hi reddit,

this is my first post and i open for any advice from you guys.

here's the story:

I do make money online by website, the site with problem now was made by me from scratch and even before i know this business partner. 

then they asked me to join them as 'Team' all deals and negotiated were based on win/win at the beginning.i keep doing my work and previously decided to quite full-time job to full push on more projects.

but now since the new site which was mine start to making some earning. they started to take advantages and not even based on agreement.

1. its an affiliate site so we put many products on the table list as agree. then they change top position (of course its main traffic) to their own links without noticed.
2. we make a deal for 50/50 on this site. but i never received those shared from what they make sales from this site.
3. they claimed this site is own by them since i'm so stupid that let them transfer hosting and domain to them ownership 

Its like i put hard work on this for couple years (and put trusted too) then they start to be take advantage of it and didn't make it as 50/50. 

how to deal with this kind of problem and this kind of people? and anyway i can take what i made from 0 back? (its like piece of art for me even its website but i put all my afford and willing-power on it)

305,"I spent 3 years of my life getting enough money to move to Switzerland. My girlfriend lives there and I wanted to give my family here in Brazil a better life by helping them financially. 2020 was going to be the year, finally. I made my passport and bought me and my best friend the cheapest ticket to Switzerland since we couldn't afford anything better. On the flight, we passed through London (yeah, its important) then Zurich.

 Getting there, with a smile that you could see from my back, we were stopped at the passport check (or whatever its called). They asked us what we would be doing there and I said we were going to stay for 3 months there (I planned to get a visa during this time); so they asked me how much money we had with us. My heart almost stopped. If you don't know, Brazilian real is not very worthy compared to other coins. I explained I had 80 euros but I was going to my girlfriend, who would support us financially. He called another guy, who asked us to follow him, brought us to a backroom and explained they wouldn't approve our entry, so they were going to send us back to Brazil. They called my girlfriend, who was waiting outside the airport for me. She cried, said how sorry she was and that she was going to do everything possible to make us stay there. Problem was: They already had their mind set. They had a flight booked back to London, so we slept at the airport with what I believe was staff watching over us. 

Getting back to London, they had no idea what was happening. I explained what happened and that the guy on Switzerland said they would pay for our flight back to Brazil. He looked at my with a disbelief expression and said it wasn't really like that. We spent around 5 days in jail until they could book a flight back to Brazil for us. The flight was for another place from Brazil, around 30h of where I lived, but at least we were home. 

&amp;#x200B;

Right as I got back home I noticed how weird things were, everything was closed because of the current pandemic, and then it hit me. My mother lost her job at the restaurant she worked for and she had 4 people home to feed. I made them trust me everything was going to be all-right and they trusted me, but it ended like this. My girlfriend sent me enough for some time but I'm already running out of money. She cant sustain a house of people here. I'm really desperate at the moment, so really any ideas are valid. The part that hurts the most was my lil brother. Some days ago we had no money for a decent dinner so we got some breads and sausages and he was so happy because he *‚Äúloved hotdogs‚Äú*. I'm not one to cry easily, but I had to remove myself from the table for some time.

&amp;#x200B;

Any ideas on what I should do now? I tried looking for jobs online as a translator but its so full that my name wont even show up in websites like fiver. Also tried asking for donations but people don't seem to really care, and I don't blame them. Times like this are harsh for everyone.

Thanks in advance.",31Mar2020,1

309,"My husband has  been a stay at home father for the past few years. Since our kids are now in school  we decided it was in his best interest to start looking for work. He's applied to several places and has been to a handful of interviews but doesn't seem to get a call back. I can tell he's getting discouraged. I know he's depressed. 
Every now  and then he will go to the liquor store, get a few tall boys and play video games after the kids and I go to bed. 
I tend to be a light sleeper so I wake up multiple times throughout the night.  I look at the clock realize its past 2am and my husband still isnt in bed yet.  My curiosity gets the best of me and I go look for him.  I normally find him passed out with his gaming remote in his hand,  headset on and him snoring away.  So I quietly clean his stuff up and try to wake him up. Now depending how I wake him we can have several outcomes. Over the years I've learned to wake him gently and be calm for best results.  He will tell me he has to use the bathroom and I'll follow him to make sure he gets to the right destination and aims for the toilet...  -Yes, its come to this point.

Let me take you back to some less fortunate times..

I've woken to my husband standing at the bedroom door using it like it's a urinal. 

I've woken up and stepped in urine. (We dont have a dog)

I've walked in the bathroom to find a lake  on the floor.

I've walked in the bathroom in the morning to find a lake all over the sink counter/floor.

I've walked in the pantry to find all our food urinated on.

I've walked by the stairway to find soaked carpet steps.

I've confronted him MULTIPLE times. He claims to never remember. 

Tonight I happen to exit the bedroom to find my husband making food in the kitchen. I notice two empty tall boys and hes slurring his words alittle.. He walks in the bathroom and shuts the door. I found it weird because I didnt hear him lift the toilet lid so I opened the door. He was  pissing in the damn sink!! 
Shocked he was doing this let alone wide awake I told him I was disgusted and sick of him urinating everywhere but the damn toilet! He proceeded to get angry and began to yell at me, calling me a psychopath and I make big deals out of nothing..

I'm honestly at the point where I'm fed up and losing sleep over this issue.

312,"I don‚Äôt usually like going to he internet for advice but I‚Äôm feeling desperate from being isolated during all this virus stuff. Me and my ex broke up earlier this year after I found out she cheated on me last year. Neither of us had any backup plans in terms of living situations since we had been together for almost 5 years and I figured things would last. Out of necessity we decided we‚Äôd stay in our current place until one of us found an option to move out. She talked about moving in with a friend, and I had a friend planning to move in because honestly I‚Äôm not sure I could afford all the bills myself. Well, then all this virus stuff started happening to my friend had to postpone moving in. Needless to say, I‚Äôm stuck, and my ex probably isn‚Äôt going to be moving out any time soon either.

My issue is, she has become so miserable to be around. She‚Äôs been seeing other people, which honestly doesn‚Äôt bother me that much because she has practically severed any emotional bond I had for her. I just told her I didn‚Äôt want to see anyone at the apartment. But now that she knows I‚Äôve been talking to other people, even though I‚Äôm not looking for any kind of relationship, she‚Äôs been super inconsiderate to me and just cold in general. She won‚Äôt say more than two words when I ask her something, she talks on the phone loud enough for me to hear about guys she‚Äôs talking to, gets mad if she sees me on Tinder, and snaps at me if I ask if she‚Äôs going out. It sucks. And I know I shouldn‚Äôt expect civility, but I‚Äôve been more than generous to her during this whole situation. I‚Äôve bought food for the both of us, I still continue to pay most of the bills even though I was recently laid off from my job due to the Corona situation, and I generally try to be nice and ask her if she‚Äôs okay or needs anything. Any time she thinks I‚Äôm talking to someone else, she starts acting like I‚Äôm some band person.

I just don‚Äôt know what to do. With everything up in the air I‚Äôm afraid to be on my own since I don‚Äôt know if I can recover financially from paying everything on my own. I just can‚Äôt handle this anymore.",31Mar2020,1

315,"Hi, I'm a bit stuck figuring out what would be the best thing to do. I'm 20 and I live with my parents and little brother. My mom and brother are home pretty much 24/7 due to work/school closures, and my dad will likely be laid off temporarily within the next few weeks. He isn't exposed to many people at his job (he works at a bodyshop), and even less now that business is slower, so we're not concerned about him bringing the virus home. Between the three of them, there is a small chance of being infected.

However, I'm going to be picking up more hours to supplement their financial deficits at one of my jobs that is considered essential, and I will be working in close contact with customers at a cash register and will even be training at another location coming up. 

Basically, I have the highest chance of bringing this virus home and infecting my mom who has a hard time breathing to begin with. I'm really anxious about the idea of getting her sick because I know she would likely have a really hard time getting through it. She's been smoking for longer than I've been alive and has been up coughing constantly at night for a few weeks (doctor said it's likely not the virus but a respiratory infection).

I can't really work less/quit since I may be the primary provider in our household for the foreseeable future (of course unemployment and other financial packages will help my parents too), so I'm considering staying with my boyfriend and his parents while I am working. They are a very healthy family with no smokers and they have very little worry when it comes to covid 19, and I have stayed with them in the past a few times. They have made it clear many times that I am always welcome there, and while considering this option I'm also planning on offering rent of some sort if I do end up staying with them for a bit.

I am planning on being extremely diligent in preventative measures while I'm at work as always, so regardless of where I'm staying, I will be trying my hardest to not get infected or transmit the disease. My job consistes of a LOT of hand-washing to begin with, so my extra caution on top gives me a bit more confidence, but not quite enough to quell my worries about my mom.

Should I consider living with my boyfriend's family to prevent my mom catching the virus? Should I stay home and distance myself? Would staying with them even be a good idea?

Any advice is appreciated, thank you.

tl;dr - my mom has underlying respiratory issues and I will be working around a lot of people coming up, should I stay out of our house to avoid getting her sick with coronavirus?",31Mar2020,1
316,"Hi! Before I start, I know none of us know what his true intentions were except for him and unless I ask. I just wanted to know what you guys think.

We‚Äôve been friends for 3 years. We met my freshman year of college and it was obvious he wanted to get to know me from the beginning. Long story short he became my first kiss, later got mad at him because he got hickies from another girl, he apologized, I initiated the talk about what his intentions were and he said he didn‚Äôt want a relationship at the time. We left off on good terms and remained good friends. Sophomore year happened, he made the effort to hangout here and there but we never hooked up or anything.

Summer going into this school year was when things started to change. We began to snap a lot and he tagged me in a lot of things on Facebook. When school started, he immediately asked to hang out with him which then became a consistent thing throughout the school year. He would always pay for my coffee, always try to hold my hand, cook for me (specifically bought me steak cause I asked for it), bought wine, asked to go to the city and FaceTime over winter break. We were at 2 parties together and he would always stay by my side and try to get with me which was unusual because the past 2 years he would be hooking up with other girls. One of those parties I was dancing pretty close with another guy and I knew he was mad but just didn‚Äôt say anything. He remembered my birthday and bought a bottle to my party after I jokingly asked for one too. I got kinda touchy with some of his friends cause I was so drunk and one of his friends the next day told me he looked stressed when I did that.

Anyways, because of the coronavirus, our classes got moved to online. He asked to hang out with me the last day of college because he said ‚Äúthis might be the last time I see your face.‚Äù Once again, he pays for my coffee and holds my hand. We then go back to my room and we cuddle for a little bit. Finally he asks if I wanted him to kiss me and I say no. He asks why and I said I‚Äôm really nervous and bad at this stuff (I have no experience lmao). He ensures me that it‚Äôs fine but I say only on the cheek. So he basically kisses me cheek and goes for my neck and we then cuddle for 2 hours. Later that same night, I go to the bar with friends and I get a text from him saying he‚Äôs coming. I dance with my guy friends and then I see him hooking up with another girl.

I‚Äôm confused; did he just put all this effort throughout the year to just hookup with me? Or was he actually trying for a relationship? He has never had a girlfriend before if that makes a difference. What do you think?",31Mar2020,1

318,"First things first I would like to apologize for any grammar mistakes I make. I'm a freshman in high school and my parents recently separated, I say this because they haven't officially divorced and I am currently living with my mom and little brother who has autism, we are in a low income family. As for the question I was wondering if I should tell my family how I feel and think of them and possibly if I should go to therapy. I've all ways been a lonely and quiet person, I have trouble making friends because I'm a socially awkward kid I think mostly because I had no friends for the first seven years of my life mostly because of the fact that my family moved to america after I was born so when I went to school and I didn't know the language so I spoke to no one and was mostly ignored by my class so this made me feel sad and alone. At home my mom would always be busy either clean the house or being with my Little brother bc of his condition and my dad worked most of the day or was with his friends so I played alone a lot by myself and I was jealous of my brother for always getting the attention of my parents for a while but eventually came to understand why he got the attention. Over all we were a happy family until we started to have economic problems so we moved about six times and eventually landed on a small house, we were fine and my mom started to work at a factory and this is when the I started to see that my dad slowly become jealous because she spent less time with him this caused them argue more and more but I understood that it is normal for couples to argue so I wasn't really affected. But this lead me think about life and start to ask questions to myself as away to spend time, eventually I made my first real friend this happened in 7th grade I got to be more talkative with people got in a friend group I was the happiest Id ever been, but then my mom decided to go on a date with a man and dad eventually found out causing huge fights and then my mom told me about my dads many affairs this caused me to hate both my parents as my mom told me she went  the date to piss off my dad this caused me to see a violent part of my dad id never seen, since we lived in a small house i slept in my parents room on the floor which is something iv done for years since every time some of our family member want to live with us they would take my room. So with the constant yelling and crying I stared not being able to sleep almost every night this made me sleep in every one of my classes, I started failing classes but I was still positive because I had gotten my first girl friend she was amazing and out of my league, she held me together until she broke up with me because I didn't make any moves on her this made me sad but she said we would still me friends I grew happy to know  that i still had her as a friend until the next dad i found out my best friend was dating her i grew kinda angry at this so I asked one of my now ex's friend how long they were dating she responded with a crushing 2 weeks.I didn't say anything about this nor did I hold a grudge against them, my friend group found out I didn't ever have my first kiss they started making fun of me eventually they started to call me gay for being a virgin which I still am and started to spread rumors and made fun of me online they started bullying me and I would never fight back because of my weak body this happen for all of middle school and my my home problems grew worse until one day my parents were in the car arguing as always but then I heard my mom scream my name I ran out side seeing that my dad had taken my mom i ran after them bare foot through the street I gave up and screamed for help but no one came I was alone I prayed for god to help me but no one answered. Eventually my parents came home mom was crying she told us that she called the police and that why my dad calmed down and came back eventually she went to my aunts house taking my little brother but I stayed with dad so he wouldn't do anything rash he pretended nothing happened and I hated him for it I hated my parents, my friends and myself I hated my self for being weak and having no control. Well after some legal agreements mom decided to stay with dad for a little bit until she could find a good job and a cheap apartment, well while living together with things calm down I started to behave differently i started to like when my parents fought I would stand out side there bedroom door a silently laugh at them I lost most my friends I become cold I could understand why people got so emotional about things. Then I remember that I didn't cry when my sisters died due to illness they both died before they had the first birth day and I hated myself for that I was frustrated that I didn't understand how they felt then I started seeing photos of dead people and videos of people being murdered I liked seeing them and But then I watched everyone I meet and noticed that I hated people especially people that hurt people. that lied to people for no reason. I started day dreaming on how to K\*ll the people that disgusted me that made my blood boil this inculcated my parents but I knew it was wrong so It thought that I was in a phase like most teens go through but those thought never left but I have lately been able to control my hatred t words people my learning maybe why they act the way they do but there are people I cant understand and I wish to hurt them.I tried to tell mom of these thought but she just said to change and to believe in god, the way she looked at me when I told her about the time that I was about to shoot my dad she looked at me like I was a monster so i didn't tell her about the rest and didn't tell her that I'm agnostic because i don't want to destroy the rest of our family I don't want problem I'm want to focus on school and on getting stronger both mentally and physically.

319,"Hi all! Here's the deal:

I'm an 18 year old male. I'm pretty lost on where to go now with my life. Backstory time!

I was always labelled as gifted in primary school, I got Dux in year 8, achieved well up until about year 11. I did well. The only thing was, I never really had to \*try\* until I hit year 11. That was when I realised that I didn't have any study skills or self motivation. The only thing that motivated me to do assessments was the panic that I hadn't yet done them. I cheated in quite a few of my year 11 and 12 assessments. I did pretty well otherwise. 

As you can see, I don't have much drive. Here I am now, a working adult (well, before covid) who is studying music at a well established arts institution. Uni is going well, but I don't know if this is for me. The thing is, I don't practice my instrument. I have a number of physical issues that I need to fix, but I just don't practice because I don't want to. This might just be laziness, but I just have no motivation whatsoever to practice. That's obviously less than ideal :/

The other thing is, although I could see myself in a music career, I couldn't see myself having the drive to achieve well in any career. Honestly, the career that appeals the most to me would be to start a damn farm and work manually for my money and livelihood. Of course, I don't have the resources to do that, and my parents would be so disappointed in me (not that it really matters, we have such a shitty relationship anyway). I just don't know anymore... Maybe I'm a quitter by nature. Ah......

320,"I have always been a fan of adult cartoons, and, as a college student, I spend a great deal of time on Netflix, so when I saw a suggestion for Big Mouth, I figured I‚Äôd check it out. 

Because of corona, I‚Äôve now had to move back home, which isn‚Äôt inherently a bad thing in my situation because I‚Äôve always been pretty close with my family. But the boredom has been getting to some of us, especially my mom who has taken a liking to conservative mommy blogs. Tonight she asked me and my brother if we‚Äôd ever heard of the show Big Mouth. I didn‚Äôt want to lie to her, so I said yes and admitted to watching it. Her facial expression said it all. She quickly responded, ‚Äúso when are you moving out?‚Äù which made my brother laugh, but she kinda seemed serious. She went on to talk about how shows like that were everything that‚Äôs wrong with the world right now, and I agreed but she wouldn‚Äôt let up. 

She‚Äôs been a very spiritual person for a long time now, and I actually admire her for that but she sometimes goes a little overboard I feel. I‚Äôve never done anything particularly ‚Äúrebellious‚Äù even after leaving home. I‚Äôve never drank or done drugs or even kissed anyone. But I do get curious, and while I‚Äôd never want to have those conversations with her, I also don‚Äôt want to watch porn or experiment for myself. So I view the show as a happy (and, sometimes, entertaining) medium. She‚Äôs never been a ‚Äúhelicopter mom‚Äù or anything like that, but she can shame people like no other.

322,"Background: My dad is a thorough believer in the current system, but I believe we could make it so that only REAL life skills would be mandatory (like a class on taxes/currency) and have a minimum amount of classes that they have to do, with all courses being available to the student so that they can go into what they want.(Only high school and onward because everyone needs math and reading, the basics I mean)
The Argument: My dad says that even though you forget things you might not use, they go into your subconscious so that you can use the skills when needed. But that is stupid because you are really only going to have 1 job at a time in the real world, and what i proposed would, instead of schools making everyone a jack-of-all-trades we could narrow into the path we actually want to go into, and if this took effect it could even eliminate collage.

Since I'm already 17, I've been trying my best to get things straight, such as saving up for college.
It's a hard thing to do, because I live out in the country, and Not the small town country, mind you.

Put it to you this way, a car drive to a decent shop is  about 20 minutes in a car.
I recently had gotten a bike, and have been trying to ask my Mama if I could use that a point of transport to a potential job.

I really do hate to be cocky, but I am not one to take hand outs, and let my Mama pay for things, especially college.

It's not likely she'll be taking me to work, because she struggles to get time off, let alone struggle to take me to a job as well. 
Same way around to everyone else I know.

As for my other hurdles, I often struggle with myself more than I'd like to.
First off, I've lost a good chunk of weight, because I'm scared of the food in my house.
The only thing I've been eating is rice and vegetables and tap water.
Any thing else, I can't fathom putting into my body.
It wasn't always like this, as this started recently, but I could picture bugs and stuff putting poison dust on it that can effect your health.

I used to eat meat, but more recently, I've felt horrible eating it, because I picture my family in it.
Tap water doesn't phase me, and rice and vegetables doesn't have that sort of vibe to me.
I trust it, so that's what I eat.

Sometimes I fast, because the kitchen is too dirty for me.
I feel uninspired to eat.

I normally clean my family's house, but sometimes it'll feel too dirty to me, I'll feel ambivalent about it, and don't know what to do with it where to start, so I don't clean.

I don't groom myself too often either. I've had a two day shower streak recently, that's how it's been.
I just feel like sometimes it's too dirty to shower in.
More recently, I've been a little bit better about hygene, because I've been cleaning the bathroom a bit better, but if I miss a day, I feel all dirty again, and wait days at time before a next cleaning or shower.

Lastly, getting out of the house is an issue.
I am a chatty person, I chat for hours on end at my peak, but at the same time, I'm paranoid of the public.

I'm scared to ride my bike out, because I'm afraid that I'll get snatched, especially being a petite 90 pound and 4'9 in height young ""Woman"".

Whenever I go out too often, I start to think horrible about my family.
I see things in the corners of my eyes, and I hear my name being called, among other things.
I'm a laid back ""it is what it is"", herbal tea drinking sort of person, so when I can't let go of stress I feel like I'm a horrible person to those around me.

At the same time, when I am getting things done, like vaccuming, I swear I can hear my family talking about me, but whenever I turn around or turn the machine off, they don't look like they've been discussing anything.

Even more concerning to me is that I think I've let some of my current struggles show, because my little 7 year old cousin pulled me aside, and asked if I was okay. I told her that I was, and why she'd ask,
And she told me that I've been acting weird.
She didn't ellaborate further, but I promptly apologized, and gave her a big hug.

I don't want to be a bad example for her.
I try my best to be a good example for her, and I try to be as patient with her as possible, and for her to be that concerned for me breaks my heart.
I know it doesn't sound like much, but I value people very seriously, especially young children who don't quite know much of things yet.

I remember I looked up to my older cousins when I was her age, and I would hate for her to look up to me if I keep disrespecting myself.
What does that show her? 

I sort of went off track, but at the same time, as someone who wants a job as important as an osteopathician, it makes me doubt myself when I'm  not being at top top shape.
How do I improve and fix myself?",31Mar2020,1
324,"a month and two weeks ago i got my ear pierced. the girl that made the piercing told me that i could change a month after doing it, and that‚Äôs what i did.
the problem is that my piercing doesn‚Äôt seem to fully scar. it‚Äôs not infected or anything, but it hurts a bit, because i put an earring with a ring shape, that is contantly moving on its own axis.
so my question is: should i leave my ear with the piercing that i have now, and continue taking care of it while i wait for it to scar? or should i put the earring i first had when i got pierced, but take the risk of screwing up the piercing more?",31Mar2020,1
325,"I'm in a situation where I have agreed to move out with a few people as roommates, and this would be the first time I've moved out of home. However, I've been thinking of staying at home for a few more months thanks to the virus, and my family needs me at home right now. 

I'm not sure how to bring this up with my group of roommates, as I know this would be really upsetting for them, and would really leave them in a bad place if I were to ditch.

What can I do to bring this problem up without hurting anyone?",31Mar2020,1
326,"So I‚Äôve been dating this girl for about a year now. She‚Äôs broken up with me 2 times over the past year. I genuinely thought she was going to be my soulmate and saw my future with her. I treated her really well and always put a lot of effort into the relationship. She just broke up with me saying that she needs to ‚Äúfocus on herself‚Äù and doesn‚Äôt feel the same anymore. It honestly fucking sucks and I‚Äôm not here to ask how to get her back.

I really just need advice on how to forget about someone. How to put someone in the past and just move on. What‚Äôs the best way to do this? Any advice would be great, thank you .",31Mar2020,1
328,"Hey everyone, I feel like I'm generally not someone to ask for advice, but here I am.

I'll put a tl;dr on the bottom, but I am looking for some insight into navigating a new/faded friendship. Some background to this story: I met a guy a few years ago. We only had the chance to hang out for one night, but we really had a good time together, hung out the whole time and had really good (friendship) chemistry. There was some alcohol involved, so I don't remember if we exchanged Instagrams at one point, but the next day, I saw he was following me, so I followed him back.

That was pretty much the end of that, was hoping we could somehow form a friendship out of it all, but it never happened. It's now been some years, we still follow each other on Instagram. He doesn't post often, but when he does, I  like his posts. He watches my stories (which I have heard doesn't mean anything, but I know I only watch the stories of people I about care about in some way, so idk) and likes some of my posts. 

I recently lost a friend who I hadn't had talked to in a few years and it got me thinking of all the people I don't talk to, but do care about. I wrote him a dumb message ""hey, what's up,"" and after a few days of no response, I felt like maybe I could have planned that better. I wrote a somewhat longer message with substance and that seemed to have sparked a response.

We ended up talking for a couple of weeks via Instagram. He'd write me a message one day, I'd respond the next, then he'd respond the day after, so it wasn't a quick back and forth, but he expressed to me that he was working multiple jobs and I'm not one to criticise if someone doesn't respond quickly. I know people are busy, life happens and sometimes I know I just don't feel like responding to people.

But I assumed it was a good conversation since he was writing longer responses, asking me questions. I thought, if he really didn't care, then he wouldn't ask me questions to continue the conversation. All in all, I thought it was going well. But then he stopped responding. It's been maybe 3 or 4 weeks now and I just feel like I won't be getting a response back anymore. It's unfortunate and hurts a little because I know we have similar intrests and thought he's a cool person. Maybe he decided it wasn't worth his time because we live in different countries, maybe I'm boring, who knows. I think I kind of get the short end of the stick because I was the one who initiated and wanted the friendship so it was ultimately up to him if he wanted it as well and it seems he decided it wasn't for him. But it's also frustrating because he still watches my stories and likes my posts. So I just feel like ""hey, what's up with that??"" We're also adults and not teenagers so I feel like an idiot for being caught up on this, haha. 

I think I know the answer is just to drop it and accept he made his choice about it, but maybe I'm looking for someone else to confirm that. Or if anyone else has any insight, that would be helpful. 

tl;dr - started writing with someone, all seemed good, they stopped all of a sudden and now I'm sad about it. But this person still likes my pictures and watches my stories. I just don't get it.",31Mar2020,1
329,"So to preface I‚Äôm pretty much a people pleaser which can have its pros and cons as everything in life. When I hung out with these two people junior year, let‚Äôs call then josh and Brittany, and basically I dropped everything for them. Sounds nice but I ended up basically dropping all school for them and didn‚Äôt do as well as I wanted to. Lame, my fault, I know. On top of that I started dating one of josh‚Äôs friends let‚Äôs call him Brandon and did some stuff with him and I now regret. A lot. I let my hormones get to me and now I can‚Äôt even recognize the me from then. *im still a virgin lmao* anyways I talked to Brittany yesterday about it cuz the both of them kept asking to call so after josh left I gave in and said everything. But I was way harsh and way too blunt with my words and I realized only after I finished that I had made her cry. And now I feel much worse than to begin with and I feel like I made a mistake by mentioning that I had thought about blocking them out of my life to shut off that part of my life... I texted her right after as a way to summarize what I really meant to say in nicer words but she didn‚Äôt reply and basically I f****d up

330,"so i‚Äôm sorry in advance that this is gonna be kinda gross but i‚Äôm nervous so i‚Äôm just gonna say it. 

even though i‚Äôm 5‚Äô2 &amp; weigh 115 lbs, my period is always heavy and lasts 6-7 days. 

in the days leading up to my period, my discharge had some brown blood in it. I thought this was weird but it had happened maybe once before so I figured it would just go away after my period. 

then finally my period came &amp; I was kinda relieved. but, it wasn‚Äôt my normal period. the blood wasn‚Äôt red, it was the same brown from my discharge. also, it was heavy. it was very light and only lasted 2-3 days. 

so I googled it (which is always a bad idea but i‚Äôm in quarantine &amp; live w/ strict parents so I can‚Äôt go buy a pregnancy test) &amp; what I found was:

1. menopause- i‚Äôm 18 so that‚Äôs not it
2. implantation bleeding- bleeding that can be confused as a period but is actually the start of pregnancy 
3. std- me and my partner have only ever been with each other so that‚Äôs not it either. 

now, we have had very busy schedules lately so me and my partner have only had sex maybe 3 times since my last cycle, and he pulled out all 3 times. i‚Äôm also on bc (which I know is not 100% effective) but this month I had been very forgetful and was taking them randomly instead of at my designated time. 

I need advice &amp; maybe some guidance on what to do. what do y‚Äôall think is wrong with me? do I have nothing to worry about? is it just my body not used to being home all day/having to do online school now so it‚Äôs acting weird???",31Mar2020,1

I put that one to the test by asking him to help me clean the apartment. He said he ‚Äòabsolutely hates‚Äô cleaning and really doesn‚Äôt want to spend much time on it. I told him living with other people it‚Äôs apart of the responsibility to help clean common areas. He agreed. Next day rolls around when we are supposed to clean and he bails. That part doesn‚Äôt concern nor surprise me. He goes out and hangs with his friends. I‚Äôve talked to him multiple times about how concerned I am. He continues to say how we are young and are LITERALLY NOT ABLE TO GET THE VIRUS. Not even be able to get sick from the virus because we are young. He won‚Äôt listen to me when I say that‚Äôs not true even though I work in the medical field.. I try to give him facts about being silent carriers and protection of other people. He just mentions how no one he‚Äôs hanging out with is sick and we both seem fine and that we both don‚Äôt have underlying issues so we are ‚Äòfine‚Äô. Damn I smoked for 6 years (I‚Äôm 23 smoked weed and backwoods) I‚Äôve never had a radiograph of my lungs, I‚Äôm probably screwed. but that‚Äôs really on the bottom of my worry list.

We have so many protocols even at home I feel like it‚Äôs all going to waste. 

He just lost his job NOT due to the virus just a temp job. He didn‚Äôt tell our other Roomate who is the main name on the lease who pays everything and he was going to tell her when he sees her next even though the day before she told both of us she can‚Äôt come back because HES not following the stay home call and her bosses are extremely old and immune compromised as is she.
He smokes weed which I‚Äôm about to use against him but when I was his age I would smoke so that puts me at a moral stand still. I‚Äôm not trying to snitch AT THE SAME TIME, I can‚Äôt handle this raging stupidity anymore. I have been STUPID mature I am almost at my PSYCO BITCH breaking point. Not sure what to do.

So if this whole Covid-19 thing doesn‚Äôt mess everything up I‚Äôm supposed to graduate highschool in May 

I want to go to college but not for the right reasons but if i had the chance to I would take it seriously unlike I did highschool (Up until late junior year I did the bare minimum in school I have like a 1.4 gpa so college is out of the question) 

I do feel embarrassed and left out a lot of my friends are going to college and there going to be partying and stuff meeting girls making new friends having new experiences and I‚Äôm going to be at home living with my parents üò≠

And that‚Äôs probably not a good enough reason to go to college , 

The current plan is to graduate and  get a Full time or part time job and go to trade school and become an electrician , I feel like it‚Äôs probably the best route I can take career wise I‚Äôd be living at home rent and bill free making money not even having to pay for trade school 

But that doesn‚Äôt sound very fun i feel like I‚Äôm going to be miserable and depressed these next few years , and  I don‚Äôt take it for granted i know it has its perks but my mom constantly treats me like a baby another reason why I‚Äôd prefer to go to college 

My parents would fully pay my tuition if I go to college , I know I can go to a community college than transfer after 2 years  but by the time im 19/20 (2 years from now) I probably won‚Äôt feel the same about ‚Äúhaving new experiences ,  partying and getting away from home‚Äù 

And once again even I know realistically making my parents pay thousands of dollars to go party and ‚Äúhave fun‚Äù is foolish , so I‚Äôd take it seriously I‚Äôve already proven to myself I can do good in school with my senior grades 

The whole point of this post is to say I‚Äôm lost and in a few months I‚Äôm going to be 18 and a full adult and I‚Äôm hella scared and it‚Äôs not looking very good 

I was wondering if there‚Äôs such a thing as non gpa requirement colleges that could maybe just rely on your Sat score for admission instead",31Mar2020,1

340,"Hello all. I‚Äôm a college student currently studying from home due to the corona virus outbreak. I‚Äôm going to try my best to keep this as short and sweet as possible. 

I currently live in the Bay Area in California, one of the covid-19 hotspots in the U.S. Because most of the surround area is completely packed with either city or suburbs we have a shelter in place order in effect. The order itself states that only essential employees may work and all others must stay inside their house as much as possible. People may only leave to perform essential tasks and exercise if they maintain proper social distancing protocol. 

The problem: 

For the past few days I have woken up to my mom talking with multiple contractors inside the house. The first few times they spent the entire day fixing the caulking in various rooms. The last was a shorter few hour inspection to verify their work. Also, tonight I was informed that they are asking the housekeeper to come 3 times a week. As a last smaller addition they go to the grocery store every day instead of buying enough for 2-3 days. 

Some family context: my parents are divorced and my mother is remarried. I‚Äôm currently splitting my time between both parent‚Äôs houses. Both my step-father and my mom are considered essential employees. My stepfather works from home 50% of the time. My mom will return to work next week as part of a small group of 65 employees allowed to work. My father (biological dad) is currently working from home 100% of the time. Also my dad and I suspect that my mom has narcissistic personality disorder. 

Earlier this night I told them that I was not comfortable with people (other than us 3) inside the house. Their response was that the workers were supposed to come when I was not home (not better because the virus can live on and spread from surfaces) and that we here in fact helping the house cleaner because she has been loyal to our family and needs the money (her husband works in the restaurant industry). My mom also said that she needs time to think about it. (It being if we should not have people in the house) 

My dilemma is that I don‚Äôt know if I should move in with my dad while the shelter in place is in effect. My reasoning to do this would be:
1. Both my dad and I can not afford to take time off if we were sick (I‚Äôm a full time student and he works in a private startup) 
2. My mom and step dad clearly do not follow social protocols and are endangering me, my dad, everyone who comes into the house, and their entire workplaces. 
3. If anyone were to not take the Coronavirus seriously and accidentally touch their mouth or get infected from carelessness it would be my mom. As mentioned above she unfortunately does not think that rules and what not apply to her. 
4. I also dislike living with them because of messy family dynamics so I‚Äôm itching for an excuse to leave. (Imagine me shrugging right now)

My reasonings to not do this would be:
1. I don‚Äôt want to be an ass and not give them a chance.

Any advice is helpful; thank you so much in advance",31Mar2020,1

The vast majority of people in the company are now working from home, but my training group (about 17 people) is still having to come in, we try to stay 6 feet apart but most people forget to sometimes, otherwise they provide us with disinfecting wipes and hand sanitizer and have started to take our temperatures when we come into the building.
Today we got an email from security saying someone in the building had tested positive for COVID-19 but that according to the info they had, that person never came into direct contact with us. 
I‚Äôve expressed my anxiety and come over the situation and asked that our managers reconsider making us go instead of working from home but I think I won‚Äôt be able to change their minds.

My family was stressing me out to plan it and that's how it had happened. Im glad I got married, but deep down I still want the wedding I've always wished for. Things were missing, like dancing, or for it to be an outside wedding, a nice wedding dress (The one I had was okay, but $50 from Amazon and it just didn't feel that special). On top of that, we never truly enjoyed a honeymoon...we went on a 3 day trip to the beach, but ended up having to stay in really bad motels and too much traveling. It was all so rushed it was hard to be in the moment.

355,"Writing this with tears in my eyes, I‚Äôm pretty ashamed of myself right now. Granted I didn‚Äôt try very hard to achieve ‚Äúgood grades,‚Äù throughout high school and it‚Äôs showing. I know grades aren‚Äôt a measure of intelligence/aren‚Äôt the end all be all, but it hurts knowing I didn‚Äôt get into even one school I applied for meanwhile my school acquaintances will going off to different universities around the country. What the fuck am I going to do next year? I guess community college is would be the answer to that. What am I supposed to do there? I was supposed to get into Berklee school of music and pursue making my own music while taking classes to be a better musician. Now what? This probably sounds like a whole lot of complaining, I know, but I need help. I‚Äôm a 17 year old senior in high school with no fucking sense of life direction. I‚Äôm scared. I‚Äôm so fucking scared, scared I‚Äôm not good enough. Scared that everything I‚Äôve ever thought about how things work in life are wrong. There is no purpose for anything, just wishful thinking. I can‚Äôt believe I thought shit would work out for me.",31Mar2020,1
356,"I'm a university student and have been living in my current home since last September. One of our friends moved out at the start of the year, so we had an empty room for a while. In the second term (about Jan), this new girl moved in. She is an international student and gets on really well with everyone in the flat, and is basically one of the family. Since going into isolation (covid-19), we have spent a lot of time together, going on runs, watching films, doing work etc.

Thing is.. I'm in love with her, and I can't escape. 

She is 100% my type, my league (I think) and we have some quirky stuff in common, which is why it is getting harder and harder to not feel like shit when I'm around her. I just want to reiterate that it's rare when I like a girl this much. As sad as this sounds, I know these feelings are real because just sitting next to her and brushing past her arm makes me nervous. It hurts me even more when I see my flatmate (guy, much taller and better-looking) playfight with her, which I know is probably innocent but still really hurts me. The thing is, I also met this other girl right before isolation happened and we hooked up, which I think happened because I accepted that things were never going to happen with the girl I'm in love with. This, however, just made me realise that I'm in love with my flatmate even more than I thought. With problems like these I would normally cool off and go home for a while or something, but that obviously isn't possible. 

I don't want to lock myself in my room because it would neglect my other housemates and probably wierd everyone out that I suddenly went into 'self-lockdown'. Also, if I moved out of the house, I think my other flatmates would follow, leaving the international girl alone during isolation. We all agreed we would stay together, instead of go home, for isolation, which is why she didn't go back to her home country when the outbreak happened. 

I really don't know what to do. I don't feel like the feelings are mutual, or if there is even a glimmer of hope for me. Can I still be friends with her? Am I doomed?",31Mar2020,1
357,"I feel really bad about this but I just thought if this right now, and like so basically I live at home while going to college so going out is harder. Long story short I‚Äôve driven drunk maybe 2 times and the first time like I‚Äôm thinking of this right now how close I was to hitting someone, and I‚Äôm thinking like in an alternate universe I hit that person and my life is literally ruined. 

Anyways thank god I didn‚Äôt, and the only reason I have to drive is to literally get back home and if I were to spend the night at a friends house then my mom would literally freak out. I‚Äôm 20 yrs old and a couple months ago I had to literally beg to spend the night at a friends house and my mom is super adamant about coming home. 

I just wanted to get that off my chest bc it was bothering me, and if I were to get stopped I‚Äôm not even 21 so I‚Äôd automatically get fucked so I just want to stop driving even if it‚Äôs 2-3 beers or whatever.",31Mar2020,1
358,"I have a neighbour who lives above me that as of yesterday especially has completely overstepped the line.

I regularly hear his loud footsteps, music, TV, and talking and I never say a thing because quite frankly I can get on with my life and I don't mind people living their lives within reason.

However, recently I have noticed rubbish put outside of my place, random stuff like shoelaces, shopping lists, finished toilet roll and so on. It's escalated recently in the last two weeks but the final straw was yesterday where my wife and I see that he has left a bunch of used hand wipes (about 5 or 6) just in front of my house, scattered in a row like it's some trail.

There was nothing there prior to him going out I imagine to do a shop and when my wife was cooking she did say she heard him say to his partner that he's going back to his car for a minute (this is where I imagine he got the wipes and left them out in front of my house).

Now, under normal circumstances this is behaviour from what is supposedly an adult, probably 5-10 years older than me. But granted this deadly virus going around that is killing people and making them ill, putting potentially infected wipes out at my front door is a disgrace?

What should be done about this? I don't see the Police or anyone really doing much about crap like this granted all of the other crimes going on at the moment. Much appreciated.",31Mar2020,1
359,"So there is this girl I‚Äôve been talking to and I think she is amazing and gorgeous but I think I fucked up, one night we were at a party and she took me away from the party so we got to chatting and then she asked if I have had a thing for her so I honestly told her that he‚Äôs I did so she asked if I still do so I told her yes, she asked if I wanted to kiss her but I rejected her as she was drinking and I was stone cold sober and didn‚Äôt want any terrible rumours going around, so I just told her no, she was really upset about it and went back to the party and got black out drunk, so we ended up talking about it later in the week and she said she was glad nothing happened between us which sort of got me down in the dumps.
So progress about a year later and I still have a crush on her but I don‚Äôt understand if she is showing any signs, first off it seems as though she mainly talks to me on Snapchat and we are both each others number 1 best friends, secondly she mainly gets on Snapchat to reply to me (I‚Äôve noticed she would get off snapchat straight after talking to me and only get back on to reply to me) we will also stay up till 2-3 am talking, when ever I see her such as when I‚Äôm working she will look at me smile and give me a wave but I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs just a friendly gesture or she is genuinely happy to see me. I don‚Äôt know if these are signs that she is interested in me or not, but if they are I don‚Äôt know how to take it up a level.",31Mar2020,1
360,"This is an alternate account I'm using so my friends don't see, and I'm not diagnosed with depression, but I just need some help with some stuff.

If I were to pinpoint a time for when my thoughts have been dipping into darker areas, I would say its a few weeks after I came out to my parents. At first, they seemed okay. My mom is taking it fine, but my father seems *sad.* He says he'll be praying for me, which is expected, since we are all very religious. He hasn't gotten over it yet, and he keeps wanting me to reaffirm my faith. I think that's a major problem for me. I want to grow spiritually, but he doesn't think I can since I'm gay. He also seems more aggressive with talking to me. He doesn't touch me or anything, but he yells more. These two things could be unconnected, but its still causing me stress, especially since I'm around him more because of the quarantine.

Other things have happened that put me in a bad place. I had this boyfriend, and we were really close. We bonded over music, memes, basic teenage boy things. The most important thing we bonded over was our common sexuality. We broke up after a while, but that didn't matter too much. We could still comfort each other. We made each other feel like we belonged. Something changed drastically, however. In a class, he just seemed mad at me. I asked him about it, and he went off . He told me things like ""I fucking hate you"" and ""I'm so done with being friends with you."" I had no idea why he was mad, and I still don't. After that, he didn't talk to me for months. I had no idea what ticked him off, and all I can think about is *why.* He apologized over text, in the most stupid way. He texted me two months later, saying stuff like ""Sorry, I was just tired."" What really hit me hard was his confession. He told me he was straight, and that hit me like a truck. I decided not to be friends anymore, since he wasn't changing his attitude, and he clearly only wanted to be my friend again because he was getting backlash for going off on me.

Both of these things are filling me up with so much anxiety. I used to have someone I could confide to, someone that can make feel good to be me. I desperately needed that, especially with whats going on with my father, but now I don't have his friendship. In a sick, bizarre way, I ***MISS*** my friend, but I ***KNOW*** he won't treat me well. I saw how fast he changed his attitude changed, I ***KNOW*** he doesn't actually care about me, but he was my confidant. I feel like I was put in a situation where wither I had decided to say friends with him, so that I could feel security in my sexuality, but be complacent in a toxic friendship, that I'm just set up to fail. Its stupid to think about it so much, but I can't help it.

Since these events, I've stopped eating, even if it makes me uncomfortable. I've also been cutting myself, but shown restraint in that area. I only cut myself in the shower occasionally with razors. I've lost interest in drawing, which I used to do a bunch. My sleep schedule is going to shit, and I can't even look my dad in the eyes anymore. I just need some help, or maybe just some advice.",31Mar2020,1

363,"Okay so, I was with a girl couple nights ago. We had a lot of fun, got drunk, watched a movie, kissed a little and did some sexual stuff. I‚Äôm just unsure of where her head is right now. So when we were laid up, I would rub her down there, but she would be really dry and tense, but after a while the water would start flowing. Im doing all the work to make her aroused, but she would not touch me at all lol. It was kind of strange. 

But anyways, we escalated to sex and I got real excited. Then she asked me if I had a condom and that killed all the intimacy and my boner literally died. I tried to put it in with it being soft, and she would tell me to stop lol. I told her I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúin the mood‚Äù, but  I had to think really fast so I didn‚Äôt fuck this up, so I decided  to just eat her out until she wanted me to stop. She said she liked it so I should be in the clear, but as soon as I did that, she said she had to go. 

But yeah kinda unsure what I should do now or what she‚Äôs thinking.. I told her we should try again and she said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll think about it‚Äù. We still text, but its some tension between us right now. I really just feel like she saw me as a piece of meat tbh instead of figuring out what the problem with me was and trying to solve it. And its wild because she says that ‚Äúshe doesn‚Äôt want me to think she‚Äôs a hoe‚Äù but it‚Äôs pretty hoeish to drop a guy for something like that instead of actually caring about him and solving the problem together, but I digress. What do you guys think about all this?

PS I dont have ED, because literally while we were chillin, I‚Äôd whip it out for her thinking I‚Äôd get a blowjob, but she‚Äôd just say ‚Äúit looks good‚Äù and not do anything with it lol. Literally its just when we jumped to sex with a condom is what turned me off, plus her not even wanting to touch me at all too. This stigma that black men should always be ready for sex is kind of wack tbh. Not all of us are the same lol. We just need to be on the same page",31Mar2020,1

369,"Hi! Before I start, I know none of us know what his true intentions were except for him and unless I ask. I just wanted to know what you guys think.

We‚Äôve been friends for 3 years. We met my freshman year of college and it was obvious he wanted to get to know me from the beginning. Long story short he became my first kiss, later got mad at him because he got hickies from another girl, he apologized, I initiated the talk about what his intentions were and he said he didn‚Äôt want a relationship at the time. We left off on good terms and remained good friends. Sophomore year happened, he made the effort to hangout here and there but we never hooked up or anything.

Summer going into this school year was when things started to change. We began to snap a lot and he tagged me in a lot of things on Facebook. When school started, he immediately asked to hang out with him which then became a consistent thing throughout the school year. He would always pay for my coffee, always try to hold my hand, cook for me (specifically bought me steak cause I asked for it), bought wine, asked to go to the city and FaceTime over winter break. We were at 2 parties together and he would always stay by my side and try to get with me which was unusual because the past 2 years he would be hooking up with other girls. One of those parties I was dancing pretty close with another guy and I knew he was mad but just didn‚Äôt say anything. He remembered my birthday and bought a bottle to my party after I jokingly asked for one too. I got kinda touchy with some of his friends cause I was so drunk and one of his friends the next day told me he looked stressed when I did that.

Anyways, because of the coronavirus, our classes got moved to online. He asked to hang out with me the last day of college because he said ‚Äúthis might be the last time I see your face.‚Äù Once again, he pays for my coffee and holds my hand. We then go back to my room and we cuddle for a little bit. Finally he asks if I wanted him to kiss me and I say no. He asks why and I said I‚Äôm really nervous and bad at this stuff (I have no experience lmao). He ensures me that it‚Äôs fine but I say only on the cheek. So he basically kisses me cheek and goes for my neck and we then cuddle for 2 hours. Later that same night, I go to the bar with friends and I get a text from him saying he‚Äôs coming. I dance with my guy friends and then I see him hooking up with another girl.

I‚Äôm confused; did he just put all this effort throughout the year to just hookup with me? Or was he actually trying for a relationship? He has never had a girlfriend before if that makes a difference. What do you think? Do you think he thinks about this too?",31Mar2020,1
370,"This may come off as really narcissistic or shallow, so bear with me. Under conventional standards of beauty I think I'm quite attractive. That begin said I've never had a girlfriend before, nor have I ever been laid. I'm only 18 years old so it's not the end of the world, but I do feel as though I'm missing out on a key aspect of being young. I understand that sex and relationships come with their fair share of problems and may not be all that they're hyped up to be. However, if I continue to lay idle and let time go by I believe that I will deeply regret not acting sooner. Lately I've been putting myself out there more and more. Although, I've had mixed results. While I have been able to make substantial strides in the right direction with one girl, most women I contact treat me like the Jehovah's Witness. Mind you while I'm not in their intimidate friend circle, I'm also not just hitting up random strangers. 

Generally I would say that my social skills are pretty solid. I used to be very shy and introverted, but over the years I've become more socially literate. Rejection still hurts, but thankfully I'm far better at dealing with it nowadays.

I chatted with my husband about this a little bit, and he says he's happy to eat anything I cook because he loves the flavor I can put in all my dishes, so that makes me happy!

375,"I need advice


I have/had 2 brother, when I was 4 my brother was killed in a drive-by. All my family was shaken up by it. My mom was depressed, my dad was always drinking and my brother was smoking all the time. 

About a year and a half passes and we‚Äôre still not over it. My brother was always smoking with his friend. My aunts would invite us to eat, so my mom can feel a bit better, and my dad was working so he wouldn‚Äôt drink as much. 

I was always with my cousins. One day one of my cousin (j)  wanted to cuddle with me (I was 5 and he 12) and then he started molesting me.J would do this often. He even encouraged his younger brother to do the same (he was 9). Eventually it was both of them doing it. This happened for months until my dad found out. My parents never wanted to talk to them and wanted to pretend like they weren‚Äôt our family. But they wanted to work thing out, they begged my parents for forgiveness. My parents agreed to keep talking to them. 

But my parents stop going to family event for a while, and when we did go, they wouldn‚Äôt let me go to their room. 
My parents never talked to me about it, the only time we ‚Äútalked about it‚Äù was when they found out and when I went to the doctor. I kinda forgot about what happened, I knew what happened but everything was kinda blurry. 

Year pass and everything goes back to normal. We would go to my aunts house all the time, and I hanged out with my cousins from time to time (not alone but with my brother or another cousin).
 I am now 14 and a freshman. As you know at this age you want to try thing. I would see my cousin smoke weed, and some of my friends were doing it. I asked my brother if he would buy me a cart, and he said no, I asked one of my other cousin to get me a cart and he said no. I then asked my cousin (j) to get me one. He said he didn‚Äôt have a cart but could get me dab. 

Since I never tried it, he said he would pick me up during school. Then he would take me to his house and we would smoke. I was going to ask one of my cousin to come along, but my cousin J said no since he didn‚Äôt have enough for all of us to smoke. (Btw I‚Äôm 14 and he‚Äôs 23)

I did worry but I thought he wouldn‚Äôt do anything. It was a long time ago, he never did anything that would weird me out. 
I mean he is my cousin,and it was a long time ago.

The day comes and I‚Äôm excited. I wait in the bathroom till the bell rings and then I walk out. He take me to his house. We smoke, and he kept telling me to smoke. He kept offering me to smoke even tho I was already getting fucked up. I then say If he can buy me some. I handed him the money. Everything was fine, I was really high but fine. I didn‚Äôt eat nothing so it was even worse. A few minutes pass and he said ‚ÄúI feel bad taking your money.. how about you do something else‚Äù. My heart dropped and I started shaking. I kept telling myself it had to be something like cleaning his room or his car or something like that. But he then said ‚Äúhave you ever gave someone head?‚Äù

I said no and then he said ‚Äúdo you want to try it?‚Äù I said no, he kept on insisting but I kept saying no and eventually I asked him to take me home. Thank god that nothing happened, but when he asked me that question. Almost everything came back. 

He did apologize on the car ride home but it didn‚Äôt seem genuine.

When I got home, no one was there. My dad goes to the gas station a lot, so I didn‚Äôt know if he was in the gas station or working. So when I got home I sat in the closet, and cried silently. 
I told my brother If he could cover for me, and say he picked me up early. I said I would explain everything when he got home. He said okay. I then went to my bed and fell asleep. I woke up by the ringing to my phone, it was my brother. He was pissed and told me why I skipped school. 

I started crying and I said I would text him the reason, because I felt guilty. I pretty much texted ‚ÄúI went  to (j) house and he asked me for a blowjob. He hanged up the phone and called him. My brother said that when he answered he sound fine, he even sounded happy. But when my brother asked him if he asked me for a bj he started stuttering and saying he didn‚Äôt even do anything.My brother was going to go to his house to fight him, but he wasn‚Äôt home.

My brother then called me again to ask if I was okay, I said yes but I started crying. I was telling him how much this hurt me because it wasn‚Äôt the first time. He then stoped me and said ‚Äúthis happened before?‚Äù I said yeah it happened when I was 5. He told me that our parents never told him that. I also told him to not tell our parents, not because I was skipping or smoking but because I didn‚Äôt want this to be a big deal. 

He agreed, and almost one week after all that happened I went to his room to talk just because I felt so depressed. We were talking about the past and that‚Äôs when I told about (e). (That‚Äôs (j) younger brother). My brother got pissed and said let‚Äôs smoke, he had some weed because he said he didn‚Äôt want me to have only that experience of smoking weed. We went to the beach to smoke and he kept on apologizing because he felt guilty.

Since he was never there and always with his friends. We went home and it was normal for a few day. I hanged out with a friend, and when I got home my mom and my brother were taking and looked serious. We went to the park and my brother told me that my mom knew everything. When I got home I broke down and my mom apologized and said sorry. 
My mom  also told my brother that the reason they never said anything to him, was because they were scared he was gonna kill him. Since my brother knows how to box, and wouldn‚Äôt care if he went to jail. 
Later my dad got home, and we told him what happened. My parents went to my aunt house. They showed them the text of him saying he would pick me up to smoke, and told them that my cousin asked me for a blowjob. My aunt was crying and scolded my cousin (j).

After an unsuccessful attempt to visit his house, when his parents said that due to the new social distancing rules, I would no longer be allowed over, I was given the option to move in with them, until the pandemic is finally over. The only issue with this, is my mother. She's Christian, and I'm not, and therefore she doesn't entirely approve of this. I brought up the idea to her, and she said she couldn't understand why I'd want to move in with them, and that she wasn't happy with it. I tried to reassure her saying that I'd have to move out eventually, and that I could visit her on weekends, but I have since found out that due to my state guidelines I wouldn't even be able to visit her, only if I was to drop of food. Part of me thinks that moving out for a while might be a good idea. I could call my mum frequently, so I guess that wouldn't be too much of an issue, but we have no idea how long it'll be before this outbreak is over.

382,"God dag, og hvordan g√•r da?

I am an American in the Bay Area of California looking to move to Norway to become a Norwegian Citizen. I'm currently learning Norwegian through Duolingo (as I couldn't find any proper classes in my area). 

I realize I don't know the 1st thing about moving to Norway, so I was wondering if any of you could provide me some resources and ideas of what exactly I would need to do. I haven't picked which part of the country I want to live in yet, so there is still a ton of flexibility for me right now.

I will provide some more details below, I know that certain circumstances can change the advice I might be given.

I am a 28/F. I work in security (trying to get into dispatching), with lots of basic office experience. I'm single, no kids, I do have several chronic health issues, but I still work full time and even overtime. I have 2 cats and a ball python. I do drive, so moving somewhere with a commute wouldn't be a problem for me. I learn quickly, so I'm not too troubled with moving somewhere that I might have to learn to drive in snow or some other type of weather I'm not used to.

I don't expect to move right away, obviously. I would need at least another 18 months or so before I could comfortably be ready to move and have all of my ducks in a row, with saving up money for not just the move, but for while I find a job and other possible expenses. 

Any advice, tips or if you want to help me learn Norwegian would be super awesome.

Thank you so much everyone and stay safe in these spooky times! 

Ha en god dag og tusen takk! ‚ù§",31Mar2020,1
383,"I'm (26f) autistic and schizophrenic. I was once involuntarily detained in a high security mental ward and strongly medicated for two weeks. It was not rehabilitative for me and I spent a year bedridden at my parent's upon discharge, and two years building up my abilities gradually before I, against all odds, bounced back, and was able to move out, and become a functioning member of society again. 

All without the use of medications, aside for that which was forced on me in the ward, which had adverse affects. I was cooperative with western medicine, and am still convinced that I require a strong western medical form of support for my conditions, but the detainment fucked me up so incredibly badly, that I have resisted the long trek of seeking proper treatment again, and I now have fallen through the cracks.

I managed 4 years without psychoses, and 2 years of being a functioning adult again before alas, this pandemic hit.

My partner (first friend and companion in 5 years), who, although I have been with him 1 year, does not know about my conditions in depth, just broke up with me, and now I am forced into absolutely zero human interaction for the remainder of the self isolation period. I have no supports in the form of friends, family, medication, and therapy, and the emotional pressures became too much for my partner to continue seeing me. 

I cannot come to terms with the seemingly inhumane act of him abandoning me during this time, but have to accept his limits. I am now a vegetable at serious risk of self harm and suicide.

I was convinced that if I ever wanna escape the working class lifestyle, I have to start dealing drugs, pimping out whores, or committing fraud when I become an adult, which is happening this year actually, I graduate high school and turn 18 this coming May and June.

What changed that belief was my big sister's old friend. She lives in Kailua, a rich white-people town, in a freaking $1.2 million house that she *owns*, and she's 31! She also raises a 7 year old daughter. The reason she broke this belief is that there's no way would I ever believe that this girl had the heart to do those kinda things.

Only thing is though, how did someone as young as her become so financially loaded that quickly? I mean she works for a stage equipment service, not exactly prime salaries there.

Long story short:

I'm studying Computer Science in the UK at a non-russel group university. A level math isn't a requirement for said university, but I've heard it is if you'd like to go into AI in the future as a career (which I do).

I don't know what to do now since I didn't do A level Math. I'm more than happy to self teach it in order to gain a greater understanding, it will help with my degree too which is a plus. I'm more concerned that future employers won't like that I didn't do it.

396,"Hi! Before I start, I know none of us know what his true intentions were except for him and unless I ask. I just wanted to know what you guys think.

We‚Äôve been friends for 3 years. We met my freshman year of college and it was obvious he wanted to get to know me from the beginning. Long story short he became my first kiss, later got mad at him because he got hickies from another girl, he apologized, I initiated the talk about what his intentions were and he said he didn‚Äôt want a relationship at the time. We left off on good terms and remained good friends. Sophomore year happened, he made the effort to hangout here and there but we never hooked up or anything.

Summer going into this school year was when things started to change. We began to snap a lot and he tagged me in a lot of things on Facebook. When school started, he immediately asked to hang out with him which then became a consistent thing throughout the school year. He would always pay for my coffee, always try to hold my hand, cook for me (specifically bought me steak cause I asked for it), bought wine, asked to go to the city and FaceTime over winter break. We were at 2 parties together and he would always stay by my side and try to get with me which was unusual because the past 2 years he would be hooking up with other girls. One of those parties I was dancing pretty close with another guy and I knew he was mad but just didn‚Äôt say anything. He remembered my birthday and bought a bottle to my party after I jokingly asked for one too. I got kinda touchy with some of his friends cause I was so drunk and one of his friends the next day told me he looked stressed when I did that.

Anyways, because of the coronavirus, our classes got moved to online. He asked to hang out with me the last day of college because he said ‚Äúthis might be the last time I see your face.‚Äù Once again, he pays for my coffee and holds my hand. We then go back to my room and we cuddle for a little bit. Finally he asks if I wanted him to kiss me and I say no. He asks why and I said I‚Äôm really nervous and bad at this stuff (I have no experience lmao). He ensures me that it‚Äôs fine but I say only on the cheek. So he basically kisses me cheek and goes for my neck and we then cuddle for 2 hours. Later that same night, I go to the bar with friends and I get a text from him saying he‚Äôs coming. I dance with my guy friends and then I see him hooking up with another girl.

I‚Äôm confused; did he just put all this effort throughout the year to just hookup with me? Or was he actually trying for a relationship? He has never had a girlfriend before if that makes a difference. What do you think? Do you think he thinks about this too?",31Mar2020,1

I have been reasonably successful thus far in my 26 years which makes me want to share what I've learnt and experienced in the past.  Some people respond really well to this and come to me for help, advice or just to talk and have a conversation. But some don't respond well to me. They think I'm a know it all and that I make them feel bad about themselves. I've known this for some time so I try my best to be humble and word things correctly and even avoid sharing if no one has asked me. My boss even told me: ""you always seem to one up me whenever I have something interesting to share"". My mates have told me: ""you're so convinced that your always right"" 

The reason I'm asking this is because of how my girlfriend responds to this. She seems to love that I'm knowledgeable and capable but quite often she says I'm lecturing her or that I'm perfect and my standards are impossibly high and that I put her down making her feel bad about herself. I understand where she's coming from but I don't really know what to do. I have a stake in her and I want the best for her and for us so I tend to voice more than I would otherwise.

We‚Äôve been told constantly from the university, government and media to stay home but my roommate refuses. My school has been doing online classes, but he still meets with group members, gets coffee from a cafe and study‚Äôs on campus for 6+ hours regularly. The only time he hasn‚Äôt followed this routine is when he took the train home for 5 days to visit family and a few friends.

We have access to a couple of apartments (slowly moving from a soon to be renovated place to a new one), so I‚Äôve self isolated at one but i have to be out within the next few days. I have a compromised immune system, smoke and have pulled multiple all nighters this semester to complete assignments (further decreasing my immune system).

I‚Äôve told all of this to him many times but he won‚Äôt listen. He even briefly got upset when i told him i was going to isolate alone (even though there are 9 bedrooms between the two places and two of us).

The only isolated place i have left is 8 hours away and no car. How can i make sure I‚Äôm safe?

Roommate isn‚Äôt doing any social distancing, what do i do?",31Mar2020,1
407,"I feel that a lot of people confuse ‚Äúself care‚Äù with ‚Äúbeing rude‚Äù, this is current what someone who was my best friend for 7 years is currently doing.

Ignoring people, refusing to talk to them, only caring for yourself is being an asshole when done for so long and to the extreme.
I‚Äôm tired of what he‚Äôs doing, and no matter how many times I‚Äôve brung it up, I‚Äôve told him how it‚Äôs hurting and what he can do to make everything better (while still keeping his feelings in mind) all I get is a ‚Äúsorry‚Äù and then he repeats the cycle. The most common excuse I hear for why he‚Äôs ignoring me is ‚ÄúI do it to everyone so it‚Äôs not just you‚Äù.

I‚Äôm so tired of the bullshit and there is no excuse for what he‚Äôs doing. Even his mother told him off about what he‚Äôs doing (since she got in contact with mine just to ask how I was doing since she thinks I‚Äôm a good person). I can‚Äôt just cut him out because that‚Äôs so many years of friendship and doing that won‚Äôt teach him anything since he‚Äôll just play the victim and say I was in the wrong.
I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a bad person I just think he‚Äôs doing the wrong things, and refusing to accept that there must be a change.

How do I deal with this?? Last time it happened I got him out of it by delivering a thing for a charity event (his mum was doing) and he ended up sitting outside in his back garden and talking to me for 3 hours, then he stayed around and showed he cares. But now he‚Äôs back to ignoring everyone and putting himself first, and it‚Äôs not like I can see him irl for the moment since I‚Äôm really high risk due to underlying health conditions.

I‚Äôm just so stuck I don‚Äôt know what I can do??",31Mar2020,1

I wrote hey :) then he replied with what are you up to this Sunday evening:) which sounded really nice. I wrote back and said I liked his description of his personality and that I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt have a pic up. Last night he replied there‚Äôs nothing to be sorry for :) I‚Äôm an easygoing person at least in my own opinion. The weather has been changing a lot here. What are you doing in quarantine? It‚Äôs boring!

He sounded so good natured and honest. And into me with asking what I‚Äôm doing and talking to me. 

But he seems to not have a premium account so he can only send one message a day. I messaged him my picture and haven‚Äôt heard back. He won‚Äôt get another message until tonight. Do you think he‚Äôll respond and keep being interested? Most guys block me right after they see my picture. Do you think the fact he didn‚Äôt pay 6$ for a premium account means he‚Äôs not into me?

411,"I had maybe a couple friends left after secondary school finished, everyone moved on to college and Uni though. Then I decided to move in with my boyfriend, our relationship was long distance at the time so it was a big move. I found a well-paid job 12 days after the move and have worked since. I‚Äôm only young so the age gap between colleagues and given the hours I work I don‚Äôt have the time or opportunity in every day life to make new friends. I‚Äôve had 2 jobs now just over 2 years later and I have made a friend here and there but they‚Äôve left to go travelling or just moving away. I tried joining a ladies football team but that flopped because the head girl didn‚Äôt like me, I think it‚Äôs because I sucked. But the whole team did so they didn‚Äôt have enough players to be able to bench me... so that lasted a month or so maybe. I tried an app like Tinder but for meeting friends, but it felt forced. I have recently discovered with my bf that he has aspergers, we always knew there was something unique about him and the way he thought and processed things, beyond it just being a guy thing. 
So I have no friends in-person and my bf is struggling to be proactive and romance me. I‚Äôm feeling really lost and isolated. My bf is my best friend but with his routine (aspie thing) being to get home and go straight upstairs to the computer room and game all evening, he‚Äôs no company either. I‚Äôve learned you need to be direct so I‚Äôve told him I want him to do things like take me on dates and get us out, having fun. I even give examples of dates and places so he can choose so I‚Äôm not orchestrating it all, but he forgets or just plainly doesn‚Äôt bother. We‚Äôve been together almost 4 years now and I really love him and I have a good relationship with his family. My own family sucks and I really see a future with my bf, I can‚Äôt imagine myself with anyone else. 
Any suggestions on how to put myself out there?",31Mar2020,1
412,"Okay so here‚Äôs the story‚Äî

About 2-3 months ago my bf and I were out with some mates and he got a little too drunk and high and ended up dumping me in front of the entire pub, which we‚Äôre regulars. So I‚Äôm totally humiliated and I decide to pick the closest lad I can and ask if he‚Äôd like to come back home with me. He‚Äôs an out of towner but a lot of people know him and apparently he‚Äôs a stand up fellow. My flatmate and her sister were apart of our group and they were saying absolutely don‚Äôt but I was so blindly angry and humiliated that I brought him back. 

Fast forward about an hour and this guy is really aggressive and not at all good. It‚Äôs what I get for doing that I guess. I‚Äôm telling him we shouldn‚Äôt and he keeps pressuring me and starts getting more aggressive. I didn‚Äôt have sex with him, only gave him a BJ because I was honestly so worried. I blurted out that I was in love with my bf and if he could kindly leave, and he finally did. Granted, my bf and I had only been together officially about a week or 2 at that point so it was so early to be saying that, but at that moment I realized that I did, which ooh romantic is it not?! 

A few days go by and he‚Äôs not answering any of my messages so I go over there to get my stuff and he‚Äôs all happy go lucky and acts like everything is fine. I‚Äôm totally timid and nervous and he asks what‚Äôs wrong. I realized at that moment he didn‚Äôt remember even dumping me. I asked him if he remembered the other night and he said not too fondly. I told him he dumped me and he felt horrible. He‚Äôs a very sensitive guy. 

So we‚Äôre still going very very very strong and I‚Äôm so head over heels for this lad but it‚Äôs way late and I can‚Äôt sleep because for some reason thinking about this is driving me to a near anxiety attack. 

Should I tell him tomorrow when I see him? Or should I just leave it. Is it even cheating technically if I thought we were broken up? On the flip side of the coin I should‚Äôve taken into account how inebriated he was. 


TL;DR: BF dumped me in public, I hook up with aggressive dude, BF didn‚Äôt remember dumping me because he was too drunk",31Mar2020,1
413,"This account was supposed to just be a throw away, but it‚Äôs just become my second account instead. 

Anyways, yeah, I‚Äôve had a feeling for a while something has been wrong with me mentally. I‚Äôve been in a bad mental state for about 3 years now, and it revolves around feelings such as no one cares about me, I‚Äôm not important, nobody wants me, I don‚Äôt mean anything to anyone, my friends and loved ones just act like they care to get me to shut up. Things like that. 

I‚Äôve tracked these thoughts to beginning shortly into the summer before my senior year of high school. Between then then and my sophomore year, I had lost 3 out of the only 4 important family members in my life outside of my direct family. All three in less than 6 months apart from each other, which didn‚Äôt give me really any proper time to fully get over each death. During the third loss, I was also in the peak of my verbally abusive relationship with a guy who made me feel like I wasn‚Äôt someone people wanted, and he actually made points to tell me I couldn‚Äôt be loved. 

During senior year, my friends started distancing themselves from me, and I began to barely hear from them. I was becoming alone and I felt like everyone important to me was leaving me and didn‚Äôt care for me. I didn‚Äôt feel important to my family, and to battle this I‚Äôve been attempting to go above and beyond to be the best daughter, the best friend, and the best lover I can be (I‚Äôm in a new relationship and have been for the past year and a half). If I feel like I‚Äôm not being the best I can, I get angry and sad and the feelings grow more. These feelings have continued into now my sophomore year of college, and they‚Äôve particularly spiked within the last few months. They spiked bad last semester as well, but went down, and now they‚Äôre back. They‚Äôre combining with body image issues, and my family is concerned I‚Äôm developing an eating disorder, but I‚Äôm not I don‚Äôt think. I still eat, but I will say I‚Äôve lost 11 pounds in the last 2 months. It kind of scared me, but not enough to be too concerned. I just know the weight loss is a result of the feelings I‚Äôve mentioned above. 

I‚Äôve been tempted to seek out therapy, but I‚Äôm scared. When I read about everyone else‚Äôs issues, they seem much more deserving of therapy than mine, and I‚Äôve had people this whole mental trip tell me that I‚Äôm just overreacting and making a big deal out of nothing or taking things too personally. I posted about my friends last semester when my fears were spiking, and someone commented saying, ‚ÄúGod you sound clingy and annoying. No wonder they don‚Äôt want to be around you.‚Äù And needless to say, that hurt. A lot. 

I‚Äôve avoided self diagnosing myself because I know that angers people, and I don‚Äôt want to be that type of person, but I can‚Äôt help but feel there‚Äôs genuinely something wrong going on in my head. I just don‚Äôt know what. I can‚Äôt allow myself to go though because there‚Äôs also that part of me that has been told my whole life I‚Äôm just overreacting and there‚Äôs nothing wrong. My own mom tells me I just need to calm down, but it‚Äôs hard. 

I‚Äôm not sure exactly what I‚Äôm asking for advice on. I think I‚Äôm just trying to figure out if others out there can help me figure out if there really is something mentally going wrong that I need help for, or if it‚Äôs just simply me overreacting and that going to therapy would be a waste because I don‚Äôt really need it like some people have told me.",31Mar2020,1
414,"So, I've never been a particularly happy person, I know I put too much pressure on myself and I beat myself up when I'm down or make a mistake. I also get angry when I mess up or things don't work out. I HATE this about myself, I am not proud of it.

Lockdown has also made me realise that I have a very boring and uneventful life. Pretty much nothing has changed in my life due to this. I'm young and want to do more but don't know what to do or where to start.

I do my best not to compare myself to friends, however, it seems that they always have these amazing opportunities. I've took risks in my work to try and open up doors but nothing has came of it.

I also complain a lot and I struggle to see the good things in life. I feel guilty about this as I know I'm more fortunate than many. I also feel like I've brought my fianc√©e down from what she used to be due to my attitude rubbing off. 

It also doesn't help that I've been made redundant during this COVID-19 situation.

PLEASE can anyone give me some advice on how to improve my mood/happiness. How to live life more and how to seek more opportunities.

TLDR: I've realised I am:
- unhappy
- negative
- angry
- lacking opportunities
- inert

I want to:
- be happier
- be more positive
- have more opportunities",31Mar2020,1
416,"M here, I've constantly had problems with my sister and recently I got myself a cat. Since then, my anger towards her has just escalated. 

Firstly, I had a cat who I really cared for, who died late last year. So recently I bought myself a new cat, who I really like. I'd like to emphasize that he is **my** cat. Now, my sister really likes that cat too. She wishes the cat was her cat, as animals rarely ever form a bond with her. So, she sees this new cat, my cat, as a blank slate that she can make hers. She denies it when I ask her, but it's obvious she wants to influence the cat to like her more. 

Now, I've laid out some rules regarding my cat. No picking him up if he doesn't need to be picked up, no trapping him in rooms without me, no holding him so that he can't escape and he can only be fed 3 times a day. My sister, of course, doesn't care. She constantly picks him up because she ""feels like it"" and in her opinion ""it's fine"" and that's a good reason to not listen. She constantly closes him in with her in an attempt to make him sleep with her on the bed. She also holds him in her arms so that he can't run away because ""I like doing it."" She overfeeds him, while he's already obese. She's becoming more and more stubborn and selfish, never helping the rest of the family with work if she isn't forced to do it. It pisses me off so much. Sometimes I just want to get a metal rod and hit her really hard with it. A little side note, I really hate high-pitched voices and my sister has one high-pitched voice. So I get mad when she talks, but that's not really important.  

I've been angry lately and over years of similar behaviour, I'm extremely cynical to my sister and critique everything she says. I've tried bringing it up with her, but she just looks smug all the time and never listens. I still live with my family and can't move out yet, so that's not an option. I've been so pissed lately. 

What should I do, and how can I get her to respect my rules I've set, without force?",31Mar2020,1

418,"I‚Äôve been questioning this for a very Long time and can‚Äôt really see it through but many people say that they probably are. My friends are good in a way but sometimes they could come off as very bad. I‚Äôm comfortable in my own body but then when it comes to my friends they often come across as insecure and would always self deprecate themselves. Most of them are in the overweight isle and I‚Äôm the only skinny girl in the group. People would insult the heaviest girl in the group often , let‚Äôs call her P , calling her a pig and etc. P comments about my appearance the most , by saying ‚Äúyou think you‚Äôre as pretty as her?‚Äù when I said whether she‚Äôs referring to that girl when she said I look like some other girl and would always downplay my looks or commenting about my skin tone. The others in the group would make fun of my appearance despite many people saying I‚Äôm the most attractive looking one in the group. When I got a 93/100 for one of my exams , they didn‚Äôt congratulate me or be happy for me and when a boy I was talking to called me pretty , P and another girl let‚Äôs call her A would then say I‚Äôm a catfish and etc when I don‚Äôt use filters. I was once in the toilet with A and because P didn‚Äôt come to school that day , she was FaceTiming her when she saw me and then said ‚Äúomg *my name* you‚Äôre so pretty‚Äù then P started laughing , A then said ‚Äúwhy are you laughing?‚Äù Then P said ‚Äúare you being sarcastic?‚Äù Then A said ‚Äúyeah you don‚Äôt know?‚Äù Then I decided to walk out of the toilet to not get hurt more. There was also a time where I was walking with my group home and because I walked faster then the others I was infront of them , then when I looked back , a girl let‚Äôs call her H was making fun of my hourglass figure saying it‚Äôs wierd looking. And about a few months ago , I was playing in the park with them when they decided to tell me to sit down with them and have a conversation , they then said that they hated me and listed out the most stupidest reasons like talking about clothes a few times and stuff? Then they told me that I just look average and that I shouldn‚Äôt ask them whether my hair was neat or not (that time they ruined my hair and it was a big mess so I decided to tie it up and told them whether it was still messy lol). There was also another time when I was going shopping with them when a random girl came up to me and said that I was pretty and then when she left P said that she probably is only saying that due to my popular sister . Just to say , back then when they did all those things to me I was not narcissistic, I had a very Low self esteem but after the 2 month holiday I had without them I started to find myself loving myself more. I also do find them my grades accelerate more when I wasn‚Äôt in much contact to them. There are also other things they did to me regarding my achievements and appearances that would come off as a very Long list. And if you think that being called ‚Äúaverage‚Äù is fine , I used to be an ugly duckling and decided to take care of myself more , then one day when I went to school after a Long public holiday , a lot of boys started having crushes on me and everyone said I was beautiful and when someone says I look ‚Äúaverage‚Äù it often translates to me that I‚Äôm not good enough. So yeah.",31Mar2020,1
419,"Essentially, my bf and I are having a clash of opinions. Due to COVID-19, I have been reading a lot of papers/articles from countries that seems to be managing a bit better the situation i.e South Korea, Hong Kong and they are all saying more or less similar things. I believe that due to their history of dealing with MERS and SARS in the past, they do have a better position in helping us understand the situation. Even the States have recently approved the 15 mins testing which is something that South Korea has been doing for a while. But my bf is not agreeing with their advice saying that different experts always have different opinions and is dismissing what I am saying.

 No matter how hard I try, I can't understand his reasoning and he's not telling me either. I don't think it's wrong taking informed decisions to be extra safe. But he's refusing to talk about the situation and I am worried about his attitude towards this. Not saying that he doesn't care, but he is so dismissive, I am worried that he's not realising how bad this thing is. What would you do in this situation? I'm at a loss on how to deal with this difference in opinion. Usually, I am pretty cool with us having different ideas, but this time, the topic is a bit serious.",31Mar2020,1
420,"I ( 26M ) am from Malaysia, I went for a diploma course in 3D Animation &amp; Multimedia ( which includes filming / graphic design / photography / videography ) after I graduated from high school. Things happened in between my diploma course and I did not graduate and got myself a diploma cert ( due to me being picked on by the head of that private university ) Anyway, fast forward to few months later, I took it upon myself to venture and specialize in photography as I have my gears, cameras, tripod etc. I started working as a freelancer since 2014, but then I was going nowhere, I only got myself a few projects a year every now and then, my parents strongly supports my freelance photography career and although I wasn't earning a stable income like regular people does, they still supported me, years went by, I realize I wasn't really working hard on my own career, and I thought of ways to promote / advertise, created my own facebook page, instagram page, websites and so on, it's all there but still I have not gotten much projects to work on, to earn some money. Recently, thanks to the COVID-19, I would say it's a blessing in disguise, a church that I formally went to, one of the pastor contacted me and ask if I'm interested to do a video recording / video editing for them, this sounds like a opportunity to me, and since I am working freelance, I have all the time, so I agreed readily. So basically this project is probably a long-term one according to them, and they say they might even setup a video production team in the future and would need me to join them, but for now this project is giving me weekly RM 300, which in USD, is about $70, I'm single, and I don't spend needlessly, so the money I earn, I save it into my bank, well it's not much I know, but I feel that it's something, I can't stop to feel that I am FINALLY doing something real, something that I love and at the same time, allows me to earn some income, and this could lead to new opportunities for me, so I am going with the flow, every week I will go to their place, do a video recording session, go back and edit, and submit to them, and they'll pay me weekly. 

So, all in all, I feel good, I'm finally earning money, I might even be able to give me parents some money if I do continue this project. At the very least, I'm not loitering around and shaking my leg all day at home thinking how to get a project in, how to get income, so yeah, can I say that I am finally doing something in my life ? Because in the past I've felt I'm pretty useless, my lil sister is a nurse, and she's earning alot more than I am ( No I'm not jealous, I'm very happy for her ) and here I am, sitting at home, pretending that I am looking for projects for my photography but the truth is, I'm not, and no project or money is coming in, but now, I can't say the same because I finally am doing something, and I love it, so I guess I can say I am finally doing something ?

429,"Basically, my boyfriend and I have been dating for just over a month. He's 20, and I'm turning 20 in June. He's great! He's a great person, and we've been friends for 7-ish years. We have similar personalities and he's my best friend. We've both agreed that we might be in this for the long run-- we've known each other long enough and well enough that we can make that kind of agreement.

There are some things, though, that make that idea not... work right. For one thing, he snores-- it's not the loudest in the world, and it's something we can probably fix, but I am a VERY particular sleeper so it's already hard having someone else in my bed. Like I said, that's probably something we can work on and move past.

There are other things, though: he has depression, which isn't a dealbreaker for me because I am also mentally ill, but he REFUSES to get help. I want to go into psychology so he relies on me to provide that kind of emotional support, but I physically can't be someone's faux therapist (I am not even in post-secondary so I feel awful even trying because I don't feel confident in what I'm doing) as well as their significant other, hands-down (and neither can anyone else, in my opinion). This makes me withdraw and it makes it hard for me to go to him with my own troubles. I believe that 100% open communication is the most important thing in any relationship, so I feel terrible for lots of reasons.

He also says things that, in general, annoy me. Like, he categorizes his self-loathing as a separate illness from his depression. It Is Not. He also makes a lot of fat jokes about himself. First off, he's not even??? Fat???? He's a bit chubby/heavyset, but his job before this one was literally moving heavy objects-- that's just the fat that surrounds muscle. Because that's how the human body works. And being fat is neither a personality trait nor is it something bad!

He's ""okay"" with everything. He doesn't have any real ambition-- he's going to be an engineer because he IS smart enough for that, so why not? I want to travel? Sure, fine with him. I want to sit and watch TV with my dinner? Sure. I'm in kind of a sexy mood? Okay, sure, we can have sex, if that's what I want. Am I selfish for wanting him to also have the drive to do these things with me? Am I two-faced for wanting him to argue with some of the things I want? 

I'm also an artist, so when I show him my work, it's just, ""Cool."" When I press and ask what he likes about it, he just says, ""Everything."" I get that it's kind of hard to articulate, but I've given him the terms to describe it. Just pick your favourite thing about the art, is that so hard?

I also feel like he idolizes me a little. He says that it's fine, but last year, I was in a relationship where I myself idolized my partner, and I can see the signs. I don't know how to gently tell him that it's Not Fine. He says things like, ""You're perfect"" and says things that strongly, strongly imply that I am the only thing that brings him happiness. I mean, he's a grocery store cashier during the COVID-19 pandemic so... maybe?

I'm also sad because we can't talk, anymore. When we were friends, we could talk endlessly and for hours. Now we just talk about work. He works at my parents' grocery store so I KNOW ALREADY about how terrible customers can be, and I KNOW that it's busy and I KNOW that \[our coworker with vertigo\] needs more time off. Shit sucks! There are probably other things to talk about, aren't there? Right? There were before we got together...

I have a hard time bringing most of this up with him, because of aforementioned reasons, but I just want to hear outside opinions before I have this conversation. I don't even know how I'd bring it up, because I've tried to have a discussion about how our relationship is going before, and I start with, ""So, is there anything you'd like me to change?"" (not on a personality scale but on like a 'is there anything about the relationship that makes you worried?') and he always says, ""No,"" so I can't go into detail about the concerns that I have. I feel bad about bringing him down because I know that he feels down about himself and also everything in general a lot.

On the other side, though: he's SO GREAT. He's so thoughtful and caring. He says the sweetest things, and I definitely love him. If there was a person that I'm supposed to spend the rest of my life with, it's him. I have a weird Thing where non-familial relationships in my life only last 4 years. No idea why, and I certainly don't do it on purpose. So the fact that ours has lasted so long is definitely a good sign! We have similar interests. They're not lined up at the moment, but we have enough context to the other's to know what the other is talking about.

I also know that I'm not perfect in the relationship. There are things about us that don't line up on his side, too (perhaps less? I'm not sure. If he registers anything, he won't tell me).

ANYWAYS. Bottom line is: should I break up with my boyfriend? Am I just freaking out? I can give more deets if needed. I do want things to work out, because he's so important to me. Is there any advice anyone can give me about talking to him?

Thank you for reading &lt;3

TL;DR: My boyfriend is depressed and refuses to get treated and I have an interest in psychology so he depends on me in that way; he is often wrong but he has a way of saying things that Are True, technically, even if the base is way off and I can't argue with it; he doesn't have any strong opinions or feelings about doing things or not doing things; he thinks a little too highly of me; we can't seem to talk anymore.

430,"21 Since I can remember, I've always been uncomfortable around men. Idk if its sexual repression but I just never felt save. And it's not about sexism or social construction since this is just my microexperience. 

I've never been raped. Never been abused by any men. I've lived most my life surrounded by women. My father has been rather absent so I've never made a connection with him. All I know from him is his trips for ""work"" and his amateur porn.

But besides that??? J mean...example..I can approach a strange men and ask them for direction and stuff but when I see a group of men..no matter their age (as long as theyre 15+)I just don't feel comfortable.

The thing is, I've only met nice guys. Not the pejorative nice guys, but kind people. Chill people. Respectfull people. Nothing outrageous or these things the media like to portray. And yet...

I've done therapy before but she never seemed to be able to help me. I have no actual past men trauma except my dad's porn. 

And it sucks bc j know I'm heterosexual so it interferes In my dating ability. I can't talk to attractive men either cause they intimidate me too. But they don't have to be. In general I have a hard time connecting and sympathizing with men. Especially a Group. J don't know how to ""blend in"" with men.

With women it's so easy. I approach them just fine and have a chat. But men are so alien to me. And they tend to be so serious and closed off and ""stoic"" all the time, which makes me uneasy to just go to them. If you look at them and smile, they don't always smile back lol. And if you make a joke, they look at you in a confused way. 

And I have been in dates. My fear may only show when I walk past a group of police officers and fear they think j committed a crime. But I can have conversation with them. It's just...becoming their friend is basically impossible. They don't stick around, it seems.",31Mar2020,1

I was kind of hoping he did ask again because I would have given it. I was so nervous I just couldn‚Äôt ask for it myself. 

Anyway, for a couple of weeks I kept feeling sick, losing my appetite over thinking the same scenario again and again. Guys have asked for my number before but I haven‚Äôt really paid much attention to it but this guy for some reason has made me feel like this.

438,"I'm not sure how long this post is going to be, but I'll try not to ramble. 

I have two option in front of me at the minute, and I have been thinking about them since January, but every day I favour a different option depending on my mood- so I don't trust myself to be able to make this decision by following 'my heart'.

I am currently studying on a campus in Luton, \~250 Miles away from home. I chose this uni because it was far from my parents who I was concerned about controlling me too much and because I got an 'unconditional offer' from them, which meant I could justifiably not stress about my exams. I spent 2 years at 6th From doing Psychology, English Lang, and Economics. I only went because I already studied there in high school and I didn't apply anywhere else. I didn't know what I wanted to do, so when I researched other schools, I didn't even know what I was looking for from them. During those 2 years, my mental health just went through the floor- all under my parent's noses. I hung out with the kind daughter of an alcoholic, a binging/purging anorexic just like me. We'd smoke cigarettes together every break time, go out and party every couple of months, but mostly I'd buy my own alcohol and save it to get tipsy before bed so I could sleep. The thing is, she worked so damn hard, she had a full-time job, temporarily moved out of home, and still studied a fuck-ton. She wasn't the only one at the end of the second year who was sick of my complaining and fucking about while everyone was trying to study. I wasn't expecting to live to see graduation, so I wasn't really bothered about starting to study now, so late into the course. I applied to universities that were so bottom of the leaderboards that no one had ever heard of them, and they'd take anyone. The requirements for the course I am currently on was about 60 points, which isnt even a full set of 3 passes. 

My exam results came in and i got ACD, a total of exactly 100 points. And off to Luton, I went. Living on my own in a studio that cost 100% of my maintenance loan plus ¬£70 out of my pocket. I quickly spiralled when I realised the things taught in the first year are so simple that I can get 79% on assignments with 20% attendance. I was drinking and eating so much every day of every week that I spent at least ¬£2000 until now and gained quite a few kilos.

I turned to prostitution as I was near London, and so were all the men willing to meet with me. I tried working in retail for a little while, but it disgusted and exhausted me in a different way than escorting, and I couldn't cope there. Plus the number of heroin addicts that would rob us every day definitely didn't make me feel any safer walking home alone at night in that town. This has caused me some serious identity issues, and I don't know if I can redeem myself and be worthy of life again as a whole after so willingly branding myself a cheap whore. 

Then all of a sudden it was time to come home for christmas. I never got out of my overdraft, but I still splashed on my family who was none the wiser because all they've seen were straight A's in the first semester. That's when I re-established contact with an old friend and now current boyfriend. I told him everything before we even met and hes still wasting time and effort on me, so he has a heart of absolute gold. 

Now here is my dilemma. I either continue studying in Luton for 2 more years, i don't know how that will go because i am not capable of healthily dealing with stress, or any sort of workload, on my own. I have no support system there, only destructive coping mechanisms. **OR** I apply to the much better university my boyfriend is at and go against all advice everyone has given me. Everyone is telling me to stay and finish, but they don't know the toxicity there. The people that do know are okay with me starting year 1 again, but I still would need to pick a course. I am currently doing management, I've never had any contact with it before and would not switch to a similar course. This is offputting to my parents who hate the idea of more debt, and me being behind 1 year in education. I have been so wrapped up in depression my whole life that I don't know what I enjoy enough to want to work hard at and successfully study. I have always just got the grades I needed so my parents would let me isolate myself. 

This turned out to be much longer than I thought, my apologies! 

TLDR: 

1: Easy pass of Business Bachelor degree &gt; mental health deterioration in arguably the worst town in the UK.

2: Applying to a course I don't care for but at a better uni, closer to home and with a support group that will help me continue personal growth&gt; 12k more debt and a year behind, worse accommodation conditions, and starting all over again in first yearChristmasI'm not sure how long this post is going to be, but I'll try not to ramble.

439,"I had this childhood friend since I was like 8 we were 3 years apart. he moved away once he was 15 I was 12 and it was overall a really tough time for me because middle school. Anyways we only spoke occasionally over Instagram or snapchat and that turned into only texting when some occation occured like a birthday or graduation. I've always had a feeling he had a crush on me but I had a crush on his brother who was 2 years older then me so I never gave it mind. 

suddenly a year and a half ago he texted me our ages were 16 and 19 and we stayed texting for awhile which grew into calls. He has always been dubbed as the ""nice"" or ""good"" brother of his family. . and it was true he was always really nice. I started to grow feelings for him due to that fact and how he spoke to me. And he told me he had liked me ever since we were young which was weird because the age difference and he had a girlfriend at the time he was still near me. They broke up after he moved. 

Our relationship began to grow quickly because I liked him too. He would always facetime me and talk about visiting me which he did at one point until he just stopped. Ghosted. Never replied to me again after one day we hadn't even had an argument or anything. I cried for months about this because I like to be told reasons like it wouldnt have hurt so bad if he had told me. And since then I got a bf but I still think about it. He didn't block me on anything so I could see his post still but he just never talked to me again.

It's difficult to maintain social distance with people due to them not taking it seriously, and my supervisors are angry that I am wearing a mask.

Recently my employers posted a note that WHO does not recommend the general public wear masks, and have cited that as a reason for me to stop wearing the mask. While the WHO notice is true, I am also aware that N95 masks protect people from contracting the virus. I am at serious risk of death if I get infected because I have multiple comorbidities.

What are my options if my employer threatens to fire me if I continue to wear the mask? I don't believe I am harming anyone from wearing it, and it is not keeping me from doing my factory job.

443,"Hi guys, 

- This is long
- After advice on dealing with an unstable person &amp; pregnancy tests

I‚Äôll start by saying I‚Äôm extremely anxious about this and would greatly appreciate  serious advice. Thanks in advance. 

I had been conversing with this girl back and forth for a couple weeks. Not consistently. Never met before. Just have mutual friends. We both had the intention of having sex. I was about 2 months out of a relationship and she was the first girl I slept with since. I made it clear to her that it was just a causal thing and she was fully aware and agreed. (Half of the reason for casual is because I had some serious red flags from her, but thought fuck it she seems like she‚Äôs on the same page) This girl came over to my place late one night for a hook up. 

We had protected sex, she left.  

We spoke a couple times since that night. Not sexually but more so friendly. Things were good. 

A week after we had sex she sent me a Snapchat out of no where of a home pregnancy test. My heart drops. I start panicking. I keep telling my self that everything will be okay - I used protection. (Yes I know it‚Äôs not 100% fool proof) 

She tells me that her period is 2 days late. I ask her if she took a test and her responses duck my questions and are very hot/cold and un-informative (1st red flag). Further on she says she is going to take the test. I am anxiously waiting by my phone. She replies saying nothing but ‚ÄúI am going to bed. Goodnight.‚Äù (2nd red flag) 

I am fucking shitting my self. 

I message back saying ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt shut me out like that please tell me what happened‚Äù blah blah blah... after waiting by my phone for 10mins, gripping it tight and feeling like ripping my eyes out of my head, she finally replies and says it‚Äôs negative. - I still feel no relief - 

After that I tried to be as calm and rational as I could and talked to her expressing all my concerns about her well being and mine. - we are both young (19 &amp; 20), have never even met before we had sex and don‚Äôt know each other from a bar of soap. She tells me that in the worst case scenario she would have a termination but tells me she might change her mind. This has me extremely worried. I understand that it‚Äôs her body. But c‚Äômon. 

Anyway I call her and we both calm down, she tells me that she will let me know when she has her period and that she will take another test 2 days later and one more on the day that marks a week since missed period. 

I message her today (2 days after first home pregnancy test) and ask how she is and if there‚Äôs any update. Trying to be as nice and sensitive as I can. 

Her first response is ‚Äúwtf‚Äù followed by ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have any more tests I‚Äôm getting them on Thursday‚Äù 

She told me on the night of her first test (Sunday) that she had 2 more tests left over. One for Tuesday and Friday (Friday being a week from missed period)... so she either wasn‚Äôt telling me on the truth on Sunday night or tonight. (3rd red flag) which I call her out on. 

She tells me that she panicked and took the remaining 2 tests on the following Monday. Which were supposedly negative. 

I really don‚Äôt know what to believe. I am so fucking scared, I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôs telling me the truth or not. This is very blunt but I feel like I‚Äôve had a good read of her personality over the time that I‚Äôve spoken to her/followed on social media to assume that she may not be very stable or trustworthy person under pressure. 

If worst comes to worst and she is pregnant I feel like she will keep it. We don‚Äôt even know each other. Our lives are just getting started. I‚Äôve never had sex with out a condom besides my ex girlfriend. I am very cautious with these things. 

So down to the questions
 
1. Pregnancy test - we had sex almost 2 weeks ago (Saturday) and her period was due on the following Friday but is now 5 days late. 

She took her first home pregnancy test 3 days after her late period, then one on the next day, and day after that. All 3 tests are negative. 

What is the legitimacy of this? How accurate can a home test be and how soon should it be taken for the best result? 

2. This girl is very hot and cold, seems to feel attacked when I ask her to keep me in the loop. Has said things like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have to give you this information‚Äù and that it does not ‚Äúaffect or concern me‚Äù. She tells me one thing and then says the other. 

How can I deal with someone like this? I feel like she may or may not be hiding the truth from me. I am a very mature and rational thinker but unfortunately I feel like she is the complete opposite. I understand that it‚Äôs her body and she can do what she pleases but this is unbelievable. 

I know this whole situation is early days, I‚Äôm probably fine. But fuck me, I have never felt this type of pressure before and I have no idea what I‚Äôm going to do. 

Thank you for reading.",31Mar2020,1
444,"I dated someone in my university class, who hurt me quite badly (emotionally). They did many things during the duration of the degree that hurt me/confused me, none of which I've ever received any apology for. 

We broke up a year ago. Since then, I have had to see my ex constantly (while they ignore me). We are in the same university group chat, which is used for assignment announcements, help, etc. Due to it being our third year, the classes were a lot smaller, and there were times we'd be sitting literally a chair away from each other. 

Other things, such as me having to give a presentation in front of my ex (and the rest of the class), hearing my exes voice behind me talking to other classmates, being in the building where we met and spent most of our time together. Even writing essays reminds me of my ex, because we'd often study together. 

Anyway, we broke up a year ago. I still feel very sad and hurt about things, although I have made slight progress in many ways. I miss my ex all the time, and am very hurt that this person did what they did and even with the virus/end of uni (ending this week) they haven't reached out once. I feel completely forgotten.

What I want to ask opinions on is, would it be that because I'm surrounded by all these reminders, that it's affecting my ability to move on? I have never been hurt/sad for this amount of time with any other ex and to be honest it has been extremely difficult. At times I feel defective, and wonder why I am still hurt. 

So yes, that's what I'd like advice on, really. Would it be these reminders that are causing me to not be able to move on properly? Also, now that uni has technically finished, I wonder if I should remove myself from the group chat. It is useful in many ways, but there is no real need for it now.",31Mar2020,1
445,"I had a dream I was raped by my stepfather, it was extremely vivid and almost felt like I was conscious in the dream. This was a couple nights ago and ever since, I can't help but think what if it was a repressed memory. The thing I find most disgusting about it is even though I felt panicked and disgusted in the dream, I was almost in shock and couldn't even fight back, it felt almost like I'd  been drugged or something. 

I feel sick to my stomach, he's the nicest guy, he's been like my real father, and it would break him to hear this, and I'm not about to accuse or tell anyone, incase it's literally just a dream. But I feel violated, terrified to see him (I live in the same house as him) and I don't know what to do, part of me thinks it was so real it could only be a memory, but I had 0 recollection until that night I had the dream.

I feel freaked out and very scared, I can't tell my mum because she'd probably kick him out when it hasn't even happened. I don't know what to do, I'm terrified that it might have.

There's just 2 months left for me to get out of here but I'm drowning with anxiety. I can't get myself to study or just even read the agenda. I don't know what to do.

448,"Hi everyone. This is a long one. TLDR at the bottom.

So a bit of context, my friend is a new mum. She's 18years old and her child is now 7 months old. I've been friends with her for a while and said I'd put her situation on here to see if anyone can help with some advice on where she stands legally and if the police will do anything. 

Her Ex and the father is not allowed to message her, see her child without it being in a meeting centre or have anything to do with his child until she is 2 years old. He's on probation and not a nice man. He took his 4 weeks paternity leave and didn't once come to meet his daughter. 

Now, my friend, she's got a part time job, 2 nights a week working with me in a club. She still loves at home and her daughter stays at home with my friends mum. Otherwise she isn't out and home 90% of the time. 

Once, maybe twice a month she will come out drinking with us and again her daughter is at home, safe and with granny and grandad. 

My friends ex is threatening her to call social services because apparently she isn't allowed to go out at all. Which isn't true as social services had a meeting with my friend the day after she gave birth and said she can still go out as long as she finds the right social life and mum life balance. Which she's done perfectly for 18 year old. Her parents have really helped her out and given her as much support as they can to make sure she can still be 18 but also be a mother. 

The question is, where dose she stand in regards to potentially calling the police on her ex? I know for a fact that it isn't against the law to go out drinking with your friends once a month as a mother, as most parents will have a night once a month or every other month to go and see friends without the children. She isn't left alone to fend for herself.

Sorry it's so long but she's really stressing about this and I got her permission to post this here without using any of the names involved. 

Thank you for any advice.

19F here. I have a SERIOUS celebrity crush - I‚Äôm not going to specify who, as I actually don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs all that relevant. 

This crush admittedly has a lot to do with physical attraction. I find myself saving pictures of them, and I‚Äôve noticed that my Instagram algorithm is even showing me them via explore page. What feels different about this though, is that I also find myself watching their recent interviews, taking note of which films they say they like, reading up as much as I can about them - in short, it‚Äôs as if I‚Äôm actually trying to get to KNOW them. I also find myself fantasising about scenarios where I meet them, and the kind of conversations I‚Äôd have with them. 

I‚Äôm not concerned about this getting to stalker level or anything, I know I would never do anything beyond follow them on social media lol. It‚Äôs just that I‚Äôve never had a celebrity crush like this before. I have friends who consider certain celebrities ‚Äòhot‚Äô, but I haven‚Äôt seen them as invested as this, which makes me question myself. 

I‚Äôm more or less looking for a second opinion on whether this is healthy, and any advice for dealing with this kind of thing.

I just moved from a tiny apartment to a somewhat big house and I‚Äôm clueless of what to buy to extend my Internet overall (WiFi plus cable). Literally went from a powerline to now feeling overwhelmed with all the information I got .
Important info, big new house, with lan exits in every room. Where I want to have WiFi in all (or almost ) every division of the house, plus some type of cable power in my office where play online/ work etc...  At the moment I just have a switch to my office where split to pc, PlayStation and tv. 
What is the best option, so I can have all I want ? Is it a second router/modem , is it the new mesh technology , is it both ? 
And for 8 divisions with lan exits I have 5 spots on the original router. 
I can do some tech stuff (not too advanced ), but enough if I would need to setup  something more ‚Äúin depth ‚Äú

What do you recommend?

456," 

kinda feel like i am the friend being sidelined, or was, as it kinda already happened. we used to hangout alot, and now (pre quarantine and covid-19) we didnt hangout at all. he never invited me over, and when he did invite me to do something he blew me off. its frustrating cause I just moved back to my school this year, and my friend had gotten rly close to other people.

i met a mutual friend and we get along rly well, but he has never invited me to hangout, while i have invited him nearly dozens of times. its confusing because i get along well with him in school, we both have similar senses of humor and like southpark, and we just have a fun time. he seems alot more interested when talking to other people though, and some of the kids who are in our friend group are already really good friends with him.

it is frustrating and confusing because nobody is really mean to me, and i get along quite well with everyone in the group, its just that i feel like i am on the outside looking in. i dont get invited to stuff, movies, and hangouts.

its funny because the ex-best friend also blew off the mutual friend, and he is always complaining about nobody inviting him to hangout or including him, but i messaged him that weekend! I kinda told him this, but apologized after the fact.

in another incident, I asked the mutual friend, who i was trying to hangout with, if he was just being nice or did he actually want to hangout with me, and he said that he actually wants to hangout. he said yes, and is generally a pretty straight-forward guy. he is also pretty busy, but he always has time to hangout with other friends on the weekends..

i havent rly been invited to hangout with anyone since November.

i am worried that i come across as clingy sometimes..sorry if this post is confusing, i will clarify any questions in the comments.

457,"So about two weeks ago my husband calls me and explains this to me. One of his friends (who is 21, we‚Äôre both 28) got kicked out of his grandparents house because they found out he went to a strip club and spent like $100. Friend needs a temporary place to stay so he asks if friend can stay with us until he finds a more permanent place to stay. 

This past weekend there were multiple people at our house and they were all on our couch and playing video games on my husbands PS4 like it was their house. And the weekend before that, there were two people that just came over uninvited because of him which is clearly becoming a problem. 

On top of that, he works in a place where to TWO people have tested positive for COVID19 this week so yeah this situation unfortunately isn‚Äôt getting better. 

I have already reached my breaking point. Neither of us want this friend here anymore because we love our space and having an entire house to ourselves. 

Should we tell this friend to start paying a very high amount in rent to get him to leave sooner than later? Or should we tell him that he needs to be out the last day of April? If it was up to me I would tell him he can‚Äôt stay longer than a month but it‚Äôs too late for that.

I was wearing a t shirt, hoodie, PJ bottoms (with no underwear on underneath) socks and shoes as i dont have slippers. 

I went into the kitchen where two members of staff were cleaning away, I made my drink and went back into my room.

Apparently when I was in the kitchen making my drink and mindlessly chatting to the staff, wearing aforementioned PJ bottoms with no underwear underneath. That its ""inapropriate"" to not wear underwear underneath PJ bottoms.....

Firstly, how the fuck did they know I wasnt wearing pants underneath them? And secondly why does it matter? Were they looking THAT closely at my crotch?! I dont understand!!

So because of all the news and fear widespread everyone has been on edge. Especially the older folk...so I‚Äôll skip that part and get to the detail. I‚Äôm a 21 year old male. I went to cook breakfast one morning and he said he wanted to have a talk. The talk was either you don‚Äôt see any of your friends or girlfriend or you stay here and go to work( I work at Amazon). Off logic considering they‚Äôll let me work in a warehouse filled with actual at risk strangers but they refuse to let anyone contact or see us. The quarantine thing wasnt a big deal but when they started to scream and cuss constantly at all of their children for something simple as checking the mail or going on a neighborhood walk ,then it began to become a social problem throughout the house. I had been sanitizing, showering, wearing gloves and an n95 about a week prior to this talk. He said because of high blood pressure he was at risk but when I talked to doctors they said high blood pressure isn‚Äôt a risk of fatal illness via covid19 ,they‚Äôre religious and they‚Äôve never once listened to their children in the entirety of us growing up. But will zealously watch cnn and fox rather than find actual and medically accurate sources. In February he banned my sister‚Äôs boyfriend from our house for life because she snuck him in one night. Then he said I couldn‚Äôt see my gf or friends who have been staying home due to the virus panic and their jobs also shutting down. Thing is, maybe we‚Äôre all asymptotic or we just don‚Äôt have it. Then their fear started to become aggressive and self centered and they would ‚Äújoke‚Äù about kicking me out. I knew it was foreshadowing something because they said they‚Äôd never kick us out. They even agreed to meet up with my gun enthusiast friend who they denied me access to if this ‚Äúboogaloo‚Äù shit unfolded I went to deliver some ammo to his house because he needed some and I ordered it for him. Which o told them about. When I came back they thought that I had taken a lyft home. But lyft had been closed down for weeks prior. Before asking me they automatically assumed that I was endangering everybody and took a lyft. I told them to look at the news on their phone to see that lyft had actually been closed. My mom wouldn‚Äôt even look at me or talk to me. No apology either. Then the next morning is where this talk began or my stepfather said that my feelings don‚Äôt matter that anything I said or felt didn‚Äôt matter.

As I entered the house I asked them if they wanted to talk at all and they said no, so I continued packing my things. After that my mom came to me and she wanted to talk but at that point we were long past negotiating. She goes downstairs in tears and my step dad comes upstairs and tells me my mom is crying you should go apologize. I don‚Äôt respond to him I just continue packing my things.

HUGE MISTAKE I KNOW, now that I think about it. She's her own person and maybe it's not as easy for her to lose the tether she has connecting her individuality to what others say.

My parent's verbal and attempts to guilt me don't affect my mood at all now. At the end of the day I know we love each other and I know they do.

So when I was young, I was introduced to the Little Einsteins and the world of art and classical music. It was amazing and I was devastated when the show was cancelled after the 2nd season. I put it aside since I was younger. But now that I'm older and helping to take care of my younger brother, I realised that he needs this show just as how I benefitted from it.

I posted my request on r/disney but it was deleted by moderators for whatever reason. My question is, how do I politely ask Disney that there should be a reboot of the show? I've tried email, but that also failed for an unknown reason. 
I'm pretty lost especially since the golden age of learning for my brother is closing soon. So, how do you get in touch with Disney? Can someone help me reach out to a representative of Disney, like an imagineer or someone in charge of TV network? If not, where can I find all the episodes of Little Einsteins?

487,"We moved in on 07.03.20, provided updated meter readings to the letting agent and gave all old energy bills to them, to pass onto the landlord. ¬£850 since September.

The energy companies have reduced customer service due to coronavirus, so now the letting agent can‚Äôt contact them to change the readings and pay the bill. 

This should have been paid and settled before we moved in. It‚Äôs now costing us more money as we are forced to stay with the expensive supplier. 

Can we bill the landlord/letting agent for the costs this has incurred and how would we work it out? 

There are other works the landlord is refusing to do now ‚Äòbecause of coronavirus‚Äô that easily could have been done before. Eg. They won‚Äôt fix the unusable freezer, roof leak, massive stain on the ceiling, light fitting, intercom, won‚Äôt do electrical testing, sticky door handle to bathroom (fire hazard). 

Is there any way we deserve reduced rent?

489,"The title says it all really.  


I've been seeing a psychologist lately because of some mental issues i've been having, and we recently spoke about Bipolar disorder. As she was listing things off, the more and more of those boxes I ticked. All of the classic signs I fit almost to a T, and to me that's really really fucking scary. I always thought I had depression, because that's what I was originally diagnosed with at 16, and have carried with me till now, but now i'm sitting at this crossroads, kind of noting things down, and trying to keep track and not spin out of control with fear. I just need some advice from the community on this. Please  


I need some examples of good interactions you've had or experienced with someone in your life, close or not so close who's Bipolar, or things maybe you yourself have learnt and experienced being Bipolar? I'm absolutely terrified of losing the very few friends I have, and during my life i've not heard about one positive experience people have had with someone with Bipolar, it's been more things like Relationships breaking down, friendships being too strained to last, and just negative after negative.   


Coping mechanisms, things you do as friends or partners, anything and everything positive please. I'm trying to not let this get the better of me, taking the first step of getting an actual diagnosis if I have it, and seeking help is a big one, but it just feels insurmountable right now",31Mar2020,1

491,"There is a lot of background stuff to this whole situation but I‚Äôll try keep it brief. Please ask for more information if you think I haven‚Äôt provided enough. 

I‚Äôm 21 female and have three younger siblings 17M, 13F and 12F. 

Some Background:

My parents split up October 2018. This in itself is a massive other story as I was the one who sat them down and got them to talk through a breakup. This was while they and my siblings came to visit me at uni during my final year. 

The reason I got them to break up is because my parents have never had a good relationship. My entire life all I‚Äôve known is them arguing shouting and being toxic to each other. And I ended up being fed up stuck in the middle and got them to end it. 

It‚Äôs only in the last couple of years that I found out why my mum was always so miserable and irritable and that‚Äôs because my dad has cheated on her multiple times during their relationship. 

I only know my mums side of the story and that being that he cheated when they where together in the beginning, they broke up then she took him back after he begged her for forgiveness. They then had me and my brother and he cheated again while she was pregnant with my sister and again sometime while my youngest sister was little. The relationship he is in now (they are also engaged) supposedly started after the breakup in October but my mum and I are very certain it started before so that‚Äôs another unfaithful part. 

She doesn‚Äôt tell me a lot so these are bits I‚Äôve picked up and my dad has said he did sleep with two other women but that‚Äôs all he‚Äôs said, no timeframes etc. 

Now I‚Äôve always been closer with my dad than my mum while growing up as he treated me with very obvious favouritism compared to my siblings (which at the time I didn‚Äôt know was because of the fact that he is actually incredibly manipulative and cruel). He was very mentally and emotionally abusive to all 4 of us and my mother (thankfully not so much my sisters but my brother an I got the worst of it, especially my brother who my dad has always had a problem with since he was a baby) which I only know realise after being in therapy for anxiety and depression since my second year of university (I graduated July 2019) And since being with my first boyfriend for 4 years. He would use my boyfriend as a punishment for me and plenty of other stuff and seeing my boyfriend‚Äôs family made me realise a lot of the stuff I thought was normal really actually wasn‚Äôt at all. 

Okay I hope that‚Äôs enough details to set a picture but again please ask any questions for me to elaborate. 

Now I am disgusted at him for what he did to my mum while we where growing up and I will forever regret not being a better daughter to her while growing up as I definitely did not treat her fairly and would always gang up on her with my dad to stay on his good side which I am so upset about just thinking back. 

My mum and I are much closer now and still getting even better. 

Since I didn‚Äôt want to loose my dad I told him I was disappointed and upset with him for what he‚Äôd done but I didn‚Äôt want it to get between us. Unfortunately this has meant that he thinks I‚Äôm totally fine with it now when it just makes me angry to think about what he did and he should never have gotten away with it for so long. 

My dad lives with his fianc√©e in the UK while my mum and siblings live in France. (They all lived together in France for about a year before the breakup and before he met his fianc√©e) 

Before meeting his new partner my dad rarely took the opportunity to visit when the courts allowed and always made excuses to not see my siblings. But since meeting his fianc√©e he has been actively trying to push himself into their lives which would be a good thing appart from the fact he‚Äôs only showing any worry or care for 13yr sister. He‚Äôs manipulated her into thinking she‚Äôs unhappy at home because my mum isn‚Äôt caring for her properly (I‚Äôve spoken to her myself and she‚Äôs saying she hates living there because she‚Äôs made to do chores and go to school) but it‚Äôs being blown out of proportion and my dad and his fianc√©e have been incredibly horrible and rude to my mum over text and phone telling her she is poisoning their minds and being an unfit mother etc. 

He‚Äôs called the police on her and is threatening to call CPS because she won‚Äôt let him take 13yr sister to live with them in the UK. 

I‚Äôve got to the end of my patience with all this and I want to cut him out if he ends up calling CPS on her because she is absolutely not being an unfit caregiver at all. But I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm overwhelmed and overreacting to all this. 

I need advice and I‚Äôm so sorry it‚Äôs so rambled and may not make sense so please ask me to elaborate on anything at all to help clear the picture. 

Also to add some info his fianc√©e has a 15M son and she‚Äôs openly said about how much she‚Äôs always wanted daughters. Which makes me think even more she has a big part behind all this too as my dad never showed this much care and effort towards any of us this much before. (Appart from me as he had been very supportive of me which is why I‚Äôm so torn as I just can‚Äôt stand that he‚Äôs being so horrible to the others)

Thank you so much for reading through this, my mind is all over the place so I‚Äôm so sorry it‚Äôs so long and mumbled!!",31Mar2020,1

Some say that it's to avoid rejection, but you can still tell him ""Sorry, I don't want your number"" or ""Sorry, I don't know you well enough, I won't call"".

But the entire point is to not make them feel pressured to reject him... So they reject him because they think that he should think that women should just deal with the risk of rejecting a violent man?

Like, he's aware that some women think ""please don't be violent"" while rejecting, or maybe they don't think that and their day gets ruined, so to instantly stop the anxiety he makes it easier for the woman but that's appearently cowardish because...... women want to reject as harshly as possible to release some steam against a poor sap? Do they get a high from rejecting men?

497,"Okay so right to the meat, my little brother-in-law (he's 15-16) loves military soldiers. From touring American war museums, to walking on old destroyers, and has taken up getting the gear to dress like a ww1 USA soldier. All just a healthy interest from the outside perspective.
But, the kid is homeschooled and only really talks to his parents, grandparents, sister, and me. Which means he has a very closed opinion on the real world. So when he took up looking into Germany and Japan, he fell in live with the tanks, planes, weaponry and the general engineering. Now he made the jump and has a full on Nazi tank commander uniform he wears around the house. He won't stop talking about ww2 and the nazis specifically, now he's getting defensive when me or gis sister comments on how evil they were. And of course his parents are silent om the matter.

So my brother is 12, obese, has no mental disorders, but he doesn't listen ever. He can get told to do something, he starts doing it for a little bit but then just shrugs it off and does what got him in trouble again. For example, today we got up early this morning to work on online schooling and he got told while our parents were home to stay awake and when he went back to sleep they would wake him up just for him to go back to sleep. Then they left and I've been telling him to stay awake but I've just gave up on him, so now he's currently asleep on the couch.

510,"I am 22[M]. I've never been in a relationship and never had sex. I am a shy guy and also have confidence issue. I have never approached any girl.

I had a crush on a girl who lives in the same building as mine. She is fair, tall,... matches well with my choices. Later, I found out she has a boyfriend who lives in this same building. OK, after knowing that, I am sad and trying to forget that girl; started taking weed again.

Over time, my attention has kinda shifted to the boyfriend. No, I'm not secretly a homo. It's my insecurities making me to observe him for no good reason other than getting more and more envious and sad.

I'm having thoughts where i put him on a pedestal while bringing myself down. Thoughts like: he's a great guy with great qualities, he knows how to get a girl and take care of her, keep her happy; he's confident, mature, assertive, he is smart, attractive. BTW, he smokes weed too.

Accompanied by negative thoughts about me: I shall never get a girl, I'm not smart, unattractive, girls wont think twice of me, I'm still immature, I can't talk like a mature guy, not worthy of anyone's attention, I'm not man enough.

I'm not after the girl anymore, since she is already with someone. Now, whenever I see the guy I feel like he possesses a greater social power than me and he is out here to make his presence felt; and it makes me cry and more inferior.

I've been suffering from this confidence issue since long. I realize that I have always been a nice guy, non assertive, shy, having difficulty taking to girls.

511,"Hi, I am a 15f. I have been in a very depressive state the last 2 years. I finally decided to talk with my mother about it. 2 months ago we visited a Mental Health hospital for kids, over the next couple of weeks I talked to a lot of doctors, psychologist, psychiatrist etc. Today one of them (I am not sure if she is a psychologist or a psychiatrist) had a meeting with me and my parents on the phone. We couldn't have a meeting in person because of Covid-19. In the beginning, they thought that I had depression like my mother, I had also strongly suspected that I had depression. The psychiatrist/psychologist told me that they don't think I have the classic form of depression, but something called a long-lasting depressive state. They base this on a couple of things in my life.

* A car crash my little brothers was in when I was 7 years old
* My parent's divorce 
* That I am being bullied in school

All these things have supposedly made me go into a depressing state. All this is something my parents told them. The thing is that I don't really agree. The car crash hasn't affected me in any way, my brother and everyone involved was perfectly fine. In fact, I was a little jealous because my brother got pizza at the hospital. I am affected by my parent's divorce but to a light degree. Then to the bulling. I have a lot of good friends at my school, we are kind of the outsiders but we are not being bullied. My parents always had the impression that I am miserable in school, I am not. There has been a few instances where some people may have said something stupid but it is rare. Yes, I am kind of an outsider but it doesn't affect me in any way. Therefore I have a hard time believing the diagnosis. Especially because it is based mainly on things my parents said. Everybody thought I had depression until they had a meeting with my parents.   
This is not the only diagnoses. They also suspect that I have a diagnosis, I don't remember the name of it but is on the autism spectrum. They base this diagnoses on a couple of things.

* I often walk on my tiptoes
* I don't function well socially
* I have a few weird topics that I am very interested in.

The only thing about this that is remotely true is that I walk on my tiptoes. I function very well socially, I have been a little withdrawn because of the depression thing though. My dad mentioned a lot that I have special interests for my age, and that they consume all of my free time. This is not true at all. I do not have any special interests at all. Yes, there are some things I find entertaining but to a very minimal degree. Over the next couple of weeks, I am going to have a lot of meeting with psychologists and psychiatrists. I am also going to take an IQ test. These meetings are gonna determinate if I have the second diagnosis.   
I can recognise myself in the first diagnosis to a degree, but not in the second. I am of course going to have meetings with them, so it isn't settled yet. It is very important to me that I mention that I trust these professionals 100% I just feel like they misunderstood a few things. I am also aware that due to my age and gender that it can seem like I want attention and want to have depression. This is not the case. Should I be clear with how I feel? Should I just accept the diagnosis? please help me

Reason I didn‚Äôt tell them exactly was because my parents wouldn‚Äôt have reacted well or would have panicked. This would have caused me to panic and be more under pressure. 

I also had a repeat year which my parents know about! 

Basically they know when I graduate! That being said my grades have been well so far. I‚Äôve taken counselling, seeing a professional and have learnt to manage my anxiety.

However ofcourse if in the future I do have any struggles I will definitely let them know and cop it. But for now I‚Äôve been doing well so far. 
They know when I graduate.
And yes I know it may show when I graduate but by then they won‚Äôt really ask but will just be happy I graduated!

Also my uni fees in gov funded so they aren‚Äôt paying for the course just to make it clear.

For some reason idk if I did the right thing ? 

I‚Äôm also worried is it bad that I took a gap year as well? The gap year was after I had finished my repeat year!

And I don't know what to change or fix to be someone that has more than 6 close friends who don't live near me. I need physical contact, I need to interact

But the kicker is I hate alcohol, I don't know how to talk about things that aren't technical stuff or science, I can't figure out small talk, I get nervous around guys (I'm a guy too), and the worst is I hate going out without someone I already know being there. And I want to change this because I want something to look forward to after the stay at home orders are done, but I know literally nothing will change except I'm going to work from the office instead of from home. But I don't know how to change it, and I don't know how to get comfortable with the things I don't like so I can go hang where everyone else is and meet people

So as a result of my depression my performance at work has been lacking, totally my responsibility,  but now I've received a final warning so if I dont improve enough in 6 weeks I'll lose my job.

If I reach 5 weeks and cant see an improvement and redemption in sight then I'll have to quit in order to still get a reference (I work in financial ops and wont be able to get another job without it).

I'm unlikely to be able to appeal the judgment successfully so my only options are to really knuckle down and/or take time off sick.

What I'm after is advice for if I do lose the job or rather have to leave in 5 weeks in order to get the reference.  I'm concerned about the mortgage primarily and my personal debt (like many people I have no savings). I dont think my partner will be able to pick up the slack for very long.

527,"So I have a quite good relationship with my boss and most of my colleagues. Recently I had my job performance evaluation and I got glowing review. All was going well, until my boss asked my what are we going to do with Janice (name changed).

Now a little back story, I started to work in this company last September and Janice transferred from another department, basically to do the same thing I do, but with a different channel. I was always amazed on how well we hit it off. It seemed that we agree on almost everything and understand each other from half a sentence. 

Back to my performance review. My boss thinks (and is backed by few other colleagues we share the office with) that Janice is just nice to me, so I would do some of her work. Since I'm not that busy and she always seems to be busy, I do some of her things, just to be a team member. My boss said that she's noticed that Janice, whenever she is asked to do something always comes to me and involves me. Basically my boss says that she just flirts with me, and acts busy, while her performance is shitty and she's on the brink of being fired.

I defended her a few times before, but never thought that I was just blind to her flirting and maybe that's why did some of her tasks. What I need an advice on is how to avoid such situations in future - is there some psychology course, book, reddit sub or post that would ""open my eyes"" and help me?

Now it's 1.5 years later, and we've been dating for 3, so it's getting serious. We talked and we're finacially stable enough to live by ourselves. There are... A lot of reasons why we don't want to live with her anymore. She's a nice person, but there's just a lot of drama all the time, she puts herself in questionable situations but she's always the victim (i.e. marrying someone she met online within a week only to find out he was lying about who he was the entire time), and she's finacially irresponsible. I'm tired of hearing how broke she is all time when she gets $500 a month from her parents, or after quitting her well paying job with no backup, or seeing her walk through the door with $80 of weed every week. I will mention that she has never been late on rent.

My roommate was recently offered a room in her new friend's house (which she now owns) in the same city her college and work is (she was temporarily laid off, but she's a registered CNA and can get a job anywhere right now). She hasn't decided on what to do yet, and it's been a couple weeks since she's said anything.

She mentioned to me that she would feel weird moving in with her friend because it wouldn't feel like HER home, rather it would just be her renting out a room in a house... But that's exactly how my boyfriend and I view her current living situation. Every single piece of furniture/cookware/whatever in the house belongs to us, aside from a bookshelf. The only difference is that she's on the lease.

The lease is up in about 5 months. We really don't want to move because of expenses, plus I'm close to family, and my boyfriend's job is across the street from our complex so we don't have to worry about sharing one car.

I was thinking about bringing it up and telling her that we want to advance the relationship and live more... privately? I want to apply to the complex without her name on the application to make sure we get approved for the lease renewal, but I'm not going to do it without her knowledge.

I'm 24 y/o bartender in a bar outside Boston. I've been working at the same bar for almost 2 years now, and this was my first bartending job. Ever since I started my boss - the owner of the bar- seemingly has had some grudge against me. Nitpicking how I do things, micromanaging, quick to tell me I'm wrong, and if I'm not he doesn't apologize for the false accusations. I've always been the first to volunteer to help with anything and been overwhelming grateful often subduing my ego to appease him and get on his good side. All in all he's a bully. However I love my coworkers, customers and the establishment itself. My coworkers are all fun, respectful and hard working teammates, the customers are nice, good conversationalists and tip well, and the establishment has great food and drinks, and turns a blind eye to us having a shot or two on shift. 

Most recently my biggest issue is during this pandemic he hasn't attempted to help me out at all. With all bars being mandated to be closed I'm out of a job and income, but who isn't?

i know it's not a big deal just delete the app forever but i'm 15f, everyone my age has instagram but i hate it. but in a few years i might like it and regret not posting this trip i don't know???? should i deactivate my account for good or just quickly post some pictures and then delete it???

i'm sorry if this is a whiny post i just have bad anxiety and every time i post to instagram i just start shaking and can't look at my phone for next few hours

also if i post now people are going to be saying ""why are you around people, you're supposed to be quarantined?"" but if i wait until coronavirus is gone i will be posting A YEAR LATE :(",31Mar2020,1
556,"Hello all,

I've been on Reddit for a couple of years now but this is my first post so I'm hoping it goes well!

(TL;DR @ the bottom of the page)

Let me first set the scene, I live in a studio apartment on the third floor of a 3-floor building. Each apartment has a sliding-glass door which leads out to an individual balcony. The floor of the balcony is made up of painted wood slats with a bit of room in between...I'm sure you can see where this is going.

So, the situation is my downstairs neighbor goes outside onto their balcony 5-7 times a day to smoke a cigarette and the smoke inevitably drifts up through the floor of my balcony. Because of the whole quarantine situation I'm currently working from home with a desk set up near my sliding door to let in the natural light. I usually work with the door open because the weather is fairly nice and so when they decide to smoke it ultimately fills my apartment with the unpleasant smell.

**Note:** I absolutely think that people should be allowed to do what they want (within reason) within the ""confines"" of their own home and that includes smoking on their balconies. While I personally don't smoke I understand that others do and thats fine. I don't have any underlying health issues, so its more annoying than anything critical.

Therefore, I have no intention of getting into a fight with this neighbor, stopping them from smoking, or involving landlords/etc. I was just wondering if anyone had any recommendations for ways to maybe avoid the smoke by blocking the floor with something or some other creative remedy. For now I've just been closing the door whenever I start to smell smoke or I hear them come outside which I'm fine with doing if there isn't any other solution.

**TL;DR - Downstairs neighbor cigarette smoke floats up through balcony and the smoke/smell enters my apartment through sliding-door window. Ways to avoid without causing a scene?**",31Mar2020,1
557,"So my mom and dad have been separated from each other for almost 8 months now living in separate homes. Long story short, a couple years ago my dad used to be  controlling and had anger issues and used to track my mom to see where she was and if she was on her way home from work etc. She absolutely hated that and ended up hanging out with one of her guy friends from work. My dad caught her going to his apartment and she swore nothing happened. They fought for years about it and finally separated when he thought she was being shady about it. After being separated they've been really good towards each other and have squashed most of their issues. But recently i've seen her talking to another guy co worker a lot and having phone calls at 3 in the morning for example. Ive visited her work and they seen them close there too. I've asked her about it before but all she says is that they're close friends and she cares for him like a brother. Today i accidentally saw some of their text messages on my computer because of ICloud. The messages were really sketchy and even included pictures. Im pretty sure they have or had a relationship at some point. My mother is very defensive and this will cause a shit storm between her and i if i confront her. Do i keep it to myself and swallow the pain and try to act normal (even though i'm crying my eyes out typing this) or do i confront her?",31Mar2020,1

561,"  

I‚Äôm currently reading about Stocks and Bonds. I am sort of skeptical about his whole concept because I know that money in general does not come easy. Besides, no matter how enticing it sounds, I hardly hear of people who brag about making huge money from their investments despite large companies like Facebook, etc existing. 

Anyway, as I was reading through, I like the idea of financial DRIPS but then I found out that stokers do not get cash, so I left the idea. Now, I‚Äôm reading about government bonds and I like this better because I know that government will definitely payback because they‚Äôd always have a source of income and profit (through taxes). However though, the skeptic in me is saying ‚Äúwell, if it was that easy, why aren‚Äôt many others doing it?‚Äù

What are your thoughts? I want to make my first investment but I do not have enough money. I want to make one never the less, like $25 lol",31Mar2020,2

563,"So I (19F) created this account solely to ask for advice on this.

My mom (60F) fell down our staircase on Monday (30/3) while cleaning. About 3-4 steps. She hit her back, and currently is having difficulty breathing and says there is pain around her left midsection.

We tried to get her to go to check immediately after, but she said no, she wanted to wait and see if it got worse. Long story short, she continued to clean and lift things despite the rest of the family telling her to stop and that we would do it. She said we were being annoying and that she was fine.

Today, the pain got a lot worse. According to her, during her sleep, she twisted and felt something crack. In the morning, the pain increased till the point where her breathing is labored and she can't sit, bend, walk, or lie down properly. She has a history of asthma and sleep apnea, which makes it worse. 

I suggested we go to the hospital now, but with the situation with Covid-19 in our country, she says we'll get arrested for heading out so late (currently 11pm). She wants to book an appointment in a few days, then plans to drive herself there.

It's a lot of back-and-forth, and I'm just worried that tonight, something will impede her breathing and she can't call for help. She's so stubborn and keeps saying the hospital can't help that much even IF she does go, suggesting that she does not actually intend to go.

I booked an appointment with a hospital she's been to before, for tomorrow, pending confirmation, but I already can see she will put up a fight, and at the very least, want to drive herself. But will it be too late?

Some backstory on this:

\- The reason she slipped is because the house we recently moved into has two outdoor levels. During the day, the dogs are locked in a side area, and at night, they are let free to run around the compound. One of them loves going down to urinate on the lower outdoor level, which was what she was attempting to clean when she slipped.

\- When we first moved in, my dad proposed that we set up a gate so that she wouldn't have to clean the lower level as we are all aware it is slippery, but she insisted the dogs needed the extra space.

\- When she fell, she said she always knew she would fall here, and had a vision about it. I do not know what to make of this, except that it makes me even more frustrated with her.

\- During our argument when I proposed she go to the hospital, she said she'd rather die than to lock up the dogs - which is not the plan, just a barricade - and that she would pick their freedom over her life. This really upset me, so I just got up and left.

We're (mostly my dad and I, as we're the ones trying to convince her) all tired of this. I feel lost, she's in a bad state but somehow maintaining her usual bull-headedness, and I just want her to be well and not have a freaking cracked rib and possibly stop breathing tonight.

Am I freaking out? Will she be okay? What if she falls again?

569,"Hello. I have only had about 5 legit jobs in my life, so i have no experience in this type of situation. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

I got a new job at a company that I have been trying to get for a while. I left my other job just before they shut down for the virus to start here. However, this isn‚Äôt what I was told it would be. First, the property Im working at is a million times more run down than I was made to understand, my first day they didn‚Äôt even know I was coming so I had no training but they left me here alone today, on my second day, to man the place. The company doesn‚Äôt even provide stationary which I didn‚Äôt ask about in my interview because I have never worked somewhere that asked me to get my own spiral notebook for the job. I am insanely miserable already and the position itself apparently doesn‚Äôt exist, they introduced me as a general team member since ‚Äúno one really has any title, specific duties, or role other than the property manager‚Äù. 

The thing is, I applied and accepted the position with the tasks that I was comfortable with and I‚Äôm happy to help with anything else i can. But after the first day being absolutely horrible and now I‚Äôm expected to just jump in with no training or ability to log into the systems, I am insanely miserable. I am applying at other places hoping something comes up ASAP by the grace of God but I have never experienced this before. When I tried to express that this isn‚Äôt what I was made to believe when I interviewed, they let me know they didn‚Äôt get told what my role was, when I was coming, or given anything to train me with. One of the only 2 other people working here told me ‚Äúit is what it is, there‚Äôs no need to feel some type of way about it. When the boss comes back in we will just tell her we talked and you‚Äôre fine.‚Äù But we didn‚Äôt talk, she just made it clear she doesn‚Äôt care what I was made to believe about the job. 

Is there anything I can do? I have worked some slummy places before but this is honestly ridiculous and no one seems to care. I‚Äôm miserable and feel stuck now that I‚Äôm here and I don‚Äôt know if I would even be considered for unemployment if they let me go in the first few days over me wanting to do the job I was hired to do, especially since I left the last place to come here. On top of all that of corse is the virus issue taking jobs and making the unemployment issue even harder. Please give me some advice before I either lose my mind or do something stupid like just get my stuff and leave.",31Mar2020,1

573,"Hello everyone,

My brother (34 years old) passed away last week unexpectedly. It was a shock to the whole family. My brother lived in Chicago and I lived in Los Angeles. I never really used facebook except to check what he's up to. He would post a lot of music, video links, his activities, and other interesting stuff. Anyways, my plan was to somehow make his facebook page a memorial that people can visit and check out, because that's what I did on a regular basis after he passed. I would listen to the music links, check out his pictures etc. 
Today I found out that my sister (30 years old) has deleted his facebook page without even consulting me. We are the only siblings left and I just thought she would have had said something before actually deleting it. We kind of got into it just now and I'm just trying to get someone's else opinion.

575,"When my ex and I were together in high school, I was his first kiss. He was perfect and so sweet. He was extremely thoughtful.

But he wasn't the person for me at all, and I know it got to him. I tried to force it and pretend I was (now that I'm 21 and in an adult realtionship, I understand that I never really felt deep feelings for him except for a little bit of codependency.

I know I sucked, and I was in denial.

We stayed over at each other's houses every night (again, codependency). I had a high sex drive for things that weren't straight PiV sex.

He, over time, started to show his anger issues. I had some myself as well. He never hit me, he just kind of tortured me a little psychologically. Every other day, he hated me.

We became worse and worse for each other over time. Eventually I was so confused and scared of what I was feeling that my brain kind of just shut off.

I know he didn't want to hurt me. Four years later, I'm confident in that. He wasn't malicious. He was scared and confused, too. He was angry that I didn't love him.

There became kind of a routine every night where I'd roll over, he'd rub my back, he'd roll me over, and we'd have sex. I pretended to enjoy it most of the time. I know if I would've asked him to stop, he would've.

Once or twice, I mentioned liking choking. That became part of the routine, too.

Eventually I stopped necessarily saying yes or really participating. So I guess in a way he could've just thought I was a pillow princess.

He started choking me and I'd just lie there. He'd have sex with me and I'd just lie there. The lights were always off. I was usually pretty silent.

I didn't want to anymore, but I was afraid to say so. I'd just lie there. Sometimes I'd do something back.

When I told him that the choking bothered me he felt really bad. Then I felt stupid for not saying something before.

But now I'm grown up and I can't say just because my boyfriend rolled over it was consent. Just because he doesn't protest, it isn't consent. I wouldn't do something without asking if it was okay. And at some point, my ex stopped asking even half the time. He just assumed, and I wanted to be a good girlfriend, so I didn't say no. If I verbally did he'd stop. It got to the point where I was having a panic attack every time, and he'd stop.

When I think about it I have a hard time. Because I didn't say no. But a lot of the time I didn't say yes. And I didn't know how to classify it.

I know I need to talk to a therapist but I'm from a small town and haven't had much luck with therapy, the ones around here that my insurance covers aren't great. I'm still going to try.

I've gotten drunk a few times and let it slip to people. I've let the r-word slip but then corrected it after.

I believe that women who have been raped have every right to come forward, but I don't identify that way. I don't want to be one of the people who cries wolf and lessens the meaning for others.

But when I think about it, I'm back in that girls shoes. Too scared to say no, otherwise he might dump me and not love me anymore again, as he did over and over again. Too scared to say no, because he knew I didn't love him and if I admitted it, he'd leave me. The amount of times I let him do it without a condom and then he bought me a plan b was insane. Because I was a little turned on, but sex to me equaled affection, so I let him. When I think about it, I think about my current (lovely) boyfriend lying still during sex. If he wasn't touching me or moving back, I'd ask if he was alright. Every time we have sex, before we have sex, I ask if it's alright.

Then I think about him, young and naive and not knowing. I was a virgin too, but I'd kissed guys and touched one while we made out.

I know this probably isn't the place, but someone, please give me your insight. I don't want to cry wolf, but it feels like a traumatizing experience. I guess it probably isn't that bad, but the first time I had sex with my current bf, I had a panic attack. I'm just so confused.

576,"Hi guys, first time poster but I'm really stuck here. 

First abit of back story:
My boyfriend is a streamer, and through that we have met alot of people. Some in mine and his home towns. The main person being ""Fred"" he is still a minor (15) and has autism and some mental health issues. My BF and Fred's dad know eachother. Fred's dad would drop him off and leave him with us to play Pokemon Go and the Pokemon TCG etc. 

To the point. 
Me, my BF and Fred have a group chat, and over the months hes became very open when talking with us. He talks about his feelings and we give him advice etc. He has also been known to lie during conversations with us. Which means we are cautious with what's truth and what's not when hes talking about certain subjects, and just play it by ere with what hes saying. 

The reason I'm here, is that last night during a conversation he stated that his parents have physically abused him, leaving him with cuts and bruises. He also said that his parents tell him hes a disappointment and he makes they're lives hell on a regular basis. 
When I questioned it due to the seriousness of what he was saying, he tried the spin it back saying his parents had done nothing wrong, and he probably got the marks  due to hitting walls (he often expresses he does that when angry). He then went on to delete his messages and told me to forget everything that had been said. 

Based on conversations my BF has had with Fred's dad in the past, he has tried to spend as much time with him and engage him into opening up but has had no joy and was grateful to me and my BF for being there when Fred needed someone to talk to. 

In light of this, do we ignore what Fred has said and just act as if everything is okay? Or do we take this further and break his trust completely?

Thanks in advance.",31Mar2020,1

592,"Hi! Before I start, I know none of us know what his true intentions were except for him and unless I ask. I just wanted to know what you guys think.

We‚Äôve been friends for 3 years. We met my freshman year of college and it was obvious he wanted to get to know me from the beginning. Long story short he became my first kiss, later got mad at him because he got hickies from another girl, he apologized, I initiated the talk about what his intentions were and he said he didn‚Äôt want a relationship at the time. We left off on good terms and remained good friends. Sophomore year happened, he made the effort to hangout here and there but we never hooked up or anything.

Summer going into this school year was when things started to change. We began to snap a lot and he tagged me in a lot of things on Facebook. When school started, he immediately asked to hang out with him which then became a consistent thing throughout the school year. He would always pay for my coffee, always try to hold my hand, cook for me (specifically bought me steak cause I asked for it), bought wine, asked to go to the city and FaceTime over winter break. We were at 2 parties together and he would always stay by my side and try to get with me which was unusual because the past 2 years he would be hooking up with other girls. One of those parties I was dancing pretty close with another guy and I knew he was mad but just didn‚Äôt say anything. He remembered my birthday and bought a bottle to my party after I jokingly asked for one too. I got kinda touchy with some of his friends cause I was so drunk and one of his friends the next day told me he looked stressed when I did that.

Anyways, because of the coronavirus, our classes got moved to online. He asked to hang out with me the last day of college because he said ‚Äúthis might be the last time I see your face.‚Äù Once again, he pays for my coffee and holds my hand. We then go back to my room and we cuddle for a little bit. Finally he asks if I wanted him to kiss me and I say no. He asks why and I said I‚Äôm really nervous and bad at this stuff (I have no experience lmao). He ensures me that it‚Äôs fine but I say only on the cheek. So he basically kisses me cheek and goes for my neck and we then cuddle for 2 hours. Later that same night, I go to the bar with friends and I get a text from him saying he‚Äôs coming. I dance with my guy friends and then I see him hooking up with another girl.

I‚Äôm confused; did he just put all this effort throughout the year to just hookup with me? Or was he actually trying for a relationship? He has never had a girlfriend before if that makes a difference. What do you think? Do you think he thinks about this too?",31Mar2020,1

604,"hello all, hope you are all doing well in this pandemic. Shoutout to any supermarket workers/nurses/doctors/researchers. 

I'm 21, by the way.

So, here it goes: In September I left escorting, to date my now-boyfriend. I know there are people that do both, have a relationship and be a sex worker, but it‚Äôs not something I want for myself/us.

I‚Äôm not a survivalist sex worker. I am very lucky to have a 9-5 job, all of my bills are covered, and a successful career ahead of me. I was what is considered a ‚Äúhigh-class escort‚Äù, so I charged more and worked only a few times per month. Sex work is just something I loved doing, helped me be creative, experiencing new things, and everything I earnt was disposable income. I‚Äôve done good things with the money, put a deposit on a flat, helped a friend who had money problems, helped my parents pay for my degree, donated money to sex work related causes etc. But let's be real, I mostly spent it on superficial/unnecessary things like food, travel, clothes, makeup, nights out. 

My boyfriend is fucking lovely. Like a great, amazing man. And I love him. He's perfect all over, so I'm not going to bother writing a paragraph about him.

HOWEVER, I miss sex work, I miss being single, I miss money, and I miss running my own business. I'm also incredibly independent, so I hate having my feelings dependant on another person. Before my boyfriend, I never wanted a relationship and I was happy with that, but he is too good to let go too.

Sex work is not forever, and I never wanted it to be. But neither is love. 

My questions are:

-Do you think I did the right thing by leaving sex work, and dating my bf? 
-If so, how do I stop reminiscing and regretting leaving sex work?
-Do I have an addiction to spending/money that is sabotaging my relationship?
-If I miss Sex Work this much, doesn't it mean I should be doing it?
-What do I do?

I guess you'll have a lot of questions to fill the gaps, which I'm happy to answer. But please, no degrading comments on Sex Work, no critiquing my choices, no unempathetic shit. Just don't be rude in general, and respect me.

Aside from that, thank you very much to anyone who has read this, I hope you &amp; your families are doing well, remember to practice safe sex, and teach inclusive sex education to your kids.",31Mar2020,1

618,"My father is in his sixties, and lives with my mom (also in her sixties) and my grandmother who is in her mid-eighties. He has underlying health conditions, and was admitted to the ER almost a year ago for a few days. 

He works as a web designer/developer at some company that is found to be an ‚Äúessential‚Äù business under California rules. However, there is *absolutely nothing technical* that prevents him from working from home.  But, management, being what they are, doubled-down on a work from home decree, saying absolutely no work from home is to be done *even if technically possible* (which it is, because he‚Äôs done it in the past for this company). His day-to-day responsibilities are CSS/HTML/Javascript writing. Nothing more.

Nobody at his company really knows why this is happening, other than a power trip by management. ‚ÄúOnly PTO may be used, all exempt employees must be in office at least 8 hours per day.‚Äù

He is in retirement age, but being that he‚Äôs an immigrant that started his 401K late in life, he has no option to retire.

On top of that, one of his workers called out sick and a cleaning crew sanitized his desk. Apparently, the coworker was in contact with a suspected case, but because of lack of tests neither the coworker or the other person were tested. The coworker is advised to stay home (unpaid, of course)

My dad works in a small room with a handful of other people. After having exhausted his vacation, HR has temporarily issued him his own office.

My biggest fear right now is that I lose my entire family due to some management bozo who is power tripping for no apparent reason.

What are my father‚Äôs options?

Retirement is not on the table, realistically.

I told him to quit, but seeing as he‚Äôs up there in age, he will struggle finding another job for sure, and he‚Äôs right. Especially given that we are (heading) in a recession or worse.

Is unemployment an option? Short-term disability? What are the California rules on this?

I haven‚Äôt seen my parents and my grandma in weeks so that me or my kids don‚Äôt infect them if we have it and don‚Äôt know it. For the first time in my life, my dad doesn‚Äôt have an answer. And he ALWAYS has an answer.

620,"Hello, this is sort of long but I really need to rant it out and seek advice, it is a lot of problems combined to cause a lot of troubles for me.

So to start it off I have a lot of issues I have with me, that being I'm insecure, I have lots of negative thoughts, I'm always anxious (heart rate is at 100 at rest), for whatever reason I've become timid to the point I freak out at any loud noise, sudden movement, sudden touch, whatever (this has caused a lot of problems going out).

I used to live with my family in England. I lived on a farm half my life in the countryside, and then a small village. Always close to nature, freedom, and just generally a place to breathe, that being said, I had a hard time with my dad for many many years - it wasn't physical abuse or anything that bad, but he said a lot of mean things, that I was failure, that there isn't anything good about me, that I'll never get anywhere, I'm a waste, whatever - his mum had died and I just sort of believed that was the reason he was like this with me (he was perfectly fatherly and loving with my brother) I do want to point out that he did a lot of selfless and loving things for me too, he just had his days/weeks. I was relatively strong and pushed past it, obviously I was sad and let it out when alone, but when with others I'd be very positive, happy, a ball of energy that made people smile. Anyway, I tried at A levels, failed, went to college, dropped out in the second year. My dad asked me to pay to stay at home (I was 18 and without a job), I then moved into my friends house for a few months, and then went to Belgium to live with a guy who I'd been in a LDR with for half a year (he had previously visited in England, and vice versa, honestly i think a lot of it was that I wanted to move on to a new place and start a new life, but I can't say my brain was screwed on logically).

It is almost 2 years later since I moved here. I have not been home since Christmas 2018 due to financial issues (to the point where we've had no hot water or gas for... Many months). I live in a very small apartment in Antwerp. There is no countryside for miles, miles and miles. I go out once every 2 weeks or so. I do not know how to make money or just generally be an adult. I miss my fricking dog who is getting old. I need to see her before anything could happen. I miss the countryside and nature. I am an extremely deep and sentimental person and just everything explodes in my head and its driving me crazy. I don't know what to do. Im missing so so much from my old life, to the point where I'm not even sure my mental health is improving being away from my dad. But at the same time, I never fit in with my family. My mum and brother and dog were so loving but it was never... Right? I don't know. But I just, I can't face going back home. And I can't face staying here either. I love my boyfriend so much, I love my dog so much, I love my family so much, I love nature so much, I love doing something with my life. I see and think so so much and I just AH. I want to do so so much, and I can feel that inside me, but at the same time I want to do absolutely nothing, to just sit still all day, every day, wollowing in self pity and just sort of die off, because if I did try anything it would all be a disaster and I'd get no where anyway. I need help, I need something, I don't know. But where do I go, what do I do, who do I see, what do I do with my life after sitting in an apartment for 300 days a year?! I just. I don't even know what I want to do, I don't even know how I feel, I don't know who I am, I don't know anything, and the more I think about all this the more I just don't want to bother at all, but because of my family, boyfriend and most importantly my dog, I will not make them sad. But at the same time, I will never be able to live my life the way I want to, or the way that will make me happy, so I just, aaaah, what's the point. 

I don't know. I'm here because I was put here, I want to be here, I also don't want to be here, but I can't make other people sad so I am here, and I'm all about how amazing life and the universe is, so I will just continue being here doing nothing, but I want to fricking do amazing awesome things and see everything and smell everything and embrace everything, but that's not possible, so back to square 1?!??! I really do not know anything my head is spaghetti and it hurts.

We haven't really gone out but we started texting and Snapping and we both really like each other (I think, at least I do). I don't know where it came from or why but after she told me that she slept with my friend, she's been very distant with me like avoiding my calls and FaceTime and barely responding with text and SnapChat. I told her that I'd still like to go out and that it doesn't matter that it all happened with her and my friend. To that she said that she'd like to go out if I'm still up for it. Now she's saying that we'll go out if I want to when the whole COVID-19 is over... She was very interested in going out though as the quarantine has been ramping up. And now nothing. What to do?... Should I just let it go and move on? Could this be her way of saying ""we're not going to work out""? If it is, I guess that's it. I'm just a kind guy, I guess.

They keep saying ""we will be careful"", but I know these people and they often show love with physical affection. I have tried to say in the nicest ways that we are not being careful enough and they take it as a personal attack.

What do I say to convince these stubborn people in my life that they are not being careful and that they are contributing to the problem? I know they would not listen if I came across too confrontational, but they are not listening to my sugar-coated responses either.",31Mar2020,1

636,"So, due to the world's current situation our school is closed. Im (F18) an A-level student in year 12 and my exams are next year. We may not be returning till november. My school is offering no types of online lessons (zoom etc) learning materials or anything. We have not even been set any kind of work, or lesson powerpoints for the lessons we were meant to have (they use the ones from previous years)

I have already repeated year 12 once due to severe depression when i was 14-present, only got diagnosed when i was 17 right before our mock exams and failed due to adjusting to meds and being in a bad place, focusing on health etc. Being in school and being around people made it a lot better, even though im in lessons with 16 year olds. Now thats all gone, i miss being taught and learning, and i really fucking miss my boyfriend. ANyways, im scared i will fail again due to our teachers making TIKTOKS (official school account, not teachers personal account) instead of helping us- they have been uploading tik toks every two or three days of teachers dancing and such. it makes me sad and angry that they have time to make bloody tiktoks with all the teachers in them, but not to email us with learning resources or at least one online class a week. idk what to do. im so worried. how am i meant to keep up my mental health, and learn from home with no one to teach us? they have been taking days to respond to emails as well. i understand they are busy, but its still hard.

So my situation is as follows:

I live at home with my parents, my Dad has advanced lung cancer and therefor is a high risk to Corona virus. I live in the UK where most jobs have been shut down and people are on furlough pay (Government pays 80% of your wages if your job has closed,employer can chose to pay the remaining 20% but doesn't have to)

I work in a factory with 300+ people, the work isn't essential and it blows my mind we haven't closed down, furlough isn't available to us. Working in a such high contaminous environment and then going home to my Dad is not an option.

I emailed HR and explained my situation and they said the only option I have is to take unpaid leave.

My other option is to quickly rent a flat for 6-12months and continue going to work. But this means I wouldn't be able to see my parents until the Virus is no longer a problem which I don't see happening for a long time.

I do have quite a bit in the bank ( I was saving up for a mortgage) So I could get through a year unpaid but its obviously not ideal, I just can't justify paying for my own place and working full time just to save a few hundred a month but never seeing my Dad who is in awful health.

I've really disliked my job for months but have been spending my time outside of work looking for a new job. Since COVID-19 hit, I've felt worst because I know that I should be thankful that I still have a job, but worsening because it's halted my job search quite drastically.

However, recently they haven‚Äôt been reaching out as much, they are less responsive and they aren‚Äôt as open as they use to be emotionally (this has happened before and things have gone back to normal, but never this bad).

However, my problem is that this is starting to take a huge toll on my own mental health.

649,"Ever since I [f19] started college, I‚Äôve been surrounded by students who smoke cigarettes. All my friends have smoked and one day I thought I would try it out. As a result of this, I‚Äôve obviously been smoking every day since then. I wouldn‚Äôt consider myself extremely addicted but I definitely enjoy a few cigarettes a day. Since I was away at school, there was no way of my parents knowing I smoked. Fast forward to now, being locked up in my house for who knows how long because of the virus, I‚Äôve been craving cigarettes. A few days ago, I decided to try smoking out of my bedroom window late at night. It smelt so bad but I was able to get rid of enough of the smell by the morning by lighting candles, keeping the window open, and using an oil diffuser. Last night, I decided to smoke again because I knew it was possible to get away with. I didn‚Äôt wait long enough for everyone to sleep and as I finished my cigarette and put it out and started airing out my room, I heard a a ruckus in the hallway and my mom runs in my room. I was sitting on the floor over a candle like a maniac. I had no idea what to tell my mom but I told her that it smelt weird and I opened the window to air it out or something. She believed me and went to bed.
The next morning, my mom, dad, and younger brother were all attacking me as to why it smelt like a ‚Äúcigarette bar‚Äù in the house and my room. I have no evidence that I was smoking other than the awful smell that traveled through the entire house by the vents. I‚Äôm so stupid and terrified to see where this day goes because I keep getting attacked with questions. My excuse is that my diffuser short-circuited and it started smelling like something was burning so I opened the window and lit a candle to air it out. My mom wants me to ‚Äúreplicate the smell‚Äù for her later tonight so we can figure out what the smell was and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt know if they thought I was actually smoking because there is no proof and I‚Äôve never shown other signs of being a smoker but I know they‚Äôre extremely suspicious and want to get to the bottom of this. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm ever going to convince them that wasn‚Äôt cigarette smell and I have no idea if they will believe me. I‚Äôm terrified. And there is no way I can admit anything to then, even my brother. They are all sooo against smoking of any kind. All suggestions and persuasion ideas are welcome.

650,"I have a bestfriend (its a girl), We've been bestfriend for like 6+ years until now. She became my bestfriend when she just straight up asked me to be her bestfriend (we were classmates back in 2013) but i was a bit hesistant because of my past experience, where i thought i was bestfriends with him but in the end i was the only who was feeling that way (this happend when i was 8 years old) so i was scared of having a bestfriend again but i gained courage after thinking about it for while.

After a year passed she transferred to another school because her family was having personal problems with the school, we would hang out but it was only at rare occasion like my friend having want to go swimming with old classmates or a friend having a birthday celebration (sometimes she never comes to those occasion) but we used to chat together a lot so i didn't really mind. Years passed till we would chat together but it would only happen if i tried to open up a conversation, asking for advice or sharing her personal problems with me so i'd help her most of the time if i can. 

This slowly became rare for her to talk to me with something today, as she is happy, making friends, new bestfriends and getting busy with her life so being me i tried to understand her that being busy with school works and life gives her barely anytime for her to have a conversation with me (We did have a conversation but it was very dry sometimes taking hours or not reply for a couple of days/weeks) until i reached the point of me having this moments of being a overthinker and a depressed boy, (not as worst as before) i was thinking that ""she probably replaced me with her new bestfriends"", ""she doesn't care anymore"" and so i thought to myself that ""I am really her bestfriend?"". 

So i stopped opening up a conversation with her just to see if she really cared about her bestfriend, I would post something like depressing shit over twitter just to give sign for her to chat ""how are you"" but it didn't happend until 2 weeks passed, i was so happy to see her start up a conversation with me but it was the same old dry conversation, i tried to distract myself from my problem by playing games or watching anime (im your typical gamer weeb) but everytime it passes through my mind it hurts like hell to even think about it and sometimes i see her having conversations with her classmates it jealous (i get sad when jealous) because they get to talk to her while i'm just ignored. I'm clueless on what should i do, i'm having a hard time trying to cope up with this feeling.

Now I'm questioning myself is this how best friends are supposed to work? I'm not so sure of myself if she cares about this bestfriend thing.

For Context on why i get sad over getting ignored or no replies in conversations: I had a crush before who i used to open a conversation a lot but i would get replies in hours or days because she always says that she's busy, this happend for 2-3 years and i being me i understood her situation but overtime this way of thinking became getting ignored and becoming depressed.

666,"This situation is extremely bizarre and complicated, and even if you don't know how to help me, this should be a good read, because it gets more bizarre with every sentence. You seriously can't make this stuff up. I should say first of all though that I'm doing extremely well and I'm really excited about things, so this isn't really a desperate call for help, just seeking general advice about a few questions that I'll get to at the end after I talk about the situation some.  


So I've only ever had one romantic relationship before, and honestly, there was nothing there. I had no clue how it was actually supposed to feel, so I had a brief relationship with a girl I didn't really like. We never fought or disagreed or anything, but going away to college was a good excuse to cut it off nice and clean. Looking back I feel bad because I think she really liked me and I was just playing with her heart. I didn't learn a lot from the experience either. We never even held hands or anything because I wasn't comfortable.  


Before that even though, I have a very bizarre story. Let's start with a whole bunch of trauma. My parents divorced when I was 12 and it was really nasty. They threatened to kill each other, my mom was afraid my dad would kill my brother and I, and it dragged on forever. At the time I didn't think it was that bad, but apparently it left some scars, because ever since then I struggled with huge identity problems, and a few years ago I was convinced I needed to never speak again, and I did something REALLY crazy. I tried to cut my tongue off, and I very nearly succeeded. It had to be reattached at a hospital. Since then psychiatrists have been trying to make sense of me. They even thought I might have had schizophrenia, and I'm on antipsychotics now.  


In the years that followed, I was doing better, but I was still depressed sometimes and I made my broken identity revolve completely around my terrible past. It was the first thing I told everyone I met because I felt like that's who I was.  


Enter a bunch of awesome friends and a beautiful girl. Somehow I wound up being part of a group of friends consisting mostly of girls, including one who is also on the autism spectrum. I didn't fall for her right away, but holy crap, when I did, it happened all at once, and I forgot about the whole world. My past became ancient facts of someone else's life, and I felt things I didn't know were possible.  


So I asked her out. She said no. It shattered my heart and I died inside. But then something weird happened. She pretty much started acting like she was my girlfriend. It really wasn't me, I took the ""no"" like a restraining order. So a few months later I asked her out again. And she said no again. And it shattered my heart again. And then she started acting even MORE like my girlfriend. She would just out of nowhere teach me how to dance or something like that. I couldn't figure it out. So the next time around I didn't ask her out, but I said something romantic and she liked it. And we just grew closer until she finally decided that we could be ""a thing.""  


Anyway, there are a few things you should understand about this girl. She can be rude without knowing it sometimes, and she never says anything to let you know if she likes something, and she's really hard to read. I think I've mostly figured it out now, but at the time this was a constant source of doubt and worry for me. Also she is very uncomfortable with touch. If you barely touch her she jumps. Not that I'm very touchy myself, just an observation. Anyway, after about a week she pretty much told me she wasn't sure she actually liked me, that she was overwhelmed, and that she wanted to go back to just being friends. And I was devastated again.  


Fast forward a couple months and we're a thing yet again. She says it doesn't feel as rushed or overwhelming this time, and now she knows she has romantic feelings for me. I believe it too. She just wasn't comfortable before, and also, we came to another realization: the idea of sex terrifies her. We're Christians and live in Christian families, so that's not going to be a thing until we're married, which is very far away. But she thinks about the future a lot, so she couldn't help but be terrified by that thought. I'm pretty comfortable with the idea of sex, but I haven't always been. I used to be so afraid of it I thought I'd never marry too. I was so uncomfortable I never would have even admitted I had sexual feelings, not even to myself. And now she seems to be in the same boat. She says she's not sure if she has sexual feelings or attraction. I don't think you can really have a marriage without sex, but I understand that's so far off now she doesn't need to think about it. So I told her that even if she never became comfortable with it, I'd want to marry her anyway. That's sort of true because right now I couldn't imagine leaving her over that, but sort of not true because I say it expecting that she'll grow out of her discomfort like I did.  


So I guess I'm just seeking advice about how to better understand her. On the matter of sex, I don't want to seem pushy and I certainly don't want it to seem like that's what matters to me the most, but I want to guide her slightly outside of her comfort so we don't ever miss out on something great. I think we could ease into it by getting comfortable with non-sexual touch first, and then after we're married ease into it more. Am I wrong for wanting to do that? And I'm not at all hurt or offended when she says she might not be attracted to me. I know I'm actually really good-looking, and again, I've been in the same boat before, so I understand completely. The part that's harder for me to understand is just how I was so struck by her and pursuing her so fiercely, while she seems more able to deny her feelings even as she's very obviously drifting closer to me. I guess I'll take any advice on how to better understand her.

I‚Äôve grown up in a Christian home my entire life, and I count myself as a Christian, but I more so believe in the possibility there is a God rather than follow all the strict rules that comes from the bible, almost every time I open it, it‚Äôs loaded nonsensical misogynistic bs, that being said, previously mentioned I grew up and continue to live in a Christian household full of overly religious people that use whatever they can to mask their biases and hatred for those different from them, including but not limited to: transphobia, homophobia, racism, xenophobia, misogyny, etc..
Now I can usually hold them back in a argument of logic, to the point where they just agree to disagree, but as of recent I‚Äôm tired of the whole ordeal with it, and I haven‚Äôt read much of the Bible and that‚Äôs on me, but I‚Äôm just looking for some verses I can quote them to get them to shut up, as I was reading a AskReddit question just last night about unusual bible verses which made me want to ask this. And I in no way want to attack anyone from the Christian community, as I don‚Äôt blame the religion for the hatred my family has, they just poorly use the Bible for non-intended purposes and I‚Äôm hoping I can find something to effectively get them to shut up.",31Mar2020,1
672,"Not that I had much motivation to begin with.

My boyfriend was nice enough to give me a spare guitar a few weeks ago, for the first week I was enthusiastically practicing daily...but I injured my finger so had to stop, and seems allowing myself that break broke all motivation. 

I just can't seem to get back into practicing guitar, he asked me yesterday to show him how far I'd progressed and I couldn't. I feel bad as I need a hobby and it's not like I don't have the time during lockdown, what's more is my boyfriend was nice enough to give me this guitar and music is a big part of his life so I feel I'll be letting him down if I can't.",31Mar2020,1
673,"Hi, I get the title is boring but hear me out.

For about a year now me (20M) and my cousin (20F) have had a very close relationship. We talk everyday, tell each other our secrets, vent to each other etc. She's struggled with depression for quite a few years, and sometimes I get worried about her to the point where I feel physically sick. We've pretty much agreed to never tell anyone what passes between us two. Due to her depression and the isolation in my country, over the past week I've started to notice her mental state get worse. This evening she called me crying, saying she loved me, I told her I'd have her back no matter what, said I love you then she hung up. She's struggling with depression and I know she's tried to take her own life a few times, so I was genuinely worried she was about to commit suicide. I called her mum (my aunt) and asked if she could check to see she was okay because she just called me and she was very upset. I didn't say anything which was revealed to me in confidence. Next thing I know, my cousin is blowing up my phone telling me she hates me, I've ruined everything and she never wants to speak to me again.

Now here's the thing. 17 months ago I had a very similar experience with my best friend. He called me, clearly upset, told me I meant the f\*\*\*\*\*\* world to him and he hung up. The next morning I found out he'd hung himself from his curtain rail in his bedroom. It's left me with trauma and still haunts me to this day. So when my cousin called me this evening very upset and hanging up very quickly my first thought was making sure she didn't take her own life.

Did I make the right call? I think I did, but I'm worried i've just sacrificed my relationship with someone I care deeply about. I've chosen to give her a wide berth for a bit so she can calm down, but after that I don't know. Some advice would be appreciated.

**Edit:** I felt more info may be needed. She insists she doesn't need any help, but as someone who's struggled with depression and alcohol in the past I can say she needs help. And because of my job (military) I'm starting to have less and less time for everyone outside work, not just her. I've tried to get her to talk to others like her parents or boyfriend, but she refuses to tell them anywhere near as much as she's told me.",31Mar2020,1

She tells me the same thing over and over when I ask how can I calm down when I can't walk away. If you need to walk away just let me know. WHEN I'M HAVING VISIONS OF SMASHING A GLASS BOTTLE AGAINST YOUR THROAT I DONT THINK OF ASKING TO WALK AWAY. 

The fact that I'm a teenager makes everyone think it's just a 'phase' that it's 'normal'. Tell me is it normal to try and break your fingers or scratch your skin off every time you get mad just so you dont hurt others or destroy a room. Is it NORMAL to visualize slicing your throat because it would be the fastest way for people to take you seriously. Is it normal to smile when you fantasize about bringing a gun to school and killing everyone you hate then yourself right after. Is it normal for you to be able to look at the room an point where your blood splatters. Is it normal for you to wonder if people even care about you because they always tease everything you do INCLUDING police officers which are suppose to make you feel safe. Is it normal to be so overprotective of your friends that you absolutely refuse to hang out with them and someone else because you might get replaced. Is it normal to take the blame for everything those friends do wrong to you because you feel you didn't change yourself enough for them. Is it normal that you find it relaxing to choke yourself because it sends a feeling to your head that makes you think ""Oh wow i almost couldn't breath"".

Because I'm pretty sure NONE of that is normal. I could keep going on but people would be here for to long. Am I suppose to just wait for 5 years hoping i don't carve into my skin or kill myself because I know the only way people will take me seriously and get me help is if I do something drastic.

684,"I live in a small town outside of Buffalo NY, but it‚Äôs kinda depressing.

I graduated high school in 2013 with a questionable relationship with my fellow classmates. I was voted most likely to trip over myself at graduation...

Nobody has moved on. Nobody made anything out of themselves (Including me). Nobody seems to have hopes or aspirations.

It‚Äôs now 2020 and we‚Äôre all in our mid 20‚Äôs. I‚Äôm desperately looking for a way out of here because nothing ever changes. No good paying jobs either. 

Everybody is doing the exact same shit they did when they were 18... I‚Äôm not against meeting up with familiar faces. It‚Äôs just the same.... thing.... every.... week.

It‚Äôs just weird. I want to go get a beer sometimes but every bar is swimming with the same cliques of 5 from high school.

If you think I‚Äôm over exaggerating, over the summer I had a nasty argument with my mother. My dad decided to take me out for a beer. Who was our waitress? My ex‚Äôs ‚Äúbad‚Äù friend.

The friend who would encourage my ex to do bad shit. I walk in to the restaurant and her friend immediately hugs me as soon as I walk in. I try to play it off as no big deal, but then she dives into shit talking my ex in front of my dad...

I made it clear that she was being inappropriate so she gave us free beer and continued to kinda pry info out of me. Before we left she hugged me again and I clarified ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say anything so I don‚Äôt want this coming back to me.‚Äù

It never did, but it was extremely uncomfortable. I loved my ex. We were teenagers together. Admittedly sometimes I still miss her, but we broke up in 2015 and it‚Äôs long been over.

I hate it here. Nobody changes. Nobody grants any privacy. Everything is Facebook or bust. I‚Äôm just having a very hard time relating and communicating to people my age. 25(M).

I feel like an old man in a 25 year olds body. I‚Äôll be 26 in August and with the COVID19 crisis, it looks like I‚Äôll be facing my 3rd lonely birthday in a row.

My parents are worried about me because I just don‚Äôt care anymore and I‚Äôve become bitter. If I go out, I focus on people who don‚Äôt like me. If I stay home I feel alone deep inside. 

I feel like an immature joke. Therapy didn‚Äôt help, and I haven‚Äôt had a job in 4 years. My only job interview was cancelled because of COVID19. Sometimes I just feel like this is the end for me. I know I‚Äôll never be rich. I know I‚Äôll never be famous. I know I‚Äôm never going to enjoy the experiences in life that Hollywood celebs carelessly flaunt 24/7. I just don‚Äôt like people my age either because they have the intellectual capacity of a 16 year old. Nobody has anything relevant to say besides ‚Äúfuck Trump‚Äù and talking shit about people we graduated with.

There is competition close to us that have chosen to cut their hours and close the front to the public. We have not done anything differently. When I asked the owner of the store if we are going to do anything different, they said no. 

Several of us are not okay with this. One of my coworkers is not currently working because of the refusal to close the front to the public and she feels unsafe.

690,"I don‚Äôt know if this is the correct subreddit for this but oh well. 

Pretty much, me and two others have renewed a 6 month lease with an apartment complex. We went to the office today, and they told us we‚Äôd be paying around $150 extra that we were not expecting. According to them, this $150 fee is added to rentals that are on a ‚Äúmonth to month‚Äù basis (which we are not. As we explicitly said we want 6 months). 

We received the lease, and the $150 was not mentioned in it. We called to verify that the lease was correct and that we would not have to pay this extra $150 per month. 

Also, I forgot to mention that we know another group of 3 that renewed a 6 month lease this same month. They do not have any extra fees added. We have looked through their contract as well. 

When we called them, the manager pretty much said ‚Äúhe forgot to add the fee‚Äù, and said that he would add it for us. He then said that he was being generous to us and adding only a $50/month fee, and that it is usually $150/ month for a short term lease. 

We are very upset about this, as we are paying an extra $50 that people with the same contract do not have to. 

Our concerns are that they will raise the fee yet again if we go ask them about this. When we mentioned the other contract of the people we know, he just said he forgot to add the fee to theirs.

692,"I‚Äôm a woman in early 20s and currently in a loving relationship. My partner for almost a year is such a wonderful man and we‚Äôre seeing each other as someone we want to spend the rest of our lives with. 

Before I met him, I moved to a new city and being somehow ‚Äúsexually constrained‚Äù, I was raised in a conservative household, never had sexual encounters until 1 year before moving to a new country (hooked up without penetration with a 1. guy I met on dating app, 2. Club 3. Friend 4. Overseas trip), I dated a new guy almost every week for around 2 months. And these are all first dates. These happened while I‚Äôm still kinda talking to the previous guys I‚Äôve met up with, but they didn‚Äôt seem to be too keen on me (seems like they‚Äôre meeting up with other girls too) and I thought well I was single and not committed to any of these guys so I should be fine. There‚Äôs two guys who expressed that they really like me, but they‚Äôre not consistent in terms of communication, so I thought oh well there‚Äôs still other guys out here. There were attempts to meet up again, but it just never happened. So the ghosting kinda happened both ways, for example, they stopped talking to me for a few days, which led me to meeting up with others, then when I have met someone else, and they message me again, I still talked to them kinda keeping them hanging because that‚Äôs how I felt they‚Äôre doing to me too. the hookups never had penetration because I thought at least I‚Äôm not giving them too much of me. I don‚Äôt know if this is quite normal in the casual dating world, I don‚Äôt have friends who do the same as most of them have been partnered since high school. 

After this, I got sick and tired of online dating and decided to stop. I felt empty. While it was a bit of fun while it happened, because I was single and thought I could explore. Then, I met my boyfriend after around a month. When I met him, I knew he‚Äôs the one. I stopped talking to any other guys. Around 2 weeks into dating, one of the guys I hooked up with messaged me what‚Äôs up (and that‚Äôs after a month of not talking to me?!), I didn‚Äôt bother replying to him because what‚Äôs the point. Then, another messaged me who saw me with my boyfriend, he‚Äôs level headed so I messaged him that I already have a boyfriend and he was respectful enough to wish me well and stopped talking to me. Then, there was one guy whom I consistently spoke with before I met my boyfriend , and I told him that I already have a boyfriend, and he‚Äôs also respectful enough to wish me well. Then, 3 months ago, I received a Facebook message request from one of the guys I hooked up with over a year ago. He messaged me asking if I remember him? Like seriously? He ghosted me not long after we met so I thought he wasn‚Äôt interested. I blocked him.

Anyway, I guess I need some advice. Am I right to feel guilty about all this? I also feel anxious that they might come back and bite me in the future :( I‚Äôm a bit scared to be prominent in my field in the future, as I‚Äôm anxious that these guys might show up or spread online that I had sexual encounters with them.

700,"I (31F) mean, I feel terrible for him (37M) and I'm still kind of processing this. We haven't been in contact since we broke up years back.

We had originally broken up about 4 years ago because I was concerned about him sleeping with other people. I later found out that some of the rumors might have been true. One of the girls he cheated with was pretty heavy in the drug scene, but I don't know how deep into that scene she was.

Regardless, after we broke up, I got an HIV test at Planned Parenthood. I figured, if there was any chance he had it, I'd test positive because our relationship had started almost a year before I took the test. However, the cheating with the girl was in a more recent timeframe (like maybe within 3 months of my taking the test.)

Test came up negative and I moved on in life, never had any more encounters with him. He went through a number of various partners after. There was one girl he was in a long term relationship with who I was good friends with and after about two years they split and she seems completely fine, happy, and healthy with a new fiance. So I imagine if he had HIV as far back as when we were together, she would've likely tested positive for sure. They were together much longer than we had been.

Anyway, he messages me this morning saying he found out on the 19th that he had AIDS and doesn't know where he got it from. His recent ex-girlfriend has it, too.

I'm honestly still reeling from this because I genuinely do feel horrible for him, I mean, we had our differences, but God, I wouldn't wish that on anyone.

I even feel selfish for being worried about my own health even though the logical side of my brain feels like I have no reason for worry.

Still, I'm worried and almost want to get retested but with the quarantine going on, I wouldn't set foot near any hospitals or clinics if you paid me.

I keep trying to tell myself, I'm likely fine‚ÄîI've been in good health ever since, save for a couple of bad flus that fucked me up last year, but I was also within 2 counties of the California Paradise fires and inhaled a LOT of bad shit that contributed to how poorly I handled those flu bouts. None of his exes that I know of between our breakup and now have mentioned anything about AIDS or HIV, which I imagine they would have unless he only got it recently.

Anyway, my head's in a weird place right now. I'm just reeling. We haven't been in contact in almost four or five years and he comes up out of the blue to tell me this. I'm already a hypochondriac as it is.

701,"This was posted in r/nostupidquestions but got redirected to a Coronavirus megathread, then upon a mods advice they thought I should post this here. 

Forgive me if I sound dumb but...

I know it seems like a straight forward thing, but I really don't know what to do with this money. Here's what I mean:

First, I don't really believe that the government is just giving us money because we *need* it. I'm not some government conspiracy theorist or anything like that, but I don't think that they are giving us ""free money"". And I know the ideal idea is that it will stimulate the economy and kind of boost it up. But I also know plenty of financially irresponsible people that will blow this money on stupid shit. For instance, I have a family member who has a joy ride and is always looking to fix it up. I know that any extra money she has goes right into this truck. Her family is already not in the financial position to even have 2 cars, let alone one she is always fixing up, and it doesn't even run, and hasn't for years. I digress. If we give back and others don't, does it really make a difference in the economy as a whole?

Second, my husband and I like to save. Almost hoard money lol We are comfortable and don't like to spend frivolous money. So when I hear we're getting money back, my immediate thought is to save it. Don't spend it, don't touch it, just save it. While this is a good thing, it also means that I have a fear of making big purchases. Buying our car and home gave me great anxiety and I am always fearful that something will happen and drain out money. We aren't rich by any means at all, but we are in a good spot and I don't want to get to where we used to be. He kind of laughs it off and says ""babe you're crazy, we're fine"".  And then this virus happened. He works for the USPS and although his job is secure per se, it's also not. If they don't get the same retail customers they are used to, they could go bankrupt. Idk how real that scenario is, but it's a legit fear of ours. So I want to save this money we're getting. 

Third, I'm seeing this as a tax advance for next year. That's what I mean by ""no free money"". It has to come from somewhere and I think that's where it's going to be paid back, next year's taxes. We wanted to pay off a debt with next year's tax return (car note), but now that this money is coming we want to do it now. Is this smart? Should we save it instead? Pay off this debt now in case they take it from us next year? We are also having a baby any day now, should we spend it on things for the baby? We don't really need to, as we have almost everything we need, but should we do it anyways?
I mean, will that little bit really do much to help the economy? 

Also, our rural town has been hit hard with this shut down. We're in a small desert town in SoCal full of mom and pop shops. I know we need to contribute to them as well. Most are eateries so should I spend there and not cook at home all the time? 

I want to make the right choice for our family, but I also know the importance of contributing. So as a consumer and frugal jerk, what do I do??

706,"I'm 19M. My problems aren't monstrous but it makes me sad though. I have a strict father who thinks money is all that needed for a man to survive. He never lets me go out with my friends, never let me watch movies or TV shows or any possible entertainment that exists in the world, he says money is what you need but we have enough money to at least be happier. He failed in his carrier and stood up several times but he never found that success is not the product but the happiness is. My mom is sick she doesn't react to any of my problems. She just listens to my problems and doesn't even care about that, that's not her problem she got sick a few years back. So never experienced love from a woman. I don't have friends not really I have some but because my father doesn't let me talk I'm in there friends list but not in best friends list. All my life I spent staying in-home and never done anything. I feel like trash at least trash has some purposes. I never played any sports, never made good friends, had no guts to talk to girls, lazy, fat, gets angry, no book reading habits, I love computers but not good at them either.  I try to do something as much as possible but lose concentration or interest soon.

Started learning programming a year back hasn't achieved anything as I keep on getting distracted. I always stare at my phone waiting for someone to text. I can't keep up the conversation either. I started talking to people on Reddit got addicted because it was nice but realized no one I speak doesn't know me in real life.

Thought of at least be a social media genius not good at either. I'm not funny enough or have a good knowledge of English movies. Discovered Reddit a few months ago my account maybe a year older but I found it interesting only a 3 months ago. I started using it for programming only but subscribed to some get friends subreddits and got sad even more listening to their achievements and how their parents treat them. I text everyone as soon as I see the message thinking I'll lose the friendship but why would I even do that. I don't even know them why am I so needy to talk to people I can't understand. 

I throw up reasons for everything. Everything that occurred to me till now is solely my responsibilities I can't accept the truth, which makes me so weak. I can't convince my father too as I don't have a job or earn my own money. My father wants to join his company if I join his' I'll be the same shit whatever I said above but his company needs a person to look after, after him. I can't deny it too.

Every insecurity I have can be solved by reducing my body weight and stop being lazy. I need some suggestions to be happy and let me leave all the pasts back. It may not be bigger problems but these things get bigger every day. I need advice and hug. Thank you.",31Mar2020,1

Hello reddit.

I am posting this for the fifth time now - I am new here and have no idea where to post this.

I am not the kind of person who uses either this site or twitter, but things being what they are I am unable to see another way of resolving this quickly.

I recently ordered a new cot bed (¬£150 + ¬£12 delivery) for my soon to be 1 year old son online from argos, as well as a wardrobe (¬£50~, total charge ¬£212~). This transaction went through fine, and my available bank balance (¬£100) reflected this. Yesterday I went food shopping for my pregnant and immuno-compromised wife. I spent 2 hours queuing to get in and a further hour traipsing around picking up bits and pieces for my first born's 1st birthday, which is on the 2nd of April. I checked my balance before going in and I still had ¬£100 available, and my order from argos was still in pending transactions. After self scanning ¬£100 worth of shopping, my payment was declined. I checked my bank and suddenly I had -¬£62 available. My Argos transaction was listed as now complete, but in pending transactions, was now showing ¬£162 waiting to go out - somehow the cotbed portion of my Argos order has been duplicated.

I then had to leave all the shopping behind, after frantically trying to call my wife and family to see if anyone could help send me money until this is resolved. I tried calling my bank but they were shut due to Covid. I then tried calling Argos with the same result. I managed to get hold of my bank today who told me that until this duplicate transaction is complete, there is nothing they can do to cancel or reverse the charge. Considering that it took 4 or 5 days to go from pending to complete for the first transaction, I am desperate at this point. I have tried repeatedly to get through to someone at Argos about this with no luck. I even joined twitter thinking that if they saw the situation they have put me in, they would do something about it. I don't know how to use twitter (or this site really) so I'm not even sure of my tweet to them has gone through.

Normally this should be easily resolvable over the phone, but with Covid that's gone out of the window. Please help an out of touch person get the message across to Argos to resolve this. Thanks.",31Mar2020,1

I need to vent


Background:

I live with my fianc√© and one month old. I‚Äôm still on maternity leave. My fianc√© works but we are quarantining from him as well.

My parents(50‚Äôs) live with my grandma(70‚Äôs) all have diabetes.

My siblings(20‚Äôs) live in their own homes as well.

*******************************************************

My family and I live in one of the COVID19 hotspots and are currently under a ‚Äústay at home‚Äù quarantine enacted by our governor. 

Two weeks before this took place, my sister thought it would be a good idea to go to Florida to visit the guy she was talking to. She did not want to pay for parking so she asked my father to take her to the airport. He said yes originally before the virus affected our area, but I talked him out of it being that he would have to pick her up when she gets back after being exposed to all of that stuff. 
She gets mad. Says things she hasn‚Äôt watched the news- whatever. We move on. 

A few days of her being in Florida she FT‚Äôs me to see the baby and I see that she‚Äôs just chillin in the grocery store (her man delivers groceries for one of those apps). I make a comment that she shouldn‚Äôt be there because of the virus and she gets upset telling me that people still have to work and that everyone WANTS to be home safe, but not everyone is privileged like me to be home. I just drop it and apologized for hurting their feelings. 

That same day at 2am she calls me on the phone hysterically crying and just wants me to stay on the phone with her. I‚Äôm kinda freaking out asking if he hurt her or if she feels in danger she says no and she doesn‚Äôt wanna talk about what happened but keeps telling me she loves me and misses me and says the same about my parents and other sibling. I try to comfort her but also remind her that she can‚Äôt see us right away when she gets back. She says she understands and we get off the phone. Later on that day after flying back home, she calls me again and tells me that the reason she was crying because the guy told her that he wasn‚Äôt looking for a relationship right now while also trying to defend herself again for the reasons why she went to Florida and that she was being as safe as could. 

The next day my dad messages me and other sibling that he thinks she‚Äôs in a depression and that we need to call her and not mention going to Florida at all and just comfort her. My sibling says that sibling messaged her that she can come to sibling‚Äôs house. I tell dad that I was trying to be there for her, but that she is an adult who chose to travel so now she can quarantine and advised my other sibling to not invite her over yet just in case. 

Cases of the virus in my area go up. Only essential businesses are open in my area. I do think at this point we need to be as safe as possible as a family, especially being that my parents and grandma are high risk. I talk to sibling about me ordering groceries for pick up and she pick it up and bringing it to our parents house as sibling is still going out for work and lives closest to them. If she can‚Äôt, my fianc√© will. Regardless, we will do it for them. We agree to this and tell my parents and they agree too. 

Next day I call my parents and they tell me they are getting ready to go to Walmart. I flip out and tell them we had an agreement. They ask my sibling to go instead. 

Next day we are communicating like normal through our group chat and even FaceTime which my sister was not apart of because she had another call. (The reason why they wanted to do a group FaceTime in the first place was because they are concerned about my sister. She lives alone and is sad.)

Another couple of days go by. The hospitals are overwhelmed now and we are now under lockdown or ‚Äústay at home quarantine.‚Äù 

My dad thinks is a good idea to go out and get food and to do a parking lot meet up as a family with me , my baby, and my siblings. I told them no and that they will get tickets from the cops if they are out without good reason. They do it anyway, send me a video and my grandma is in the backseat, all the windows are down and they are all talking and laughing parked very close with my sister who was in Florida only a week prior. They said my texts how they missed me. I am pissed but I make a joke and brush it off.

I started thinking about all the recent events and how everything unfolded and I just get really sad and mad. I don‚Äôt want anything to happen to them and I feel that they are being reckless, especially with my grandma. I want to cry because I feel like they‚Äôre not taking this seriously so I don‚Äôt talk to them the next day. All they really ask is where are pictures of the baby anyway. My sibling calls me and I say how I feel and that I‚Äôm just annoyed with how they are acting. Through the group chat they say that I‚Äôm ‚Äúlosing my shit‚Äù and that I‚Äôm overreacting. They say that ‚Äúpeople still need to live‚Äù and that they‚Äôre taking all the precautions to be safe. They also called me childish for not sending pictures of my child to them because I‚Äôm upset. I just told them that I disagree, but I‚Äôm done arguing. We have different opinions and they‚Äôre not going to change and also that I‚Äôm allowed to be upset and they‚Äôre not entitled to pictures of my child especially when I am upset.

I might be overreacting but right now my child and keeping her safe is my #1 priority. It used to be my priority keeping them all safe, but they don‚Äôt care so why should I?

(Btw, I have 2 sisters but I thought it would be less confusing if I referred to one as sister and the other as sibling.)",31Mar2020,1
714,"I need some help guys!

I have been with my company for over 1.5 years, pretty good relationship with my bosses. I beieve I am considered an ""at-will employee"". Super small office with only 3 full time employees and 1 part time, our CEO lives many states away. At the start of Covid-19, I discussed with the CEO of my company an agreement for me to work from home. We agree to a week by week basis and we'd discuss the following week the Friday before on whether I would still WFH or come into the office. 

From the start of this, my office manager (who works in my office) has been one of those who is very negative about the quarantine, claims she is healthy and corona is just another type of ""flu"". Yeah, one of those annoying people. One of the other full-time employees also started working from home not long after I did. 

My office manager sent the other employee and I an email, claiming that after a discussion with the CEO, they'd like us back into the office April 6 (April 7 was the end of the stay at home order for my state). It stated that we were not required to come into the office April 6, although if we chose not to we could not WFH and it would then be un-paid leave. 

Today, my Governor pushed the stay at home until end of April. I have proven that I can do my work from home over the past few weeks, thus proving I am not an essential employee to be in the office. All my work is online, and my work has not been impacted by me working from home.

I have multiple family members in my house that are considered high risk, I'm not taking the chance of going into my office. My job is not worth that. Do I have any leverage here? Could I claim unemployment benefits if I don't go in next week? I don't know where to go from here. 

Any assistance or advice is appreciated!",31Mar2020,1

One of our special collections like one collected stamps another leaves and glass. We did that growing up. All things I planned on keeping and getting when I find a husband and a forever home. It was cheap way to keep us busy, these collections. But now she‚Äôs throwing it all away.

717,"I don‚Äôt know if this will go somewhere but I don‚Äôt know what to do.

718,"*For reference, I'm a bisexual low-functioning autistic 16 year old male with a boyfriend (my first relationship, ever) and a group of friends I get along with very easily (with some... minor disagreements that happen sometimes but it never causes any real problems in the end) and I feel like I'm happier than I've ever been.*

So lately I've been thinking about myself and what I seem to be to people. I've thought about it a lot so I've recognized my problem already, so I'll summarize it best I can.

I have a role I kind of have myself in the world, where I take care of others more than I take care of myself. I feel like others are more amazing and more important, and that they deserve success more than I should. That's not to say I don't take care of myself; I try to, but I don't know how to. I do things I like to do, I try to keep up with my work (which has gotten incredibly hard lately due to my school shutting down over *you-know-what*), and I practice and refine the only skill I see worth in, my drawing skills. I try to always be optimistic, both for myself and for others, especially for my boyfriend.

The real problem is, I have trouble believing in myself. My mind is in constant war with itself. Every now and then, the bad thoughts come in, and I feel worthless. Sometimes when these things happen I ask whatever close friend I'm talking to at the time why they're my friend or why they want someone as useless as me. Then maybe a few hours, or, if it's really bad, the next morning, I go back to being happy and optimistic. When I'm not under the influence of those pessimistic thoughts, they are still there, but my optimism drives them out when they come around.

I've also had trouble with consistency. Call them whatever you want- mood swings, teenage angst, whatever- but it's there.

I don't know what I need to do, or if I even need advice in the first place. I'm confused and I'm just trying to understand myself. What's wrong with me?",31Mar2020,1
719,"I know this sounds really ridiculous, but I need some advice on how to stop myself from spending money/sticking to a budget while social distancing. 

So, I had a retail job that I mostly worked on weekends. With the virus, I've not been fired, but I'm not working because the store is closed (it's a non-essential mom and pop shop). I'm in a very lucky, very privileged situation where I live with my granddad so I don't pay rent or utilities, and I get an allowance from my father.  

My problem is that for a while I have spent really unwisely. When I was an undergraduate student I was really good at putting money into my savings (and I have a couple grand saved up) but since I started graduate school I not only haven't saved anything, I've spent around $1000 of my savings on unnecessary things (mostly big things like tattoos or gaming consoles). I'm not sure what happened, but I think it's just been retail therapy and not having anybody around to check me. In undergrad, I always went shopping with my friends and I think they were good influences on my spending habits. Now, I don't have them around, so I only have to justify my spending to myself (even though my friends never actually judged me or anything, it was mostly just they would spend reasonably so I also would). 

I had been making some progress towards limiting frivolous spending. I stopped going to Starbucks, I would tell myself I could buy only $20 worth of ""fun"" stuff when I went to Target to get something I needed, etc. I never really online shopped because I prefer to see stuff in-person, so when I was trying to stop myself from spending money I just wouldn't go to places where I could spend too much money. It helped a little bit. 

Now, with social distancing, online shopping is a problem. I'm very anxious about my father (who is 63 and has heart problems) and my grandfather (who is 91) getting the virus, and that anxiety is made worse because my mother died of cancer in February, so I'm still dealing with that. Retail therapy seems to be my way of distracting myself and making myself feel better.  I'm teleworking for an internship and I have online classes, so that distracts me for part of the day, but it's hard for me to really focus on them because teleworking is boring and frustrating and I'm just checked out of my classes. Whenever I get the chance to buy something, I have been, and my credit card is almost maxed out already and it isn't due for another 20 days. I've been justifying it as giving myself something to do for the next several months, or something to make my room a happier place to be stuck in, or whatever. Also buying groceries for me and my granddad has been really expensive, as each time I've gone to the store I've bought more than I usually do so we have enough in case I can't go out again for a while, and I've been buying more snacks I can eat while home. 

I'm just not sure what I can do to stop myself from spending. It's harder to put myself in a situation where I can't spend when I can just use PayPal. I've been trying to distract myself with TV or reading, neither of which hold my attention for long. Video games kind of work but I can only play Animal Crossing for so long before I get tired of it. I text my friends but that doesn't really distract me, and I'm trying to avoid my granddad as much as possible in case I'm carrying the virus with no symptoms, so I can't really spend much time with him. 

Does anybody have any advice on how to keep myself from needing to spend money or at least keeping within a budget?",31Mar2020,2

732,"Hello. I‚Äôm 18 F and have been living with my parents again because of Quarantine. Typically I would be living at college versus my house. For most of my life, my mother has occasionally come up from behind and slapped my butt. when i was young, I did not care, but as I‚Äôve grown, it‚Äôs begun to make me very uncomfortable. when I was 16, I started telling her to knock it off. She has continued to this day. Today, she did it and I flipped out and told her how uncomfortable it made me and how, for the hundredth time, it was not okay to do. She freaked out. Slammed doors, yelled, started crying, and started saying that she was the worst parent ever and that my whole childhood was just ‚Äúawful‚Äù. She then just walked out of the house and I have not seen her since. It‚Äôs been an hour. 

For extra information, she has never touched any other inappropriate part of me. She does not intend to slap my ass in a sexual way, nor in lieu of punishment. She only does this about once every 3 months. I have consistently told her of my discomfort every time she does it, yet she continues. This is not the first time this kind of situation has happened, where she has tried to draw pity from myself and the family, and started crying.
I have done my best to tell the story how it is, from an unbiased standpoint. I would be happy to answer any questions pertaining to the story. Please help.",31Mar2020,1
733,"Hey guys. I know i sounded dramatic with that title but that‚Äôs what I am feeling right now. So I graduated high school back in 2013 and started doing my undergrad in 2015. In my junior year of college I did something wrong. I had lots of classes and not enough time to study for all of them so I tried to cheat during one of the finals. I have been caught and expelled from the university for plagiarism and cheating. Do I regret it? Yes. Did I deserve a punishment? Absolutely. Did it have to be that severe? I don‚Äôt know. No one, not even my family knows that I was kicked out of college and it‚Äôs been two years since that happened and I am turning 24 this year... I want to start doing my undergrad again but with the academic background I already have, I am not sure if I‚Äôll get an acceptance letter plus I‚Äôm not that young anymore.

734,"F/24. 

I have just realised that women have no inherent power. As a teenager (12 to 16) I was an angry feminist and I‚Äôve been much more conservative in recent years (a 180¬∞ turn), but now I just feel confused and deflated.

People say women have power over men, but that is only if that particular man finds that particular woman attractive. That‚Äôs not power, when it‚Äôs inextricably linked to what a man thinks of immutable characteristics. I‚Äôm not beautiful, I never really was, and when I‚Äôm old I‚Äôll be far less attractive - so this ‚Äúpower‚Äù really only exists for a sliver of women, for a period of twenty years or less.

I don‚Äôt have to find a man attractive for him to have power over me because of his superior physical strength. Please don‚Äôt say women can be just as physically strong as men, you know that in the vast majority of cases, that is just utter nonsense.

Women don‚Äôt have any kind of special ‚Äúrespect‚Äù or ‚Äúreverence‚Äù shown to them because they‚Äôre women anymore nowadays - feminists have seen to that, because apparently it was evil.

So where is our ability to protect ourselves, really? Feminism promised so much but in the end it just stripped away all these protections, leaving women vulnerable, and also giving them a taste of a completely unsustainable freedom, because if something were to go wrong, and society were to break down, women would not be able to survive without running to men. Men ultimately DID build the vast majority of infrastructure, the vast majority of medical, mechanical, architectural, educational, political developments we enjoy come from men, and actually I don‚Äôt believe women are just as capable as men, in just as large numbers of doing these sorts of things. This doesn‚Äôt make women inferior as human beings, or mean that there can‚Äôt be exceptions, but I think it‚Äôs pretty clear that women and men have differing interests and generally pursue different things.

I‚Äôm sick of Hollywood feeding us nonsense about stick thin models like Sasha Luss beating up twenty beefy trained assassins in three minutes - please. I‚Äôm sick of seeing this constant push for ‚Äúmore women in X‚Äù. Why? Why do we need more women in engineering? How does that necessarily improve engineering? It doesn‚Äôt. We just need the best quality engineers, no? Man or woman, and most will be men.

All of this really upsets me. Not because I hate men, but I just see it as so cruel and unfair. Why are women made like this? Why couldn‚Äôt we be at least of equal strength to men? For those of you who believe, why would God do this to us?",31Mar2020,0
735,"So, I‚Äôm (21M) currently set to earn my bachelors degree in June. I finish my fall semester at the end of April, was set to ‚Äúattend‚Äù the virtual ceremony in May, but since I‚Äôm 2 classes short, I would complete them online over the summer in May and June. 

Currently I‚Äôm graduating a year early with business degrees in Entrepreneurship and Management from Northeastern University, which is a moderately prestigious school.

However, this downturn is really shaking me up. I had a job offer all but lined up, and 3 weeks ago got the email that they weren‚Äôt hiring anymore. In the past 3 weeks I‚Äôve applied to north of 100 jobs in just about every major city, of which I have gotten one interview and about 15 emails saying they‚Äôre no longer hiring. I‚Äôve also reached out to 4 of my old professors asking for help connecting with their networks, but nothing has come through yet.

I know all of the horror stories of the class of 2009, and  have read all the articles already proclaiming the class of 2020 to be the new 2009.  I‚Äôve also read most analysts expect this downturn to be briefer than the last one, and that we will start recovering again in 6-8 months (assuming the virus calms down). 

The reason I wanted to graduate a year early was to avoid too many student loans. My goal was to graduate with no more than $55K in debt, and expect to graduate at exactly that line. Doing an extra year will increase my debt by at least $20k. 

On the other hand, if I do another year I would be able to get a bachelors in finance degree, which would be a much more valuable and marketable degree than my current two. I also have the very strong likelihood of graduating in a better job market than the current one, where even businesses who can afford to hire aren‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going to happen.

TL;DR this is my pros and cons list:

Pros 2020
Graduating with $20k less debt
Possibility of getting an extra year of salary if I do get a job

Cons 2020
Graduating in the worst job market in at least a decade, theoretically ever
Graduating with 2 less valuable degrees

Pros 2021
Getting a much more valuable finance degree
Likely graduating in a better job market

Cons 2021
$20k more debt, $75k total
If the virus does come back next year and bring down the economy again, I‚Äôd be just as screwed as I am now, only with $20k more debt",31Mar2020,1

738,"So every year, I get together with a bunch of friends I grew up together. It's become somewhat of a tradition.

Now, friend-group boundaries aren't always clear. There have always been a ring of ""peripheral"" people that, each year, I struggle with deciding whether to invite them or not. These people are peripheral in a sense that several folks in the ""core"" group are close with them, but most of them are not. Such as one friend of mine, let's call them A.

A is a little eccentric. I like hanging out with A, but my sense is that most of the folks in my Core Group do not feel totally comfortable hanging out with A. I had A come to the annual party once, but the atmosphere was just not that great. A has a strong personality and likes to take up a lot of space while most people in the Core Group are less assertive. Since then, I have not invited A to these parties.

But each year, I feel bad about not inviting A. This is because A tends to lament about how they don't get invited to things, and I have a sneaky suspicion that they already know I've continued doing these parties without them. I remember A asking one time years ago, explicitly, ""are you doing this party without me?"" I don't remember exactly how I answered them, but I think I said something along the lines of oh I'm getting together with these people but do you want to do our own get-together too?

There is an implicit understanding that the party belongs to my core group, which is why I've tended to err on the side of let's-not-invite-A. But the party does belong somewhat more to me and another one of my friends, because year after year we've taken the lead in organizing and it's usually at one of our places. We've taken the habit of making decisions based on what makes the Core Group feel best, and we feel that not inviting A makes the Core Group feel the most comfortable.

A hasn't asked, in the last 2 years or so, about the existence of these parties, maybe because we were teenagers when these parties first became a thing and we're now very much adults. So maybe A has just grown out of caring. What I've been doing in the past few years is continuing the Core Group parties but also doing something with A at another time with people that we're all comfortable with. I think this is a fair compromise, but I still feel a weird icky feeling that I'm hiding something from A.

So, should I ""confess"" to A, in the spirit of transparency, that these parties have still been continuing? I admit I tend to be overly conscientious when it comes to offending people, and sometimes I feel urges to do things that, while they may alleviate my conscience, can make matters worse.

747,"Long post, but I‚Äôm very confused as to why I‚Äôm being accused of theft from an online seller. I‚Äôm also not sure which flair this would be under, but it‚Äôs a small amount of money, so I chose small claims. Apologies if I‚Äôm incorrect:

Back in November, I ordered a retro video game console and a flash cartridge for said system from a small electronics business out of California, and paid them via PayPal. I spent $205 for the game system, and the flash cart, with the flash carts generally retailing at around $130-150. I had bought from this company before and figured they could give me a good deal.

When I got the package in the mail, everything was fine except for the fact that the seller didn‚Äôt include the registration information for the cartridge, which is needed to download the firmware from online. Firmware is linked to specific cartridges, so you HAVE to have your own cart‚Äôs registration info, and using someone else‚Äôs firmware will not work.

I messaged the seller asking for the information so I could download my firmware from the site, and instead of giving me the information, they emailed me a copy of what was supposedly my cart‚Äôs firmware, and of course it didn‚Äôt work. I then told them that I needed my cart‚Äôs info, and it took several weeks before I even got a response, even though I could see the they were reading my messages. I even called their support number where I spoke with the owner, and he happily told me that he would take care of it later that evening. I waited a couple more weeks and still had no response or help. He did not answer any more phone calls from me afterwards. They later gave me registration info that was not accepted by the website, and then sent me another firmware copy that still did not work. 

Finally, I just asked them if I could just return the cartridge and be refunded for the value of the cartridge, intending to eventually just buy a new cartridge directly from the manufacturer. The seller responded ‚Äúsure, don‚Äôt see why not,‚Äù but they didn‚Äôt tell me how much they were going to refund for the cartridge. The day before mailing it, I asked them how much they were going to refund me for the cartridge, and they said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, we‚Äôll have to look at your order‚Äù. Still, I mailed the cartridge back to them from the post office the next day, and the estimated delivery date was scheduled to be the following Tuesday.

A day after the estimated date, I messaged asking if they received it. The seller said he was in Detroit but would see when he got back in a couple days. I waited until the following Monday and messaged again. This time I could see that they read my message, but I received no response. For the next several days, I messaged the page at least once a day, just trying to find out if my package had been received, so that I could get my refund. The following week, I decided that enough was enough, and I filed a claim with PayPal to get my refund. As soon as the claim was filed, the company responded on PayPal telling me that my PayPal account was being flagged in their database for suspicious and fraudulent activity, and that they would report me to the authorities if necessary. They also blocked me on Facebook, so I lost any way to message or contact them.

I hadn‚Äôt done anything wrong, however, so I 
continued with the PayPal claim, eventually speaking to a PayPal representative on the phone and explaining that I didn‚Äôt even need a FULL refund because I had only sent back the nonfunctional portion of my order: the cartridge. Several days later, I was refunded $164 of the $205 that I initially paid. That amount was a bit higher than I would have asked for the cartridge value, but seeing as the company gave me no way to contact them, at that point, I figured the situation was done.

Fast forward to about a month later. I‚Äôm posting in a retro game group that I‚Äôm in (where the company was referenced to me in) and evidently the owner has an account and is part of that group. He commented on my post and said ‚Äúaren‚Äôt you the dude who stole a PSX from me earlier this year?‚Äù

Others began replying and he said that he had filed an IC3 claim against me, which opened a mail fraud claim. He claimed that I sent back a functioning cartridge claiming that it did not work, and kept the game system itself, while receiving a full refund from PayPal. Obviously this is false, as I only received a partial refund for the partial return that I made, and I specifically told them that I needed refunded for the value of the cartridge and for that to just be separated from the original amount. In no way did I ever imply or state that I was sending back the entire package, game system included. The system works fine, so I only needed to return the part of the package that wasn‚Äôt working as intended to get a partial refund, which is exactly what I did. 

I replied to his comment and said everything I just posted here, and even said that I would be more than happy to pay an extra $34 so that they would have received $130 of my money, which is the retail price of one of the flash cartridges. I also messaged him personally with the same offer. That was two days ago, and he has yet to respond to either the comments, or to even read the messages. I have no problem paying him a bit extra, but at the moment, he hasn‚Äôt attempted to speak with me any further or to get that money.

I‚Äôm not very educated in legality so:

1. Should I be worried at all? I know mail fraud is a federal offense, but is this something that has enough evidence to even GO to court? Again if my math is correct, this whole dispute is over around $34, which just seems silly to me. I have our ENTIRE message history saved, where they clearly tell me that it‚Äôs okay to send the cartridge back to have it‚Äôs value refunded.

2. I wonder if he actually filed anything, or if he‚Äôs just blowing smoke? Assuming a mail fraud claim WAS opened, would I have heard about it by now, since it‚Äôs been a little over a month since I received my refund? How long do those investigations typically take? 

3. Should I continue to try contacting him, or leave it alone at this point? The fact that I‚Äôm even aware of any potential legal trouble is just on the chance that I saw his comment on my post, as again, I hadn‚Äôt given the situation a second thought since it ended last month.",31Mar2020,2
749,"Apologies for what is probably gonna be a mess of a post. 

I work as a manager at a restaurant in california, earning a tiny bit over minimum wage. So i don‚Äôt want to address these concerns in a way that puts me or my other coworkers at risk in this uncertain times. But basically the way this place is handling things is borderline absurd. 

Example 1: a coworker of mine was directly ‚Äúexposed‚Äù. Showed no symptoms but had a direct link to someone who came direct contact with it and hadn‚Äôt taken a test yet. This was early March, before the stay at home order. My coworker was told that it was ‚Äúup to them‚Äù to decide whether they wanted to come in, or take two weeks quarantine unpaid because their doctor wouldn‚Äôt allow them to take a test to confirm or deny they had the virus, so a self-quarantine would fall under ‚Äúvoluntary time off‚Äù. (They had no symptoms, doctor couldn‚Äôt give them a test when others had symptoms)

Example 2: Since changing our business to takeout/delivery only we have a lot of doordashes/uber eats/etc. we halved our occupancy which means 45 people can still be in our lobby hanging out waiting. There are no clear rules on how we are supposed to enforce social distancing (or if we even have to at all). Customers stand in groups of 5-6 in our lobby, talking and waiting for food. 

Example 3: People cannot sit outside, but they can go eat in their car, and come in to refill their cups despite it being a huge cross contamination risk. 

Example 4: Doordash/uber eats/etc delivery drivers have consistently brought their bags into our (still open) bathrooms, as well as putting them on the floor while waiting for the food to be ready. 

Example 5: we‚Äôve had consistent customer complaints since this whole thing has started. The most recent and common thing at this point being that customers are required to get their own drinks, along with the lids and straws being exposed for anyone to grab. Basically all cups are exposed should someone be sick and grab one. 

There are other issues with this company that don‚Äôt necessarily involve the CDC, like them working people 2 hours every 2 weeks. Basically being fine with exposing their employees to whatever for like...20 bucks ultimately. Anyways, we as a crew are getting really stressed, tired and beaten down with this whole thing. And i know that we should be thankful we‚Äôre still making money, but honestly some of them are spending more on gas to get to work than making during their shift. They aren‚Äôt listening to us. What can I do?

**1**)**He sleep in everyday:**

He sleeps in everyday until 1:00pm or 5:00pm. This wasn‚Äôt a problem besides weekends. It wasn‚Äôt a problem as I was at work most of the day.

However, due to Covid-19 I am now working from home. I had a conference call over zoom at 10:00am, he texted me saying I was being ‚Äúa bit loud.‚Äù I had headphones on so he wouldn‚Äôt hear my coworkers, I had left my room and went in the living room for the call as that is the room farthest from his room. Before Covid-19, I was either at work in the morning or would tip-toe quietly around the apartment 4during the weekend. However, this is work and I can‚Äôt budge on that, If I could I would but I need to pay rent.

This wouldn‚Äôt be so frustrating, but he is sleeping in ***by choice.*** He works from home and sets his own hours, although work for him is sporadic and he isn‚Äôt working right now. If he worked nightshift I would understand but he is in complete control on his schedule.

He has brought up before that he wants to begin waking up earlier, what time that means I don‚Äôt know.

I have emailed my strata and asked what time quiet hours are, but I imagine like most apartments it will be between 7:00am or 8:00am to 8 or 9pm

I plan on having the following conversations with him:

1. I will explain to him that I want to accommodate him and usually do but this is my work and I don‚Äôt have a choice, I will explain that I am well within non-quiet hours.
2. I will explain that I will ty to keep my voice down as much as I can and try to push all my work calls after 10:00am, my work starts earlier than that but I will push calls back for him if it all possible.
3. I will nicely explain that after 10:00am I may need to make calls, he will need to accommodate that.
4. I will nicely offer him earplugs. I often wear earplugs to accommodate him during the day when he is noisy (see my second complaint).
5. I will let him know that I usually do my best to accommodate him, in the past ive gone outside for personal calls when I am home in the morning. So, I try to accommodate him when I can. However, this is work and I will have to make semi frequent calls with my laptop infront of me. I can‚Äôt step outside all the time.

&amp;#x200B;

**2**)**He is noisy when he games:**

Before we moved in, he mentioned that he was a big gamer and liked to watch movies. I knew we were living in a relatively small apartment, I brought up the issue of noise. He stated this wouldn‚Äôt be a problem as he could ‚Äúalways wear headphones.‚Äù

What he didn‚Äôt mention, was that wearing headphones included using a microphone to talk to his friends. This is loud and I can hear everything. He will play 6 ‚Äì 10 hours a day. This also means he takes over the living room.

This feels unfair, as Im expected to be quiet most of the day and he is loud most of the afternoon/evening he is awake.

In his defense, when I tell him im going to bed he *usually* keeps the noise down or atleast lowers his speaking voice. This is in part because I sleep with a fan for whitenoise and sometimes earplugs.

During the day, I will wear plugs and industrial ear muffs to drown him out. In the past, when it was really bad and he was playing atleast 14+ hours a day with a mic I brought up that the noise was becoming a problem for me. This was during a snowstorm and I had to work from home again. I shared with him that I had to wear ear plugs a lot of the time to deal with his noise.

He seemed empathetic and stated that must be frustrating. He said he had been playing more because his friends weren‚Äôt working due to the snowstorm. He stated he would begin to play less, and that work would pick up for him soon and he would have less time to play.

He does play a little less, instead of 14 hours to 16 hours with a mic, its down between 6 to 10 hours. Work did not pick up for him.

This wouldn‚Äôt be so bad, but im not exaggerating when I say it‚Äôs *everyday.* Normally, before covid-19 he would stay at his parents 2 weekdays to visit them and as a result I would geta bit of a break but he is not doing that now. Even when he was at his parents for 2 days, I still felt the noise was excessive.

**How im going to approach this**:

1. The noise is a less of an issue than the sleeping in and I may leave the noise issue until after quarantine.
2. Before we renew our lease, I will speak to him again about the noise. If he doesn‚Äôt offer a solution, I may have to ask for a time limit to be set or tell him I am moving out. I could live with my parents again while I look for a new place.

**What he does for me:**

In his defense, he pay his rent on time, he furnished our living room with couches, a t.v ,and table, he lets me use his consoles and lets me leach off his Costco card.

I actually like him as a person, we were semi-friends.

**Additional Thoughts:**

Is their any guides of how to approach my roommate about these difficult topics?

I realize I should approach these as a give-and-take conversation ‚Äì any ideas how to best do this?

757,"Hello everyone, needless to say this is a throwaway account due to obvious reasons. 

I am currently in Prague and my 90 day stay ends next week. I decided to come here to escape from my country ongoing social crisis  and I was applying to jobs and going through interviews, I have the great advantage that I can go to any Czech embassy in the world to apply for a work card, nonetheless due to the current situation I am unable to do anything and I will become an illegal migrant after the state of emergency ends most likely next month. I am thinking about applying for international protection since I am afraid to return to my country, nonetheless I met a Czech woman last year who has been now supporting me with food and accommodation and she is willing to register with me at the migration office so I can stay legally. I can tell she is truly in love with me, although I am not because there is a noticeable age difference (25 years) and I feel we don't have much in common. Probably some of you will not agree with me on any of this and I am willing to take the bullets, but at the same time I am in a desperate situation. Should I request a partnership visa provided that we get all the necessary assistance to ensure it is successful or should I apply for international protection?",31Mar2020,1
758,"There are few things that are the reasons I don't want to call him a friend anymore and we have been talking to each other for 3-4 years online. All three of us are in our 20's. 

\- He never texts me first + if he does, he texts late at night. This is an issue for me because I don't like to be the initiating one since he doesn't reply because either he forgets to (he says so + though he is a forgetful person and I understand, I find it weird that he would not just bump into my message like ""Oh, that girl; forgot to text better do it now."") or he is busy. 

About the business, I told him to text me he is busy if I'm expecting a response for it so I don't feel bad or mention it beforehand. I'm an insecure person and I sometimes think he just doesn't want to talk to me. 

About the texting first thing, I stopped initiating conversations because of the numerous times I have failed and he usually texts me around 9 -7 for him- o'clock. The problem is, I later on learn he wasn't busy at those times at all. I feel like his late night call. 

\- I can't express my feelings as much -anger, irritation, disappointment etc.- because when I do, he goes to a bad conclusion that never even crossed my mind and at the end it gets tiring for me to try to make him understand so I just don't care and move on. At times the tables even turn and we suddenly talk about what I'm supposedly doing wrong. + I sometimes don't **feel** like he doesn't find wrong in himself at all even at incidents where obviously he is the one at fault (this is how I feel, I don't know for sure regarding what he says to me).

\- We talk on and off, he claims this is because he has mood swings. We can go without talking for months and then I will just get a text like ""I'm bored, help"" at 2AM. That makes me **feel** used. 

\- He put me aside for some new friend he has. I just don't **feel** like I'm even accounted for when it comes to that friend, the first moment they met, he just ditched me to play with the friend when we were binge playing together. I **feel** like that's something disrespectful to do to a friend? I get that he may like this friend more than he likes me regardless of the time we have been friends for, it's just that I **feel** like he doesn't even care about me enough to be thinking about how I would feel in such situation. He had even mentioned it is going to be 1 game that he plays with the friend but after &gt;1 games, I texted him he was going to notify me after a game and he just said ""I forgot"". I waited for an hour and a half just to be officially ditched. 

There is one more thing that is something I consider an issue when it comes to this point; he said he felt catfished and wanted to make a voice call which ended up being for all the games they are playing together. The problem is, I ripped my ass to call just once in a game. I seriously insisted that we call from time to time only to respectfully give up when he said he doesn't like calls. So what changed with this person? They call for hours and I'm just so feeling shit. Am I actually taking this too personal? 

These mentioned actions make me want to be away from him but just as I'm pushing away, he starts pulling me! I never text first now which decreased our time together but I seriously don't mind since it appears this is what he wants, I **feel** like this is what he wants because he doesn't do anything to make it change. 

What can I do to make myself feel better? He is, pathetic of me, the only friend I have and these things just make me feel lonelier than when I had no friends.

765,"Sorry this is a long post and sorry for the formatting...I‚Äôm on mobile. 

So I guess to start, I‚Äôve been dealing with depression for the past 5 years on and off. This year has been really really bad and I‚Äôve also been dealing with anxiety, issues with focus, trouble eating, and difficulty maintaining a normal sleep schedule (I‚Äôm going to therapy now and I have a great therapist who has really helped. My college also knows about these issues and I‚Äôve been getting help on that front as well). I‚Äôve also become much more introverted and am now at the point where there are very few people I would actually want to see. But even with the people with whom I‚Äôm closest, I would never ever reach out to talk, much less to hang out. Whenever I do reach out to someone, it‚Äôs usually because I‚Äôm in a very bad place, which I know is really bad and so I try to balance that out by being there for them and telling them good things that happen. 

My closest friend is an extreme extrovert. She struggles/struggled with many of the same issues I have but they have shaped her in different ways. She cannot be without human contact so all of the quarantining and social distancing has been hard for her. I, however, have been doing much better since I‚Äôve been away from people (I‚Äôm in college so now that I‚Äôm living at home, I just see my family...but even with them I have to get away so I spent the past weekend at college to have some space). My best friend can be a little overwhelming at times and she always reaches out so I figured she was comfortable with that and I just left it at that. Apparently she wasn‚Äôt. 

Yesterday was her birthday. I had a very busy day with school and handling some other things. She lives about 30 minutes away from our college so I spent Sunday night with her and was there for her birthday at midnight. However, on the day of her birthday, I didn‚Äôt have the time to talk. After I was done (around 4) I took a friend who lives in the same apartment complex (she has also dealt with stuff and is a little easier to talk to about my issues than my best friend but she doesn‚Äôt give nearly as good advice) to get groceries and we also picked up some stuff for my best friend‚Äôs housemate who may or may not have coronavirus. Then me and my apartment friend got dinner and I spent the rest of the night in. This, understandably, frustrated my best friend, as this was her 21st birthday and she takes birthdays very seriously. I hate my birthday and each year I dread the well wishes and celebration and I can‚Äôt wait for it to be over. 

I know I messed up so I‚Äôm asking for advice on how to be more proactive. I HATE reaching out to people. If I‚Äôm physically close to someone it‚Äôs a little easier for me (even to text them which is weird). I realize that you can‚Äôt change other people and that I will probably be the one who has to change, but this is the most satisfied I‚Äôve been in a while. If I didn‚Äôt get any texts or snapchats from any of my friends for any period of time, I would be fine. I‚Äôm very comfortable being alone and not talking to people. I will do it when prompted but reaching out is hard. I (clearly) don‚Äôt have a problem talking to strangers on the internet and honestly reddit has been very good for my mental health overall. 

What do I do? Do I ask her to stop talking to me so much? She‚Äôs already angry that she has been the one reaching out to me since we got out of school (about 2.5 weeks ago). She is one of my closest friends and confidants so if I push her away I will probably push everyone else away too (I‚Äôve kind of been doing that already and honestly I feel a little better). On the other hand, whenever I upset my best friend, I get these super bad depressive episodes because my best friend tends to get angrier more easily whereas I get sad. I‚Äôve started writing more and I‚Äôve found that I don‚Äôt need to talk about it with other people anymore. To make matters worse (?) I‚Äôm also in a situation where I have been guaranteed a job after I graduate but that involves working a lot with people (which I can do) and mentoring (which I can do) but the people who I consider my peers can be very toxic at times and generally unhelpful with mental health things (there are exceptions). 

TL/DR: I‚Äôm an extreme introvert who is best friends with an extreme extrovert. How do I maintain that relationship even though it emotionally taxes me?

I'm no stranger to homework, I've always gotten sick easily and have been out of school for months at a time and always bouncing back.  But ever since having the flu at the beginning of last semester after Christmas an irrational fear has developed revolving around homework.  I told my parents of course but I still got through the quarter, never slipping to failing, so they sort of shrugged it off and told me it was hypochondria and just being a hormonal teen.

772,"Hello everyone, for about a year I started hitting myself in the head everytime I get frustrated. I also tend to punch myself in the face as well. At the beggining it wasn't serious, because I was quite weak. However, one year ago I started doing home training, with a pullup bar and some dumbells and my strength has increased a lot. Everytime I hit myself it hurts now, but I haven't reached the point of getting dizzy or anything like that. The problem is that I'm a university student, and the idea that hitting my head will affect my brain scares me. I don't really think I'm a crazy person or anything to the point that  I require some psychological help, as I don't get super frustrated quite often. I'm asking because during this quarantine I'm having a lot of free time, and being surrounded with my family (I'm fighting a lot with them) and playing clash royale (for those who know this game, I play with emotes off and even so I get mad) is causing a lot of disconfort, leading to me hitting myself a lot more than I do. 

What I wanted to know is if anyone knows a safe way of dealing with burts of explosive anger. I thought of finding another place in my body that is safer to hit, like the palm of my hands.

Now the project is done but I'm afraid that if it is graded as a two-person project, it might not get a good grade. However, for a one-person project, it is great so I'd be losing points by going with him.

777,"As the title says, my brother is an incel. He has always been a jerk, possibly autistic, but this is beyond asshole behavior. He has gone off the deep end with this and I don't know how to help. He isn't the violent kind, but his views are so hateful, and he has convinced himself that he is the only person who is right. 

When he left for uni, he couldn't get a girlfriend. He thought it was his looks, because he was fat. He ignored that all his friends were also fat and had girlfriends. Everyone told him that he needed to listen to other people more, be more respectful of their views.

Then after he lost weight (strict dieting absolutely no exercise) he decided it was because there were no women his age who were interested in his hobbies. According to him, it was only just recently (this was in 2008) that girls started getting into nerdy hobbies.

He ignored the fact that our -mother- raised us on anime, comics, and videogames. She even named him after her favorite character (it's a normal name but if you know the show you will pick up on it immediately). He also ignored that most of his anime club were women, and half the people in his classes. Everyone told him he was wrong, he just had to be willing to look. This was when he started bothering young girls at cons. He looks young so I don't think they knew his age at first. He got some dates but of course they didn't last.

He never wanted to talk to women his age that were single. Some of them were hella desperate and he easily could have locked down a 6-7/10 thirty-something year old woman a few times if he had put in any effort towards himself. But he wants a manic pixi dream girl, she has to be young and smart(but not smarter than him or she is ""angry"") and beautiful and play games, and not just be willing to, but actively want to cook and clean for him! 

He has litterally told me, ""My apartment is a mess because I need a woman"". No one in our family has EVER in his life told him anything like that. Our family is feminist and openly so.

Something happened to him from ages 30-40. These days I can't have friends around him because he will spout some horrible sexist or racist garbage. -I- can barely stand to be around him. He talks about all sorts of racial stereotypes as of they were 100% fact, and he thinks that because what he is saying ""isn't negative"" it is fine to say. He went out to a restaurant with us once and got too loud, I asked him to quiet down so he wouldn't bother the people next to us, he looks over at them and says to me ""oh they probably don't speak English anyway!"". We live in California. It is rather diverse here to put it lightly. That was not only wildly racist of him to say, but it was delusional. 

I even once heard him speak pityingly of Eliot Rodgers. I, his own little sister, am a white woman in a relationship with an Asian man. We used to live in Santa Barbara and if everything had gone according to plan that day, my boyfriend and I would have been on that campus. My brother knows this. 

Things got worse after a while. He dated a women for a month-ish, but then she had a mental breakdown and committed suicide (possibly some bad drugs she tried for the first time, she didn't do them before. It was VERY sad). He has since fabricated an entire relationship with her in his own mind. He has spent the past few years either A: actually greiving as if he lost a long term partner, or B: using this as an excuse to wallow in his own self pity. The end result is the same.

*He lost his job, and all of his money.

*All of his longtime friends are gone, I asked around, turns out they can't stand hearing him go on and on about 'how all women are overly emotional, how all women who stream games are titty streamers and that's why streaming is easy for them, etc.' And that is what they were -willing- to tell me. 

*He is a shut in and horder. His apartment is filled to the top with bottles, and his kitchen doesn't work. His refrigerator isn't even plugged in. 

He has hit rock bottom, and he still refuses to listen to anyone or get any help. He still thinks he is the smartest and most reasonable person in the room, if anyone raises their voice over his actions then clearly they are being emotional and emotional people are always wrong. He thinks terms like ""Chad and Stacy"" are things people should know. He honestly seems to believe that his problem is that he is a nerd and no one likes nerds.

When it is pointed out to him that his Revenge of the Nerds/Office Space style ideals are extremely outdated, that nerds are the cool people now, he straight up ignores it. Henry Cavel almost missed becoming Superman because he was playing WoW, for fucks sake. Obviously that is an extreme example, but being a nerd is no longer stigmatized. There never was a reason, but now there is even less of one to go unwashed, not do your own laundry, not make friends. He seems to act like not taking care of himself is a part of being a nerd. He seems to think that if you are into videogames, you can't lift some weights as well. 

And when I say he ignores this, I mean that if you talk to him about it, he will continue a conversation as if you are saying something completely different. 
-""Nerds haven't been picked on since the late 90's""
-""Yeah I just finished the new season of Altered carbon, it was pretty good""

It is frankly terrifying to watch because I am not certain he is doing it on purpose. It feels like a legitimate mental block on his part, like he needs it to be true, because otherwise he created his own problems.

There is so much more, I can't possibly put it all down coherently in a Reddit post. I am not sure that this is all that coherent to begin with. My brother needs some serious help and I don't know what to do. Obviously he needs therapy, but he won't listen. I even tried to find therapists in his area for him, but that didn't work because he actually needs to GO. I am not good at this kind of thing, so I know I am fucking it up, but if I don't try he is going to die alone buried in trash at the age of 50 and I won't have that happen to my brother no matter how dedicated he is to being a terrible person.

I almost wish I could commit him, but that's not something that can be done, and as much as I wish I could physically force my brother to go to a doctor, that is not the best way to go about it. You can't force people to get help. It doesn't work. I know. 

My brother has terrible depression obviously. No need to point that out in the comments, it's familial. And in before ""some people just don't want help"", I am familiar with that too.

778,"T**his is my first reddit post , so sorry if there is any mistakes and I genuinely need advice from fellow chess players and teachers**  **and also mention my grammatical mistakes or spelling mistakes(****^(thank you).)** **^(( I suggest you skip the first para if you would like to directly dive to the problem))** **. My Dad ordered me to teach my 6 year old brother how to play chess.**

So here is how it goes I recently ranked up in chess due to quarantine more precisely having more time to spend on it . I casually mentioned this to my Dad while we were having  dinner . My mom out of no where comes in and complains to my dad that I spend nearly 5 hours straight on the family laptop . But I cant help it as there is nothing else to do once I finish my chores . So to defend myself I ask my dad to play chess with once he finishes his work , he works from home . He knows that he will lose so he will lose even if I have a handicap . So he goes silent and on cue my brother comes in to the table complaining that my mom's phone is out of charge . 

My dad gets an Idea and says that until my brother is able to play one proper match of chess with my dad neither  me or my brother is to touch any phone or tablet etc. not being enforced properly as both of us are in or devices at the moment but he will eventually catch us doing this its a matter of time. So It's been about 3 days and it's definitely not easy teaching a completely blank slate how chess works. He seems to under stand how pawns aka soldier's move but he also attacks straight instead of diagonal . He most certainly does not know how the knight aka horse moves as he keeps moving them in long L rather than the proper 2 step up and side. My patience with him is quite surprising because he keeps repeating the same mistakes over and over even if I mention it to him . He also can't sit for more than 10 at a time . He constantly makes excuses like toilet , thirsty heck even ear pain that magically disappears after he gets my moms phone. I know I m expecting a lot from a 6 year old but please advice the quickest most efficient way to teach him how chess works.",31Mar2020,1
779,"  Super long, but I just need someone to listen, hopefully have any sort of advice, and have some non-judgmental compassion.

I‚Äôm a teacher who‚Äôs been diagnosed with severe anxiety, OCD, psychotic depression, and am mostly likely autistic according to my therapist, though I have not been formally diagnosed (too expensive as of right now). Despite these conditions, I‚Äôm able to put on a mask and seem and function pretty normally at work. I‚Äôm good at my job and I love it very much. My students are the reason I wake up each morning. You‚Äôd never guess by how happy, confident, and relaxed I am while teaching that I suffer from these godforsaken conditions each day. I even received a promotion at the school year last year, to go from a kindergarten teacher to a K-6 reading teacher, to give you an idea of how well I can function while teaching. 

But when I am not actively teaching with a group of kids, it feels like I am being fried from the inside out. I am incredibly socially anxious around the other adults (not the kids, of course). It‚Äôs as if I totally forget my personality, totally forget how to be just a human being around the other teachers. I can‚Äôt talk, I can‚Äôt relax, I‚Äôm constantly scared they‚Äôre judging me, staring at me, what have you. It‚Äôs like my whole nervous system is constantly screaming and on fire, but my conscious brain is just like, ‚ÄúWhat??? What is wrong??? There‚Äôs nothing even happening!"" They notice I‚Äôm quiet around them, but all I tell them is that I have selective mutism, that's all. They don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm basically constantly having a panic attack around them. I don‚Äôt totally know why I feel this way about them. There‚Äô nothing wrong with them. They‚Äôre wonderful people and wonderful teachers who I‚Äôve learned a lot from. I‚Äôm glad to be working with them. But it‚Äôs as if some kind of disconnected, uncontrollable part of my nervous system goes into freak out mode just being in the same room. I‚Äôm just on constant high-alert. I don‚Äôt know how to literally just relax, sit there, and just do my work like literally any human being. I don‚Äôt know how to just sit and be a person. I can teach, talk, laugh, smile, and connect with my students on virtually every level, totally naturally and calmly. But if it‚Äôs the exact same setting, just without the kids and actively teaching, I‚Äôm an absolute wreck. I feel terrified and don‚Äôt consciously know why. The only time I feel like a human being is while teaching. 

How do you just sit in a room with people and just be a regular human being? I‚Äôm dead serious. What do people think about or feel when they‚Äôre just sitting there quietly doing solitary work? I guess part of me thinks maybe I just have too much energy that I don‚Äôt know how to express when I don‚Äôt have the kids around to use teaching to get out all the energy in such a positive way. I'm already medicated, by the way.

I'm just very concerned over my mental health as a teacher in this way. How sustainable is it to live this way? I love my job but it's like my brain is just allergic to other adult human beings. I HAVE to be able to deal with people and relax.",31Mar2020,2

785,"Buckle up y‚Äôall this is a long, somewhat confusing story. (Also sorry for the constant changes in tense, I wrote this rather quickly as the matter is somewhat urgent) 
So I have a friend, R. R used to be a really good friend. We went to college together and had several similar interests. I only did one year of college with her and R hasn‚Äôt finish her 2 year program (she stretched it to three for health reasons). After her second year she went to a foreign country which cost a lot of money. She had a job lined up for when she got back but it fell through and she spent the summer with her parents looking for a job and not getting one. The whole time she complained to me about how difficult her parents were being. In fairness her mother was being hard on her, saying ‚Äúyour full time job is finding a job‚Äù R doesn‚Äôt have a room at her house anymore, so while she stayed over the summer she slept in the living room. Aka she had no personal space and as such her mother got frustrated every time R wasn‚Äôt actively searching for a job. R messaged me again and again saying the situation with her mother was getting worse and saying that she was being emotionally abused and that she just desperately wanted to leave. 

This all came to a head when R called me crying over the following situation: R told her parents that as she could not find a job, she would not be going back to school that semester. She also told her parents she wanted to be a missionary to the foreign country that she had visited over the summer. Her parents told her that is wasn‚Äôt okay that she wasn‚Äôt going to school and that ‚ÄúGod had given her a talent for theatre and that she needed to pursue acting because they (the parents) believed that‚Äôs where God was calling her‚Äù (now this is just the most ridiculous thing I‚Äôve heard? What parent would rather their kid be a poor actress than an English teacher helping change lives? Let alone the fact that R should know better what God wants for her life than her parents, But I digress). She said she couldn‚Äôt take it there anymore and didn‚Äôt know what to do. So I asked her, ‚Äúin a perfect world, what would your next step be?‚Äù She said, ‚ÄúI would like to return to the town our college is at, work for a year, pay off my loans, and take classes next semester. But there‚Äôs no way I can do that.‚Äù 

In walks me. I have no money because I was still paying for student loans and my own personal travels (In the midst of all this I was planning to study abroad over that summer). I still lived with my dad at the time and was hoping to save up for another 6 months before moving into my own place, but I though, what if I could find a place for the both of us and we could share an apartment? I said ‚Äúif we can both afford $300 a month I know a few places we can move, it will be right but it will get you out from under your parents and you can save up for school next semester, we‚Äôll even try to get a place near the school.‚Äù She said that she talked with her parents and $300 was too much (?) a month for her. I let it drop and figured I couldn‚Äôt help her then. A few days later she called me again in tears saying her father had been laid off. Her mother was now even more adamant that R had to get a job and wouldn‚Äôt let R leave the house for anything and wouldn‚Äôt give R any chance to relax even when R got a concussion and was supposed to be relaxing like the doctor (which was a process in and of itself. R asked me if she should go and because of my EMT training I said of course you need to go, and then she was like but we don‚Äôt have insurance now... blah blah blah, I eventually found R like 5 free clinics but her mother wouldn‚Äôt take her cause it was the bad side of town, basically I had to do all the work myself to make sure R‚Äôs mom took her to the doctor) told her to. 

Now when R had told me that she was going to unnamed country I was super excited for her knowing she really loved the culture and it would be a good experience. I had wanted to help her pay, but really couldn‚Äôt afford anything at the time. So, when she called me crying, I thought this is my chance to help her now that I have the funds (which I was really taking from my own travel funds) I gave her four hundred bucks and I told her to get out. Just leave, she needed to, according to her it was an abusive situation and I wasn‚Äôt going to let R be there if I could help it. I asked my father if she could move in with us (we have an extra room) until R and I could get our own place, he said yes, it was all set and then her mother decided it wasn‚Äôt decent for a girl to live with us because it was just my father and I and people would ‚Äúget the wrong impression‚Äù (ah yes, because any time a girl moves into her friends house the immediate thought is that the girl must be involved with the father who hasn‚Äôt dated in over 25 years, but again I digress) anyway I gave her the $400 to get out and I knew she had less than $15 when I gave it to her and then like a day later she bought like a toy thing and I was like ??? Okay??? But it was her money now and I wasn‚Äôt going to make a big deal out of it cause she was dealing with stuff and maybe the toy made her feel just a little better, that‚Äôs all I wanted. I wanted her safe and better so if the toy helped then it helped. 

Flash forward to I‚Äôve just gotten back from studying abroad, R still hasn‚Äôt been able to leave home, and I‚Äôm trying to find us an apartment. She still can‚Äôt afford $300 a month with no job so I suggest that she pay a smaller part of the rent in exchange for her doing the house duties that I don‚Äôt like (dishes, cleaning the bathroom, vacuuming) she says okay. We settle on her paying $100 and doing all chores. Not a great financial deal for me but I did it to help her, she then says her parents won‚Äôt let her leave until she gets a car. She has no money for a car and I don‚Äôt drive so I have no reason for a car, but I do have access to my fathers old van. It‚Äôs old, and I mean old. It has 360,000 miles on it and it‚Äôs got 3 of 4 minor driving issues but it gets you from place to place. 

So I bought the car (not a big investment my father basically gave it to me) and I go to insure it. I put R‚Äôs name on the insurance too knowing she‚Äôll drive it and I pay for the insurance under the agreement that she drives me places as needed. All is well. I start looking for a place, she says she isn‚Äôt picky. I find a one bedroom within my price range and I ask ‚Äúcan we share?‚Äù I don‚Äôt want to but it‚Äôs all I can afford. She says okay we can, and I go to apply. Too late however and we don‚Äôt get the apartment. There aren‚Äôt any in town within my range so I start looking a few towns over and she pipes up saying ‚Äúno it needs to be in the town our school is in cause I‚Äôll be going to school next semester. It has to be close.‚Äù Now she shouldn‚Äôt get the right to be choosy about it but I allow it because I want what‚Äôs best for her. I find (amazingly) a cheaper, 2 bedroom that‚Äôs somehow bigger than the other apartment and closer to the school. It‚Äôs perfect. We get it. We start moving in, all is well. 

I get the ‚Äúmaster‚Äù she gets the smaller room with the smaller closet. So I offer to let her use a little of my closet space. She now has half of my closet, all of her closet, and all of our hall closet completely full of her stuff, while my stuff is crammed into my room because I don‚Äôt have space. Finally she gets a job, starts working, and stops driving me to work because she has to work. Leaves me carless so that I have to pay for an Uber to get to work every day. This is unfair but it‚Äôs not even the beginning. She got into an accident in my car. 

She knowingly drove on a flat tire and then the tire de-seated so she just left my car in the middle of the road. The middle of the road! I deal with the problem, she causes another accident, and has to pay for repairs. Then she has the audacity to complain about how much the car is costing her! After she basically stole my car and went back on our agreement to drive me places. I‚Äôm upset but I let it slide.


I get a new job and just accept that now I have to get an Uber every day because even when she is available to drive me to work she won‚Äôt wake up until noon and I don‚Äôt like waking her up because she‚Äôs rude for the first hour of being up and she acts like everything is just this big huge inconvenience and it feels very demeaning. Anyway one day I can‚Äôt get an Uber. I don‚Äôt want to wake her but I have to go to work. I ask her is she can drive me and she pretends not to hear me, this goes on until she says no. So my only option is to drive myself. I have no license. So I take the keys and I grab my bag and get ready to drive myself to work. Long story short, I lock the keys in the car accidentally. With my apartment key and phone. It‚Äôs freezing cold middle of winter. I bang on the apartment door hoping to get back in and she doesn‚Äôt answer because she‚Äôs already back asleep. It takes ten minutes of banging on the door before she finally wakes up. I ask to borrow her phone so I can call the locksmith so I can get to work, she lets me borrow it and goes back to sleep. Acting like she didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. Mind you the house is a mess because she hasn‚Äôt cleaned in weeks and there are stacks of dishes everywhere and I just feel so played and broken. 

But this isn‚Äôt all! Then she decided that she‚Äôs not going back to school at all this year! Because she wasn‚Äôt saving up that whole time, or wasn‚Äôt enough, or whatever. She decides instead of going back to school she‚Äôs going to start saving to go back to the country she went to last summer. I‚Äôm obviously annoyed because the whole reason I‚Äôm killing myself with this job I hate is so I can pay most of the rent so that she can continue to go to school and she just decides to quit?

And then. She buys a car because mine just didn‚Äôt good enough but she‚Äôs an idiot and spends all her money on a dud. Well, I‚Äôm trying to sell my fathers car and my mother gives me her old car as my Christmas gift (even though legally I have to buy it but again, I get it dirt cheap) because now I‚Äôm trying to get my license and I need a car that I can safely drive and whatnot. Well R asks me when she can start using my new car. 

Part of the agreement with my mom for getting this newer car from her (which isn‚Äôt new by any means, but is still better than the car I‚Äôm trying to sell) was that I didn‚Äôt let R drive the car because she basically totalled my other one. As it is I can‚Äôt afford to keep her on the insurance since I‚Äôm still paying for her insurance (?) and it went up since her at fault accident. (Did I forget to mention that, yeah she hit someone with my car and then got mad at me for not having the insurance papers in the car when I took them out so could transfer the title to my name so she didn‚Äôt get in trouble driving it) she seems upset by this but let‚Äôs it slide. Well everything mostly starts settling down and I‚Äôm starting to think maybe I‚Äôm giving way more than I‚Äôm getting out of this friendship when she does an unthinkable thing.

She brought in furniture from the garbage that gave her bedbugs. She discovers the bedbugs at 1 am on a Sunday, proceeds to pound on my bedroom door until I wake up, sits down on my bed, grabs my pillow, and *then* she tells me she has bedbugs. After she tells me, she leaves. 

Just leaves! Went back home to her ‚Äúabusive‚Äù parents and left me to deal with her bed big mess. I had to call the exterminator I had to set up the appointment and throw away her gross mattress and chair. She just left! She back in state now, staying somewhere else. The apartment is fine to move back into but she hasn‚Äôt. What she has done is clear out most of her stuff (some of which is actually shared or that she allows me to use) and she barely contacts me. I don‚Äôt know if or when she plans to move back in or if she‚Äôll keep paying rent and I can‚Äôt for the life of me figure out why she thinks that she can just leave me her messes and expect me to fix everything. 

Our lease is going to be up in 6 months but, she never actually signed the lease. I asked if she wanted to co-sign but she didn‚Äôt and I said she could just sublet from me. We never signed a formal agreement. Can I kick her out? Is that too cold hearted? Should I just wait until the lease is up and find a new place to live? 

Please, help. I don‚Äôt want to lose her friendship but I‚Äôm not sure if we‚Äôre even still friends anymore. She gets more and more rude every day. We don‚Äôt talk anymore and if my boyfriend is around (dont even get me started on how nice he is to her, fixing her car when it‚Äôs broke, changing tires when she parks in literal ice, helping me get rid of the bedbugs she brought in etc.) she‚Äôs incredibly rude to him. 

Most of the time when we do have conversations she interrupts me or doesn‚Äôt even listen to what I‚Äôm saying and she just seems really really self absorbed and... frankly really entitled. Which is weird because we both grew up relatively poor (I grew up in a single parent home, she grew up with 3 siblings and one provider) I never expect anything to be given to me. I work hard at my job and I work hard for the things I get (yes I know, my parents both gave me cars; I‚Äôm privileged, etc. ... I was raised poor, but my parents are now financially better off so I‚Äôm lucky that they‚Äôre now able to help me sometimes. More often than not tho, I‚Äôm on my own. Both my brother and I had to put ourselves through college and I‚Äôm only 21 living on my own which in America most 21 year olds are still entirely dependent on their parents) She works part time and barely pays rent and yet she‚Äôs still unable to save for college? Idk something seems wrong and I don‚Äôt know how to tell her that I no longer respect her. 

What‚Äôs a nice way to solve this problem? How do I keep my relationship with R intact without also allowing myself to be a complete pushover? Is my friendship even with keeping? I don‚Äôt have very many friends and I just had a falling out with one of my closet friends so now I‚Äôm down to like literally two people so if I can save the friendship I want to. Please tell me what to do.",31Mar2020,2
786,"Hey guys, I am a college student who's always been kind of awkward and not had that many friends. Thankfully, I have managed to make friends in college which has been great, but I don't have many friends from back home (there's nobody I really hang out with during breaks when I come home, there are only really 2 kids I'd call my friends from here but I'm not even close with them).

A new girl thats close to my age moved in next door which is the first time someone my age has lived next to me. I talked to her briefly and it seems like she misses where she moved from because she doesn't have any friends here and this is more of a suburb than a bustling city.

So basically I was thinking that I should try to reach out to her so that she can make some friends here, but there isn't really anything I can invite her to and I don't really have a friend group to include her in. I was just wondering how I should reach out and any ideas for including her since she seems cool and I'd like to be her friend.

Hello fellow redditors, i hope y'all safe and doing alright.

(She's 18F)

This summer, i decided to make some life improvements since i'm going to take a major national exam this year so i thought i could adopt a better lifestyle: i finally realised that i could start going on a diet since i'm a bit overweight and start socialising often more.Therefore, i joined a summer school in July in order to meet new people and start preparing for the exam i have this year.

Everything was going as planned,i started losing weight little by little, the summer courses were fine and i made a new female friend.She sat next to me: sounded welcoming, smiling, cheerful, enthusiastic, she really knew how to talk, behave in public and was really my type. I've never been in any relationship before since i didn't want anybody wasting my time for nothing and wasn't a priority for me: i just wanted to let it come by itself so i could find the partner that could suit me the most.I slowly started catching feelings towards this girl and liking her more and more day after day. As soon as her name appeared on my notifications tab, i'd start randomly smiling for no reason, i'd become the happiest man in earth no matter what my actual mood was, i'd feel myself transported to heaven during the conversation that i was having with her and that i'd wish it would never end. I know that might sound exaggerated too but honestly i won't find words to describe how much i loved this girl.

However, i thought more than once that i should give up since she's way more sociable than me and i got tons of competition but one thing marked me about this girl is that even tho she had an amazing way to see things, was very pessimistic and always afraid of studies and failure so i thought i could help her since i struggled with the same issues 2 years ago and know how bad could it feel while keeping admiring her secretly.

Once the summer school ended, we kept texting each other and i told her that it was very nice meeting her and that she could contact me if she ever need anything especially with her studies and she said the same to me. I couldn't stop thinking about her and started developing interest more and more. I always thought that love doesn't exist: it's all about chemical reactions in your brain until you get used to that person but when i met this girl.. everything changed.I'd spend days looking for conversation material with her lol. We kept barely texting the first month after school: i checked up on her sometimes, we talked about everything: how'd our last year at school started, what were we studying, our hobbies, our common interests etc.. I was there for her literally every time she needed smth especially with studies, texts were getting more frequent and i was getting happier ofc. Sometimes,i'd flirt innocently without knowing i'm doing so lol also.We met 2 times during that period where i told her that i could help her with subjects that she wasn't that good at them and they went pretty well.She also took the SAT and TOEFL test in order to get a scholarship but she failed at getting a good score on both of them.During that period, i was with her every day:motivating her,encouraging her, asking her if she ever needed somth and giving her everything i had.We also had simultaneously practice exams at schools that she had to drop off in order to take care of her tests and i told her that it was totally okay and that i'd help her recover all the lessons she missed since we were going into winter vocation.

During all of that time, i kept seeing her doing behaviours that i used to do two years ago when i was suffering from anxiety and slightly depressed such as only seeing the bad part from things, only hoping for the worst to come, TOOOO MUCH overthinking of very single detail, crying herself to sleep,having literally zero self esteem and self confidence etc..

We kept talking on a daily basis after, until we went together on a date on her birthday, i bought her a present, she was extremely happy with it that she hugged me. she almost cried from joy too lol since it was her very first time spending her birthday with someone outside her family and bringing her a present. We had a very good time, we barely talked about everything until she asked me about relationships like if I've ever been in one before, what do i think of them etc.. she even talked to me about her ex and asked me if i liked a girl and told her that yes i do.

After giving me all those signs, we texted each other a bit that night where she told me that she couldn't find the words to thank me for the way she spent her birthday with today and i was a special person etc.. The next day, i confessed my feelings to her and she told me that we shall not rush things up and that for her you can't ask for a relationship but it comes spontaneously and i was totally okay with it and she even told me that i shall not consider that as a rejection, that she did not expect to be my crush (cuz of her low self esteem) and we can still be friends ofc and get to know each other better and i was totally fine with it because i always believed that great things take time.

We kept texting each other then and getting closer and closer and we started talking about literally everything without any shame or smth. When we were gonna take the practice exams for the second semester she started getting panic attacks, overthinking a bit too much and even thinking that i'm sick of her and don't wanna talk to her anymore so i had to tell her that i won't be tired from speaking to smn who i like so she said that i could've lost interest so i told her that this is not our case and then finally asked if the interest did grow a little bigger so i said yes and she told me that it was reciprocated . And one night before an important exam, she told me that she was suffering through depression, that she went to a therapist, that she doesn't wanna take any meds and taht she has some suicidal thoughts etc.. so i told her about my experience when going through her same thing and that made her feel much better. We kept getting closer nd closer and talking about even her friends and mine etc until i decided to ask her out and she finally said yes and that i was the best boy that i treated her ever, i always made her feel like she meant smth, i never thought of her in a sexual way (i live in a third world country) and that she won't forget me no matter what .After the first night, she'd spend the whole day offline, not checking up on her phone and i kept asking her whether she's okay or not and she kept repeating that she was fine while i knew that she was not. We spent one week together before she'd tell me that she literally faked everything, that she's forcing somth that's not gonna happen, that we don't suit each other, that she's a very bad girl and has many dark spots in her soul, and that she'd be hella jealous if she ever heard of me dating another girl and hoping that she'll deserve me. And i never felt that heartbroken or sad before, all i do is think about her, the good times and talks we've had, the first time we met and talked, the good things we said to each other it's been a week now and i can't get over all of this and she still texts me to talk to me about her daily problems etc.. and even told me that she could take time to catch feelings and that i'm husband material and giving really mixed signals but she finally asked me if i ever needed some space and i said yes.And i'm really feeling lost and devastated.

Ps: Excuse my grammar/spelling mistakes since English is my third language.

tldr;i loved a girl for the first time of my life, she gave up on me after i gave her everything, it's been a week now and i can't get over this.",31Mar2020,1

794,"I‚Äôm a retail cannabis manager in Canada. We are currently open as we are categorized as an essential service.

Most employees are doing okay but we do have one, very very liberal employee who strongly believes that we should be getting hazard pay, and paid time off for this if she gets put on quarantine for showing symptoms (which the quarantine is ordered by HO or myself) 

Here is my thought process: We sanitize everything, we are overall a very clean store, and we are following protocol for social distancing. However, we do not have gloves or masks. We cannot find them anywhere in our city. 

We are not required to be at work. I am a ‚Äúmiddle ground manager‚Äù, I run a store in western Canada but our HO (located in Ottawa) therefore I escalate payroll and HR issues to them. 

Do you think I am being too conservative, should I be asking HO about hazard pay, or do you think they are likely to tell us to take a hike? 

Also- we have 6 full time employees whose hours have been reduced to 27 hours a week (except myself and ASM) because of lower operational hours. 

I do want what‚Äôs best for the employees, but I also am looking at it from a business standpoint. Should I be laying a person or two off (therefore boosting everyone else‚Äôs hours), and letting them file for EI/government assistance? Or should I be bringing up to  HO that hazard pay should be necessary? Or should I have a conversation with the employee and just say that this is how things are?

808,"   So I'm in high school and in a program that is more academically challenging, and it all started off well in my freshman year, but then my math grades started going a bit down hill and I didn't do as well as I wanted to do and that was partly because I couldn't see well. Anyways, because of my grades I felt like my confidence had dropped a little, then I did quadratics and algebra and I did worse at first but then started to improve a bit. I think it was because of finding ways to manage my time better, anyways come sophomore year I had missed a lot of school due to health issues but at this time I was struggling in my math class, and was finding it hard as I was emotional, and and did a lot of overthinking, and had physical pain.

Any who I did bad in math. I had got advice from my teacher, and she just recommended getting a tutor or taking summer school to help improve and catch up. Then, next semester started but I was pretty burned out mentally and emotionally and was disappointed about my performance and just my overall health. I started caring less, but my anxiety was soaring however I had got some help and support and started doing better. I just feel like I developed bad test taking habits. Now come to the summer, I was feeling better, I also started to relearn and review math from freshman year up to where I learned.

Come junior year I still wanted to challenge myself, I was doing tutoring, but I found myself in a similar situation, doing poorly on tests. It was kind of intimidating to ask others for help because all the people I knew were doing really well or were complaining about high grades. I also had my other classes to stay on top of including sciences. So, I ended up doing poorly again, but this time I kind of just felt numb about it. I didn‚Äôt know who to share this with as some of my family members get mad easily and I feel like they would just get really upset with me. I don‚Äôt want to leave my program as I don‚Äôt want to transfer to another school which will most likely be the other option, and I‚Äôm already so far into it that I do want to complete it, and I have some friends as well.

I‚Äôm trying to do improve my work habits but I still end up doing poorly. I want to be able to get into a good school, even though right now I‚Äôm not sure about what I would like to do in the future, I‚Äôm mainly concerned about my grades, and meeting requirements for various programs, but more importantly I want/need to learn how to work better, smarter, more efficiently and build a better routine.

812,"Everytime I think of school I get suicidal thoughts When I'm at school I am okay yet when I'm at home before and after school thinking about it I literally want to kill myself. The mornings are especially bad. I'm not getting bullied or anything, it's just something about school that I fucking hate and I don't know why. I'm not getting bullied so I shouldn't have a reason to act like this but for some reason I do act like this. I don't have school right now because of the coronavirus, but online school is getting ready to start. 20 minutes ago my teacher texted me asking whether or not I had completed my essay that was due literally 3 weeks ago. I haven't even started. Every time I tried to start my essay I'd go into a mass panic and spend the better half of a good six hours having an emotional fucking breakdown over various things all related to school, and nothing would get achieved because I either got so exhausted I gave up and went to sleep or I ended up nearly killing myself and was having a back and forth with myself for hours on why I should or shouldn't die. I don't know what happened but I guess eventually I pushed the essay to the back of my mind and just forgot about it after giving myself a panic attack for like five days straight. 

When my teacher texted me, I instantly got reminded of school and the essay, and it literally felt like a freaking switch flipped and suddenly my suicidal thoughts were back. I have vivid imaginations (these are relatively new things that ONLY happen when I think of school) in my head of myself shooting myself in the head or stabbing myself, and I have no control over them, it happens so suddenly that it feels like somebody else is controlling them. And then after that I got reminded about how much of an idiot I am and the actual ""thoughts"" (like words) came telling me that I should just kill myself and I can't do anything right. I can shut of my thoughts sometimes but the images man they just happen so suddenly **(also I'm okay I'm not gonna kill myself. My thoughts are passive at the moment not something I'm gonna act on)**

This is how almost every school assignment goes and I'm so fucking sick of me being a dumbass and never doing anything right. I mean who the fuck has suicidal thoughts over something as small as an essay or homework! It doesn't make sense and I don't know what's wrong with me. Yeah I know I have depression but this specific instance just can't be depression because up until my teacher had reminded me about school, I felt amazing. I was happy, hadn't had suicidal thoughts in what felt like forever, especially after the school got closed down. Even after getting bored and lonely, I felt fine. School is like a literal trigger for me and right no I think it's the only one

What's wrong with me and how can I stop being like this? Please don't tell me to go tell my parents or whatever because they aren't gonna help me, nor will any other adults. They always assume I'm overreacting or just trying to give an excuse for why I do so poorly in school. I don't know maybe they're right I am making up excuses and just being a lazy fuck. I mean after all I was LITERALLY feeling like I was on top of the world like an hour ago and now I want to die. Maybe I'm just overreacting idk I just don't understand. I don't know if this is the right sub or not and I'm probably gonna delete this later but can someone please help me?",31Mar2020,1

817,"I [18F] live in an emotionally and sometimes physically abusive household. My Dad has a terrible temper. In the past he used to pretty much beat me with a stick and I would have bruises for weeks. Now that I'm older and could probably hurt him some too, he has mostly stopped that. He will break things in fits of rage and threaten to harm me physically still however. 

I always swore up and down to never be like him, but I have noticed recently how I'm turning out exactly like him. I get angry really easily and I turn to intimidation techniques with my siblings to get them to do the things that I want. Aside from that, I constantly feel insecure and I can't function properly in romantic or platonic relationships. I do have some lasting platonic relationships because I always apologize when I'm wrong, even with my siblings, but I am plagued by the feeling of not being good enough and constantly concerned that people will leave me. I am also very fearful of men. If a man ever raised his voice to me, I completely shut down.

I am a good student (senior in high school) with a solid outlook on the future. I am currently planning to go to school on a premed track. I would love to move out because I can't stand the emotional strain of dealing with my father and it seriously impacts my grades. My grades are good right now, but I know they would be so much better if I didn't have to deal with the emotional pain consistently. Here's my concern: I have a scholarship to a state school where I live, but my state is still very expensive. Even though my actual tuition is very low, adding the cost of housing (off-campus is cheaper) and other associated school costs in would mean I would be in a lot of debt. I can work, but it would be better if I didn't have to work much because, as I'm sure you guys know, you have to be an outstanding applicant in various aspects to make medical school admission. They aren't very forgiving of your grades or anything else that is faltering because you had to work.

I kind of feel trapped. I can stay living at home and be under much less financial pressure, but face the abuse, or I can move out and be financially burdened, but not have to deal with my Dad. I want to be financially independent and not rely on my parents, but I'm worried that moving out will negatively impact my future in various aspects. What should I do?

819,"Okay so first of all, I understand my parents care about meand that they wish me best but the way they enforce it is ""old school"". I'm gonna start with my dad. He cares about us but I don't know if he is abusive to some extent or not. He makes a big deal out of everything, saying no will piss him off and talking back will just result inme either getting insulted, maybe beaten or physically harmed (no marks) or he will just go on a huge rant about us. He broke my and my brother's phones twice. Both times was for minor inconveniences. I am also here to blame because I keep forgetting stuff they tell me, but I'm aware their way of raising a child is bad. He is authoritan, only personality trait of his is rambling about politics and religion and being pissed. He does love us just his hot headedness makes him unreasonable. He is impossible to compromise with, beated me up once with umbrella after he beated ME up for losing it and calling him psycho because he was pissed at me over something minor (can't remember what). Also he beated me with a belt when I was playing 3 minutes longer than his 45 minutes. He is a good person, he bought us new phones after he was pissed and was sometimes apologetic but apologies don't mean anything if the damage is already done in my opinion. Here is another thing about him, he rambles about ""other kids"" like ""other kids don't have X"" ""other kids don't have Y"" ""I've had it worse, my father was way worse than I was"" etc. First of all, I did not ask for anything he bought, I was always modest and I understand why he says that but it's so annoying. Moving onto my mom. She is a total opposite of a karen, she was beating the everliving fuck out of me when I was very young (3-9) years but she really is a nice person. However her biggest problem is, when I mess up, she insults me and when I talk back enough times , she will physically harm me (no marks, usually something like hitting me with palm open, pulling my hair). I understand I was annoying and entitled when younger but now I changed a lot and am more modest and on more Introverted side. On the good side I was always able to open up to her about certain stuff. Moving onto my siblings. I have a brother, who likes winding me up and my parents dont do shit about it. He always goofs around when with me in public places. He is also a horrible student and my online friends hate him. He also says weird ass stuff when online with friends to embarrass me. Not suprised why they hate him and in top of that, MY PARENTS DONT DO SHIT ABOUT HIM. Worst punishment he received was a few months ago when dad beated a fuck out of him cause he lied about grades (it left marks iirc) but that's about it. They may just tell on him and other than that, nothing. No restrictions and despite being a bad student and annoying as fuck they just don't fucking care. My sister is a brat to me because I like hugging her and treating her too nice out of love sometimes I guess. Almost always sides with my brother and if I ever hit her my dad would be pissed. One last thing is this weird feeling I had from within that told me there is people having it worse and shouldnt write this post, I don't know why I always had conflict from within when talking about this stuff and that same feeling from within tells me I am overreacting. For the record, I am M14, eldest child in the family, 4.23/5 student in middle school, with brother M12 dad M45 Mom F38 and sister F8, Had various problems in school when younger with peers.",31Mar2020,1

822,"I [18f] have been having a ridiculous amount of issues with my boyfriend [18m] lately. We met in middle school and always had a solid friendship so sophomore year we both ended up revealing our feelings to each other. We are now seniors and have never had major issues until recently. 

From the very beginning of our friendship, I knew he had a very troubled past that involved abuse amongst other things. This, however, never interfered with our relationship. He sometimes had days where he was very down, but that applies to anyone and everyone. I always did my best to comfort him and he would get back to his usual, happy self relatively quickly. 

A month or two ago things took a turn to the worst and he started displaying many red flags. I recognized them yet I ignored them because I‚Äôm so drawn to him and he‚Äôs such an important part of my life. On top of that, he has admitted to me that I‚Äôm one of the first people in his life to care for him so much. So one night we got into an argument because I let him know that I was going to hangout with one of my guy friends and that if I didn‚Äôt reply quickly, that was why. I didn‚Äôt see a problem with this, but my boyfriend became so agitated and angry. He began to spam me with texts and calls to try and drill me into telling him who it was. I asked him nicely to please stop sending so many messages and to calm down. Then he started naming some of my guy friends to gauge my reaction and see if he could guess who it was. Instead, I simply told him who it was and then he accuses me of cheating. No evidence or anything, this stemmed from me just wanting to hangout with a friend. He has trust issues so I tried to understand why he had this reaction. I felt bad so I ended up not hanging out with my friend and this type of behavior kept going on and is STILL going on. 

Fast forward to early last week, my older brother sent me a very sweet message one morning so I felt touched and decided to post it on my Instagram story, as most teens my age do nowadays. Well within 5 minutes, I already had my boyfriend spamming me with messages asking who that was. He called my brother very ugly and disrespectful names without even knowing it was him. Well once I told him it was my brother, he said ‚ÄúAnother guy shouldn‚Äôt be telling you he loves you anyway.‚Äù I was dumbfounded and didn‚Äôt text him for the rest of the day because I thought that was so ridiculous so I was upset. 

He has been using my social media such as the Snap Map to track my location and when I‚Äôm online so the next morning he sent me a paragraph explaining that I‚Äôm such an asshole for not messaging him despite being online. I explained my pov calmly in hopes of calming him and that we could discuss it without it becoming an altercation. Well out of nowhere he says ‚ÄúI bet you were with another guy, right?‚Äù And he asked this question over and over so once again, I stopped replying and decided to turn off my snap map and any other way he could see when I was online. He noticed IMMEDIATELY and hounded me about it. Still, I wasn‚Äôt replying. That night he began threatening to self harm if I didn‚Äôt reply so naturally I did, because I felt extremely guilty. We stayed up video chatting all night and he was so chill about the whole situation that it made me uncomfortable and I even felt scared. By the time it was around 5 or 6 am I was exhausted so I let him know that I was going to sleep at that point but that I would stay on the call if he wanted me to. His expression changed so quickly that it gave me chills. All I saw was pure rage in his eyes and I had never ever seen that in him before. He started guilt tripping me saying that I ‚Äúhad been waiting to leave him the whole night‚Äù. I tried to calm him down but I‚Äôm not the best under pressure or when I‚Äôm nervous so it didn‚Äôt work and ultimately, he cut himself in front of me, on camera. At that point I was a crying mess and I apologized countless times but he hung up and told me he was going to kill himself sometime soon. I texted his aunt, who he lives with, about the threat and she told me she checked on him but that he seemed completely fine and that he was even laughing. I‚Äôm scared for his well-being but I‚Äôm also scared for my own if I stay with him. 

This past week has been events like that repeating themselves and it‚Äôs emotionally draining for me. He needs help, but I‚Äôm not going to stay with him anymore. He needs professional help, but I‚Äôm so scared to leave him because of what he might do to harm me and/or himself. I‚Äôm sorry for such a long post, but I will appreciate any words of advice on what I could do! Thank you very much",31Mar2020,2
823,"Hi, just looking for any advice anyone would like to offer.

I am an 18 year old girl home from college due to the Coronavirus. I had a rough time in high school which included a mentally, physically, and sexually abusive boyfriend, not doing my homework, constantly feeling the need to die in order to escape everything, having essentially no friends, and PTSD from my ex and traumatic experiences with multiple guys that I can‚Äôt even begin to explain. Of these things, my parents know about an experience I had with a guy in middle school that still haunts me, that I had no friends in highschool and that I hardly did homework while I was in highschool and almost failed out.

I have had the best experience in college so far. I have been doing well in my classes and have met tons of friends. I love it in college and due to the awful experiences I have had at home, it is extremely hard for me to live here. I have nearly constant nightmares, I have no desire to do schoolwork or do anything toward bettering myself, and I have flashbacks a lot of the time which makes me feel like if I don‚Äôt get out of this house, this suburb, and this whole area, I will end up killing myself but now I don‚Äôt wanna die because college life has given me something to look forward to.

I have a more than friends with benefits situation with a guy that is a bit older than me, which I can‚Äôt explain to my parents as they see me as relatively innocent and having the same views relationship wise as them. This guy, who will be going to basic training for the national guard in August or September so I won‚Äôt see him otherwise until January, offered to let me live in his apartment with him and his roommate for as long as I needed to.

I told my parents that I kinda liked this guy but he didn‚Äôt like me back (totally false but I thought they would get at me about having sex, which we never talk about, if I said he liked me back or I didn‚Äôt know). I then asked my parents if I could stay with him for a month or at least until the hospitals are prepared for all of the future virus patients, which to no surprise they said absolutely not.

My mom thinks if I go down there I am going to die of the Coronavirus and she would feel irresponsible if she let me go down two hours to his apartment and something happened. She thinks he is going to rape me or take advantage of me in some other way.

I understand where she is coming from, but I need to get out of this house. I need to get out of this city I never liked. I need to start doing things that will benefit me and stop hurting me so much. I don‚Äôt want to do anything I regret and I feel like if I stay in this home, I will do something I can‚Äôt come back from.

Tomorrow morning I think I am going to get the courage to tell my mom about my abusive ex and tell her that it is essential for me to leave and I can‚Äôt live here anymore. I am constantly plagued by flashbacks and nightmares that make me feel so sick inside that I don‚Äôt know what to do with myself. I am worried that my mom will not let me leave or that my fwb will not show up in time to pick me up before I can leave.

I am willing to leave everything behind as there is nothing left for me here. Since starting middle school, I haven‚Äôt had a good relationship with my parents, my brother, any of my grandparents, and anyone else in between. I am tired of being here and without the escape of living two hours away at college, I don‚Äôt know what I will do to myself being here.

Do you think I should move in with my more than willing fwb and his roommate or do I stick it out and hope that I don‚Äôt get more fucked up in the head from being back at home?

Thanks",31Mar2020,1

Hi all,

This is a post I never wanted to make, but my family really needs help right now. 

My mother has been verbally and emotionally, sometimes physically, abusive towards me [24F] and my three siblings [22M, 15, and 8] (don't want to reveal additional info about underage siblings), as well as my father [49M] for our entire lives. I will not detail this abuse, but it has gone on for far too long. I have experienced alot of mental health issues as a direct result of this abuse.  I do not want my younger siblings to have their entire childhoods destroyed by her and have to deal with the lasting effects like me and my 22 year old brother have.

My parents divorced around 15 years ago but got together again and have been living together 10+ years since. They are not married, so I don't know if that has any implications on their separation, please let me know if so. 

My dad is worried that if he tells my mom he wants to separate she will make up stories and tell lies to try to get him arrested or charged with something, and also try to get custody of the younger children. She has no job so she relies solely on my father's income, which she spends so excessively that my dad's credit is ruined. I know that the chance of not having access to my dad's money would enrage her. My mom has very little family or friends, as she has cut them all off or ruined relationships with them. So there would be no one to vouch for her if she did accuse him, but it still worries me. She will do anything to get exactly what she wants and I'm very scared.

I just don't know what my dad should do. I told him before he does anything he should speak to an attorney, but I don't know what about or what type of attorney he should speak to. We live in Iowa, USA. 

Please help me. What should we do? Should he speak to an attorney? What type of attorney, if so? What can I do to help make sure the whole process goes as smoothly as possible?

 I have issues with rambling, I'm not quick to pick up on things in conversations, I sometimes will bring something irrelevant or weird into a conversation, most of my replies are just one word answers or a chuckle, my tone comes across as IDGAF even when I'm engaged or care about something, and in person I have a resting bitch face, and I also have an unconventional and inappropriate sense of humor that doesn't seem to mesh well with others.

All of my interactions are extremely awkward and draining so it's just led to me trying to avoid them all together but that's obviously not going to work long-term. Is there any way to improve your personality or conversational skills?",31Mar2020,1
831,"
A little backstory here, I have been friends with this girl for near 20 years and we have never had any issues in our friendship but lately I‚Äôm seeing a new side of her. I live in a house with two peeps. One is the above mentioned roommate (Max) and the other is a girl we moved in like 8 months ago (Jennifer). 

Now Jennifer has a very serious condition where she has to do dialysis three times a week. She is waiting to receive a new kidney and is not in the healthiest state of being to fight off Covid19. She could very well die if she gets it. We as a whole house have sat down twice now to discuss how we can keep from bringing this virus home and each time my friend Max seems to agree. Then she will turn around and go out of the house for 8+ hours to shop for food and go see her friends and family. 

This happened three days in a row. So yet again I very politely asked her to sit down and have a talk with me about all this. I begin to ask about the time she is spending outside and she interjects to, as she says ‚Äúput her two cents in‚Äù. I let her speak and the words that came out made me see my friend of 20 years in a whole new light. She said she doesn‚Äôt see how any of what she is doing could put us at risk and that she will still continue to do as she desires when it comes to going out. She said she is ‚Äúbored‚Äù and doesn‚Äôt want to stay home. She also said she doesn‚Äôt really like our other roommate and doesn‚Äôt really care what happens to her. I was so appalled and angered by this. 

I immediately stated that we(Jen and I) had made all the appropriate sacrifices to help protect her health as well as our own but she can‚Äôt even consider doing it for us. She immediately started crying like I‚Äôd just murdered her mother(which made things awkward) then she wipes her tears away gets up and says I need to go to the store for some things. She spent all day out again. I am beyond furious and I really don‚Äôt know what to do or say. This whole thing has made me realize the person I thought I knew this whole time was nothing like who she appeared to be. She doesn‚Äôt care about me or anyone else. Sorry that was kinda long winded but I needed to get that all out as I have nobody else to talk to about this. Im not sure what to do anymore and how to approach things going forward..Am I wrong for being so upset by this? Is there any advice you all have for such a situation?",31Mar2020,0
832,"I live in Australia and I'm studying four subjects in university this semester. Due to the coronavirus everything had been moved online, including practical classes. These changes happened very close to the census date and the university was ambiguous with what the format of the online practicals would be. It was just an email stating they are reconfiguring practicals. It wasn't until after the census date the details of the online practical classes was released. I would rather do these subjects next year and to get the face-to-face practical classes in the laboratory.

Edit: In California, USA. I am M24

I was looking for receptionist jobs on indeed. I found this company that paid rather well and I was emailed by an agent of the company who said the receptionist position was filled and that he required a personal assistant. He said he was an a real estate agent and would give me a formal interview in two weeks. Today he asked if I would be able to complete a task for him, and he would give me instruction once a check arrived in the mail so j can buy supplies for him. The email was setting me off a little, saying that it would be done for charity and I would be going to get supplies for a foster home. The MO of this also set me off since I've heard many stories of scams about checks being bounced as prospective employees tried to cash them out, making the employee pay the price of the bounced check.

I looked up the company on google maps and all I could see of it was one picture of what seemed like the backside of a building in the alley. So I decided to reverse google search the image and saw it attributed to a different person by a different name who was a historical society curator, not a real estate agent. I'm obviously not going to take this job now but my question is, should I wait for the check to come in and report it to a bank, the police or what? I also plan on reporting the job listing on the site I found it on to prevent other people from falling for it. Thank you for your responses.

835,"My brother works at a grocery store where, approximately a week ago, a coworker in another department of the store tested positive for the coronavirus. Although my brother hasn‚Äôt ever met this coworker, the store didn‚Äôt shut down when they found out. They went through the video footage to see everything this worker may have touched and just got rid of it.
Fast forward to yesterday, my brother got a fever and dry cough. This morning he went to his doctor who then gave him a prescription to go get testing done. Without any knowledge, and without checking online, he went to the Urgent care where they said they do not do testing there, nor did they know of any places that did. My brother comes home and goes immediately to sleep because he feels terrible and today he had shortness of breath too. 
I checked online to see where the testing centers were and I found that I can only take him tomorrow morning as the one in my county won‚Äôt pick up the phone for an appointment so I found a walk in one that‚Äôs open on certain days. 

So throughout this whole ordeal my parents have been very angry. They told my younger brother to stop working a long time ago before, but as we need money to support ourselves, he refused. My father, who does not have money whatsoever, told my brother that he‚Äôs stupid for continuously working that my father would provide him with money. From where? He doesn‚Äôt have anything and is not being paid during this quarantine. I was also let go from my job and my mom‚Äôs getting paid while she‚Äôs at home and it isn‚Äôt a lot. 

They are now blaming the entire situation on both him and I. That we were the ones who caused this whole situation and we put them at the risk of contracting the virus as they are 50+ with some health issues. 
But here‚Äôs the thing, they‚Äôre constantly going out and my dad even tries to invite his friends over. Yet because my brother decided to work, he should be shunned just because he might possibly have it?
I have very mixed feelings.

My parents had decided earlier that they were going to go to their VA apartment that is provided by my dad‚Äôs employer, we live in NJ at the moment, and leave my brother and I here, that I have to take my brother in the morning to get tested, which I planned to anyway. Then I found out that VA is now on complete lockdown of which I informed them about. It only angered them more, they just are very angry at the whole situation and can‚Äôt stop with the guilt tripping.

I understand they are at more of a risk but that‚Äôs their son, he feels like shit and he‚Äôs sick, yet they‚Äôre constantly bombarding him with the ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù or ‚ÄúIf get it and die it‚Äôs because of you.‚Äù He hasn‚Äôt gotten tested yet and just feels like crap, he‚Äôs worried as well about himself but now they‚Äôre guilting him? 

We don‚Äôt have any god damn money nor did we ever have any because my dad was not the best when we were growing up. My brother had just wanted some security and if I were honest, I would keep working too until a situation arose, we aren‚Äôt that secure to stop working. 

Yes there was fault in the fact that he planned to keep working, but the day he found out about his coworker was the last time he worked so far since he got sick, and it was because his store had not informed him right away. 

I just feel very mixed and just weird about this whole thing. I‚Äôd like your opinion more than the advice, I know it was long so I‚Äôm sorry about that as well.",31Mar2020,2

839,"So, I work in a hospital, and today is my 5th day without 60% of my paycheck from last week due to a simple clerical mistake. 

No big deal. I told my boss and told the payroll and HR lady at the company office, that‚Äôs separate from my immediate supervisor and worksite. (I need to keep anonymity because I like to not be unemployed, especially during these times.)

When I told them at the office, I said that I couldn‚Äôt wait a week for the money and they told me that I would have that money by sometime yesterday deposited in my account.

Yesterday morning (I work 3rd shift) I went into the company office, and the woman at the desk I spoke to only a few days before basically hushed me out after asking me if I had an appointment, not even giving me a second to explain that I just had to scrape together the last of my random change to be able to throw a gallon of gas in my car, and that I also haven‚Äôt eaten in two days. Can‚Äôt even support my nicotine addiction, as I normally and comfortably would, so my anxiety has been through the roof because I can‚Äôt even grab a smoke. (I was sent out of the office by the HR employee while she‚Äôs talking on a cellphone, and there‚Äôs already another employee sitting in the office?) 

From there I crossed my fingers and went to another location of my job (hard to explain but it‚Äôs my immediate supervisor‚Äôs boss, the account manager) and they just told me that the money was put through when I originally said there was an issue. (I went to the company office before that for the sole reason of seeing if they can write me a check.) So, I assumed it was going to be in my account yesterday.

Wrong. Barely made it to work last night with the amount of gas I have left. (Yes, I‚Äôm still having to work. My hours are being cut by 15-25% a day, as the hospital is now slow during all of this.) I‚Äôve tried chasing this money all day, and all yesterday. I‚Äôm tired, I‚Äôve worked all morning, and I have to go into work again for midnight. I cannot literally afford to go to work tonight because this company has not given me a check AND I AM A FRONT LINE HEALTHCARE WORKER! Oh, and to top it off, the money I‚Äôm waiting for is a few days of sick pay after being exposed to Corona (more than once... due to lack of proper equipment and poor communication.) I thankfully didn‚Äôt/don‚Äôt currently have the virus, and after 48 hours of being fever free with no cough and all of my senses presenting normal, I returned to work.

This company I work for is absolutely useless. I‚Äôve worked here on third shift for more than a year with no issues. It really bothers me that I mentioned that I haven‚Äôt eaten in couple days to more than one of my supervisors, and not one person even asked to fucking help me out, or even ask if I am okay... because I‚Äôm not.

So, it‚Äôs after 5pm now. I‚Äôve heard nothing from this job. Department of labor and training is closed, company office is closed, account manager left at 4pm. Aaaaaand the bill I expected to pay last week gave me only an extension until today and that was after 20 minutes of pleading on the phone. None of my supervisors know anything about pay issues and the only thing posted about pay issues from this company is to contact your supervisor...but they just send you to the office and it makes no sense, but there‚Äôs no policy ever outlined for what to do in this case.

So, what in the absolute hell do I do? I can‚Äôt just quit, I can‚Äôt drive or even Uber anywhere that possibly could help, and I‚Äôm the only person in my apartment that thankfully has a job, and I can‚Äôt get a new job easily because my license is suspended (my court date was moved to June and it‚Äôs suspended due to bullshit red light ticket that I refuse to pay)

I should also add that I make $14 per hour to deal with all of this bullshit and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever felt so powerless at a job ever.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions! It means a lot if you‚Äôve made it all the way down here! &lt;3",31Mar2020,2

841,"Okay so backstory. I‚Äôm 19 and I‚Äôve been having a really rough time with vehicles these past 10 months, my Ford Escape died so I bought a cheap Jeep which lasted for two months, when it unexpectedly died I had no where to turn due to my family disowning me and I needed a vehicle immediately. I tried applying to finance a $5000 car and got denied for lack of credit history. So the only place I would get approved was to lease a vehicle. I chose a 2010 equinox and put $2000 down and made $600 in payments on it and only drove it around 10 days in two months due to the many issues it had. 

They transferred me from the equinox to the loaner car I was using (2005 Buick LaCrosse) they restarted my lease so I was out $2600 and am being charged $15,000 for this Buick in a 3.5 year lease, I felt ripped off because of the money I lost and the buick is worth around $3,000. They told me that the Buick was only $9,700 but when I reviewed the lease all the other fees added up to $15,000 total. But I was fine with it because I finally had a vehicle that was running unlike the equinox did.

A week after the Buick was put into my name it started having many problems that I noticed, (abs/brake/check engine/traction control light turned on, radio would randomly short out which would follow with the gas gauge and temp gauges going all the way down and the car would start to lose power, the windows won‚Äôt roll up, the temp thermostat needed replaced the wheel bearings needed replaced) and the list goes on. 

I messaged the manager and told her about the problems and she essentially told me to go get it fixed. I left it alone and messaged her a month later and asked if it was possible to do a lease transfer. She said no. So I asked ‚Äúin the sense of if my partner and I separated could anything be done to where the lease could be in their name? (my partner and I aren‚Äôt separating but I was curious) or if the car just wasn‚Äôt reparable anymore if anything could be done and she said ‚ÄúIm sorry but that is pretty hard to believe considering how long you used it for a loaner car before you transferred into it voluntarily and happily. Nothing I can do for you in that regard. Sorry your marriage isn‚Äôt working out.‚Äù To which I replied, ‚Äúthat was completely unprofessional, I am disappointed.‚Äù She responded with, ‚ÄúObviously you misinterpret emails and should no longer email me questions if you do not like the response. Try the phone. My direct line is...‚Äù 

I was so pissed that she was talking to me that way but I didn‚Äôt respond. I went to google to go to delete my positive review that I had put on their previously but it wouldn‚Äôt let me delete, only edit. So I changed it to a one star and said, ‚Äúdo not go here for the life of you! I was given two overpriced lemon vehicles. And the manager was completely rude and unprofessional!‚Äù The manager responded to comment saying that what I was saying was ‚ÄòLibel‚Äô and that ‚ÄúI came to her about my relationship problems‚Äù and that what I was saying was against the law. 

I am so pissed and I don‚Äôt know what to do. The vehicle isn‚Äôt going to run for much longer.",31Mar2020,1

The other day I was watching some movie trailers and the ""candy man"" came on. For the past two days, it's all I've thought about I continue to say the name in my head even though it makes me warier when I do this - I'm even worried about looking into mirrors around the house now.

Looking into mirrors themselves has also been hard at times for me because of horror movies and the supernatural link to them. I remember in middle school when all of my friends turned the lights off in the toilets and started to say bloody mary into the mirrors and for me every second of that experience was awful.

I'm currently 17 and don't want this to be an issue when I'm older and living alone in my own house as this can genuinely frighten me at times when I begin to overthink as I can't stop once I start and the only thing that helps me out is knowing I have the company of my family.

852,"As the title says, I work as a baby sitter. I started in college and stuck to it full time because I am making more money now than I would if I got a job in the field I majored in. 

I‚Äôve been working for the same family for going on 3 years now, and the boy is abusive. He is 12 years old, has ADHD and learning disabilities such as dyslexia. His parents have raised him in a way that makes it seem like he is the one in charge, whatever he says goes, no matter what his other siblings think. He is spoiled rotten. When I met him, he was absolutely terrible. He was constantly throwing fits, smashing things in the house, screaming and locking himself in rooms when he didn‚Äôt want to go to school, appointments, practice etc. His parents would just call me and I would handle it. He listens to me 50x better than he listens to his parents, but although it is 50x better it is still not how a now 12 year old should behave. 

Before, it was the behaviors stated above, now that he‚Äôs getting older, his lashing out is becoming less frequent but more intense. He now cusses at his parents, hits them regularly, and continues to smash things. They do not discipline him properly at all. It seems they would rather pay me than deal with him correctly. He rarely does these behaviors with me, but when he does, I find them completely appalling. It has happened twice in the last year, the latest time being today. He was angry and hitting himself over a game, and when I went to pick up the cellphone he threw, he engaged in a battle with me over the phone. I‚Äôm not a weak woman, so I got the phone easily. Once I had the phone, he hit me twice. Now, I have years of experience working with kids and would never ever put my hands on a child, but I got so close today out of self defense. Of course I did not hit him, but I told him he was COMPLETELY out of line and left him alone in his room. 

I seriously do not know what to do. I don‚Äôt want to quit because I make great money here and these things don‚Äôt happen often to me, but he is constantly treating his parents this way. It will only get worse, and i‚Äôm afraid of what will happen not only to me but to anyone in this household without an intervention. I am the longest staying nanny/sitter they‚Äôve ever had, since no one else can handle him, and the family treats me so well and I can tell the appreciate me a lot. He is getting so bad since the quarantine started and is at home all day while his parents work (they are essential workers so I have to come in to watch the kids) and there is no clear end to this quarantine as of yet. I don‚Äôt want to be out of a job due to the nature of things going on and I don‚Äôt want to leave 2 essential workers who are helping with this pandemic without a babysitter. I refuse to let a kid try to beat me up, but I do want to help him badly. When he is behaving, he‚Äôs a funny active kid, and I know he has potential because he behaves 95% of the time when he‚Äôs with me.

Bit of background (I‚Äôll try to make this brief): 
- met this dude on tinder in Jan
- agreed we were both looking sex
- began having great sex 
- dude fell for me, deleted apps, expressed all this to me
- I was thrown off but interested, but asked if we could take things slow
- continued being a sweetheart in all forms: giving me loving attention, acts of service, quality time, words of affirmation blah blah blah. Even made comments about wanting me to move in and a joke about us getting married.
- had a few more good weeks until he became distant, because instead of communicating his feelings to me, decided that I was rejecting him because I wasn‚Äôt ready for all the stuff mentioned above.
- had a really stupid miscommunication over a text msg
- we didn‚Äôt speak for a week until he reached out to me asking to return his library book. I asked if we could talk. Over 1h40min phone call dude declared we were not on the same page and I should ‚Äúlive my life I‚Äôm so young and he knows what he wants and I don‚Äôt know what I want‚Äù. For context I‚Äôm 27, he‚Äôs 33...not a whopping age gap? 
- we haven‚Äôt spoke since
- he dropped my stuff off at work unexpectedly (I hadn‚Äôt even asked for it back?) and he didn‚Äôt bother to arrange anything with me so that was awkward for everyone involved
- now it‚Äôs been a month and we‚Äôve still had no communication
- on Friday he unblocks me on Facebook and sends me some gif of a person awkwardly shrugging in a msg. Idk wtf that‚Äôs supposed to mean.

So here I am, wasting everyone‚Äôs time with my garbage story but what the hell should I do? 

The thing is I‚Äôm not over him. I think about him all the time and I miss him. I do want to work things out. I was honestly hoping he‚Äôd message me but receiving this gif just made me feel so cheap. 

I haven‚Äôt replied because it feels like it doesn‚Äôt deserve a reply after how cold and quick he was to drop me. Another hesitation I have about replying is that communication is what essentially broke us up- he was not able to communicate effectively with me, so when I thought everything was okay, it was not. 

He‚Äôs stubborn and I am assuming that he thinks this gif is reaching out- but to me, it feels like not much thought was put into it. I worry he is just casting a line to see if I‚Äôm interested or avails. Or he could just be bored in isolation? 

This ridiculous situation is giving me such bad anxiety and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about him. What the hell do I do?",31Mar2020,1
855,"So, as the title states, my boyfriend is afraid to see a therapist. He has been struggling a lot with his stress level recently; he just got out of being quarantined with COVID-19, his dad is in a wheelchair, his car broke down yesterday, he may lose his job, when he was quarantined he kept getting bombarded with panicked calls and people wanting advice on their cars (he‚Äôs a mechanic), and all and all life has been putting him through the ringer and hasn‚Äôt given him a chance to breath any. While it‚Äôs been worse recently, all of this has been building up for a long time. These past few months have been extremely draining on him and taking a toll. 

While being stressed is completely normal, I know that he has a past of struggling with being suicidal (one moment two years ago where he only kept going because he knew no one else could take care of his dog), and he has made comments about ‚Äúgiving up‚Äù recently. When I talked to him and asked what he meant, he claimed that he just wanted to pack up and run away, but I‚Äôm worried that he is just saying that to avoid worrying me too much. He keeps saying that he is at his breaking point. Each time he has a moment like this, he bounces back within a few hours and things seem amazing, but I can‚Äôt help but keep thinking about how low his lows are, as well as how often (1-3 times a week).

I asked him to possibly seek professional help, but he confessed that he is too scared to. When he was young, his dad (who he is now close to) was diagnosed with depression and started to get treatment for it. The medicine that he was given made him very unstable and uncontrollable. He was very abusive during those years, leading my boyfriend to have a terrible home life that made him chose to leave home at 17 and live out of his truck. He is terrified that the same thing will happen to him, especially since he thinks that most doctors are just ‚Äúpull pushers‚Äù. I would like some advice on how to help him realize that not all doctors are bad and that they won‚Äôt try to force him to take medication. I know that he is scared, and I understand why completely. Maybe I am overreacting, and he really can handle it. Either way, I‚Äôd like to know what you guys think.

862,"I‚Äôll try and keep things short. Was supposed to get married this weekend but our plans were cancelled with corona virus. We‚Äôre left with three options. 

1. Marry with a small ceremony on the weekend, rebook wedding plans next year - my partner is keen, I am scared it won‚Äôt be the same and I‚Äôll always be sad we didn‚Äôt wait to do what we had planned. I also told my mom who crapped on the whole idea and told me I would never be a bride etc. This compounded my original fears, despite some excitement for a small wedding. My mums support meant a lot and whole she‚Äôd still come, she‚Äôd make it clear it‚Äôs not what she wants. 

2. Partner moves in, we get married later - This would be my preferred option right now but he holds Christian values and doesn‚Äôt want to move in first. He‚Äôs worried it will mean the wedding won‚Äôt mean as much because we‚Äôre already doing every married people do. I think he‚Äôs also concerned about how his family will react. 

3. He rents elsewhere, we get married later - no ones best choice but his preference after option 1. Costs for this will be stupid. We rented our current house with the plan of him moving in after we were married and he won‚Äôt be able to stay in his cheap accomodation anymore. We are likely unable to rebook anything for around 12 months. 

I have no clear solution where everyone is happy, everyone of these has a loser. I‚Äôm scarred I‚Äôm going to miss being introduced as husband and wife, our first dance, those one off moments we won‚Äôt get in a small wedding and may not be the same later.

i came home from uni last week, only brought half my stuff, but i left things like my pc, bunch of peripherals, my bike and few clothes/bedsheets. need to go back and move it out before end of may, as that is when my house contract ends. i am thinking of going on the train tomorrow or day after so i can move my stuff into storage, then coming back few days after. i really dont know if i should go tomorrow or wait until this lockdown is over, i have fears they might extend it, in which case i will not be able to go and move my stuff out. i live about4hrs away via train, my dad doesnt want to drive me up cause hes scared we'll get stopped by police and he has a criminial record and is understandably quite anxious about being stopped.if they cancel trains then i literally wont be able to get my stuff.

looking for some advice regarding whether i should go tomorrow/day after and sort it, which will probably take me a day or 2 to do completely, or if i should wait. i have fears i may be stranded at my uni which would really suck as im alone there, but at least my stuff will be somewhere safe.

While the other roommate and I decided to go back for the term due to obligations we have on campus (on campus job/campus clubs/groups). My question is how we should handle the bills as to who should pay which. We want to keep the house for the next year as well so rent is going to mandatory if everyone wants to stay in the house (no one has moved out either). But what about the rest of the bills? Would it be a bad idea to ask the other two roommates to help with water or electricity?

867,"TL,DR: My partner quit his job right before coronavirus hit and now has no savings, no family support, and is so depressed he can hardly do anything. I don't know what to do at this point.

My partner (24M) of almost two years who I moved in with back in September left his job of almost two years in the middle of February to pursue new opportunities. The job's pay was pretty terrible and the work miserable, but he stayed in the hopes he would be able to grow into a role more suited to his interests and talents. While he loved the team, he complained endlessly about his job for the entire time he was there because the work was not at all what he wanted to do. I encouraged him repeatedly to try applying to jobs at night after work, but he insisted his work demanded too much of him emotionally and intellectually to do so and he needed his after-work time to rest. He wasn't able to save much at all, he says, because the job was supposed to open up new opportunities to him, so he has been relying on his mother to pay his portion of our rent in full. (She encouraged him to take this low-paying job and promised to support him while he did so; she has co-signed our lease.) After a long process of back and forth, he eventually mustered up the courage to leave, and has been unemployed since.

Naturally, right as he left, COVID hit, and everything has been a wreck since. Many of the jobs he was looking at are essentially put on hold due to COVID, and his mother‚Äôs income as a small business owner has been effectively eradicated. He and his mother have had a rocky relationship for a while now, but she has essentially cut my partner off and is no longer paying his rent. With measly savings, few job prospects, and a history of depression and mental illness, he is basically at rock bottom. He has done nothing but stream Netflix, smoke weed and listen to podcasts for a month straight; he hasn‚Äôt left the house in 2 and ¬Ω weeks (he cites COVID as a concern, but I am still expected to go grocery shopping / get takeout etc. for us), and hasn‚Äôt applied to a single job since he quit. He hasn‚Äôt been able to go to his regular therapist because he can no longer afford it, either, so now that he has this riff with his mother and family, I am effectively his only support system.

I am employed, have a backlog of savings, and get an allowance from my parents to help pay rent, so I was able to pay his portion of the rent for April, and have offered to take on more of the expenses of groceries and food to help in the meantime. But as I took a pay cut in February to start a new job (and he insists I cannot tell my family about his challenges, who might be willing to support us, because he doesn‚Äôt want to be seen as a ‚Äúdeadbeat boyfriend‚Äù by my family) and make a pretty measly salary, I know this cannot last. However, he refuses to apply to jobs or do the work to prepare to do so. He has former coworkers reaching out to him and giving him contacts, advice, and offering to look over his resume, which he hasn‚Äôt followed up on at all. 

I don‚Äôt really know at all what to do at this point. We are deeply committed to one another, and living with him has been a delight. While I understand he can‚Äôt just stop being depressed, I really need him to show me that he‚Äôs trying to find work as that's the only way he'll be able to support himself. I‚Äôve communicated this to him, offered to update his resume and even apply and search for jobs with him, but he continues to sulk. 

How can I get my partner to help himself when he is in such a dark place? Is there some way to help that I‚Äôm missing, or will I just have to stay steady until he gets better? And if so, how do I take care of myself in all this when I can‚Äôt escape it (we‚Äôre quarantined together) and don‚Äôt want my friends to think poorly of him?",31Mar2020,1

872,"I've started going to a new school at the beginning of this year, and I got easy friends with two people that I decided to sit with. As time went on, I began to notice more and more red flags. They were very oblivious to anybody's feeling that weren't their own. They would bring up topics I felt uncomfortable about in front of other people, like gaming. I let them know that I did not enjoy it when they did things like this, but they could care less, and kept doing it. Both of them get really angry over little things when they game, they will start screaming, cussing, and over all just start acting really immature for their age.  When I think of friends, I think of people who I can have deeper conversations with, people who I can tell things that I don't want others knowing. Whenever I tell my friends something that seems weird, they screenshot it and keep it in case I do something they don't like. I feel like I am rambling at this point, but there is more to think of. My friends are very disrespectful to anybody who they don't like for whatever reason, they are always getting themselves into trouble.  I have never been apart of any idiotic things they do, and this may sound really selfish, but I feel like being friends with these people makes me seem like a worse person than I really am.

The issue is I‚Äôm engaged to my cousin (20F) from Pakistan and I (21M) live in London. She‚Äôs from my mom side and my mom and her side of the family decided that when we grow up we both would get married so growing up we never saw each other as cousins because we knew our families were going to get us married. We started dating at age 16. Now since the age of 19 it‚Äôs been on and off because the more we talked the more I felt that we are very different personality wise and I also feel that we don‚Äôt love each other, we think we do because we knew both of us would get married. Another big thing I‚Äôve realized is that she‚Äôs beautiful but I‚Äôm not attracted to her. I‚Äôm not a fan of cousin marriages but I can over look that and We can get tested before having kids, adopt or just not have kids. She dose not speak English or dress like what I‚Äôm used but I can look over all those things but I just can‚Äôt seem to genuinely say I love her or I‚Äôm attracted to her. I care about her and don‚Äôt want to hurt her but we both are just different. When I tell her that she always say I will try my best to change my self but I feel that she or I shouldn‚Äôt have to change so many things about one another to be in ‚Äúlove‚Äù.  Now our families decided to get us engaged in November and I made a big scene at home and said no. My family will never force me but they started emotionally blackmailing me mostly my mom who said things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to kill myself‚Äù ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt love me‚Äù ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt attend you‚Äôre wedding‚Äù ‚Äúyou used her‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to take them (my brothers and sisters) back to Pakistan so they don‚Äôt grow up to be like you‚Äù. The last one hurt the most because my siblings are very young the one after me we have an age difference of 8 years. I grew up alone with no emotional support from anyone so choosing who I marry is a very big deal to me. So hearing all those things my mom say and I was getting told that my cousin has been crying nonstop this continued for a month and I broke and said yes making myself believe this can work she can change and I can overlook all the negative stuff but after 2 weeks from my engagement I feel empty and not excited at all about my future. It‚Äôs been so bad that I feel like just ending everything so I don‚Äôt hurt anyone (I also have depression and anxiety since I was 16). I don‚Äôt know what to do because it‚Äôs not my cousins fault either she grew up very sheltered and strict and she has just been imagining her life after we get married and is willing to change everything for me. She‚Äôs very sweet when I said no before the engagement everyone went against me but she was a big help and told everyone to let me do what I want. I don‚Äôt know how to say no to her because she‚Äôs literally the sweetest person I‚Äôve met and I love her but it‚Äôs just not that type of love also I‚Äôm rich the reason why I‚Äôm saying that is because the options her family have for her after me are not very stable financially and some of them are a holes. If her life gets ruined because of my no I will hate myself and if I marry her I might wake up one day and hate myself for saying yes.

876,"It‚Äôs weird to even begin to type this out. Everything around me tells me no, and my brain is wired to staying. Some background, I‚Äôm a 17 year old Chinese American born child of three to two immigrant parents. My parents are very loving and caring, but there are two sides to the story. They hold very conservative chinese values such as going to a good college, finding a job that pays above six figures, and marrying ‚Äúthe one‚Äù. I‚Äôve never had deep emotional conversations with them, nor have I told them some of the secrets throughout most of my teenage life. 

I never really connected or shared a bond between my parents other than obeying their orders. I was a gifted student growing up, and was led to believed that I could have anything I wanted in life, so long as I worked for it. I was, and still am, pressured into doing well on my SATs, my AP classes, and being a ‚Äúwell-rounded‚Äù student. Freshman year through present, I have been chasing my vices such as smoking, drinking, gambling, and the occasional dabble of harder drugs. I have never been abused by my parents before, and I love them deep down, but I crave my own independence and identity. 


I have had panging thoughts about getting into my car, and driving a few states over to take a crack at life from my own perspective instead of my parents. I want to pursue success in international business and franchising, but my parents would rather I take the alternative of acadamia, and making roughly 100,000$ a year as a professor. With this new coronavirus quarantine, I have been home for the past few days and have been confined to my room, unable to see my girlfriend (which they have no idea about because they don‚Äôt believe high schoolers can have relationships), or interact socially. 


I had a stressor today when I was told I couldn‚Äôt play games or use my phone because it was a ‚Äúweekday‚Äù and ‚Äúthere is school‚Äù. (Technically online school now because of quarantine, but shouldn‚Äôt I be able to relax in a time of crisis rather than focusing on my studies?) I feel so distant from my parents and the younger side of me feels the need to get away from my parents‚Äô constant micromanagement. 

Hypothetically, I would first withdraw around $2.5k from my bank account and then plan on taking my car in the dead of night a few states over via national highway, and leaving it in a lot. I would be courteous enough to let them know where the car is in case they wan‚Äôt it back. I then plan to ride a greyhound or train to a city that I prefer. Landing there, I would immediately look for a place to stay, with enough to pay a deposit and rent for at least a month. I am willing to work a minimum wage job doing anything to try to sustain myself and hopefully not starve. Is this just the teenage angst talking about wanting to leave, or should I pull the trigger.

882,"Im a nerd, and i make fanfics. Yes I know, not that interesting, or maybe looked down on. But its honestly fun when creating your own story about your favorite movie, game, etc. I don‚Äôt make very weird stuff, and I wont put any of my work, or the site I go to. 

First, I have an amazing online ‚Äúsister‚Äù who we had been close for almost ten years. I think ten.. We started off by making interesting RP‚Äôs. Role play for anyone who don‚Äôt really know. We made a bunch in the past, and both bonded during our story making so she was like a sister to me, online that is. Sometimes, we would just talk and, or share some advice for artwork, or real life stuff. 

Recently, she‚Äôs been going to college and has work on a few days of the week. I‚Äôm okay with it and we try to be online from time to time. We‚Äôre making another fun story together and I‚Äôm pretty upset about it. I‚Äôll explain a little of why I‚Äôm upset not about the story, but with her. 

See, she‚Äôs busy, but she‚Äôll be on on her breaks, or just whenever. We do turns on our RP‚Äôs so when it‚Äôs her turn, she‚Äôs on almost all the time. I‚Äôm okay with it, really I am. Sometimes I don‚Äôt like what she has for her part, but I don‚Äôt say anything cause I don‚Äôt wanna hurt her. Now when my turn comes, she‚Äôs barely on. You‚Äôll probably say ‚Äúshe might be busy. She has homework, or work, maybe she‚Äôs not able to be on right now.‚Äù Listen, she has been online talking with me when it was her turn, no matter what. She‚Äôs at work, she talks to me. She‚Äôs home doing whatever, she talks with me.

My turn, she‚Äôs barely on. I think she‚Äôs literally ignoring me, not wanting to even continue on my side of the story. The way she is treating me is making me very upset about it and I don‚Äôt know how to express my feelings without her getting upset at me. Maybe she is busy, but every time my turn cones up, she replies once, or twice, then stops while she‚Äôs on practically all night if its her turn. Now this might sound childish, maybe immature of me, and I‚Äôll be made fun of for it because people don‚Äôt usually fight over fanfictions.. I‚Äôm just tired of dealing with this. I don‚Äôt wanna lose her friendship over this childish fight I‚Äôm having, and I don‚Äôt wanna stop making our stories together because we both make them fun, but if I‚Äôm willing to be supportive, she needs to as well. Not all the time, but I just want her to stop ignoring me. 

How do I tell her that I‚Äôm feeling very upset about how your treating me while I‚Äôm working with your needs, even if I might not be okay with it at times? I don‚Äôt want to be rude at all, and I‚Äôm afraid that if I ask her, or tell her, she‚Äôll quit being my friend. I have no friends where I live and I have a few other‚Äôs online, she‚Äôs one of them. So how do I express my feelings without causing a fight to happen? 

It‚Äôs okay to be harsh with me cause I am acting like s child with this. Maybe I shouldn‚Äôt ask, but please, how do you express your feelings towards another without making them upset, or make them think your the bad person?",31Mar2020,1
883,"Hey guys so I‚Äôm a first year student at the university of Toronto studying international business and finance. Currently I‚Äôm a campus ambassador for a company and it allows me to get good experience for my resume.

That said since I‚Äôm in a coop program and I‚Äôm scheduled to have my first work term on fall 2020, this means I would need to leave this role. As such, I was wondering should I wait for the winter 2021 session to do my work term instead. 

The reason why I‚Äôm asking is because due to the coronavirus pandemic I feel like the economy is gonna get worse and that it‚Äôs gonna be harder for me to find a good internship. 

As such, I would like to know: Should I delay my work term and keep my campus ambassador position for the fall semester.

884,"Hey, this is my first post ever but I am desperate for some kind of guidance. My best friend of almost 10 years who lives across the country from me is currently going through some kind of mania after accidentally mixing a ton of drugs in their system (2 antidepressants prescribed, vaping and kratom). 

We played games online until 5am together late Friday night and by Saturday afternoon I was being bombarded with strange, unsettling texts and I just knew something wasn‚Äôt right.
I managed to get in contact with the family and my friend was hospitalized but only briefly (blood was taken, pee tests, etc). 

With everything going on with Covid-19, my friend‚Äôs mother claims they are unable to pursue ‚Äúthird party‚Äù services which I assume to mean mental health services right away. They discharged my friend from the hospital to their family home Saturday night.

But my friend‚Äôs condition seems to be getting more and more unstable? We are accustomed to talking daily and obviously I could have a huge role in helping my friend feel safe during this time but it is starting to be incredibly difficult for me to act like everything is okay over the phone.

My friend must get less than 6 hours of sleep a night. All other time is spent leaping around the house, taking 3-4 showers a day, and sending me walls of text full of strange accusations and observations, heavy word repetition and seriously concerning depression all disguised under this super upbeat, joyful tone. 

It has been devastating for me to witness every day and the heavier it gets, the more I struggle to find appropriate words of encouragement. I just don‚Äôt know what to say to help. I am terrified of encouraging the wrong kind of behavior or statement and doing more damage to my friend long term.

Does anyone have any experience with this? How long does this typically last? Is there more I could be doing? Should I risk overstepping to urge the family to do more? Please help. Thank you.",31Mar2020,1

887,"So here is my problem. 20 years ago my sister died. I can't realy go into detail since my posts keep getting deleted if I do.
A few weeks ago, I got a letter from an assassment I had to take earlier this year. There were detailed info about her death from the police report of 20 years ago as well.
Since I read those I can't realy sleep anymore. Whenever I watch a movie something reminds me of what happened and I start to think about it. Ist close to midnight where I live now. I just wanted to watch a fail army video with my gf and go to sleep. And in the video there was a person getting scared in their sleep. Boom thinking again. I have the feeling someone is in the room sometimes. Like shadows moving in my peripheral view. I know there is noone there. I still started locking my door in the night, pulling a beerbox in front so I would notice if someone would open it... 

I do know I should seek professional help. I tried that. I had called around 24 therapists. All couldn't give me an appointment in the next 3 month. And now 2 of those who gave me one for April, called an said they can't take it duo to the worldwide situation right now.

One told me to go to a clinic but I realy can't do that. As everything was OK until a few weeks ago, I never thought it would bother me that much again. So I became a nurse in a psychiatric facility for children.
My coworkers know about my sisters death, but I can't be in a mental hospital and keep working there.

The work doesn't bother me at all, I realy like it a lot and the team there is the best. Realy can't afford losing the job either.

In Germany we have a Hotline to call, but duo to recent events they specialized on somatic problems. The other Hotline for crisis is constantly blocked.

Tried to find other solutions like discord groups. But all of them seem to be abandoned...

892,"My brother is quite possibly insane but I feel like sometimes he knows what he‚Äôs doing! So a bit of backstory; my brother has been on medication for all his life until recently (last summer), it‚Äôs to help with a genetic illness he has. The medication is called folic acid and I‚Äôve read it‚Äôs good for bipolar or schizophrenic(which I suspect is what‚Äôs the cause of my brothers behaviour) like symptoms/behaviour. However last summer he stopped taking his medication and I‚Äôm positive that‚Äôs when things started taking a turn for the worse even tho we didn‚Äôt know it then. He‚Äôs always been a very irritable person but the past 4 months have been dreadful, this guy would get annoyed at any and everything, have a full argument with You but come back later in the day and act like nothing happened??? He‚Äôs a very selfish individual and lacks self awareness which is confusing to me because he seems to have introspection as he seems to always be thinking to the point of overthinking which causes more harm than good. He doesn‚Äôt care how he is perceived as he will wear trashy clothes and go outside for errands with bed hair(this is some of the reasons why I think he has no self awareness) and seems to have an obsession with ‚Äúbeing himself/finding his true self‚Äù. This guy will go on manic rants about how he wants to just find out who he is and these thoughts dominate his mind which makes it harder for him to think about and do other things like school work which affects his grades etc. 

OCD does run in my family from my mom side as I have it as well and I think he might have it as well mixed with bipolar or schizio. I  believe what noticeably highlighted his symptoms was his marijuana usage. When he started smoking daily towards the end of 2019 I started to not recognize him and felt a bit uneasy around him like he wasn‚Äôt all there in the head. I feel like the weed makes him overthink things as well as believe nonsensical shit like he really thought he could talk to snakes after getting high af one day, like legit talk to snakes??? He seems to think it helps him think and that‚Äôs why he won‚Äôt quit. Talking to snakes isn‚Äôt even the worst part, he seems to think people want to come and beat him up and are jealous of him because he‚Äôs going to become famous and I try to tell him, most people don‚Äôt give a fuck about him and are in their own worlds but it seems to lead no where with him. His brain also seems to be more prone to fantasy like thoughts and lacks logic or rationale. 

He is probably the most illogical person I‚Äôve ever met. I know smoking weed occasionally isn‚Äôt bad because I do it and I know it gives me intrusive thoughts that I can push away and just relax but the herb seems to have fucked him beyond repair. He also suffers from severe delusions as he believes he is already famous and he‚Äôs some cool kid that people will look at and want to emulate which is laughable because he looks like he hasn‚Äôt slept in weeks and just unkept and depressed and creepy looking. It‚Äôs a shame because he use to look clean and attractive but this past few months he‚Äôs just deteriorated in every way possible. He also reasons like a child although I believe this is more to do with him being unintelligent(very gullible, can‚Äôt read social situations very well, sub par pattern recognition of anything, and not the best grades through out his schooling). He use to be bullied in highschool which I‚Äôm sure affected him a lot but at the time I never noticed it‚Äôs impact. His lack of rationale/logical thinking, plus his kid like mind could have caused the bullying to do a lot more damage than it should have? I‚Äôm saying this because I‚Äôve been bullied as well in middle school but I kind of just reflected on my actions that made my bullies pick on me (being overly competitive, being nosey af, and just being a pest in general) which led to me stopping some of these things. I also reasoned that I‚Äôm not going to know these kids for the rest of my life so who cares what they say about me, as long as I know myself. I feel like he lacks this common sense/pathology. 

He says he doesn‚Äôt care what others think of him but his whole life currently has been dictated by actions of others towards him. The sheer amount of cognitive dissonance is laughable. The nail in the coffin for all of this is him getting arrested and charged a few weeks back for harassment! He‚Äôs been crushing on this girl for the longest time and she clearly wants nothing to do with him even tho she initially liked him but he probably did some weird ass creepy thing to put her off, but he seems to not know why she doesn‚Äôt like him back(no self awareness -_-). Well after my mom bailed him out he seemed to not be phased by the whole ordeal and actually said to me she wants him to talk to her more because they have a special connection?? I brushed and laughed it off because he couldn‚Äôt be serious right?? Wrong, he went back the following week and tried contacting her and her friends, which got him arrested again. This time the bail was a lot higher and my dad didn‚Äôt want to pay so my mom had to beg one of her friends to help bail him out. Mind you he‚Äôs 20 so he stayed in actual prison over the weekend and after I spoke to him yesterday, he doesn‚Äôt seem to have been phased by it at all, apart from wanting to sue the guards for treating him like shit lol. 

My brother is super manipulative with my mom and dad which is why I suspect this whole thing is an act and he could just be a sociopath or narcissist or something but the following is what really got me thinking he has some form of schizio or multiple personality. I proceeded to call my brother And we got in a heated argument and he started screaming some nonsensical things like ‚ÄúDO YOU KNOW WHAT VENOM IS????‚Äù While hissing like a snake? That‚Äôs when I knew something was off, after screaming that I kind of just hung up and my sister called me asking me what had happened, it seems like I broke my brother mentally because he started saying full blown schizophrenic shit like ‚Äúmedusa is coming‚Äù ‚Äúshhhhh can‚Äôt you hear the snakes‚Äù, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre afraid, you‚Äôre afraid, shhhh, don‚Äôt lie‚Äù Apparently he‚Äôd been pacing in and out of my sisters room saying shit like this, so yea that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at right now, my whole family thinks he needs to go to a psychiatric ward and needs to be put on medication because clearly the guy is not ok. I feel like I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs fully wrong with him, most likely schizophrenic with ocd or multiple personalities or could he just be a sociopath and is just manipulating us because after the whole mental breakdown shit, I called him to apologize and we seemed to be good. He texted later asking for the Netflix password and if I didn‚Äôt give it fast medusa would be coming?? I gave him the password and asked him who is medusa and he said ‚Äúnvm I‚Äôm joking, talk about something else‚Äù So I‚Äôm just confused, any psychologist or people who have dealt with a similar sort of thing explain to me what‚Äôs wrong with this kid? Ive kind of just given up and told my parents my two cents (he needs psychiatric help and medication before he hurts himself or us/others). He‚Äôs unstable and crazy which makes him dangerous imo but I still also feel like he‚Äôs doing some manipulation? He also barely sleeps and walks around a lot talking to himself seemingly arguing in different scene radios with 3-4 different voices and tones lmao. I try to understand but I can‚Äôt. I‚Äôm forgetting a lot of things he does because I‚Äôm writing all this on the spot but feel free to ask more questions and if I need to go into more detail with certain things. I feel like I painted a decent enough picture tho, so wtf is wrong with my bro and is my decision to cut him out of my life and not help a good one?",31Mar2020,0
894,"I ended a relationship in June of last year ([the same relationship from this previous advice post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/aciso0/left_at_home_with_my_girlfriends_unknowing/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)) that I would definitely describe as emotionally abusive. She would call me saying she was holding a knife and would hurt herself if I didn‚Äôt immediately go see her, suggest that if I were to break up with her she‚Äôd hurt herself, say I didn‚Äôt take care about her mental health, etc. I was also having sexual issues brought upon by anxiety which she made me feel terrible about and said it was because I didn‚Äôt find her attractive and that this was me doing something to her.

Anyway, this has left me with some pretty long term damage that I‚Äôm gonna have to explain to any future partner. If I‚Äôm not able to call it abuse I really don‚Äôt know how to describe how I may have issues in future relationships or even friendships. 

I guess I‚Äôm scared of essentially saying she abused me when she was clearly not in a mentally sound place at the time and I‚Äôm scared of it ever reaching back to her. Truly the last thing I want to happen is for there to be any possibility of confrontation or bringing up the past when it isn‚Äôt necessary (talking to a future partner).

899,"I won't go super specific with each event for fear that this post will read like a novel, but I'll give you some of the awful things that have happened to me in my recent past. This is all for context so that you can see where I'm coming from. TW for sensitive topics such as mental illness and harassment by the way.

1. My biological mom commit suicide in my house. I saw her body when it happened.

2. I have severe schizophrenia to the point that I can't trust my own brain anymore. My meds have been ineffective. My dad is also schizophrenic but is still in denial and has convinced himself that he has a special ability to contact the afterlife. 

3. I was sexually harassed by a male coworker who got away with no repercussions even after I went to the higher ups about it.

4. My bio mom's side of the family has stalked us, lied about us, attacked us, and accused us of murder.

5. I've been jumped by some not-so-great people my step-sister is associated with.

6. I've been cheated on three times.

7. I've been abused by two different people physically.

8. I can no longer visit my therapist or my psychologist due to coronavirus shutting everything down. They are not hospital-bound so their work places are closed.

9. One of my step-sisters attacked me physically yesterday out of absolutely nowhere as well as screaming a whole slew of insults. Some homophobic, some racist (she absolutely despises anybody who isn't related to an African American), and some just downright mocking my mental illness like a joke.

10. People have outright shamed me in public for my fashion choices and claimed I was attention-whoring. I only wear band-tees I've bought to remember some of my favourite concerts, and unsurprisingly, the majority of them happen to be mostly greyscale. But people don't like a lack of bright colors and prejudge you on it.

Now that you all have a glimpse into some of the shit I have to put up with in my life, it might be more clear why intrusive thoughts are happening. There's two different kinds that I think- Violence toward myself and violence toward others. It's super stressful but weirdly gives me hope and even a bit of satisfaction. My guess is that the latter is from all of the adrenaline. The stress is the worst part of the thoughts. Like, what if I got caught for murder? Do I really want to spend life in prison? If I hurt myself, will I be babied for the rest of my life? If I killed myself, how much sadness and undeserved hopelessness would I bring to my dad and my brother? I try to let the questions keep me from giving into the thoughts I have but they keep happening anyways. It only gets worse as the time goes on. So, r/Advice, please tell me how to stop thinking these awful things. I don't *want* to do any of it, but when shitty things pop up, the heat of the moment has caused me to come close before. I just want help with this while there's still hope left.",31Mar2020,0

901,"An example is the situation I‚Äôm in right now. So I had 2 friends, A and B, and they lived together at uni last year and moved into a house together for this year. And friend B is very full on and not afraid to say anything and friend A is less so but will still call me out. I didn‚Äôt really spend a lot of time with them so when I did, they would call me out and criticise me for not making plans with them. They would piss me off about other things too like not making an effort to get to know all their friends, when personally if I‚Äôve only met these people once or twice and in a very loaded situation with all of them there, how can I remember their names? I don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs probably not relevant, but they were problematic friends to me and probably never realised. 

So anyway when I first became friends with them I had feelings for friend A and on a drunken night out I told her and told her she should take me out on a date. And then afterwards we just didn‚Äôt acknowledge it and went on as usual. Flash forward to summer, she asked me about it and I was over it but I was drunk and didn‚Äôt remember what I said the next day. So she asked me the next day and I said that I didn‚Äôt remember what I said, but I just wanted to be friends. And she hinted that she liked me. 

I didn‚Äôt see her much at all afterwards but I went to a party of hers where we slept in the same bed and at the time I thought nothing of it. 

Since this time I haven‚Äôt met up with either of the friends and have basically cut them off, and I don‚Äôt want contact. 

But in the last few days I really have been thinking about friend A and what could have happened if we just acted on our feelings and it‚Äôs making me really really confused. I thought I was completely over her but I‚Äôm having curious thoughts now and stalking her online to see what‚Äôs different since I detached myself. And I‚Äôm feeling guilty for leaving without explaining myself whatsoever. I‚Äôm generally feeling sad about the situation and I can‚Äôt understand my feelings. 

I‚Äôm also currently talking to/seeing (well, not seeing. we were dating before corona ruined it all) a guy and I‚Äôm really into him and we click really well. It‚Äôs making me feel guilty about it because I like him so much but I‚Äôm suddenly thinking about friend A?????

I don‚Äôt really know what to do and talking to friend A would make a lot of questions appear that I don‚Äôt know how to answer, or give the false hope that I‚Äôm going to rekindle the friendship or something.

None of this is my business, but there are a few cases where his ‚Äúsituation‚Äù in life becomes an issue.

K says things like:

1. ‚ÄúThe professor makes this class way too easy, maybe I should just teach it next semester‚Äù

2. ‚ÄúI hate living with my dad, he always does x‚Äù

3. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean you haven‚Äôt seen/done x?‚Äù

My past replies have been:

1. I resist the urge to remind him that classes are probably easy for him because he‚Äôs taking 2-3 at a time and has no other responsibilities. 

2. I‚Äôve suggested that he look into a part time job so he can save up to move, to which he exclaims that he couldn‚Äôt possibly do so without seeing his grades slip. He‚Äôs too busy going to school to fit a job in his ‚Äúpacked schedule‚Äù.

3. Once I responded ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt done/seen that because I don‚Äôt have as much free time as you‚Äù, to which he responded ‚ÄúOh no silly! We have the same amount of free time!‚Äù

Usually when he brings up his or my lifestyle I let it go, but I just got hired in our field at a big company. Since then some of his comments have gotten directed at me.

We were talking about my new job, and I asked if he‚Äôd considered internships. He said ‚ÄúI have to focus on my grades.

I pointed out I was a working student who didn‚Äôt lie to get a job, and that lots of students do internships in school. He ignored me for a day, then sent me a 3-page letter about how he‚Äôs sorry he can‚Äôt live up to my standards, he‚Äôs already spread too thin and trying his best.

Yesterday we were talking about baking together, and he said he ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt a fan‚Äù of mixed kitchens. When you live with roommates everyone brings their own stuff to the kitchen. I thought it was weird for him to comment about my kitchen and roommates when he still lives at home. I told him ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how to respond to that‚Äù and changed the subject, but he changed it back and said stuff like ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt live like that‚Äù, ‚Äúit‚Äôs ridiculous when you open a drawer and have 3 sets of x‚Äù. He went on to talk about how he‚Äôd avoid having roommates at all costs.

I finally told him ‚Äúhow can you talk to me about having roommates and clutter in my kitchen? You‚Äôre over 30 and you live with your mom. You‚Äôve never had to pay a bill.‚Äù I told him I didn‚Äôt want to be friends if he was going to act this way, and he sulked and said he needed space before proceeding to ignore me.

So here‚Äôs the scoop, my friend, who we‚Äôll call Jim, is dating a girl named Lily.  Jim has been my friend for around 10 years, and my best friend for over 5.   He is an awesome bloke, and our group loves him for who he is.  He‚Äôs confident, smart, good looking, and sometimes, just sometimes, even funny ! All jokes aside, he‚Äôs really great guy.  

He gives wonderful advice, and because of that, and his eagerness to help others, he‚Äôs had a very positive impact on me, and many others.  However, I noticed in HS 3 yearsish or so, that despite being a high quality guy, he would go for...not the best in gals.  He seemed to have an affinity for helping ‚Äúfix‚Äù people.

Now at the age of 20,  he‚Äôs well over a year deep into a relationship with a girl who‚Äôs just holding him back.

She‚Äôs hardly able to hold a job.  
She‚Äôs rude, cold, and overly dramatic. 
She‚Äôs from a wealthy suburb, a silver spoon girl, who talks and acts like she‚Äôs auditioning to take eazy-e‚Äôs spot in NWA.  
She has a young daughter who‚Äôs father is someone named ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs complicated‚Äù, of whom she doesn‚Äôt have custody of, but lives with, and yet still hardly sees sober.  
Speaking of sober, if she‚Äôs not on lots of Xanax, Adderall, or whatever other pills she‚Äôs into, she‚Äôs probably having another round of ‚Äúrelapse and cheat on Jim with my heroine dealer‚Äù.
The first time she did that, she blamed Jim for not giving her enough fucking attention, yet still denies ever cheating.   She fucking kissed the dude at the door when Jim came to pick her up.  


I‚Äôve only met her around 5 times, because she has Jim on a leash.   He literally can‚Äôt go out without her permission.  If he can go out, he acts worried, and is glued to his phone the whole time.   I have no clue what that‚Äôs ever about, he never lets us in.  Rather quickly, He just says he‚Äôs got to go ‚Äúwork through some stuff with Lily‚Äù and leaves.   We hardly see him anymore, because there‚Äôs always something to ‚Äúwork through‚Äù.   
She even once called me, freaking out, that he beat her.   I asked her to slow down and just tell me what happened.   Her story jumped from setting to setting, plot change after plot change, until finally she just said it was too much, and I just need to talk to him.    So I caught him as he was leaving work.  We sat down and talked about this, and he says it never happened.   I believe him.  Not a bit of what she was saying made a lick of sense.  


Anyways, I‚Äôm no psychologist, but I‚Äôm mildly sure this girl is a psychopath or something.  Maybe just a narcissistic junkie ? I don‚Äôt know, but I do know, shes bad news.   He sees such a bright future of marriage and children with this girl, and it‚Äôs just crazy.   He‚Äôs clearly falling apart, clinging to this abusive rodeo of a relationship.   What can I do to help him ? I‚Äôve tried talking to him about this many times.  My whole group has, and it never gets anywhere.  He just gets defensive of her, and shuts us down.  I think it might play a role in why we never see him.   She sees that her control over him is at risk because of my friend group and I, so she isolates him.   Whats your best advice ? How do I get through to him, or better yet, help him see for himself ?",31Mar2020,1
908,"Hey all, I'm starting to think I have a balance issue or something. I'll be sitting at my desk and suddenly I'd feel as if I'm leaning over or backwards, about to fall. My chair has to have armrests in order for me to feel comfortable. If it doesn't, I'm gripping the table. I think it could be because I'm extremely afraid of heights but I'm not sure. Another instance was when I was getting my birth control implant inserted and I was laying one those long padded chairs. No armrests and I was probably some inches high. I was afraid to touch my arm if it meant I had to let go of the chair because to me it felt as if the chair was too narrow. I can't go down stairs without having a rail to hold on to. And sometimes when I'm standing, I feel the floor drop like two inches, like I just got down riding an elevator when it stops. It's so weird. And it's happening more than usual.

911,"Because of this whole fucking COVID thing, my sister (F,11) and I (M,15) have been home for 3 weeks. I just normally stay in my room and play Minecraft with my friends. And now, it feels like I have to isolate myself to make sure shit doesn't go down.

As the title says, my sister is the main reason why I try to isolate myself from everyone. She is the biggest piece of shit I know. She watches her YT videos on a loud volume, she almost always gets what she wants, physically abuses me and ruins my friendships and my social life. Whenever I like a girl, my whole damn family seems to be up in my business, making jokes at my expense. My sister especially. (Keep in mind that she is younger than me, but is treated like a princess). She constantly mocks me because I like a girl, and no matter how many times I tell her to stop, she won't. When we get into fights, she always throws the first punch, and no matter what I do, she always manages to give me some sorta scar. She takes a HUGE advantage over the ""BoYs CaNt HiT gIrLs"" shit. She always gets offended over the littlest of things. She can't handle a joke, and she can do stuff that I get in trouble for. Case and point, YouTube. I watch my videos at a low volume, because mainly I don't want others to see what I watch, or hear. But then my sister walks into the room, and I can no longer hear my video, just an overlay of her video. And anytime I am on a call with a friend, she demands that she be in the call and talk shit about me. She gets so fucking annoying to the point where if she picks a fist fight with me, I'm piledriving my fist into her skull.

914,"TRIGGER WARNING: Sexual Assault 

So I‚Äôm aware that maybe this story probably isn‚Äôt meant for Reddit, but I don‚Äôt have many people that I can talk to about this. It‚Äôs not my story to tell, and it‚Äôs not something I enjoy talking about, so just bear with me please. My girlfriend and I have been together for 2 years now, an incredible 2 years with the love of my life. She moved in with me when she turned 18 and all was well. Just some context into my ‚Äúbest friend‚Äù even though I don‚Äôt really wanna make this about him, I‚Äôve known this guy practically all of my life. Him and I grew up together and we were really close. He was over all the time playing the Switch and Xbox and shit with me. She didn‚Äôt mind, she enjoyed when he was over too. Like we were all pretty close, and he never made any advances on her or anything so I never thought I had to worry. But one night we were just chilling playing games and having a few beers and I knocked out on the couch. She was in our bed sleeping because she had work in the morning and I figured he‚Äôd just let himself out as he‚Äôs done before. 

But in the middle of the night I woke up to piss and she was just sitting on the bathroom floor, crying. I didn‚Äôt really know what was wrong, just figured she was sick or something but then she told me that he ‚Äúhurt‚Äù her. I didn‚Äôt really ask any questions because I just knew, just went and woke him up asking him what he did. He got like super defensive and I was an idiot and didn‚Äôt think and made him leave because if I didn‚Äôt I probably would‚Äôve killed him. First thing we did was go to the hospital, but since she took a shower because she told me she felt dirty and gross, they didn‚Äôt find any of his DNA on her. And when the cops did finally go get him and talk to him, he failed a lie detector test which wasn‚Äôt enough evidence for anything. And they found ‚Äúforeign DNA‚Äù under his fingernails but that‚Äôs all they could find and it couldn‚Äôt be matched. There was signs that show she was brutally penetrated vaginally and anally, but no DNA. So there wasn‚Äôt enough evidence for any justice, so it was just kind of dropped. 

She didn‚Äôt wanna talk about what happened in front of me, and I can‚Äôt blame her. I think for awhile at first she kind of blamed me. Hell, I blamed me. I was drunk and I should‚Äôve been protecting her. I still do blame myself to this day. We haven‚Äôt really told anyone what happened. Her parents know, my parents know, and a few of our friends, but she was embarrassed for the longest of time. For the first 2 months after it happened she wouldn‚Äôt even sleep in our bedroom, we both slept on an air mattress in the living room. When she needed something out of the bedroom I‚Äôd get it for her. But then she decided she‚Äôd try and sleep in there, so I changed the sheets and bought new pillows and just tried to change it up a bit so it wouldn‚Äôt remind her of what happened. She didn‚Äôt do so well that night, so it was back to sleeping in the living room. I didn‚Äôt mind, she‚Äôs healing and will be healing for a long time. We both will. But I went to her parents about it and they suggested selling the old furniture and they‚Äôd help buy new. So that‚Äôs what we did, we bought a new mattress, a new bed frame, new dressers. I even painted the walls a new color and completely rearranged our bedroom. That helped a ton, she was finally able to sleep in there without having a set back. Which was a major milestone. I even convinced her to see a therapist. It was hard, for her especially, but also for me a bit. I beat myself up for the longest time, and I can‚Äôt talk to many people and tell them what he did. It‚Äôs not my story to tell for starters, but I was warned that since the case was dropped, I could get in legal trouble if I told people about him. I‚Äôd love to beat his ass but I won‚Äôt, because that‚Äôs not what she wants. 

So we don‚Äôt really talk about it. She was doing amazing for awhile there, but with it being about that time of year that it happened, she‚Äôs been having a set back. And being cooped up in the house, not being able to go to therapy, doesn‚Äôt help. She‚Äôs back to sleeping on the couch, she tries to play it off that she‚Äôs just ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù falling asleep out there. I know that‚Äôs not the case, but it‚Äôs like she just doesn‚Äôt wanna talk about it. It almost seems like she‚Äôs blaming me in her head again. And I don‚Äôt know how to help her. I gave up drinking, I changed practically the entire apartment, I try to be there, I haven‚Äôt had any friends over since it happened. But it seems like nothing I do helps. I don‚Äôt know how to help, and it‚Äôs killing me. How can I help her? I‚Äôm not sure how long it‚Äôll be before she can see her therapist again (The last 3 sessions have been cancelled because of COVID-19), and I don‚Äôt want her to suffer in silence until then. If there is any way you guys could recommend me helping her please let me know. I don‚Äôt wanna push too hard, but I don‚Äôt wanna not do anything at all. She‚Äôs been sleeping a lot. Last night she slept from 9pm-3am. Then she woke up and was just watching some show till 7 am. And she fell back asleep and is still sleeping now. Even when she‚Äôs awake she doesn‚Äôt seem there. It‚Äôs bad again. It seems like she‚Äôs eating a lot more than usual, she showers like once or twice a week, but she hates it. I‚Äôm concerned about her. Please if anyone knows how I can help, let me know.

TLDR; My girlfriend was sexually assaulted by a friend of ours a year ago. She hasn‚Äôt been able to go to therapy due to COVID-19 and has been falling back into a bad place. How can I help her through this while we self isolate?",31Mar2020,1
915,"My ex and I broke up seven months ago and it was completely out of the blue. I've been trying to understand why ever since, because we'd been together for three years and everything seemed perfect. All I could really get from her was that ""A friend told her to"". Every few months she pops back up again and messages me telling me what she's been up to. Cool, whatever, I like to hear that she's doing okay. *However* in January she informed me that a guy she met on a dating app sexually assaulted her. This one hit **deep** because she had been assaulted in the past and it really messed her up. She's been working hard to get through the trauma, then it happened again because (in my head at least) I wasn't there to protect her like I had been.

This took some time for me to work through my feelings on, and I finally was able to rationalize that it wasn't my fault, and that there were many, many other things that could have been done to stop that from happening. Now today, she messages me again and tells me that she was raped by another guy a short time ago. She wasn't sober at the time and the guy had made his intentions clear beforehand. I've helped her as much as I can through this. Given advice where wanted and just been a listening ear and a shoulder to lean on, otherwise. 

Now I'm right back to blaming myself again, but even worse. I feel like if I had just been better or if I had done something different, none of this would have happened. She wouldn't have taken her (as admitted from her own mouth) toxic friend's advice, which means we would still be together and she wouldn't have been raped.

I know this sounds like a ""She left me and I want her back"" post, but I understand I'll never get her back, and though I can't love her romantically anymore, I still love her as a person and want the absolute best for her. Plus, I'm in a committed and loving relationship with an amazing person. How can I quit blaming myself for things happening in her life?

Sorry for the long text, but i need advice since i tend to overthink everything and get lost and in the end do nothing and be unhappy. 

First I'm not that confident with the Nintendo Switch Lite since i can not play it in docked mode and would not be able to play games in local multiplayer with some friends after the quarantine. But i also love playing in handheld since i owned a DS and play some casual games on my phone. 
The problem here is that all Nintendo Switches are sold out, and i would like to buy a new one for the normal price. In my country they will be back in stock in 2-3 months from now. 

Additionally i have nothing to do right now and i suppose the quarantine will last longer than the government agreed on for now. Currently i have no working gaming device since my desktop PC just broke and i dont want to spend any more money on it since i own a laptop for work (but that one isnt suitable for gaming)

And there is one more thing, I wanted to buy a new Xbox Series X at the end of the year, but i guess buying 2 consoles is dumb and a waste of money?

I would love to finally play Forza Horizon 3 or 4 and the upcoming cyberpunk since my shitty PC couldnt handle it but also would like to play games like the new animal crossing or mario Kart 8.
Additionally i would want to play skyrim, rocket league, minecraft, bioshock &amp; the witcher 3 which can be played on all consoles.

So the question is should i wait those months for the regular switch or even more months for the Xbox series X or buy a switch Lite now? Or buy a switch (Lite) and a xbox?

931,"Hello everyone,

To inform you all of what my ordeal is, my biological father who had my older sister and I with my mom divorced her when I was an infant after he cheated on her several times and wanted to go off and live his wicked life. He left her with my sister and I when we were young and he shortly remarried after he divorced my mom to start another family and ended up screwing them over too! His whole life he was getting in trouble for dumb stuff like spending my mom's money when they had a shared account on drugs and partying while my mom was taking care of my sister and I and then years later became heavily involved in Christianity and then tried to paint himself as a good guy after he did.

Pretty much, he and I came into contact with each other about 4 years ago after I graduated from High School and went on to accomplish my dreams. My mom remarried a successful businessman and he was there for my sister and I in immeasurable ways than my biological father was and I consider him as my dad. (Dad = Someone who loves you and supports you) My grandpa, who is my biological father's dad, was another father figure and better one than my biolgical father was to a large degree too. (Father = Person who created you) Everyday from 2018 to 2019, he wanted to talk on the phone to make up for my lifetime of being absent and a fool. You can't make up the time lost over phone calls and think everything is going to be peaches and gravy. As I progressed more and more in life, he tried to get me to convert to Christianity and made me feel convicted for not believing in god.
After every conversation ended with him trying to make me convert to Christianity and my beliefs went against his, I decided I would call it quits because I wasn't going to just sink in my down time every day with this guy just so he can spend HOURS at a time trying to make up for the time he never spent with my family. 

He understood my perspective of not wanting to speak to him anyway and he gave me the good to go and move on with my life. It's been more than a year since I cut him out of my life and his family who is my extended family are all believing that I messed up for disconnecting him since they all still speak to him even though he ran away across the country from everyone and now it seems like they're perceiving me to be wrong. I can't have a normal conversation with them anymore without them either bringing him up and trying to shove him back into my life or they talk differently to me than they did before. Thoughts? Do you believe he is the good guy and I messed up or do you believe he's conspiring against me and painting me as the one who messed up?",31Mar2020,0

My brother is already in an engineering program at another university and my dad's an engineer as well so I just said why not. I hoped that maybe with a general first year I'd be able to find something I like since engineering is a very broad program but I have yet to find something that I really like. I even tried joining some engineering clubs at my university in hopes of finding something but nothing has really stuck with me so far. But at the same time I don't know anything else I would want to do. Nothing else really interests me to the point where I'd want to considering switching programs and I don't have any passions that would realistically lead me to a career.

I do think I am a coward for not asking her out. I'm not a person that shows feeling easily, I keep them inside and that might have made that she has began to think that I don't like her. I do whatever I can to not show my feelings for her for some reason.

949,"This is a long post but I‚Äôll put a TL;DR at the bottom.

Okay, so a couple months ago my girlfriend told me that she wasn‚Äôt happy in the relationship and that I needed to put more effort in and open up to her more as I have been struggling with depression recently and tend to shit down sometimes. I accepted that I hadn‚Äôt been putting enough effort in and I began to do better. Part of that was opening up to her about what happened to me when I was a kid. 

I have never told anyone other than her about it but when I was a kid I was sexually abused by my neighbour. I told her about it and she didn‚Äôt say much, just gave me a hug and we didn‚Äôt talk about it anymore. After I left her house she started being really dry in texts, cancelling our plans and making up excuses to not see me. When I confronted her about it she said she ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt have any more to give‚Äù to our relationship and that she wanted a break to figure it out. I said I was willing to do anything it took to make our relationship work and that if she needed some time that was fine by me.

The more I thought about it, the angrier I got. I had been there for her when her parents split up, and she repays me by avoiding me after I tell her I was molested? When her parents split I was in a really bad place and all I thought about was killing myself but I put that to the side for the moment because she needed me but she couldn‚Äôt even speak to me never mind support me when I needed it?

After 2 days on a break I met with her and told her I didn‚Äôt want a break, I wanted to break up because I can‚Äôt forgive her for hurting me like that. She used to be such a kind person but I just don‚Äôt see her as that anymore. To be fair to her, I don‚Äôt think it was because of what I told her that she was avoiding me. I think she wanted to break up but didn‚Äôt have the balls to do it. I‚Äôm just so angry and hurt that the person I trusted most in the world didn‚Äôt spare a single thought for my feelings when I told her about something as serious as that.

It‚Äôs been a month since we split up and I am still so angry. Im normally really laid back and don‚Äôt get angry but I‚Äôm turning into an angry, jaded person and I don‚Äôt know how to stop. So how do I forgive her and move on? How do I stop being so angry all the time?

953,"Tried to post to r/amitheasshole but can't because of the coronavirus talk ban. 

I've been friends with this girl since I was in the 5th grade. She was the maid of honor in my wedding (which was just a couple months ago btw), was set to be the godmother in name only to the son I'm having in August, and one of the only people that stayed by my side throughout some very tumultuous situations I was in. 

The main turning point in our friendship seemed to be when she started dating this guy I don't particularly get along with. They've been together two years and this was both of their first relationships, he's 24 and she's 23. I didn't have a problem with him at first, but he's proven to be excessively dumb, he treats her like crap, and she was always saying how she was embarrassed by him and didn't want him around her friends, she even was gonna break up with him back in October but has given him a ton of chances since then. They fought a lot because he wanted to get married and she didn't, he was basically trying to bully her and guilt her into saying yes. He tried to pull some shit at my wedding that pissed me off too, basically getting mad at my friend because she wanted to dance and have fun, but he was ""tired"" and wanted to sit at the table all night and got all moody when she didn't. I tried to stay out of it the best I could, but she always came to me for advice and to vent about it. It really made me dislike him, and most of her other friends felt the same way.

Right before quarantine started, they had a huge blow up and went on a break. She was asking me for advice on how to deal with him and cut things off, and I gave it to her honestly without sugarcoating things. When we had to start self isolating, she got lonely and kept putting it off. He kept treating her like crap; threatening to hurt himself if they broke up, calling her constantly even though she said she needed a break, crying all the time to the point where his mom got involved and tried to tell her off (mind you, this is a grown 24 year old man.) She just kept coming to me for advice, and I didn't pull any punches and told her to cut it off cause he was being manipulative. I was sincerely worried he'd do something to her.

One day, she just snapped with me. Said I was always negative and never supported her, and that I needed to stop giving her advice even though she asked for it. I figured she just didn't like when people told her things she didn't want to hear, which I should have known since she's been like that since I met her. I backed off and tried not to overstep anymore. Then, she started becoming self destructive and going out of her way to flirt with other guys, trying to get with them, even trying to manipulate her current boyfriend into breaking up with her by telling him he can't talk to his friends anymore (and admitted it to me flat out) purely because she's bored. 

It made me really uncomfortable, so I told her I was upset with the way she was acting towards me and everyone else in her life and that I wanted to still be friends with her, but at this point in my life (5 months pregnant and dealing with a lot of adult stuff), I couldn't deal with the high school drama she was pulling. I told her not to ask me for advice if she didn't like what I said, and that I wanted her in my life but the way she was treating everyone made it hard. We've had stuff like this happen in the past and always talked our way through it, but not this time. She ignored me and blocked me on everything and I haven't talked to her since, despite trying my hardest to be as kind and reasonable as I could while still standing up for myself. She recently unblocked me, but still hasn't talked to me and keeps posting stuff about ""betrayal"" and basically saying other people's feelings arent as important as hers. Total high school shit, but it still hurts since we were friends for so long and I really want to make amends. 

TLDR: Best friend is acting like a child and being an ass to everyone around her, got mad at me because I didn't just let her treat me like that.

964,"Okay, I've never used reddit before but I've heard it's a great place to get help and/or advice. Not sure if I've even picked the right subreddit to post in, but I have an oddly specific problem that I don't think there would be a group for. 

A few years ago my dad told me that we have a sort of family mystery. My great-great-grandmother spent some amount of time in a mental hospital, and she may or may not have died there. Only my great-grandmother knew anything about it, but she died without ever telling anyone any details. I don't know when she was admitted there, I don't know how long for, and I definitely don't know why. I've managed to find which hospital I think she was in, but I'm having trouble finding out how I can access any records from it. I've thought about ordering her death certificate, but obviously there's a chance that whatever she died from had nothing to do with the reason she was in the hospital in the first place. 

I've done a little research on the hospital, as it's no longer around, but there seem to be varying reports on what kind of cases they took in, and I can't find anything online that points me in the direction of accessing the hospital's records. From what I know so far, the 1939 UK Census records say that she was living in Tooting Bec Hospital in Wandsworth, London; another record tells me that she died aged 62 in 1945, in Wandsworth London. It doesn't get any more specific with the death record, but I would assume that maybe she died in the hospital? One website tells me that at one point in time the hospital was used exclusively for senile dementia cases, but, unless she had early onset, the fact that she died at 62 would tell me maybe she didn't have dementia? 

Is this a hopeless case? I know that it seems as though my life could go on unchanged if I never found any answers, and I'm sure that's true, but I can't let go of it and I'm desperate to know what happened to her. I've had my own mental health issues, and so have many others in my family, so I feel a very strong connection and I want to explore it more.

My mom, the one staying here and who I'm living with as my dorm shutdown,  is the most extroverted person I've met in my entire life. She has over 10,000 contacts on her phone and a large part of her job is networking.  She's the type of lady who makes friends on airplanes and with the other people standing in the checkout line. I love her, and she's super cool. 

She started quarantine way before most people all the way back at the end of February.  And it's breaking her. My mom has seen some shit in her life dealing with other people, but she's made of iron while she may get frustrated, I've never seen something break her as quarantine has. She's beyond lonely and I frankly don't know what to do.

I spend a little bit of time with her each day, but I was raised under the ""we're not your friends, we're your parents"" idea, and I'm the exact opposite of her. People make me severely uncomfortable and I really struggle to be around anyone, especially my parents who still don't let me fully express myself. Even when I spend time with her though, she's still super lonely. She needs other interactions than just her awkward son. 

My other parent, due to the nature of their job, is an essential worker and refuses to come home or let us come see them as there's a good chance they've been exposed to Covid-19 at some point. I'm sure the stress of knowing that isn't helping my mom either.

977,"Here‚Äôs my problem:  when I [17F] was growing up I was always slightly chubby, but it was literally just baby fat. One side of my family would constantly make backhanded remarks about my weight, even though I was a perfectly normal size.  

I joined track bc I wanted to lose weight, and the weird thing is, once I started doing track, I really stopped feeling bad about my body even though I didn‚Äôt physically change. Two years ago I started cross country, as well as continuing track &amp; field (which I‚Äôve done for 4 years).  I also started intuitive eating. I feel like these sports saved me from a lifetime of dieting and bad body image, because my teammates are so loving and supportive.  They are literally my best friends, and they are all super body positive.  Our coaches are also super amazing, and they encourage us to eat well. They‚Äôre really aware that many girls and guys in cross country can develop EDs to get faster, and as a result they encourage us to have a healthy relationship with food. A lot of the time, we‚Äôll have team dinners after our races, too.  I never really noticed, but I did get a little skinnier just because of how much running I do. It wasn‚Äôt intentional, and I eat three times as much as I did in middle school, so it‚Äôs definitely not that I‚Äôm not eating enough. 

Last summer, the remarks about me weight went from ‚Äútoo fat‚Äù to ‚Äútoo skinny‚Äù.  A lot of these comments are from cousins that are girls my age. Some of them have started to put themselves down about their weight, and it kills me to see my gorgeous cousins crash dieting to be my size.  One of them called me anorexic because I didn‚Äôt eat any dessert one day (if they had asked, they would‚Äôve known it‚Äôs because I can‚Äôt eat gluten without getting weeklong nausea, cramps, and migraines. No cupcake is worth that much to me).  Another said something along the lines of ‚Äúguys like girls that have a little meat on their bones‚Äù. 

Every time I asked them to stop commenting on my weight, they just brushed it off and said i was being sensitive. I don‚Äôt know if they think it‚Äôs not actually insulting, but it really hurts.  What is a good way to tell them that they are being hurtful with their comments about my weight without making them think I‚Äôm just being sensitive/a bitch?

978,I‚Äôm taking some time off school and since now I have so much free time it‚Äôs just got me upset with myself and where I‚Äôm at. I refuse to just accept that I‚Äôm going to live a normal life working hard just to pay bills and afford life. Although that‚Äôs probably going to be what happens. I always thought I would have a purpose something that would help me get up in the morning or be happy with who I am and what I‚Äôm doing but recently I feel there‚Äôs no point to anything. I‚Äôm working hard to make money to spend it just to work hard to earn it again.,31Mar2020,2
979,"I found out today that my friend‚Äôs dad will be passing away in a few months. I‚Äôve been thinking about it and also the other people I‚Äôve lost in my life or my friends have and how that felt. 

I have a few friends but nobody really close or what people call best friends. I am not an outgoing person by nature. I have my husband as my friend and that‚Äôs all. I do not make an active effort to make friends because I feel like nobody will ever be best friends.

Ever since I heard about my friend‚Äôs dad, I‚Äôve been thinking about whether I‚Äôll be able to cope or carry on if my husband passes away. I feel like I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll do. I‚Äôve been thinking about buying some poisonous substance so I can eat them if he suddenly dies. I know I‚Äôm panicking and I should calm down. But really, how can anybody live with no one in their life?",31Mar2020,1
980,"I'm a programmer and stuck to my desk all day due to work. What I did prior to the shut down was go for a run outside or go to the gym after work which really helped refresh myself. I've been working out at home but it just doesn't cut it since I live in a studio. I've slowly gained weight and am really struggling to stay motivated in doing work or even running and working out.

Does anyone know what I can do? It's really getting to me.",31Mar2020,1

982,"Hey all, 

The title pretty much explains itself and what I need advice on. I tend to overthink every single thing that happens in a day and I don't know how to stop. 

Examples; 

If my boyfriend isn't home around the time he usually is, I'm always paranoid he's talking to girls or he is avoiding coming home because I'm here. 

Sometimes he sits in his car in the garage on his phone when he gets home and I'm nervous it's to avoid me? 

Sometimes all he wants to do is play video games with all the girls he has on his friends list and I'm afraid he is bored of me and only wants to spend time with me at his own convenience and doesn't want to be around me a lot. 

I know when he has breaks at work, or around the time he usually does, and when I don't hear from him I'm afraid he's talking to someone he'd rather talk to more. 

I trust him that he won't cheat, that he loves me, and so on.. 

But I get so much anxiety and my brain puts situations in my head that makes me feel really upset and brings my mood down constantly throughout the day. I know they aren't true, but I can't help thinking about it and I just want to know what I can do to make these thoughts less prominent and slowly to the point where I don't have them anymore. 

Any help is greatly appreciated.",31Mar2020,1
983,"So over the past 5 years, my brothers wife has been making up stories about me and my girlfriend. She has been spreading these stories around and especially making a point of telling my family them. 
She has made accusations that I have tried to sleep with her, accused my girlfriend of cheating on me and has said that I am harassing her at work (just to name a few things). All of these accusations are unfounded and have no evidence for them. 
I am looking for advice on how to deal with her, she has been confronted before and has continued with this. 
So if anyone can help me with a way to deal with her please feel free to tell me.
I am 29 from the UK, my girlfriend is 30. My brothers wife is of some age ( I don't know as I already don't talk to her or my brother)",31Mar2020,1
